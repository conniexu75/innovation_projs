https://openalex.org/W1893528652,"A glyceryl ether containing phosphoglyceride, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine (Ac-GEPC), has been shown to have a biological activity indistinguishable from that of naturally generated (rabbit) platelet activating factor (PAF). Its biochemical and biological properties so closely parallel those of naturally occurring PAF that we propose they are one and the same compound. Both PAF and AcGEPC could be converted to an inactive form through base-catalyzed methanolysis and restored to 100% functional activity by reaction with acetic anhydride. The synthetic lipid, AcGEPC, elicited 50% secretion of serotonin from rabbit platelets at a level of 10(-10) M (based on phosphorus). A propionyl derivative had somewhat comparable activity towards platelets, whereas the butyryl homologue was some 7-fold less active and the stearoyl derivative was inactive. These short chain acylglyceryl ether phosphoglycerides represent an entirely new, potent and unique class of lipid chemical mediators. 1-Acyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine (AcLL) also exhibited activity towards platelets but was some 200-fold less active than AcGepc. the propionyl lysolecithin behaved quite similarly to AcLL, but butyryl and stearoyl lysolecithins showed no activity."
https://openalex.org/W1987975025,"Abstract The studies described here demonstrate that the expression of many early adenovirus mRNAs is dependent upon the activity of a pre-early viral product. This viral gene product is defective in adenovirus 5 host range (Ad hr) group I mutants. Adenovirus 5 host range mutants were previously isolated by their ability to replicate in the adenovirus 5-transformed human embryonic cell line 293 and by their inability to replicate efficiently in HeLa cells (Harrison, Graham and Williams, 1977). The group I complementation class of host range mutants has been mapped by marker rescue between 0 and 4.4 units (Frost and Williams, 1978). We have used the S1 nuclease gel technique to examine the expression of early mRNA after infection of HeLa cells with Ad5 hr group I and II mutants. The Ad5 hr group II mutants stimulate the synthesis of a wild-type pattern of early mRNAs. In contrast, infection of HeLa cells with Ad5 hr group I mutants gives rise to only two early mRNAs. These mRNAs map from 1.5–4.4 units, or in the same region as the Ad5 hr group I mutations. Since infection of HeLa cells with Ad5 hr group I mutants was defective for synthesis of cytoplasmic mRNAs complementary to three early regions in the right half of the genome and to the early region 4.5–11.0 units, we also analyzed nuclear RNA from these cells by the S1 nuclease gel technique for the presence of precursor RNA chains. Nuclear precursors were not detected in Ad5 hr group I-infected HeLa cells, suggesting that the gene product defective in these mutants is required for synthesis of stable nuclear RNA from the three early regions in the right half of the genome and from the early region 4.5–11.0 units."
https://openalex.org/W1999861460,"Abstract Electron micrographs of thin sections of metaphase chromosomes isolated from HeLa cells provide new insight into the higher-order arrangement of the nucleoprotein fiber. Micrographs obtained from chromosomes swollen by chelation of the divalent cation are particularly revealing. Under these conditions, chromosomes swell in width by a factor of about 4 and the basic, thick nucleoprotein fiber (200–300 A) relaxes to the thin fiber (100 A), which is probably a linear array of nucleosomes. Cross sections show a central area from which the fibers emerge in a radial fashion, often forming loops which are 3–4 μm long. Chromosomes fixed in the presence of 1 mM MgCl 2 are more compact, having an average chromatid diameter of about 1 μm, and consist of the thick (200–300 A) fiber. Radial loops of about 0.6 μm can be observed frequently in these chromosomes, although the loops are more difficult to visualize due to the compactness of the structure and the material contaminating the periphery. Chromosomes isolated with the help of hexylene glycol are extremely compact (diameter about 0.6 μm) but quite free of cytoplasmic material. They consist of a 500 A fiber that forms rather regular projections at the periphery. These projections appear to be loops of the thick fiber (200–300 A), possibly shortened by twisting into a short supercoil. The chromatin loops observed in the intact chromosomes are thought to be structurally related to the DNA loops observed previously in the histone-depleted chromosomes (Paulson and Laemmli, 1977). In this paper, we discuss a model in which the nucleoprotein fiber is folded into loops which are arranged in the chromatid in radial fashion, in such a way that their bases become the central axis of the chromatid."

https://openalex.org/W1994429247,The responses of dopamine cells in the substantia nigra to iontophoretically administered dopamine and intravenous apomorphine were compared to the responses of spontaneously active neurons in the caudate nucleus. Dopaminergic cells were six to ten times more sensitive to dopamine and intravenous apomorphine than 86 percent of the caudate cells tested. This differential sensitivity of dopamine auto- and postsynaptic receptors may explain the apparently paradoxical behavioral effects induced by small compared to large doses of some dopamine agonists and may provide a means of developing new types of drugs to antagonize dopaminergic influence in the central nervous system.
https://openalex.org/W2036917468,"The mechanism by which prolactin, a peptide hormone, regulates casein gene expression has been studied in mammary gland organ culture. After prolactin addition, a 2-4 fold increase in the rate of casein mRNA transcription was observed within 1 hr and maintained for at least 24 hr. This increased rate of transcription is not sufficient to account for the mass accumulation of casein mRNA. The half-life of casein mRNA is also increased 17-25 fold in the presence of prolactin. This change in casein mRNA half-life, coupled with a 2-4 fold increase in the rate of transcription, can account for the normal accumulation of casein mRNA observed after prolactin addition. This hormone-induced change in casein mRNA half-life appeared to be selective, since prolactin was found to exert only a slight effect (1-4 fold) on the half-life of poly(A) RNA determined under identical pulse-chase conditions. The hormonal regulation of casein gene expression thus does not app-ar to be an ""all or none"" process occurring only at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, but rather may involve a coordinated response at several levels to permit the efficient expression of specialized differentiated functions."

https://openalex.org/W1990597263,"In echolocating bats, the primary cue for determining distance to a target is the interval between an emitted orientation sound and its echo. Whereas frequency is represented by place in the bat cochlea, no anatomical location represents of primary range. Target range is coded by the time interval between grouped discharges of primary auditory neurons in response to both the emitted sound and its echo. In the frequency-modulated-signal processing area of the auditory cortex of the mustache bat (Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus), neurons respond poorly or not at all to synthesized orientation sounds or echoes alone but respond vigorously to echoes following the emitted sound with a specific delay from targets at a specific range. These range-tuned neurons are systemically arranged along the rostrocaudal axis of the frequency-modulated-signal processing area according to the delays to which they best respond, and thus represent target range in terms of cortical organization. The frequency-modulated-signal processing area therefore shows odotopic representation."
https://openalex.org/W2006221223,Electrolytic lesions of the nucleus raphe dorsalis and medianus reduce the concentration of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) within rat brain intraparenchymal blood vessels. The concentration of serotonin within these vessels increases or decreases after the administration of drugs that modify the biosynthesis and degradation of serotonin or destroy nerve terminals by an uptake-dependent mechanism. These studies provide evidence for the existence of a serotonin-containing pathway seemingly analogous to the neuronal projection that terminates on small parenchymal blood vessels from noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus.

These changes in Purkinje cells were accompanied by a selective reduction in the thickness of the cerebellar molecular layer. The data provide evidence for cerebellar plasticity during late development and demonstrate that physical activity can modify the development of Purkinje cell dendrites.

Physical mapping by an improved marker rescue method showed that a group of ""early function"" mutations previously found by us to map within the left quarter of the genome do not map within the known early sequence (0-11.2) in that region, but instead lie within the coordinates 18.5-22.0. A search for early expression in this region of the genome using saturation hybridization techniques showed the presence of two discrete sets of viral cytoplasmic RNA sequences, present early in infection at low copy number and complementary to sequences on the I strand of the adenovirus genome lying between 11.2-14.5 and 19.8-23.5 untis."

The first light onset causes a rapid, synchronous disassembly and buildup of the rhabdom in each photoreceptor cell. The entire process is complete within 30 minutes. Blocking the efferent input to the retina from the brain blocks the turnover of the rhabdom, and mimicking the efferent input by optic nerve stimulation restores it."
https://openalex.org/W2026619315,"Chick sternal chondrocytes cultured at high cell density lack fibronectin as a surface protein, while vitamin A-treated chondrocytes contain it as the major cell surface protein. We investigated the mechanism of fibronectin accumulation under these conditions. Control chondrocytes synthesized nearly as much fibronectin as vitamin A-treated chondrocytes, but it was secreted primarily into culture medium. Although the fibronectin of control chondrocytes was of a slightly lower apparent molecular weight than the fibronectin synthesized by the treated cells, it bound as effectively to the cell layer of both normal and treated cells. In contrast, the vitamin A-treated cultures were 2.7 fold more effective in binding fibronectin synthesized by either control or treated cells. Thus in chondrocytes, vitamin A appears to regulate the cellular accumulation of fibronectin by increasing the ability of the cell layer to bind fibronectin rather than by altering its synthesis or its adhesivity for the cell layer."
https://openalex.org/W2100369582,"The plasmid pDd 812 contains a portion of a poly(A)+ RNA sequence isolated from developing cells of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum ( Williams and Lloyd, 1979 Williams J.G. Lloyd M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 19-38 Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar ). The poly(A)+ RNA complementary to this plasmid shows an increase in concentration during the first 4 hr of development followed by a decrease in concentration during the following 4 hr. This RNA is very abundant after 3–4 hr of development, constituting at least 2% of the poly(A)+ RNA population. In this study, we demonstrate that this poly(A)+ RNA is an mRNA sequence by translating the RNA complementary to pDd 812 in a heterologous system. The mRNA directs the synthesis of a major polypeptide of 33,000 daltons and a minor polypeptide of 31,000 daltons. We have used the plasmid DNA immobilized on filters to analyze the transcription of this RNA sequence in isolated nuclei. The amount of transcript synthesized in nuclei isolated at various stages of development which was complementary to pDd 812 changed in the same way as did the cytoplasmic concentration of this RNA — that is, maximal transcription occurred after 3–4 hr of development. Because this result was observed using labeling periods as short as 5 min, we believe that this change is unlikely to reflect a change in the rate of processing of RNA. We interpret these results to indicate that, at least in part, the control of the synthesis of this RNA is at the level of gene transcription."

Synthesis of myelin-associated lipids such as cerebrosides and sulfatides was used as an index for myelination. An experimental design, in which the cells were grown on medium containing serum from a thyroidectomized calf, was employed to demonstrate the direct effect of L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3Y on the biosynthesis of myelin lipids. The cells grown in the presence of hypothyroid calf serum which contained very low levels of thyroid hormones (T4 (thyroxine), 1.2 microgram/ml; T3, less than 25 ng/100 ml) compared to normal serum (T4, 5.8 microgram/ml; T3, 110 ng/100 ml) showed a diminished synthesis of myelin-associated glycolipids. This reduced activity could be restored to normal by including T3 (13 ng/ml) in the medium."

The intervening sequence of a mouse β-globin gene is transcribed within the 15S β-globin mRNA precursor. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 75. 1978: 1309-1313 Google Scholar . We have investigated the intracellular processing pathway of the 1800 nucleotide precursor by analyzing the organization of mRNA segments and intervening sequences in two classes of processing intermediates, one containing 1030 and the other 900 nucleotides. These RNAs were purified from pulse-labeled erythroid cells so that each class could be analyzed separately, thereby allowing us to derive a probable processing scheme and to compare the rates of each cleavage step. The 1030 nucleotide intermediate is 700–800 nucleotides shorter than the precursor and contains two intervening sequences. This RNA is thus generated by excision from the precursor of a major portion of the larger IVS. The 900 nucleotide RNA contains two structurally distinct molecules. One of the 900 nucleotide RNAs still contains the two IVS. The other 900 nucleotide RNA contains only one IVS derived from what was initially the larger IVS. The smaller IVS has been completely excised from this RNA to yield a spliced RNA segment derived from the 5′ terminal and middle mRNA fragments. The fully spliced 790 nucleotide β-globin mRNA is generated by excision of the remaining IVS from the 900 nucleotide RNAs. These data are consistent with a stepwise elimination of the larger IVS by at least two cleavage-ligation reactions. This result implies that the new nucleotide sequence arrangement generated by the first cleavage-ligation reaction is crucial to the precise joining of the mRNA coding regions during the final processing step."
https://openalex.org/W1970726906,"The programmed de novo synthesis of flagellar tubulin during the hour-long differentiation of Naegleria gruberi from amoebae to flagellates is our paradigm for the study of gene expression during cell differentiation. This paper reports the efficient translation of flagellar tubulin mRNA in the wheat germ cell-free system directed by total or polyadenylated RNA extracted from differentiating cells. The tubulin in the in vitro product has a subunit molecular weight of 55,000, separates into α and β subunits under suitable conditions of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and co-polymerizes with calf brain tubulin. At least half of the tubulin synthesized in vitro is precipitated by antibodies specific to flagellar tubulin, and the immunoprecipitated tubulin subunits yield peptide maps similar to those of outer doublet tubulin. Flagellar tubulin is the predominant protein synthesized in the cell-free system, and amounts to about 5% of the polypeptides whose synthesis is directed by total RNA from differentiating cells. In contrast, little or no flagellar tubulin is synthesized when the cell-free system is directed by RNA extracted from amoebae prior to differentiation. Translation assays show that at least 92% of the flagellar tubulin mRNA appears during differentiation. The time course of appearance of this mRNA was measured by quantitative immunoprecipitation of the cell-free products. Under conditions where cells form flagella 60 min after initiation of differentiation, translatable flagellar tubulin mRNA was first detected at 20 min, reached a maximum at about 60 min and then declined. An excellent correlation was observed between the amount of translatable flagellar tubulin mRNA and the previously measured rates of flagellar tubulin synthesis in vivo. These results indicate that synthesis of flagellar tubulin is a direct reflection of the abundance of its mRNA, and provide the molecular techniques for dissection of the factors that regulate the rapid appearance of this structural protein during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1570812063,"Primary rat hepatocyte culture cells were used to study the acute regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in response to 25-hydroxycholesterol, 3 beta,5 alpha,6 beta-cholestantriol, and mevalonolactone. All three effectors caused a rapid suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity. 25-Hydroxycholesterol also caused an increase in the ratio of newly synthesized methyl sterols to newly synthesized C27-sterols. Furthermore, in 25-hydroxycholesterol-treated cells, the relative contribution of delta 24-sterol precursors to the nonsaponifiable lipid fraction increased. Di- and trimethyl-diene sterols were the dominant methyl sterols synthesized in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol. 3 beta,5 alpha,6 beta-Cholestrantriol (50 microM) also caused a very strong (97%) suppression of sterol demethylation; 4,4-dimethylmonoene sterols were more prominent (23%) in cells treated with 3 beta,5 alpha,6 beta-cholestrantriol, than in cells treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol (2%). The rates of both unesterified and esterified sterol synthesis increased as a function of exogenous mevalonolactone concentration. C27-sterol synthesis was saturated at a concentration of (R)-mevalonolactone which produced only a 33% suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity. However, there was a direct relationship between the accumulation of methyl sterols and the decrease in HMG-CoA reductase activity. With the aid of triparanol, it was demonstrated that the suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity by mevalonolactone was linked with the ability of the cells to convert squalene-2,3-epoxide into sterols. The results described in the present article support an important and perhaps necessary relationship between the rate of methyl sterol conversion of C27-sterols and the suppression or inhibition of HMG-Coa reductase in primary hepatocyte culture cells."

https://openalex.org/W1656367974,"Immunochemical techniques have been utilized to study the effect of thyroid status on the content and rates of synthesis and degradation of pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase in rat liver. Liver from hyperthyroid rats had twice the pyruvate carboxylase activity of normal rats while thyroidectomized rats had about two-thirds of normal activity. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity was unchanged in the hyperthyroid state but was significantly reduced (by a third) in hypothyroid rats. Changes in catalytic activity during altered thyroid status were by immunochemical means to be closely related to the amount of the hepatic enzymes present. Isotopic studies showed that the changes in the content of pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase reflected alterations in the rate of the synthesis of the enzymes with the degradation rates little affected by thyroid status. The half-life for pyruvate carboxylase was 4.6 days, and that for pyruvate dehydrogenase, 8.1 days. In both cases, the turnover time was slower than that of the average mitochondrial protein (t1/2 = 3.8 days) for the control animals."

During particle ingestion, the levels of ATP in these cells did not change. However, the specific activity of ATP extracted from macrophages labeled with [32P]Pi during phagocytosis was 40% lower than ATP extracted from control cells. These results suggested that macrophages contain a high energy phosphate reservoir, in addition to the ATP pool(s). A search for such a reservoir led to the identification of creatine phosphate in both resident and thioglycollate-elicited macrophages at concentrations that are in 3- to 5-fold-molar excess over ATP. Creatine phosphate levels in phagocytosing resident macrophages decreased by 45%, while creatine phosphate levels in phagocytosing thioglycollate-elicited macrophages did not change. Creatine phosphate turnover was measured in macrophages prelabeled with [14C]creatine. Over 90% of the intracellular label was in the form of creatine phosphate. During phagocytosis, there was a 40% decrease in intracellular [14C]creatine phosphate in both resident and thioglycollate-elicited macrophages. These results indicate that creatine phosphate turns over more rapidly during phagocytosis and replenishes the ATP consumed."

https://openalex.org/W1607880187,"Incubation of hepatocytes with [32P]orthophosphate resulted in the incorporation of 32P into material that is precipitated by reaction with antibodies to ATP citrate lyase. The amount of radioactivity precipitated was decreased when unlabeled, purified ATP citrate lyase was added to extracts of hepatocytes that had been incubated with [32P]orthophosphate. Addition of glucagon to hepatocytes that had been preincubated with [32P]orthophosphate resulted in a 56% increase in acid-stable 32P in the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble portion of immunoprecipitates. Catalytic phosphate bound to ATP citrate lyase reaction with ATP and Mg2+ is acid-labile; thus, glucagon-dependent phosphorylation is distinguished from the catalytic phosphate. When hepatocytes were incubated in the absence of [32P]orthophosphate and extracted in a medium containing [gamma-32P]ATP, no acid-stable 32P was present in immunoprecipitates. This indicates that the incorporation into ATP citrate lyase of acid-stable phosphate occurs prior to extraction of the enzyme. Preliminary studies, using a procedure that allows for measurement of enzyme activity starting 1 min after beginning the extraction of lyase from hepatocytes, have shown no difference in lyase activity when hepatocytes are treated with or without glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W1595306733,"Prenyltransferase catalyzes the sequential, irreversible 1'-4 condensation of isopentenyl-PP with dimethylallyl-PP and geranyl-PP to yield farnesyl-PP. A kinetic study shows substrate inhibition by isopentenyl-PP at concentrations above 0.7 microM when the concentration of geranyl-PP is 1.0 microM or less as a result of binding by the homoallylic substrate to the allylic region of the active site. Inhibition studies were carried out with the products, farnesyl-PP and PPi, and dead-end inhibitors 2-F-isopentenyl-PP and 2-F-geranyl-PP, analogues for the normal substrates. Competitive patterns were seen for farnesyl-PP and 2-F-geranyl-PP when geranyl-PP was varied, while noncompetitive patterns were found for all other combinations. A minor form of PPi, MgHPPi-, is implicated as the species of PPi in the magnesium-containing buffer which binds most tightly to the enzyme. This observation explains why K's for PPi calculated from the total concentration of PPi are much larger than K's for the organic pyrophosphates. The lack of regiospecificity in the binding of isopentenyl-PP, as evidenced by substrate inhibition patterns, introduces an element of ambiguity into mechanistic interpretations, and it is not possible to distinguish between ordered and random mechanisms on the basis of inhibition studies."

This exchange is reversible and catalyzed by soluble proteins from the brain homogenate precipitated at pH 5.1. The extent of exchange of phosphatidylinositol from microsomal membrane to myelin is dependent upon pH and temperature, with an optimum around pH 7 and at 50 degrees C. Maximum exchange was observed at approximately equal amounts of microsomal, myelin, and supernatant proteins. The extent of the catalyzed exchange increases 4- to 8-fold upon using sonicated or heat-treated myelin as an acceptor membrane. Heating of microsomal membranes results in no change. The extent of catalyzed exchange of phosphatidylcholine is less than that of the phosphatidylinositol. The exchange of other phospholipids and glycolipids between microsomal and myelin membranes cannot be demonstrated. The catalytic activity of the pH 5.1 supernatant proteins in rat brain for the exchange of phosphatidylinositol increases with age after birth and reaches a maximum around 21 days of age analogous to the process of myelination.

These cells have the potential in culture to differentiate into erythroid cells, beating heart muscle tissue, chondrocytes and epithelial cells. Transformation in vitro of pure primary mesenchymal cells by avian erythroblastosis virus (wt-AEV) and a temperature-sensitive mutant (ts34-AEV) gave rise to rapidly growing cells which remained largely undifferentiated, could be cloned in semi-solid medium and could be maintained for up to 3 months in culture. The majority of mesenchymal cells transformed by wt-AEV (MAE cells) are benzidine-negative. Gel electrophoresis of radioactively labeled cell proteins, immunoprecipitated with specific antisera against chicken hemoglobin, showed that MAE cell clones synthesize the alpha D, pi (or pi') and some unidentified ""globin"" polypeptide chains. Treatment of MAE cell clones with 1.0 mM n-butyrate stops cell proliferation reversibly and causes an increased synthesis of alpha D and pi (or pi') globin polypeptide chains. In certain clones of mesenchymal cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of the virus, ts34-AEV (MAE-ts34 cells), benzidine-positive cells can be induced by a shift from 37 degrees to 41 degrees C. The ability of the clone to undergo an increase in benzidine-positivity by temperature shift is decreased with the age of the clone. Different clones show a variable proportion of cells which are positive by immunofluorescence for both globin and chicken-specific histone H5. The alpha A and alpha D globin chains are synthesized in MAE-ts34 clones, but the ratios and quantities of these chains vary for different clones. Temperature shift made little difference in the types and quantities of globin chains synthesized; the increase in benzidine positivity is probably due to an increase in heme biosynthesis."

Serum albumin secreted by the cultures was also isolated and used to estimate the leucine precursor pool specific radioactivity. The protein half-life of phenylalanine hydroxylase could them be calculated. Experiments performed at long and short labeling times and with high and low concentrations of leucine in the medium yielded equivalent results. Phenylalanine hydroxylase half-life in the H4 cells was investigated under both normal and hydrocortisone-induced growth conditions. Average half-lives of 7.4 and 8.2 h were found for induced and uninduced cultures, respectively. Although these measured enzyme half-lives were not essentially different, the steady state level of phenylalanine hydroxylase was increased 6.2-fold upon hydrocortisone induction, from 0.076 to 0.47 microgram/10(6) cells. The results demonstrated that hydrocortisone induces phenylalanine hydroxylase in the H4 cells by causing an increase in the rate of enzyme synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1963747994,Exposure of the head to pulse-modulated microwaves induces the perception of a sound. It has been hypothesized that the electromagnetic energy is converted to acoustic energy in the skull and then conducted through the bone. Dynamic time-averaged interferometric holography showed that the predicted motion of head tissue did not occur. An alternative locus for this hearing effect is suggested.
https://openalex.org/W1569521378,"Though DNase does not contain any cysteine residues, incubation of the enzyme with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid in the presence of Ca2+ at pH values above 7.5 results in an irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. The inactivation also occurs when Ca2+ is replaced by Mg2+, but not in their absence. Amino acid analyses after acid hydrolyses of the completely inactivated ant the native enzymes show no significant differences in composition, including tryptophan and half-cystine residues. However, sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis indicates enzyme cleavage by the treatment with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid. This reagent does not inactivate chymotrypsin and lysozyme, and under conditions where bovine DNase is inactivated, does not inactivate other nucleases such as ribonuclease, snake venom phosphodiesterase, and spleen acid DNase. However, it inactivates malt DNase and can, therefore, be considered a specific inhibitor of DNase I. The inactivation kinetics is pseudo-first order, resembling Michaelis-Menten, with an affinity constant of 16.7 mM. It is the cyano group, not the thionitrobenzoic acid of 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid that reacts to form cyano-DNase."
https://openalex.org/W1596098158,"Studies on the inhibition of translation by methylglyoxal of capped and chemically decapped globin mRNAs in the rabbit reciculocyte system strongly suggest that it is cap-dependent. Concentrations of methylglyoxal (0.2 mM), which effected substantial inhibition (80%) of capped mRNA, were only slightly inhibitory (10%) to the decapped species. In addition, the inhibition was K+-dependent with maximal inhibition occurring at the K+ optimum for translation of the capped species, suggesting cap recognition is required for the effect. Results with endogenous mRNA further substantiate that initiation and not elongation is the site of action. These results are consistent with an inhibition due to a newly discovered, rapid reaction of methylglyoxal with the 7-methylguanosine of the cap structure."

https://openalex.org/W1552109090,"The amino acid compositions of various fragments isolated from DNase treated with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB) show peptide bond cleavages to be at Thr14, Ser40, and Ser135. Isolation and characterization of radioactive tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of [14C]cyano-DNase reveal four points of peptide bond cleavage; in addition to Thr14, Ser40, and Ser135, cleavage occurs at the amino end of Ser72. Approximately 2.8 mol of [14C]cyano group are incorporated in the completely inactivated enzyme, in which 0.6 residue of Thr14, 0.8 of Ser40, and approximately 0.3 each of Ser72 and Ser135 are modified. The inactivation by NTCB can also be obtained by reacting the enzyme with a mixture of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), KCN, and iodoacetate which generates NTCB. The mixture facilitates the uses of K[14C]N, which is readily incorporated into the enzyme as the [14C]cyano derivative. The reaction of NTCB with serine or threonine resembles that with cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1525086569,"Steady state kinetic studies have been performed to investigate the formation of thrombin from prothrombin by human coagulation Factor Xa in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipid. The concentration of ligand which gives 50% of the maximum velocity (K0.5) is 2.3 mM for Ca2+, 7.4 microM for phospholipid, and 0.006 microM for prothrombin. Hill plots of the Ca2+ enhancement of the reaction give a Hill coefficient of 3.1, indicating positive cooperativity. The initial velocity patterns are consistent with an ordered addition of reactants with phospholipid as the second reactant to bind to the enzyme. Although our results do not differentiate between Ca2+ or the prothrombin substrate as the first reactant to bind to Factor Xa, it is established that Ca2+ can bind to Factor Xa in the absence of the other reactants. Thus, the most probable order of addition of reactants is Ca2+, phospholipid, and the prothrombin substrate. Plots of (v)-1 versus (prothrombin)-1 or (v)-1 versus [(Ca2+)3]-1 at several constant concentrations of phospholipid indicate that the major effect of phospholipid is to increase the turnover number of Factor Xa."

In particular, they advocate virtually nationwide distribution of potassium iodide, which can block the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland; their report suggests, for example, that a supply of the medicine might be fastened to electricity meters."
