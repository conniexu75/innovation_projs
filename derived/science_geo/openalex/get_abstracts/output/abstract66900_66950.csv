https://openalex.org/W2070426830,"Retinoscopy was performed on animals with different sized eyes, all of whom appeared hypermetropic. The data were well fitted by an equation of the form y = kx(-2) where y is refractive error in diopters, and x is the corneo-retinal length of the eye. Apparent hypermetropia may be due to the reflection from the inner surface of the retins."
https://openalex.org/W2071514927,A mixture of gases roughly simulating the primitive terrestrial atmosphere has been subjected to shock heating followed by a rapid thermal quench. Under strictly homogeneous conditions there is a very high efficiency of 5 Ã— 1010 molecules per erg of shock-injected energy for production of alpha-amino acids. Calculations suggest that rapid quenching bypasses the usual thermochemical barrier. The product of energy flux and efficiency implies the unexpected conclusion that shocks occurring on atmospheric entry of cometary meteors and micrometeorites and from thunder may have been the principal energy sources for prebiological organic synthesis on the primitive earth.

It contains about 7 percent carbohydrate, half of which occurs as glucosylgalactose disaccharide units linked to hydroxylysine. Glomeruli from diabetics contain increased amounts of basement membrane material. In addition, these membranes show a distinct chemical alteration characterized by a significant decrease in lysine, accompanied by an equivalent increase in hydroxylysine and hydroxylysine-linked disaccharide units."

This result is consistent with the theory of a decreased sensitivity to internal signals in the control of food intake of obese people."

https://openalex.org/W2059402871,"In yeast the mating type alleles a and a also control sporulation; heterozygous strains (a/a) sporulate while homozygous strains (a/a or a/a) do not. Net DNA synthesis, an early event preceding sporulation, occurred normally in the heterozygous strains but did not occur in the homozygous strains. Therefore, the a/a allelles also influence early development well before spore formation begins."
https://openalex.org/W2074843622,"After biosynthesis of norepinephrine was inhibited, treatment of rats for 10 days with rubidium chloride (0.6 milliequivalent per kilogram of body weight) caused an increase in the rate of disappearance of norepinephrine in the brainstem but not in the telencephalon. Also the utilization of intracisternally injected tritiated norepinephrine was increased and was accompanied by a shift in the pattern of norepinephrine metabolism to normetanephrine. These data suggest that greater amounts of neuronally stored norepinephrine were released to central adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2066600262,"p-Bromoaniline is rapidly acetylated by four soil microorganisms. Two fungal species convert metobromuron to p-bromoacetanilide, but a bacterial and an algal species do not metabolize metobromuron. Acetylation may serve as a detoxification mechanism by competing with azobenzene formation in utilizing the aniline formed by metabolism of substituted urea herbicides."

https://openalex.org/W1995571536,"The growth of tumor isografts in inbred mice is inhibited by intra-peritoneal injections of syngeneic spleen incubated, in vitro, with ribonucleic acid extracted from guinea pigs immunized with the same mouse tumor. This inhibition is partially tumor-specific. Treatment with ribonuclease abolishes the response."
https://openalex.org/W2060369229,"Human glial cells grown in culture and gliomas and white matter contain an L-glutamic acid decarboxylase which is stimulated markedly by carbonyl-trapping agents. In contrast, L-glutamic acid decarboxylase activity of human cerebral gray matter is strongly inhibited by carbonyl-trapping agents. These results suggest a glial localization of the new type of L-glutamic acid decarboxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1541927157,"Abstract The influence of protein conformation upon the circular dichroism (CD) bands of two peroxidase isoenzymes (A1 and C) was investigated by using guanidine hydrochloride and other denaturing agents. In all four proteins, guanidine hydrochloride markedly reduces the 221-nm CD band, indicating disruption of the ordered peptide backbone conformation. Similarly guanidine hydrochloride greatly diminishes the near ultraviolet CD bands of the tyrosyl and tryptophanyl side chains, which implies that their orientation has been disrupted. In contrast, guanidine hydrochloride treatment of peroxidase C brings out phenylalanyl CD fine structure at 268 and 261 nm, even though none can be detected in the native conformation. The intensities of these CD bands in the denatured peroxidase C are comparable to those of an equivalent concentration of unoriented phenylalanyl model compound. These findings indicate that in the native peroxidase C many of the phenylalanyl side chains have fixed orientations producing unique interactions with the surroundings. Apparently the rotatory strength of each oriented phenylalanyl side chain may be weak or strong and either positive or negative. The native peroxidase C may have as many as 23 oriented phenylalanine residues; summing the individual contributions leads to nearly complete cancellation of CD intensity. In the denatured peroxidase C, even though the unoriented phenylalanyl side chains have weak CD bands, all have nearly the same CD spectrum, thereby precluding cancellation among the residues. Thus the observed intensity of the phenylalanyl CD bands increases when the orientations of the phenylalanyl side chains are disrupted in peroxidase C. Guanidine hydrochloride and other denaturing agents do not cause any detectable change (l20%) in the intensity of the 268- and 261-nm phenylalanyl CD fine structure observed in the native peroxidase A1 or either of the apoisoenzymes. Other evidence suggests that, at least for peroxidase A1, the observed intensities of the phenylalanyl CD bands may remain constant even though the local environment is altered."

The multiple origin of this joint suggests that additional criteria are required to separate early mammals from advanced therapsids."

The normal fish eye is myopic in air because of curvature of the cornea. This is overcome in Mnierpes by the presence of two flattened corneal surfaces."

Cell growth continiues until all cells become nonseparating cell doublets in a V configuration. Mutants have been isolated capable of uninhibited growth in the presence of concentrations of Colcemid mycostatic for the parent strain."
https://openalex.org/W2079424709,"Although there seems to be a regular relation of protein change versus time via an exponential equation of the form ID =e(kt), nevertheless, examination of the data indicates that such an exponential fit may be premature. Two other models, ID = kt + b and ID = bt(k) + c represent better fits. Without better data none of the models appears convincing."
https://openalex.org/W2010989703,"Macdonald and Ellis report1 that cycloheximide inhibits the uptake of chloride in storage tissue disks of beet, carrot and potato, and in roots of wheat and pea plants. It was also found that oxygen uptake was markedly stimulated by the antibiotic in beet and carrot disks, slightly stimulated in potato disks, and not affected in wheat or pea roots. These findings were considered to suggest that cycloheximide can disrupt cellular metabolism in other ways than the inhibition of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W122517954,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of rat pancreatic ribonuclease has been found by Beintema and Gruber to differ from that of the bovine enzyme in approximately one-third of the residues. We have found that, in spite of this large number of amino acid replacements, the two proteins are very similar in their over-all conformation as attested by optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism in the far ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Some local differences in conformation have been detected by the use of proteases which show that the subtilisin- and elastase-sensitive region of the bovine enzyme is altered in the rat enzyme. Circular dichroism studies in the far ultraviolet region indicate that the exposed tyrosine residues of the bovine enzyme contribute significantly to the optical activity of the protein in the near ultraviolet spectral region."
