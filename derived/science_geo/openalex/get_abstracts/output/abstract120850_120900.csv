https://openalex.org/W1980314143,"We report highly potent, selective, and low cost bifunctional acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors developed by our two-step prototype optimization strategy utilizing computer modeling of ligand docking with target proteins: 1) identify low affinity sites normally missed by x-ray crystallography; and 2) design bifunctional analogs capable of simultaneous binding at the computer-determined low affinity site and the x-ray-identified high affinity site. Applying this strategy to 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine (THA), a drug for Alzheimer's disease, we obtained alkylene linked bis-THA analogs. These analogs were up to 10,000-fold more selective and 1,000-fold more potent than THA in inhibiting rat AChE and yet required one simple reaction to synthesize. Additionally, alkylene linked benzyl-THA analogs were developed to examine the specificity of the docking-derived low affinity THA peripheral site in AChE. The present work and our previous computational studies strongly suggest that a low affinity THA peripheral site exists in AChE. This peripheral site provides a structural basis for design of improved cholinesterase ligands for treating Alzheimer's disease and for other health-related purposes.

The agent THA 1The abbreviations used are: THA9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridineAChEacetylcholinesteraseBChEbutyrylcholinesteraseADAlzheimer's disease. is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for palliative treatment of mild and moderate AD (1Davis K.L. Powchik P. Lancet. 1995; 345: 625-630Google Scholar). Despite evidence of clinical utility, the mechanism of the therapeutic effect of THA is uncertain, since this drug has many actions in the central nervous system and interacts with multiple receptors and ligand-binding sites. However, one well characterized effect of THA is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme that regulates synaptic availability of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (2Quinn D.M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 955-979Google Scholar, 3Sussman J.L. Harel M. Silman I. Multidisciplinary Approaches to Cholinesterase Functions. Plenum Press, New York1992: 95-107Google Scholar). 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine acetylcholinesterase butyrylcholinesterase Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, THA is not without serious toxicity, so it would be logical to develop additional potent and selective inhibitors of AChE as potential therapeutic agents. We have aimed at compounds that are more potent and selective for AChE inhibition but otherwise similar to THA. Such inhibitors may or may not produce all of the clinical effects of THA, but these THA analogs can serve as indispensable pharmacological tools for evaluating the role of AChE inhibition in AD therapy. If AChE inhibition is an important component of the therapeutic response, and if structural modification introduces no additional toxicity, increased potency might provide clinical advantage. With these aims, we previously devised an automated computer docking program, SYSDOC, to guide the directed synthesis of THA analogs with superior therapeutic potential. This program systematically translates and rotates a guest (such as THA) in the putative binding pocket of a host (such as AChE) to evaluate energetically favorable binding sites for each available conformation of the two partners. The affinity of binding in a docking study is estimated from the potential energy of the complex relative to the potential energies of the guest and host in their free state, assuming that the differences in entropy and solvation energies between two binding sites can be neglected (4Pang Y.-P. Kozikowski A.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 669-693Google Scholar). Work with SYSDOC identified putative binding sites for THA and other inhibitors in the three-dimensional structure of AChE (4Pang Y.-P. Kozikowski A.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 669-693Google Scholar, 5Harel M. Schalk I. Ehretsabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9031-9035Google Scholar). One interesting prediction of the SYSDOC analysis was THA docking at two different loci on the Torpedo AChE, not only at the catalytic site per se but also near residues Trp279, Tyr70, and Phe290. The second region constitutes AChE's so-called peripheral site (4Pang Y.-P. Kozikowski A.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 669-693Google Scholar, 6Pang Y.-P. Kollman P.A. Perspect. Drug Discovery Des. 1995; 6: 106-122Google Scholar, 7Radic Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Google Scholar, 8Eichler J. Anselment A. Sussman J.L. Massoulie J. Silman I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 335-340Google Scholar). It is located at the opening of the enzymatic binding pocket (gorge) and is far from the catalytic site at the bottom of the gorge (Fig. 1). The catalytic site has been shown by x-ray crystallography to bind THA; however, a crystal complex of THA-AChE contained no ligand at the peripheral site (5Harel M. Schalk I. Ehretsabatier L. Bouet F. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Axelsen P.H. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9031-9035Google Scholar). Pharmacological evidence for interaction of THA with AChE's peripheral site is also conflicting (9Pomponi M. Giardina B. Gatta F. Marta M. Med. Chem. Res. 1992; 2: 306-327Google Scholar, 10Berman H.A. Leonard K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 412-418Google Scholar, 11Taylor J.L. Mayer R.T. Himel C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 74-83Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we propose that the SYSDOC-determined peripheral THA site does exist and is functionally relevant in the Torpedo AChE but not in the related enzyme mammalian butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (12Harel M. Sussman J.L. Krejci E. Bon S. Chanal P. Massoulie J. Silman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10827-10831Google Scholar). 2In BChE, the amino acids that are key components of AChE's peripheral site are replaced by the nonaromatic residues Ala279, Asn70, and Gln121. This fact does not exclude the possibility that a hydrophobic peripheral site of butyrylcholine may exist (Y.-P. Pang and S. Brimijoin, manuscript in preparation). We further propose that this peripheral site also exists in mammalian AChE, whose primary structure is similar to the Torpedo enzyme, especially in the conserved 14 aromatic residues lining the active site gorge (13Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Google Scholar). The peripheral site in AChE probably evolved to increase the concentration of acetylcholine at the opening of the active site gorge, facilitating passage through the narrower portion of the gorge toward the catalytic site. This function is best accomplished with interactions of relatively low affinity (4Pang Y.-P. Kozikowski A.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 669-693Google Scholar, 6Pang Y.-P. Kollman P.A. Perspect. Drug Discovery Des. 1995; 6: 106-122Google Scholar, 13Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Google Scholar), for tight binding at the peripheral site would actually lower substrate concentrations at the catalytic site. A peripheral site that serves to concentrate acetylcholine would not be an advantage for BChE, however, since the active site gorge of this enzyme is wider throughout (12Harel M. Sussman J.L. Krejci E. Bon S. Chanal P. Massoulie J. Silman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10827-10831Google Scholar). It seems likely that low affinity explains why crystallography revealed no THA binding at the peripheral site. This low affinity peripheral site can also be responsible for nonspecific, low affinity binding of inhibitors such as 9-aminoacridine (11Taylor J.L. Mayer R.T. Himel C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 74-83Google Scholar). The peripheral site predicted by SYSDOC suggested a strategy for improving on the potency and selectivity of AChE inhibition by THA. This strategy was to connect two THA molecules with an alkylene chain spaced to permit simultaneous binding at the catalytic and peripheral sites (Fig. 1). This design takes advantage of Koshland's “proximity and orientation” effect (14Koshland D.E. J. Theor. Biol. 1962; 2: 75-86Google Scholar), facilitating productive interactions between ligand and protein by decreasing the entropy loss of the ligand in binding. At the same time, since BChE lacks a peripheral site for THA, selectivity for AChE should be increased. Additional reasons for producing bifunctional THA analogs were 1) to minimize efforts in synthesis of THA analogs and toxicity studies of the respective metabolites and synthetic intermediates; 2) to develop economical insecticides and parasiticides; 3) to confirm the existence of AChE's peripheral THA site; and 4) to evaluate the role of AChE inhibition by THA in treating AD. Bifunctional THA analogs are well suited to the last aim, since varying the linking chain length may vary AChE inhibition while preserving other pharmacologic properties of the THA molecule. Effective alkylene-bridged analogs require chains of the correct length (number of methylene units) coupled to the parent structure at the appropriate point. Inhibitory potency toward AChE is reportedly preserved or raised by attaching an n-pentyl or phenethyl group to the amino group of THA (15Steinberg G.M. Mednick M.L. Maddox J. Rice R. J. Med. Chem. 1975; 18: 1057-1061Google Scholar). Therefore, guided also by simulations of AChE complexed with two bound THA molecules we chose to link the amino nitrogen atoms. This choice simplified the synthesis of analogs because the nitrogen atom served as a nucleophilic center. Approximate chain length was determined by the growth method, in which sp3 carbon atoms were added sequentially starting at one connecting point and ending near the other. At each step, the new atom's energetically favored location in AChE's active-site gorge was determined. Energy evaluation with the CHARMM force field involved rotating the torsional angle of the newly introduced atom at increments of 30° over a 360° range of arc (16Brooks B.R. Brucoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. Slater D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Google Scholar). Once these calculations had established the approximate chain length (9 methylene units), the specified compound 1c was readily synthesized according to Scheme I as illustrated in Fig. 1. Given the ease of synthesis, it was efficient to make homologs without performing full scale docking studies and the dual topology (17Gao J. Kuczera K. Tidor B. Karplus M. Science. 1989; 244: 1069-1072Google Scholar) free energy perturbations for accurate chain length. Therefore, three homologs with chains one and two atoms shorter and one atom longer than in 1c were produced at the same time for empirical evaluation. Newly synthesized compounds were tested in vitro for selectivity and potency as enzyme inhibitors. Rat serum and extracts from rat brain were used, respectively, as sources of BChE and AChE for this screening work. As compared with THA, compound 1a proved 1,000 times more potent and 10,000 times more selective in inhibiting rat brain AChE (Table I). Inhibitory potency within the series of compounds was related to the length of the alkylene chain (Table I). The best chain length determined by experiment was reached in compound 1a, with 7 methylene groups between THA residues. Based on a conformational search of compound 1a, the heptylene chain allows the ring nitrogen atoms of the two THA moieties to lie up to 18 Å apart. This spacing amply bridges the distance between the two SYSDOC-determined THA-binding sites (approximately 16 Å between the ring nitrogen atoms).Table I.Inhibition of AChE and BChE by THA and its bifunctional analogsTHA and analogsIC50Selectivity for AChEaSelectivity for AChE: IC50 for BChE divided by IC50 for AChE.Rat brain AChERat serum BChEnMTHA590 ± 3744 ± 2.00.11a0.40 ± 0.025390 ± 669801b0.66 ± 0.20340 ± 135201c0.77 ± 0.11190 ± 302501d3.1 ± 0.75440 ± 1001402a1400 ± 140NANA2b1500 ± 190520 ± 500.42c610 ± 23810 ± 1201.42d390 ± 121000 ± 352.62e210 ± 192400 ± 21011.42f20,000 ± 9509300 ± 18000.52g27,000 ± 40009400 ± 5500.4a Selectivity for AChE: IC50 for BChE divided by IC50 for AChE. Open table in a new tab The modest discrepancy by 2 methylene units between the experimental result and the highly simplified computational result is hardly surprising. The growth method ignores solvent and entropy effects as well as the molecular flexibility of both enzyme and inhibitor. These factors all contribute to the experimentally observed binding affinity. Nonetheless, the predictive power of the growth method is evident in the fact that compound 1c, although not optimal in the series, still demonstrates dramatic improvement in potency and selectivity relative to THA (Table I). For a rigorous test of the anticholinesterase properties of our compounds, the substrate kinetics of enzyme inhibition were examined in a highly purified preparation of human brain AChE. According to the reciprocal slope-replot procedure of Segel (18Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons, New York1975Google Scholar), class 1 analogs, like THA itself, produced a linear mixed type of enzyme inhibition (Fig. 2). The calculated Ki for compound 1a was 1.4 nM. This value is well below the 80 nM Ki determined for THA in the same AChE preparation. It does appear that THA inhibits human AChE more readily than rat AChE, at which its Ki is nearly micromolar. Even so, the results conclusively demonstrate the advantage of bifunctional analogs as inhibitors of AChE in the mammalian brain. Compound 1a is superior to the drug candidates developed over the past 25 years (19Villalobos A. Butler T.W. Chapin D.S. Chen Y.L. Demattos S.B. Ives J.L. Jones S.B. Listen D.R. Nagel A.A. Nason D.M.

Chem. 1986; 64: 837-839Google Scholar) on the basis of not only inhibitory potency and selectivity to AChE but also efficiency in synthesis and economies in toxicological studies of metabolites and synthetic intermediates. Further pharmacological evaluation is needed to establish the efficacy of bis-THA analogs in vivo and to explore their potential for AD. In considering molecular targets, however, the focus should not be confined to AChE. For one thing, there is impressive structural similarity between compound 1 and recognized K+ channel and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel blockers (23Patocka J. Bajgar J. Bielavsky J. Fusek J. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 1976; 41: 816-824Google Scholar, 24Galanakis D. Davis C.A. Del Rey Herrero B. Ganellin C.R. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 595-606Google Scholar, 25Nelson M.E. Albuquerque E.X. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 151-160Google Scholar). For another, THA itself at high concentration can affect K+ channels (26Osterrieder W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 92: 521-525Google Scholar) and muscarinic receptors (27Flynn D.D. Mash D.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 250: 573-581Google Scholar). It would therefore be interesting to test whether the THA analogs affect K+ channels, muscarinic receptors, and perhaps N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as well. To probe the relationship between chain length and inhibitory potency and to examine the specificity of the THA peripheral site, we synthesized another series of analogs with a benzyl group in place of one THA moiety (Fig. 1, scheme II). Enzyme inhibition by these class 2 analogs (Table I) showed that compound 2e was optimal, and further decrease or increase of chain length weakened AChE inhibition. This result confirmed that the chain length of bis-aromatic THA analogs was an important determinant of potency. In particular, a spacing of 7 methylene units between THA and toluene residues of the class 2 compounds was consistently associated with maximal effect on the catalytic function of AChE. Thus, modification of the spacer chain can serve as a molecular “switch” for regulating AChE inhibition. It is striking that, when tested against rat brain AChE, compound 2e and THA were nearly equipotent inhibitors, much weaker than compound 1a. The dramatic increase in inhibitory potency conferred by the additional THA residue in compound 1a but not by the toluene residue in compound 2e implies a secondary site that is specific to THA. The relative potency of compound 2e is not as great as that of compound 1a. A likely explanation is that the small amount of favorable interaction energy gained from the nonspecific binding of toluene is largely offset by the loss of entropy energy when the alkylene chain binds and by the steric hindrance of the chain. In our view, this secondary site probably corresponds to the recognized “peripheral anionic site” of AChE. Additional enzymological studies of our THA analogs might be pursued for new insights into the highly evolved catalytic machinery inherent in the protein structure of AChE. Inestrosa et al. (28Inestrosa N.C. Alvarez A. Perez C.A. Moreno R.D. Vicente M. Linker C. Casanueva O.I. Sota C. Garrido J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 881-891Google Scholar) recently reported that AChE accelerates amyloid formation from amyloid-β peptide, which alone produces few amyloid-like fibrils, and that the formation of amyloid induced by the association of AChE with amyloid-β peptide can be inhibited by peripheral anionic site ligands such as propidium and decamethonium (28Inestrosa N.C. Alvarez A. Perez C.A. Moreno R.D. Vicente M. Linker C. Casanueva O.I. Sota C. Garrido J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 881-891Google Scholar). Compounds 1 and 2 are novel peripheral anionic site ligands with different functional groups occupying the peripheral anionic site. It will be interesting to investigate whether these compounds can effectively inhibit the AChE-induced amyloid formation and therefore offer additional mechanistic advantage of treating AD relative to the current drug THA. In conclusion, we have produced a series of highly potent, selective, and low cost bis-THA AChE inhibitors. These compounds are more hydrophobic than THA because of the introduced alkylene chain and interact simultaneously with the catalytic site and the peripheral anionic site. They might therefore serve as improved drugs for treating AD and as potential insecticides and parasiticides. The present work and the results of our previous computational studies (4Pang Y.-P. Kozikowski A.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 669-693Google Scholar, 6Pang Y.-P. Kollman P.A. Perspect. Drug Discovery Des. 1995; 6: 106-122Google Scholar) strongly suggest that a low affinity THA peripheral site exists in AChE. This unique secondary site in AChE therefore provides a structural basis for designing novel antidotes for chemical warfare agents (29Wilson I.B. Ginsburg S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 18: 168-170Google Scholar) and developing novel BChE-selective compounds that do not fit AChE's peripheral site. Such analogs can serve as tools to evaluate permissive or causative roles of neural AChE and glial BChE in the neuropathology of AD (30Mesulam M.M. Geula C. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 722-727Google Scholar). We thank M. Stacy of the Mayo Foundation for providing computing resources."
https://openalex.org/W2076606604,"Accumulating evidence suggests that phosphatidylinositol metabolism is essential for membrane traffic in the cell. Of particular importance, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein and the type I phosphatidylinositol- 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI4P5K) have been identified as cytosolic components required for ATP-dependent, Ca2+-activated secretion. In order to identify PI4P5K isoforms that may play important roles in regulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, we employed the polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers and screening of a cDNA library of the murine pancreatic β-cell line MIN6. Two novel cDNAs, designated PI4P5K-Iα and PI4P5K-Iβ, were identified, which contained complete coding sequences encoding 539- or 546-amino acid proteins, respectively. These cDNAs were expressed in mammalian cells with an adenoviral expression vector. Proteins of both isoforms migrated at 68 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exhibited phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase activity, which was activated by phosphatidic acid, indicating that these proteins were type I isoforms. While these isoforms share a marked amino acid sequence homology in their central portion, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions differ significantly. Northern blot analysis depicted that tissue distributions differed between the two isoforms.

INTRODUCTIONExocytotic release of neurotransmitters and hormones is a highly complex process.

Also required are cytosolic proteins, including N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins (reviewed in 1Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Google Scholar). Recently, two other cytosolic protein components required for ATP-dependent priming for Ca2+ -activated secretion have been identified: phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (2Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Google Scholar) and the type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI4P5K) (3Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Google Scholar). PI4P5K produces, from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-204Google Scholar)P), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), which has been demonstrated to be important in various cellular processes. PtdIns(4,5)P2 acts as a substrate for phospholipase C, generating the major second messenger molecules, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (4Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-204Google Scholar). In addition, PtdIns(4,5)P2 itself has also been demonstrated to function as a regulator molecule in several cellular processes, including actin filament reorganization (5Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Google Scholar, 6Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Google Scholar) and exocytosis (7Eberahard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Google Scholar). More recently, it has been postulated that PtdIns(4,5)P2 functions in the fusion of intracellular vesicles with target membranes (8Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Google Scholar). Despite these important roles played by the type I PI4P5K, molecular identification of the enzyme has yet to be carried out.Insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is one example of regulated exocytosis. Extensive studies have been conducted, which suggest the importance of the polyphosphoinositide synthesis pathway and the breakdown of its products by phospholipase C (9Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 1185-1248Google Scholar, 10Farese F.V. DiMarco P.E. Barnes D.E. Sabir M.A. Larson R.E. Davis J.S. Morrison A.D.

We recently demonstrated that insulin secretion requires an ATP-dependent priming process (12Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1-243AGoogle Scholar), suggesting that the type I PI4P5K plays a significant role in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. We have therefore made efforts to identify PI4P5K-like proteins in insulin-secreting MIN6 cells (13Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J.-I.

Nature. 1989; 341: 197-204Google Scholar), actin filament reorganization (5Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Google Scholar, 6Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Google Scholar), and exocytosis (7Eberahard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Google Scholar). Co-existence of at least three isoforms of the PI4P5K (one previously cloned isoform (type II or C) and two type I) in an insulin-secreting cell line, MIN6, suggests that these isoforms have distinct roles in various cellular processes. These isoforms may reside in different subcellular compartments and that spatially segregated synthesis or metabolism of PtdIns(4,5)P2 may be linked to different cellular functions. While these novel isoforms show approximately 75% identity in their central regions, the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal sequences are different. It is possible that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions have isoform-specific functions. Further studies of these isoforms are needed; of particular interest is their subcellular localization and possible association with other molecules, such as Rac1 (29Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Google Scholar) and Rho (30Ren X.-D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Google Scholar).Proteins of both the Iα and the Iβ isoform migrate at 68 kDa on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that these isoforms are identical or closely related to the type Ia isoform previously described (3Hay J.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Google Scholar). During the screening of the MIN6 cell cDNA library, we obtained another partial coding sequence closely homologous to the PI4P5K-Iα and Iβ isoforms. Further studies are needed to characterize the third sequence.Whether the type I PI4P5K plays an important roles in regulated exocytosis of insulin secretory granules remains to be determined. The type I but not the type II enzyme has been demonstrated to be activated by phosphatidic acid and appears to phosphorylate PtdIns(4Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-204Google Scholar)P on intact membrane (31Bazenet C.E. Ruano A.R. Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18012-18022Google Scholar). Recent studies on regulated exocytosis have postulated that a positive feedback loop catalyzed by phospholipase D and the type I PI4P5K is involved in exocytotic processes (8Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Google Scholar), which may form a microdomain enriched in negatively charged phospholipids on the vesicle membrane. Our demonstration of several isoforms of the type I PI4P5K in insulin-secreting cells (MIN6), together with a previous demonstration of phospholipase D in pancreatic islets (32Metz S.A. Dunlop M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 417-428Google Scholar), raises the possibility that such a positive feedback loop may operate in insulin-secreting cells. Furthermore, it was previously reported that glucose could cause activation of phosphatidylinositol metabolism, which was partly ascribed to increased de novo synthesis of PA and polyphosphoinositide in pancreatic islets (10Farese F.V.

Commun. 1985; 132: 467-473Google Scholar). These observations suggest that activation of phosphatidylinositol metabolism, in concert with membrane depolarization, may serve as a link between glucose metabolism and exocytosis of insulin secretory granules. Molecular identification of the type I PI4P5K isoforms will provide essential information for the precise role of phosphatidylinositol metabolism in exocytosis of insulin-containing dense core vesicles. INTRODUCTIONExocytotic release of neurotransmitters and hormones is a highly complex process. In addition to Ca2+ and ATP, regulated fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane requires membrane proteins, v-SNARE 1The abbreviations used here are: v-SNARE and t-SNAREvesicle membrane- and target membrane-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive attachment protein receptorsPI4P5Kphosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinasePtdIns(4,5)P2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePtdIns(3,4)P2phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphatePtdIns(4Berridge M.J.

Also required are cytosolic proteins, including N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins (reviewed in 1Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Google Scholar). Recently, two other cytosolic protein components required for ATP-dependent priming for Ca2+ -activated secretion have been identified: phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (2Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Google Scholar) and the type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI4P5K) (3Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Google Scholar). PI4P5K produces, from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-204Google Scholar)P), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), which has been demonstrated to be important in various cellular processes. PtdIns(4,5)P2 acts as a substrate for phospholipase C, generating the major second messenger molecules, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (4Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-204Google Scholar). In addition, PtdIns(4,5)P2 itself has also been demonstrated to function as a regulator molecule in several cellular processes, including actin filament reorganization (5Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Google Scholar, 6Fukami K. Furuhashi K. Inagaki M. Endo T. Hatano S. Takenawa T. Nature. 1992; 359: 150-152Google Scholar) and exocytosis (7Eberahard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Google Scholar). More recently, it has been postulated that PtdIns(4,5)P2 functions in the fusion of intracellular vesicles with target membranes (8Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Google Scholar). Despite these important roles played by the type I PI4P5K, molecular identification of the enzyme has yet to be carried out.Insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is one example of regulated exocytosis. Extensive studies have been conducted, which suggest the importance of the polyphosphoinositide synthesis pathway and the breakdown of its products by phospholipase C (9Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M.

We recently demonstrated that insulin secretion requires an ATP-dependent priming process (12Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1-243AGoogle Scholar), suggesting that the type I PI4P5K plays a significant role in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells.

The mechanisms that regulate this process are incompletely characterized. This report investigates the effects of protein kinase C activation on the regulation of connexin-43 gene transcription in human uterine smooth muscle cells. In primary myometrial cells treated with phorbol ester, transient increases in c-Fos and c-Jun protein levels were observed at 2-4 h, followed by significant increases in connexin-43 protein levels at 6-8 h. Nuclear run-on transcription analysis showed an increase in connexin-43 transcription 3 h after phorbol ester treatment. AP-1 sites were identified in the sequence of the 5′-flanking promoter region of the human connexin-43 gene at 44 and 1000 base pairs upstream of transcription start. Transcription from a reporter plasmid containing the proximal human connexin-43 promoter was increased in transfected primary cultures treated with phorbol ester. Mutation of the proximal AP-1 site in the promoter abolished the phorbol ester-dependent transactivation.

This work provides evidence that transcription of the human connexin-43 gene is induced through protein kinase C activation in uterine smooth muscle cells, and that the induction involves up-regulation and activation of c-Jun and c-Fos. Connexins compose a family of transmembrane proteins, which form hexameric hemi-channel structures in cell membranes. When hemi-channels of adjacent cells attach, an intercellular channel is created, which allows for the passive diffusion of ionic mediators and secondary messengers of less than about 1,500 daltons (Da) and establishes direct communication between connected cells via such small molecules. A specialized region of the membrane containing connexin channels is called a gap junction (1Goodenough D. CSH Symposia on Quantitative Biology. Vol XL. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1975: 37Google Scholar). Gap junctions allow for coordinate function of the cells in a tissue. Several mammalian connexins cDNAs have been sequenced (2Willecke K. Hennemann H. Dahl E. Jungbluth S. Heynkes R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 1-7Google Scholar, 3Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Leinwand L.A.

Genomics. 1991; 10: 250-256Google Scholar), and the proteins, named according to their respective molecular weights, appear to be tissue-specific. The primary connexin in cardiac muscle, osteoblasts, granulosa cells of the ovary, and vascular and uterine smooth muscle is connexin-43 (Cx43) (43,000 Da) (3Fishman G.I. Spray D.C. Leinwand L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 589-598Google Scholar, 5Beyer E.C. Kistler J. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 198: 595-605Google Scholar, 6Andersen J. Grine E.A. Eng C.L.-Y. Zhao K. Barbieri R.L.

Res. 1995; 10: 881-889Google Scholar). Additionally, during mouse fetal development, temporal and spatial patterns of connexin-43 gene (cx43) expression occur (8Dahl E. Winterhager E. Traub O. Willecke K. Anat. Enbryol. 1995; 191: 267-278Google Scholar). There is little information concerning the mechanisms that control connexin-43 gene expression or that govern tissue-specific differences in gene expression. In adult tissues such as the heart muscle and bone, cx43 expression is relatively stable. In myometrium, Cx43 gap junctions are not evident except just before parturition when connexin-43 (cx43) mRNA levels increase dramatically (9Risek B. Guthrie S. Kumar N. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 269-282Google Scholar). Cx43 gap junctions subsequently become abundant in myometrium (10Claire-Wathes D.C. Porter D.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1982; 65: 497-505Google Scholar, 11Garfield R.E. Puri C.P. Csapo A.I. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1982; 142: 21-27Google Scholar, 12Hendrix E.M. Mao S.J.T. Everson W. Larsen W.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 33: 27-38Google Scholar) and are believed to play an essential role in successful deliveries by synchronizing contractions during labor through the passage of molecules such as [Ca2+] (13Garfield R.E. Grover A.K. Daniel E.E. Calcium and Contractility: Smooth Muscle. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1985: 143Google Scholar, 14Garfield R.E. Sims S. Daniel E.E.

The mechanisms that regulate the sparsity of myometrial gap junctions during pregnancy and their abundance during parturition are unknown. Prior to labor, myometrial cx43 expression is regulated in part by the steroid hormones, estrogen, and progesterone (10Claire-Wathes D.C. Porter D.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1982; 65: 497-505Google Scholar, 13Garfield R.E. Grover A.K. Daniel E.E. Calcium and Contractility: Smooth Muscle. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1985: 143Google Scholar, 16Zhao K. Kuperman L. Geimonen E. Andersen J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 607-615Google Scholar). Progesterone suppresses cx43 gene transcription and inhibits the trafficking of Cx43 protein through the Golgi apparatus (12Hendrix E.M. Mao S.J.T. Everson W. Larsen W.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 33: 27-38Google Scholar, 16Zhao K. Kuperman L. Geimonen E. Andersen J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 607-615Google Scholar). Estrogen can induce premature cx43 expression and gap junction formation in the myometrium of pregnant animals (14Garfield R.E. Sims S. Daniel E.E. Science. 1977; 198: 958-959Google Scholar, 17MacKenzie L.W. Garfield R.E. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1986; 64: 462-466Google Scholar). However, cx43 expression only remains high in estrogen-treated myometrial cells if internal uterine pressure is maintained after delivery (10Claire-Wathes D.C. Porter D.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1982; 65: 497-505Google Scholar). These data indicate that estrogen acts with a factor(s) produced through uterine distension to influence myometrial cx43 gene expression. It is plausible that such a factor or factors are bio-reactive moieties derived from phospholipid breakdown upon extension of the smooth muscle membrane. Diacylglycerol is an early product of inositol phospholipid breakdown in the cell membrane. Diacylglycerol is the major activator of protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase CTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatebpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseEREestrogen response elementPREprogesterone response elementHREhormone response elementERestrogen receptor. (18Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Google Scholar). The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also activates PKC. The PKC signal transduction cascade causes activation of cell-specific transcription factors, which in turn bind cognate sequence elements in gene promoters and modulate gene expression. Several cis-acting elements in the DNA have been identified, which regulate gene expression after activation of PKC (for review see 19Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Google Scholar). The sequence of the 5′-flanking promoter region of the human cx43 gene revealed two types of cis-acting elements associated with PKC activation, AP-1 and AP-2 sites. protein kinase C 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate base pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase estrogen response element progesterone response element hormone response element estrogen receptor. The AP-1 site is the cognate binding sequence for the Jun and Fos families of transcription factors (20Curran T. Franza Jr., B.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Google Scholar, 21Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Google Scholar). Jun and Fos, products of “immediate-early” genes, induce the expression of the “late” genes which contain AP-1 sites. C-Jun and c-Fos are the members of the families which are primarily expressed in uterine smooth muscle cells (22Stancel G.M. Boettger-Tong H. Hyder S.M. Kirkland J.L. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Khan S.A. Stancel G.M. Protooncogenes and Growth Factors in Steroid Hormone Induced Growth and Differentiation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 87Google Scholar, 23Spelsberg T.C. Subramaniam M.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 105Google Scholar). In general, activation of PKC results in increased expression of jun and fos genes and AP-1-mediated transcription is stimulated. In this report, the role of c-Jun and c-Fos in cx43 gene regulation in uterine smooth muscle was investigated using primary cultures of human uterine smooth muscle cells composed of nonpregnancy myometrial cells, as well as uterine leiomyoma cells, myometrial-like benign tumors which express many estrogen-regulated genes expressed in pregnancy myometrium (see 25Andersen J. Barbieri R.L. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1995; 2: 663-672Google Scholar for discussion). Upon culturing, nonpregnancy myometrial and leiomyoma primary cells begin to express Cx43 protein and the expression can be suppressed by progestin (16Zhao K. Kuperman L. Geimonen E. Andersen J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 607-615Google Scholar). The present study shows that TPA treatment causes the primary cells to transiently increase expression first of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins followed by increased expression of Cx43 protein. The study suggests that up-regulation of myometrial cx43 gap junction expression at the onset of labor may involve the activation of c-Fos and c-Jun through the PKC pathway. Approval to utilize human tissue was given by Stony Brook University Hospital's Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (95-1224). Human myometrial and leiomyoma tissues were obtained from surplus pieces of surgical specimens after hysterectomies. Matched myometrium and leiomyoma tissues were processed and cultured as described by Zhao et al. (16Zhao K. Kuperman L. Geimonen E. Andersen J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 607-615Google Scholar) and Andersen et al. (6Andersen J. Grine E.A. Eng C.L.-Y. Zhao K. Barbieri R.L. Chumas J. Brink P. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1993; 169: 1266-1276Google Scholar). The cultures were never passaged and were used within 2 weeks of the initial plating. The source of the tissues dictated and generally limited the number of culture dishes that could be prepared for analysis (generally 10-20 culture plates for one experiment). Twenty-four hours prior to the experiments, the culture medium was changed to serum-free, phenol red-free (26Berthois Y. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2496-2500Google Scholar) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described (27Andersen J. DyReyes V. Barbieri R.L. Coachman D. Miksicek R. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1995; 2: 542-551Google Scholar). All experiments with the primary cultures were performed using this defined serum-free medium. TPA (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA) was added to the cultures at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Control samples were treated with reagent vehicle Me2SO at 0.03% final concentration. The relative levels of Cx43, c-Fos, c-Jun, AP-2, and intermediate filament desmin proteins were measured by immunoblot analysis. Preparation of cell lysates and immunoblot analysis using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Life Science) were performed as described previously (6Andersen J. Grine E.A. Eng C.L.-Y. Zhao K. Barbieri R.L. Chumas J. Brink P. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1993; 169: 1266-1276Google Scholar, 27Andersen J. DyReyes V. Barbieri R.L. Coachman D. Miksicek R. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1995; 2: 542-551Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody used to detect Cx43 protein was purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (San Francisco, CA) and the mouse monoclonal antibody used to detect desmin intermediate filament protein (55,000 Da) was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies specific for c-Fos (SC-52), c-Jun (SC-822), and AP-2 (SC-184) proteins were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The levels of c-Jun and c-Fos were analyzed, since these forms of Fos and Jun predominate in myometrial tissue (22Stancel G.M. Boettger-Tong H. Hyder S.M. Kirkland J.L. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Khan S.A. Stancel G.M. Protooncogenes and Growth Factors in Steroid Hormone Induced Growth and Differentiation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 87Google Scholar, 23Spelsberg T.C. Subramaniam M.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 105Google Scholar). Quantitation was by densitometry of resulting autoradiographs using the Bio-Rad laser densitometer and analysis by density volume using the Molecular Analysis Program. The densities of desmin were used to normalize the values of Cx43, c-Jun, and c-Fos proteins. Restriction fragments of pGF-10 (4Fishman G.I. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Rosenthal L. Leinwand L.A. Genomics. 1991; 10: 250-256Google Scholar) were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, Inc.). The human 5′-flanking cx43 promoter was sequenced independently using an automated sequencer as well as manually using Sequenase DNA polymerase and the Sanger dideoxy method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). The two sequences were compared to each other and to the published rat cx43 promoter sequence (29Yu W. Dahl G. Werner R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1994; 255: 125-132Google Scholar) using the Hibio DNAsis Program (Hitachi Software Engineering America Ltd., Brisbane, CA). The medium of the cultures was switched to the serum-free medium 24 h before the experiment, and all experiments were done in serum-free medium as described by Zhao (16Zhao K. Kuperman L. Geimonen E. Andersen J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 607-615Google Scholar). Five 10-cm plates with confluent primary cultures were analyzed per condition. Cultures were treated with 100 ng/ml TPA or reagent vehicle for 3 h before harvesting. Slot blot filters were prepared and used in the nuclear run-on analyses as described (16Zhao K. Kuperman L. Geimonen E. Andersen J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 607-615Google Scholar) using plasmids containing the cDNAs for human cx43, rat fos, and rat gapd (see Table I). Plasmids were purified on CsCl gradients (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Open table in a new tab A 18-mer oligonucleotide (5′-TTTGGTACTTTCCTCACG-3′) was made, which is complementary to a region of cx43 mRNA within exon 1 (positions 51-69). The oligonucleotide was purified using an Applied Biosystems Oligonucleotide Purification Cartridge following the manufacturer's directions. Sixty-five pmol of the oligonucleotide were kinased with 300 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP using Escherichia coli polynucleotide kinase as described previously (27Andersen J. DyReyes V. Barbieri R.L. Coachman D. Miksicek R. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1995; 2: 542-551Google Scholar) and purified on a G-25 Sephadex spin column (Boehringer Mannheim). One pmol of the unlabeled oligonucleotide was used for the corresponding Sanger sequencing reactions using 3 μg of pGF-10, which contains the cx43 gene (32DeLeon J.R. Buttrick P.M. Fishman G.I. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1994; 26: 379-389Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from the cultured myometrial and leiomyoma cells according to the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). The transcription start was determined by the primer extension method as described (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15Google Scholar) using 20 μg of total RNA of each type. The final sequencing gel was dried onto Whatman paper and subjected to autoradiography. Mutation of an AP-1 site to 5′-TCGGCCG-3′ has been shown by others to silence the function of the site (35Umayahara Y. Kawamori R. Watada H. Imano E. Iwama N. Morishima T. Yamasaki Y. Kajimoto Y. Kamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16433-16442Google Scholar). The proximal AP-1 in the cx43 promoter was mutated using the Kunkel method (36Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar), and the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-TCCCAGTTCGGCCGGTGGCT- 3′ (changed bases are underlined). A 420-bp HindIII DNA fragment of the proximal cx43 promoter was subcloned into M13mp18 vector using standard protocols (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15Google Scholar). The protocols described by Ausubel et al. (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols In Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 8Google Scholar) were used to create the mutant AP-1 site. The HindIII fragment containing the mutant AP-1 site was subcloned into the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) vector, pCXV1-CAT3. The final mutant clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Reporter plasmids containing portions of the 5′-proximal cx43 promoter cloned upstream of the bacterial CAT gene (pBL-CAT3) were used in transient expression assays (see Table I). A cryptic AP-1 site has been reported in the backbone of such vectors (38Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Duncan K.G. Lopez G.N. Schaufele F. Uht R.M. Webb P. West B.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 405-407Google Scholar). This site was deleted by digesting pBL-CAT3 with EcoO109 and NdeI, filling-in the digested ends with Klenow enzyme, and religating (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15Google Scholar). The primary cultures were transfected with 40 μg of reporter plasmid/10-cm plate using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (27Andersen J. DyReyes V. Barbieri R.L. Coachman D. Miksicek R. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1995; 2: 542-551Google Scholar). Expression vectors for c-jun or c-fos were co-transfected with the CAT reporter plasmids at 0.5 μg/10-cm plate. Transfected cells were treated with either 100 ng/ml TPA or reagent vehicle for 48 h before obtaining cell lysates. Lysates were normalized for protein concentration and analyzed for CAT activity as described previously (27Andersen J. DyReyes V. Barbieri R.L. Coachman D. Miksicek R. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1995; 2: 542-551Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of the results was made with GraphPad's Instat computer software for small sample sets using a two-tailed Student's t test, or with GraphPad's Prism software using two way ANOVA analyses. The human cx43 gene transcription start has been determined for cardiac muscle (32DeLeon J.R. Buttrick P.M. Fishman G.I. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1994; 26: 379-389Google Scholar). To determine the human cx43 transcription start in myometrial and leiomyoma primary cells, primer extension assays were performed using total RNA purified from myometrial and leiomyoma cells. The RNAs had previously been shown to contain cx43 mRNA through Northern blot analysis (16Zhao K. Kuperman L. Geimonen E. Andersen J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 607-615Google Scholar). The size of the myometrial and leiomyoma cx43 mRNA was found to be similar to the size found in heart muscle, about 3,000 bases (16Zhao K. Kuperman L. Geimonen E. Andersen J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 607-615Google Scholar). The transcription start (Fig. 1) was found to be 2 base pairs upstream of the start in cardiac muscle (32DeLeon J.R. Buttrick P.M. Fishman G.I. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1994; 26: 379-389Google Scholar). The sequence of more than 3000 base pairs of the 5′-flanking portion of the human cx43 promoter was determined by two independent methods (see Fig. 2A). The human cx43 promoter sequence is very similar to the the rat cx43 promoter sequence (29Yu W. Dahl G. Werner R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1994; 255: 125-132Google Scholar) having a 68.6% homology. The transcription start and first exon of the gene have been marked on the sequence (Fig. 2A). Several canonical cis-acting elements are observed in the 5′-flanking sequence including two AP-1 sites (5′-TGAGTCA-3′) 44 bp and (5′-TGACTCA-3′) 1000 bp upstream of the transcription start determined for myometrial and leiomyoma cells (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2A). Several putative cis-acting elements, which may be important to PKC or steroid hormone regulation of the gene, have been marked in the sequence. Three AP-2 sites (at −93, −133, and −1499) and a trimer of SP-1 sites (40Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Google Scholar) (at −1459 to −1388) can be found upstream of the transcription start. The AP-1 and AP-2 sites in similar positions to transcription start have been noted in the rat cx43 promoter (29Yu W. Dahl G. Werner R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1994; 255: 125-132Google Scholar). No complete estrogen response elements (EREs) or progesterone response elements (PREs) could be found in the 5′-flanking region of this gene. However, the sequence contains six 5′-GGTCA (at −420, −455, −702, −2068, −2528, and −2793), which may be half-palindromic ERE sites, and a 5′-TGTTCT (at −1746) and 5′-AGAACA (at −1690), which may be half-palindromic PRE sites. Half-EREs and half-PREs have also been noted in the rat cx43 promoter sequence (29Yu W. Dahl G. Werner R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1994; 255: 125-132Google Scholar). Transcription regulated through AP-1 and AP-2 sites are induced through the PKC cascade. To investigate the role of PKC activation in the regulation of myometrial cx43 gene expression, primary human uterine smooth muscle cells were treated with the phorbol ester TPA, an activator of protein kinase C. The relative levels of Cx43, desmin, c-Fos and c-Jun proteins were then determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3). The levels of Cx43, c-Jun, and c-Fos, normalized to the intermediate filament protein desmin, gradually increase with time in the vehicle-treated cultures after the change to serum-free medium. The increase in Cx43 protein with time in serum-free medium is consistent with previous observations (16Zhao K. Kuperman L. Geimonen E. Andersen J. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 607-615Google Scholar). The reasons for these increases are presently unknown. When compared to the time control samples, the amount of Cx43 protein increased significantly in cultures treated for 6-8 h with TPA (n = 3, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1B). The increase in Cx43 protein levels followed transient increases at 2-4 h in the levels of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins, the transcription factors that bind AP-1 sites (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the cell-specific, 49.5-kDa transcription factor AP-2, which can also be induced through TPA treatment, was not detected (data not shown). Two forms of c-Jun were observed in the myometrial cells after TPA treatment: a 39-kDa form, which is a dormant form, and a slower mobility 46-kDa form, which presumably is an active form due to phosphorylation of serines 63 and 73 (39Pulverer B.J. Hughes K. Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. Leevers S.J. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 407-415Google Scholar). Both forms increased with time after TPA treatment, indicating both an increase in c-jun gene expression and activation of Jun protein. After 18 h of TPA treatment, the levels of Cx43, c-Jun, and c-Fos proteins approached the corresponding levels in the control samples without TPA (Fig. 3, B and C). These data suggest that activation of PKC in human primary myometrial cells results in increased gene expression of both c-fos and c-jun and the increased fos/jun expression is associated temporally with increased Cx43 protein levels. Cell lysates of nonpregnancy myometrial tissues from different stages of the menstrual cycle and of pregnancy myometrial tissue from a woman who had been in active full-term labor were also subjected to immunoblot analysis to test for the presence of Cx43, c-Fos, c-Jun, and AP-2 proteins. We were able to detect c-Fos in the nonpregnancy myometrial tissues (especially in tissues from estrogen-dominated follicular phase), but could not detect c-Jun, AP-2, or Cx43 proteins (data not shown). In contrast, we were able to detect Cx43, c-Fos and c-Jun (at 46 kDa) proteins in the pregnancy myometrium (Fig. 3A, lane marked P) but not AP-2. This suggests that c-Jun and c-Fos (and not AP-2) play a role in the induction of cx43 in pregnancy myometrium at term and that the same regulatory pathway is exhibited in the cultured myometrial cells. To test if the TPA-induced increases in myometrial Cx43 protein levels were the result of increased gene transcription, nuclear run-on transcription analyses were performed. Nascent radiolabeled nuclear transcripts were made from fresh nuclei isolated from primary human myometrial cells either treated with TPA or reagent vehicle, and were hybridized to specific cDNAs immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane (Fig. 4). Relative to transcription from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapd) gene, a dramatic increase in de novo transcription from the cx43 and the c-fos genes was evident in myometrial cells after 3 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 2, lane marked TPA). These data indicate that activation of PKC induces increased cx43 gene transcription in human primary myometrial cells. Transient expression assays were employed to further investigate the role of PKC induction in cx43 gene expression. The 5′-proximal region of the human cx43 promoter has the most transcriptional activity in cardiac myocytes (32DeLeon J.R. Buttrick P.M. Fishman G.I. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1994; 26: 379-389Google Scholar) and in primary uterine smooth cells (data not shown). For analysis of the most active portions of the promoter, several restriction fragments containing the 5′-proximal cx43 gene promoter were cloned into CAT reporter plasmid (see Fig. 2B) from which a reported cryptic AP-1 sequence had been removed (see “Materials and Methods”). A CAT reporter plasmid containing an 870-bp restriction fragment of the cx43 gene from the EcoRV site 700 bp upstream of transcription start to a created BglII (32DeLeon J.R. Buttrick P.M.

This portion of the promoter contains the natural transcription start, two of the half-palindromic EREs, two of the AP-2 sites, the proximal AP-1 site, and most of exon I.

We recently identified ELK expression in human renal microvascular endothelial cells and sought to identify intracellular proteins through which it signals responses. The cytoplasmic domain of ELK was used as “bait” in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interactive proteins expressed from a randomly primed embryonic murine library (E9.5-10.5). Among interactive products of 76 cDNAs characterized, 10 nonidentical, overlapping clones encoded the SH2 domain of the recently reported Grb10 adapter protein, and an additional 3 encoded Grb2. A self-phosphorylated recombinant, baculovirus-expressed GST-ELKcy fusion protein bound Grb10 and Grb2 from human renal microvascular endothelial cell extracts, while the unphosphorylated fusion form did not. Site-directed mutation identified Tyr-929 as a putative phosphorylation site required for Grb10, but not Grb2, interaction in yeast and recombinant protein assays. The ELK ligand, LERK-2/Fc, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ELK, and recruitment of Grb10 and Grb2 to endothelial ELK receptors recovered by wheat germ agglutinin lectin and immunoprecipitation. These findings define ligand-activated interaction between ELK and the SH2 domains of Grb2 and the newly identified Grb10 protein that shares homology with a Caenorhabditis elegans gene product implicated in neural cell migration.

There are now at least 13 distinct family members that are expressed in species ranging from Xenopus laevis to humans, in cell-type and tissue-restricted patterns that suggest that they signal targeting or differentiation (5Henkemeyer M.

The endothelial cell product, B61, is the ligand for the Eck receptor and mediates tumor necrosis factor α-induced angiogenesis (3Pandey A. Shao H. Marks R.M. Polverini P.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1995; 268: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We recently identified expression of a second Eph family receptor, ELK, in vascular endothelial cells. Originally cloned from a rat brain cDNA library, ELK is also expressed in testis, fetal kidney, and skeletal muscle (7Tang X.X. Biegel J.A. Nycum L.M. Yoshioka A. Brodeur G.M. Pleasure D.E.

Available data show that natively expressed Eph-related receptors, including ELK, Mek4, and Eck, do not signal proliferative responses upon ligand binding (3Pandey A. Shao H. Marks R.M.

Because it mediates nonproliferative signals in microvascular endothelial cells, we were motivated to identify the intracellular interactive proteins through which ELK signals, anticipating that these ELK-interactive proteins may discriminate proliferative from nonproliferative responses. To this end, we utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify protein partners that interact with the ELK cytoplasmic domain (ELKcy). 3The abbreviations used are: ELKcycytoplasmic domain of HuELKI (amino acids 566-984)HREMChuman renal microvascular endothelial cellsPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferaseELKcyΔCtermCOOH-terminal domain deletion of ELKcy (retaining amino acids 566-883)ELKcyΔJMjuxtamembrane deletion of ELKcy (retaining amino acids 618-984)ELKcyK652Rsite-directed mutant substituting lysine at position 652 with arginineELKcyY929Fsite-directed mutant substituting tyrosine at position 929 with phenylalanineLERK-2/Fca fusion protein including the extracellular domain of LERK-2 and IgG1 Fc domainORF/Fca fusion protein including an irrelevant open reading frame and the IgG1 Fc domainEIPELK-interactive proteinPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

Fusion plasmids were constructed to permit shuttling of ELK-encoding inserts from the baculovirus expression vector pAC-GST to the yeast two-hybrid “bait” LexA fusion plasmid pBTM116. Parent sequences were derived from the predominant human ELK cDNA recovered from a human renal microvascular endothelial cell library (HRMEC) (HuELKI), and amino acid designations refer to that sequence.1 The pAC-GST/ELKcy plasmid was constructed by PCR/ligation-independent cloning (LIC) (13Haun R.S. Serventi I.M. Moss J. Biotechniques. 1992; 13: 515-518PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gruenwald S. Singh S. in PharMingen Research Products Catalog. San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar) to place a HuELKI cDNA fragment encoding the complete cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 566-984) in frame and downstream of GST-encoding sequences (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). To permit insert “shuttling,” an in-frame 5′ SmaI site and a customized SalI site 3′ of translation termination codons were placed in positions flanking ELK cytoplasmic domain coding sequences by PCR amplification, using oligonucleotides containing the PCR/ligation-independent cloning sequence, a SmaI site, and HuELKI cDNA sequences (underlined) representing ELKcy sequences (oligonucleotide 1, 5′ primer: (5′-CTG GTT CCG GCG ATC CCG GGG AGG AAA CGG GCT TAT AGC-3′) and oligonucleotide 2, 3′primer: (5′-CTC GCT CCG GCG AGG TCG ACGTCA TGC CAT TGC CGT TGG-3′)). PCR product was gel purified and ligated into pAC-GST-LIC (PharMingen). Constructs encoding regional domain deletions of the ELK cytoplasmic domain as GST fusions were generated in a similar manner and include: 1) the catalytic domain construct, pAC-GST/ELKcyΔJM/Cterm (HuELKI amino acids 618-883); 2) pAC-GST-ELKcyΔCterm (amino acids 566-883); and 3) pAC-GST-ELKcyΔJM (amino acids 618-984). The LexA-ELKcy bait plasmids were constructed by digesting the respective pAC-GST-ELKcy plasmids with SmaI and SalI, recovering ELKcy fragments, and subcloning them into SmaI-SalI-digested pBTM116 vector (15Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids drive expression of the indicated cytoplasmic domains of HuELKI as LexA fusion proteins, under control of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase promotor. Overlap extension PCR was used to generate a kinase-inactivating ELKcy mutation (K652R) by the method of Ho et al. (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6765) Google Scholar). Overlapping oligonucleotides encoding the mutation (5′-CTT CAG GGT CCT GAT GGC CAC GTA-3′ and 5′-GTG GCC ATC AGG ACC GTG AAG GCA-3′) were used to generate 5′- and 3′-overlapping PCR products that were reannealed, PCR amplified, and digested with BglII and Bsu36I. The recovered fragment was cloned into the BglII-Bsu36I-digested pAC-GST-ELKcy to generate pAC-GST/ELKcy(K652R). pAC-GST-ELKcyY929F was generated as described above, using oligonucleotide 1 (above) and a specific 3′-primer encoding the mutation (5′-GAA GCT GTT CCT GAA CTG GAC CAT TTT-3′) to generate a PCR product overlapping that generated using the 5′-primer (5′-AAA ATG GTC CAG TTC AGG AAC AGC TTC-3′) and oligonucleotide 2 (see above). Overlap-extended PCR-amplified products were digested with EspI-SalI and subcloned into EspI-SalI-digested pAC-GST-ELKcy. Products were confirmed by sequence analysis, and the SmaI-SalI fragments of ELKcyK652R and ELKcyY929F were substituted for the SmaI-SalI fragment of ELKcy pBTM116-ELKcy to generate pBTM116-ELKcyK652R and pBTM116-ELKcyY929F. Sf9 cells were grown as monolayers in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 27°C. HRMECs were cultured as described previously (17Wojta J. Hoover R.L. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2846-2852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genotype of the S. cerevisiae reporter strain L40 is MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ (15Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown at 30°C in YPAD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-Peptone, 2% dextrose, 1 mg/ml adenine) or in synthetic medium with the appropriate supplements (18Rose M.S. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The yeast reporter strain L40, containing the reporter genes lacZ and HIS3 downstream of a LexA promoter, was sequentially transformed with the pLexA-ELKcy (or derivative) plasmids, then with a cDNA library encoding VP16 (transcription activation domain) fusions with peptide sequences expressed in murine embryos (E9.5-10.5), using the lithium acetate method (19Hill J. Donald K.A. Griffins D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 20Schiestl R.H. Giest R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). The library used was size selected (350-700 nucleotides) and random-primed to permit unweighted representation of NH2- and COOH-terminal domains and to permit recovery of independent clones of overlapping, but nonidentical sequences as independent confirmation of significant interactions. An estimated 2 × 107 yeast transformants were grown for 4 h at 30°C in synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan to maintain selection for the ELKcy bait and the cDNA library plasmids, respectively; transformants were then plated on synthetic medium lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan, uracil, and lysine; supplemented with 1.5 m 3-aminotriazole; and incubated at 30°C for 3 days (18Rose M.S. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Selected yeast clones (HIS+) were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (lacZ+), and yeast DNA was prepared from the His+/lacZ+ colonies. Putative ELK-interactive protein (EIP) “prey” cDNAs were recovered by electroporation of yeast DNA into competent HB101 Escherichia coli (21Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., (1994) E. coli Pulser Transformation Apparatus, Hercules, CA.Google Scholar, 22Ward A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and tested to exclude nonspecific transactivation independent of the pBTM116-ELKcy bait by cotransfection with pBTM116 (no insert) and with pLexA-Lamin (15Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). Putative EIP cDNAs surviving this exclusion were sequenced, and the identity of each cDNA sequence was ascertained using the BLAST search engine (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68105) Google Scholar). Individual recombinant Baculovirus stocks were generated by cotransfecting a monolayer of Sf9 cells with a recombinant pAC-GST-ELK fusion construct and BaculoGold Baculovirus DNA (PharMingen) according the manufacture's protocol (24Gruenwald S. Singh S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedure and Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar). Five days after transfection, supernatants were collected and subjected to two rounds of amplification (P1 lysate). For affinity binding assays, a monolayer of Sf9 cells was infected with the P1 lysate, and 3 days later, cells were lysed in triple detergent lysis buffer (50 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 m NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 m PMSF, 2 mg/ml aprotonin) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation; the precleared lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) washed twice with lysis buffer, followed by two washes with in vitro kinase buffer (20 m HEPES, 20 m MnCl2, 150 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 m PMSF) at 4°C. As indicated in the legend to Fig. 3, glutathione-agarose beads were incubated in the presence or absence of 30 μ ATP for 30 min at 30°C (25Kumjian D.A. Wahl M.I. Rhee S.G. Daniel T.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8232-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of HRMECs (∼5 × 106 cells/P100) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 m PMSF and then incubated for 20 min on ice with 3 ml of buffer D (50 m Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 300 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 m PMSF). Lysates were cleared of particulate by centrifugation at 4°C and incubated overnight at 4°C with ∼50 μg of glutathione-agarose-immobilized (phosphorylated or unphosphorylated) GST/ELKcy, GST/ELKcyΔJM, or GST/ELKcyY929F fusion proteins, as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. Immobilized GST/fusion protein complexes were washed three times with buffer D, omitting bovine albumin from the last wash. Bound proteins were resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and detected by Western blot analysis using the ECL system (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL). Plates of 90-100% confluent HRMECs were washed and then incubated in OPTI-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 0.5 m sodium suramin (Calbiochem) for 16 h to dissociate any endogenous ligand from ELK receptors. For 60 min prior to stimulation, 10 μ sodium o-vanadate was added to the medium. Cells were washed and then exposed for 10 min at 37°C to 500 ng/ml of highly purified Fc fusion forms of either the best characterized ligand for ELK receptors, LERK-2/Fc (10Beckmann M.P.

Cells were lysed in buffer WG (Triticum vulgaris-lectin purification), containing 50 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 m NaCl, 5 m EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 m sodium o-vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 m PMSF; lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated at 4°C with agarose-conjugated lectin from T. vulgaris (Sigma). Agarose beads were washed repeatedly, and specifically adsorbed proteins were eluted in buffer WG containing 3 m N′,N”,N‴-triacetylchitotriose (Sigma), as described. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, cells were lysed in buffer D, containing 20 m HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 m NaF, 1 m sodium o-vanadate, 1 m PMSF, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin; clarified by centrifugation; incubated with indicated antibodies for 16-18 h at 4°C; recovered; and then washed extensively on protein A-Sepharose beads. Eluates or immunoprecipitates were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and Western blots were incubated with previously characterized rabbit antisera containing antibodies against the extracellular domain of rat ELK (10Beckmann M.P.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar), the murine monoclonal antibodies against Grb2 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). To identify EIPs expressed in an embryonic (E9.5-10.5) murine library (15Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar), we utilized a yeast two-hybrid system. The yeast reporter strain L40 was initially transformed with the pLexA-ELKcy sequences encoding the entire ELK cytoplasmic domain (ELKcy-bait) protein fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (LexBD). We determined that this bait did not transactivate and express the HIS3 gene product in the presence of 1.5 m 3-aminotriazole (data not shown). On the basis of our previous observation that ELK is expressed in E9.5 murine embyros,2 we screened a murine embryonic library (E9.5-10.5) for EIPs, anticipating that developmental expression of EIPs would coincide with ELK expression. Yeast from a single transfected colony carrying the bait were selected on Trp− plates, made competent, and then cotransfected with the E9.5-10.5 embryonic murine cDNA library encoding potential prey products as fusion proteins with the VP16 transcription activation domain (Fig. 1). Formation of a complex between LexA-ELKcy and VP16-EIPs should confer histidine auxotrophy and β-galactosidase activity. Among ∼2 × 107 yeast transformants screened, 320 colonies grew on His− plates; among these, 290 displayed β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid DNA was prepared from 80 of the colonies surviving both selections, and of these, 4 were shown to transactivate as cotransfectants with either pLexA-Lamin fusion protein or pBTM116 alone. The remaining 76 were subjected to sequence analysis. Among these 76 potential EIPs, multiple distinct cDNAs encoding at least 19 different previously described proteins and 3 novel proteins were identified. 4E. Stein and T. O. Daniel, manuscript in preparation. Among the most frequently represented cDNA sequences recovered in this screen were those encoding SH2 domains of Grb10 (10 independent clones) and Grb2 (3 independent clones). Fig. 1B depicts the comparative positions of the peptides encoded by the partial cDNA sequences compared with the parent proteins. To determine whether the ELKcy interactions with Grb10 and Grb2 require ELK self-phosphorylation, we inactivated the tyrosine kinase of the ELKcy fusion proteins by site-directed mutagenesis of the ATP-binding lysine (K652R). Fig. 2 shows that the kinase-inactive form of the ELKcy bait does not support interaction with Grb10 or Grb2 SH2 domain interactors. This finding implies that tyrosine phosphorylation of the ELKcy domain plays a critical role in its interaction with Grb10 and Grb2, as is predicted by the phosphotyrosine-binding function of SH2 domains (28Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). To identify protein domains through which ELKcy interacts with Grb10 and Grb2, we examined their interactions with truncations of the original ELKcy bait that deleted the juxtamembrane domain (pLexA-ELKcyΔJM), the COOH-terminal domain (pLexA-ELKcyΔCterm), or both (pLexA-ELKcyΔJM/Cterm), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The catalytic domain was retained in each of these constructs to facilitate the tyrosine self-phosphorylation required to provide phosphotyrosine-containing SH2 binding sites. We found that while Grb2 retained interaction with the isolated ELKcy tyrosine kinase catalytic domain (pLexA-ELKcyΔJM/Cterm) (not shown here), Grb10 interaction required that ELKcy constructs retain the COOH-terminal domain (amino acids 883-984). This finding indicates that the sites of ELK interaction with Grb10 and Grb2 are distinct. Because data were not available to define SH2 binding consensus sites for Grb10, we proceeded with site-directed mutation of the single tyrosine residue in this COOH-terminal domain (Tyr-929). This single substitution disrupted the two-hybrid interaction of ELKcy with the Grb10 SH2 domain represented in EIP 23 (Fig. 1B) (data not shown), providing evidence that phosphorylated Tyr-929 is part of the binding domain with which Grb10 interacts. We used an in vitro affinity binding assay to verify that ELKcy is capable of binding endogenous endothelial Grb10 and Grb2 proteins, depending upon its state of tyrosine phosphorylation. GST fusion forms of ELKcy, GST/ELKcy, GST/ELKcyΔJM, and GST/ELKcyY929F were generated in an insect expression system (see “Experimental Procedures”), bound to GSH-agarose beads, and incubated in kinase buffer in the presence (or absence) of ATP to determine if self-phosphorylation was required for binding. Incubation with ATP was required for tyrosine phosphorylation of recombinant, baculovirus-expressed proteins under these conditions (data not shown). Each of the GST/ELKcy fusion proteins were then incubated with HRMEC (endothelial) lysates, and washed extensively in high salt (300 m NaCl) buffer. In Fig. 3, Western analysis of proteins adsorbed to each immobilized ELKcy fusion protein evaluated binding of endogenous Grb10 and Grb2. Grb2 bound each of the tyrosine self-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain ELK fusions but did not bind the unphosphorylated fusions. While Grb10 bound phosphorylated fusions including the full cytoplasmic domain (ELKcy) and one lacking the juxtamembrane domain (ELKcyΔJM), it failed to bind the fusion containing the point mutation, Y929F (Fig. 3). This finding defines the site through which Grb10 interacts with ELK (Tyr-929) as distinct from that mediating ELK-Grb2 association. These data do not exclude the possibility that these interactions involve participation of other proteins that bridge between ELK and Grb2 or Grb10. However, that bridging function must be conferred by constitutively expressed yeast proteins to support the two hybrid interactions that we identified. While these data show that in vitro phosphorylated ELK has the capacity to interact with endothelial Grb10 and Grb2, biologically significant interactions should be promoted by ligand activation of endogenous ELK receptors in intact cells. To explore this issue, we exposed HRMEC to the ELK ligand, LERK-2/Fc, or an irrelevant open reading frame Fc fusion, ORF/Fc, and recovered ELK receptors by lectin affinity chromatography (Fig. 4A) or immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4A, LERK-2/Fc-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a wheat germ agglutinin-lectin-recovered protein that comigrated with ELK receptors identified by Western analysis (Fig. 4A, upper panels); increased amounts of Grb2 and Grb10 immunoreactive proteins were recovered in the wheat germ agglutinin-agarose eluate from LERK-2/Fc-stimulated cells, compared with cells exposed ORF/Fc at the same concentration. To confirm that ELK receptors form coprecipitable complexes with Grb2 and Grb10 following ligand activation, we immunoprecipitated ELK receptors from cells exposed to either ORF/Fc or the ELK ligand, LERK-2/Fc, and analyzed immunoprecipitates for coprecipitating Grb2 and Grb10. In Fig. 4B (left), ELK immunoprecipitates recovered immunoreactive Grb2 (23 kDa) following stimulation of cells with LERK-2/Fc, but not ORF/Fc. The prominent, nonspecific 25-kDa band in each lane represents the immunoglobin light chain of the precipitating anti-ELK or preimmune antibodies. In parallel (Fig. 4B, right), ELK antisera coprecipitated Grb10-immunoreactive material from LERK-2/Fc-, but not ORF/Fc-, stimulated cells. Again, the common, 50-kDa band at the bottom of the figure represents precipitating immunoglobin heavy chain. The multiple forms of immunoreactive Grb10 protein, ranging in size from 65 to 80 kDa, were recovered in ELK immunoprecipitates from LERK-2/Fc-, but not ORF/Fc-, stimulated cells. These multiple Grb10 forms represent proteins generated in transfected cells through use of alternative translation start sites and modified by phosphorylation (27Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings identify two previously described proteins, Grb2 and Grb10, as interactive partners that bind to ligand-activated, self-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain sequences of ELK. This screen yielded multiple independent, but overlapping, clones that encode the SH2 domains of both Grb10 and Grb2; in aggregate, these clones account for some 20% of recovered sequences. We surmise this reflects some preference for high affinity ELKcy interaction with these particular SH2 domain-containing proteins, among many expressed in this library. This prediction was supported by independent demonstration that recombinant GST/ELKcy binds Grb10 and Grb2 in crude endothelial lysates (Fig. 3). Further, we showed that ELK ligand stimulates ELK tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of Grb10 and Grb2 to copurify with ELK recovered by either a wheat germ agglutinin-lectin-binding step or immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). Interactive properties of ELKcy subdomain deletions were evaluated in both two-hybrid (data not shown) and direct binding assays (Fig. 3). Although both Grb10 and Grb2 required that ELK kinase catalyze phosphorylation of intrinsic tyrosine residues, the Grb10 interaction required an intact COOH-terminal domain that is not required for the Grb2 interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis of Y929, the only tyrosine residue in this domain, eliminated both the two hybrid interaction between ELKcy and Grb10 (not shown), and binding of endothelial Grb10 to the GST fusion protein, GST/ELKcyY929F (Fig. 3). In aggregate, these data provide strong support for ligand-coupled assembly of complexes that associate tyrosine-phosphorylated ELK with Grb10 and Grb2 at independent sites of interaction. The cytoplasmic domain of ELK includes 17 tyrosine residues, 14 of which are represented at analogous sites in other Eph family kinases. Moreover, ELK shares striking sequence identity with mammalian Eck, Erk, and Ehk, as representatives of other family members. Of the 428 ELK cytoplasmic amino acids, 202 are identical among these receptors, and 79 are conserved. To date, information about intracellular proteins that mediate responses to Eph family receptors has been limited to data on Eck interactive proteins (29Pandey A. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. Dixit V.M.

More recently, they identified a novel c-src homologous protein they named SLAP as an interactive protein that binds Eck on ligand activation, similar to the PI3K findings (30Pandey A. Duan H. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19201-19204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Among the 76 sequenced EIP clones that we have evaluated to date, we did not recover either phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or SLAP. This may reflect differences in expression of these and other transcripts in the two cDNA libraries that were screened; however, it appears more likely that sequence differences or tyrosine phosphorylation sites within cytoplasmic domain sequences of ELK and Eck define distinct SH2 recognition domains. ELK lacks a consensus sequence for binding the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit (Y-hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic), while Eck and Ehk both have these motifs (28Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

The Grb2 protein has been assigned important roles in signaling cell proliferation through the p21-RAS pathway as an adapter molecule binding activated platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and other receptors directly (31Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 4: 25-30Crossref Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, Grb2 has also been recognized to participate in nerve growth factor-mediated differentiation of PC12 cells, where nerve growth factor receptor activation promotes assembly of SHC-Grb2-SOS complexes (32Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 33Buday L. Downward J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We have ascertained that ELK receptor activation does not stimulate proliferation of the microvascular endothelial cells used in this study (data not shown). In this context, it appears that Grb2 binding to ELK is likely to signal nonproliferative downstream responses, such as cell-cell aggregation behavior. Grb10 is a recently identified adapter protein family member with high level sequence similarity to Grb7, a known interacter with HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptors (27Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Grb10 and Grb7 share COOH-terminal SH2 domains and a central domain of ∼350 amino acids that is encoded by the C. elegans gene, F10E9.6 (27Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). That locus is mutated in mig-10 worms and is implicated in their defects in embryonic neural migration. 5J. Manser, unpublished results. At present, it is attractive to speculate that Grb10, through its interaction with ELK, may participate similarly in neural cell targeting during embryonic mammalian central nervous system development, because ELK is highly expressed in human fetal brain (7Tang X.X. Biegel J.A. Nycum L.M. Yoshioka A. Brodeur G.M. Pleasure D.E. Ikegaki N. Genomics. 1995; 29: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Grb10 participation in endothelial cell migration and targeting mediated through ELK activation is now accessible for study, using this cultured microvascular endothelial system. Previous data have identified interactions between Grb10 and c-ret, a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in renal and enteric neuron development, thyroid papillary carcinomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia (types 2A and 2B) (35Pandey A. Duan H. Di Fiore P.P. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21461-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, sufficient data are not yet available to identify the sequence preferences for Grb10 SH2 domains. Comparison of the primary amino acid sequences surrounding the putative Tyr-929 binding site in ELK to those surrounding cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of c-ret do not yet readily identify a consensus for Grb10 SH2 interaction (data not shown). Nevertheless, our data using ELKcy deletion and site-directed mutation constructs (Fig. 3) lead us to conclude that Tyr-929 is the site for phosphorylation-dependent binding of ELK to the Grb10 SH2 domain. Although tyrosine residues are conserved at that position among multiple Eph family receptors, including Eck, only 4 of 12 residues adjacent to Tyr-929 are shared betweeen ELK and Eck. Eck has been shown not to bind Grb10 under conditions where the c-ret kinase does (35Pandey A. Duan H. Di Fiore P.P. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21461-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These limited findings suggest that, although receptors of the Eph family share striking cytoplasmic domain sequence identity, significant differences in coupled responses may be expected as individual receptors interact with distinct intracellular signaling partners.

Chem. 271, 20524-20530), we demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of glucokinase but not hexokinase I has a potent enhancing effect on glycogen synthesis in primary hepatocytes. In an effort to understand the underlying mechanism of this differential effect of the two hexokinase isoforms, we have investigated changes in key intracellular metabolites and the activation state of glycogen synthase in cells treated with recombinant adenoviruses expressing the liver isoform of glucokinase (AdCMV-GKL) or hexokinase I (AdCMV-HKI). Glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) levels are elevated from approximately 1.5 nmol/mg protein to 8-10 nmol/mg protein in both AdCMV-GKL- and AdCMV-HKI-treated hepatocytes as glucose is raised from 1 to 5 mM, levels four times higher than those in untreated cells. In AdCMV-GKL-treated cells, Glu-6-P continues to accumulate at glucose levels greater than 5 mM, reaching a maximum of 120 nmol/mg protein in cells incubated at 25 mM glucose, a value 10 and 50 times greater than the maximal levels achieved in AdCMV-HKI-treated and untreated cells, respectively. In parallel with the changes observed in Glu-6-P levels, increases in UDP-Glc in AdCMV-HKI- and AdCMV-GKL-treated cells were most pronounced at low (1-5 mM) and high (25 mM) glucose levels, respectively. Despite the significant increases in Glu-6-P and UDP-Glc achieved in AdCMV-HKI-treated cells, only AdCMV-GKL-treated cells exhibited increases in glycogen synthase activity ratio and translocation of the enzyme from a soluble to a particulate form relative to untreated control cells. We conclude that Glu-6-P produced by overexpressed glucokinase is glycogenic because it effectively promotes activation of glycogen synthase.

Mutation of the “Barbie box,” a putative phenobarbital-responsive element (He, J.-S., and Fulco, A. J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7864-7869) in the CYP2B1 proximal promoter did not reduce the relative response to phenobarbital. These results demonstrate that direct injection of DNA into rat liver may be used to assay phenobarbital responsiveness of cytochrome P450 genes. In this system, a distal CYP2B2 element mediates a response to phenobarbital, and proximal elements, including the Barbie box, are not required for the induction. The induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes by phenobarbital (PB) 1The abbreviations used are: PBphenobarbitalP450cytochrome P450CYPP450 geneBTEbasal transcription elementC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer binding proteinbpbase pairskbkilobase pairsPCRpolymerase chain reactionPBREphenobarbital-responsive element. was reported almost 40 years ago (1Remmer H. Naturwissenshaften. 1958; 45: 189Google Scholar). Cytochromes P450 are the primary enzymes responsible for phase I metabolism of drugs, and PB has been shown to increase the amounts of P450 enzyme and mRNA by stimulation of gene expression (2Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-592Google Scholar). PB-responsive P450 genes have been isolated and characterized, but progress in determining the molecular mechanism by which this drug activates gene expression has been impeded by the lack of a continuous cell line that is competent for PB induction. Transcription in cell-free systems of a CYP2B1/2 mini-gene containing 179 bp of the 5′-flanking region was induced in liver extracts from PB-treated rats (3Upadhya P. Rao M.V. Venkateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 557-562Google Scholar, 4Ram N. Rao M.V. Prabhu L. Nirodi C.S. Sultana S. Vatsala P.G. Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 39-45Google Scholar), and this same sequence responded to PB when introduced into rat liver cells in vivo as a complex with asialoglycoproteins (5Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Sultana N. Vatsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9628-9632Google Scholar). PB-dependent changes in binding of nuclear proteins to proximal elements have been detected by gel shift and DNase I footprinting assays and have led to a model in which positive and negative regulatory elements are involved in the PB response (5Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Sultana N. Vatsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9628-9632Google Scholar). In other studies, a sequence motif was identified as a PB-response element (“Barbie box”) in CYP genes in Bacillus megaterium, and similar motifs were found in other PB-responsive genes in several species including the proximal promoter of mammalian CYP2B1/2 and CYP2C1 (6He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7864-7869Google Scholar, 7Lubet R.A. Dragnev K.H. Chauhan D.P. Nims R.W. Diwan B.A. Ward J.M. Jones C.R. Rice J.M. Miller M.S. Biochem.

Mutation of a Barbie box in the rat α1-acid glycoprotein promoter eliminated a 1.6-fold induction by PB in transfected hepatocytes in primary culture (9Fournier T. Mejdoubi N. Lapoumeroulie C.

In contrast to these studies implicating a proximal promoter sequence as a PB-responsive element, other studies have suggested that elements 5′ distal to the promoter mediate PB induction. A distal enhancer-like element in the chick CYP2H1 gene was reported to mediate PB induction of a heterologous promoter in primary cultures of chicken hepatocytes (10Hahn C.N. Hansen A.J. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17031-17039Google Scholar). Transgenes in mice, which contained the CYP2B2 gene with 800 bp of 5′-flanking region including the proximal promoter elements discussed above, were expressed constitutively at high levels and were not induced by PB, while expression of transgenes containing 19 kb of 5′-flanking region was dependent on PB treatment (11Ramsden R. Sommer K.M. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21722-21726Google Scholar). Consistent with this result a CYP2B2 sequence from −2318 to −2155 was shown to mediate PB induction in primary rat hepatocyte cultures with its homologous promoter and a heterologous promoter (12Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar). In studies on the mouse Cyp2b10 gene, deletion of sequences from −1404 to −971 resulted in elimination of a 2-3-fold response to PB in transfected primary hepatocytes (13Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Interestingly, this region in Cyp2b10 is highly similar to the corresponding region in CYP2B2, but the constructions of the CYP2B2 promoter in which the −2318 to −2155 region were deleted, but the sequences similar to the −1404 to −971 region in the mouse gene were retained, were not induced by PB in transfected primary hepatocytes (12Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar). These results indicate that the proximal promoter alone in CYP2B genes is not sufficient for PB induction, but that distal elements are also required. We now report that direct injection of DNA into rat liver is an effective in situ transient transfection method to assay CYP promoter activity. The distal PBRE reported by Trottier et al. (12Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar) mediates PB responsiveness in this system and mutation of proximal promoter elements, including the Barbie box, does not eliminate the response. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380A DNA synthesizer at the Biotechnology Center of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: 2B2PBRE-A, 5′-CGGAATTCGTGATGTTCAGCCAATGCCTTTCTGG3′; 2B2PBRE-B, 5′-CGGGATCCGTCTGCATGGAATGCACCTCATGTC-3′; 2C1-257, 5′-CCGGGATCCAAATCCAGGTG-3′; BBM1, 5′-CCGGGATCCGGTAAGGGAATGAGGAGTGAATAGTACTGTCAGGAGG-3′; BBM2, 5′-CCGGGATCCGGTAAGGGAATGAGGAGTGAATAGCTGGGACAGGAGG-3′; and 2BA, 5′-CCGGGGAAGCTTGCTCTCCAGCAGG-3′. Construction of pC1-272LUC (14Chen D. Park Y. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 771-779Google Scholar) and pB1-110LUC (15Park Y. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 693-701Google Scholar) have been described. A fragment of CYP2B2 from −2343 to −2095 was isolated by PCR using rat genomic DNA with 2B2PBRE-A as a 5′-primer and 2B2PBRE-B as a 3′-primer and cloned into EcoRI/BamHI-digested pTZ18R (16Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Google Scholar) to produce pTZ-PBRE. The sequence of the Sau3AI fragment from −2318 to −2155 of CYP2B2 (designated PBRE) differed from the published sequence only by having 3 rather than 4 Ts at −2226, but the published numbering is used in this report (17Hoffmann M. Mager W.H. Scholte B.J. Civil A. Planta R.J. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 353-363Google Scholar). To construct hybrid plasmids of PBRE and CYP2C1 or CYP2B1 5′-flanking regions, the −272 to 1 CYP2C1 and the −110 to 1 CYP2B1 fragments were first excised from pC1-2000LUC (18Venepally P. Chen D. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17333-17338Google Scholar) and pB1-110LUC by BamHI and HindIII digestion and cloned into pTZ18R to produce pTZC1-271 and pTZB1-110. The EcoRI-BamHI CYP2B2 fragment from pTZ-PBRE was isolated and digested with Sau3AI. The resulting Sau3AI fragment was ligated to itself for 1 h, then to BamHI-digested pTZC1-272. Orientation of single, double, and triple copies of the PBRE in pTZC1-272 was identified by sequencing. The hybrid PBRE-C1-272 fragments were excised by digestion with SmaI and HindIII and inserted into the promoterless luciferase vector pA3LUC (19Maxwell I.H. Harrison G.H. Wood W.M. Maxwell F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 276-280Google Scholar) digested with the same enzymes. Single and triple copies of the PBRE in the natural orientation in these CYP2C1 constructions were amplified by PCR using a T7 promoter primer and primer 2C1-257. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into EcoRI/BamHI-digested wild type pTZB1-110 or its BTE and C/EBP mutations (15Park Y. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 693-701Google Scholar). For insertion of a double copy of the PBRE into pTZB1-110, the double copy was amplified as above from a CYP2C1 construction; however, the orientation of the copies in the CYP2C1 construction was reversed. To obtain the proper orientation, the EcoRI/BamHI-digested PCR product was inserted into EcoRI/BamHI-digested pTZ18R, reexcised by digestion with SmaI and HincII, and cloned into the SmaI site of pTZB1-110. The correct orientation was confirmed by sequencing. The Barbie box was mutated by PCR using BBM1 or BBM2 as a 5′-primer, 2BA as a 3′-primer, and pB1-110LUC as a template. Mutated PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII, inserted into pTZ18R to form pTZBBM1 amd pTZBBM2, and three copies of the PBRE were inserted into these vectors as described above for pTZB1-110. The PBRE and CYP2B1 hybrid sequences were excised from the pTZ18R vector with SmaI and HindIII and inserted into pA3LUC digested with the same enzymes. Direct hepatic injections of DNA were performed as described by Malone et al. (20Malone R.W. Hickman M.A. Lehmann-Bruinsma K. Sih T.R. Walzem R. Carlson D.M. Powell J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29903-29907Google Scholar) with minor modifications. DNA of plasmids containing the CYP promoter-luciferase genes was purified by centrifugation twice in CsCl gradients, followed by dialysis against 1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-350 g were anesthetized with ether by inhalation, and a single liver lobe was pulled out through a ventral midline incision. DNA from CYP2B1 (350 μg) or CYP2C1 (400 μg) promoter constructions in 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were injected into three different spots of a single liver lobe with a 25-gauge (null)/5;8-inch needle. One mg of dexamethasone/kg was injected subcutaneously 24 h before surgery as an anti-inflammatory agent that increases expression of the injected gene (20Malone R.W. Hickman M.A. Lehmann-Bruinsma K. Sih T.R. Walzem R. Carlson D.M. Powell J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29903-29907Google Scholar). Shortly after rats recovered from surgery, 1 mg of dexamethasone/kg, subcutaneously, and either saline or 100 mg of PB/kg, intraperitoneally, were injected. Rats were sacrificed 24 h later to obtain liver tissues for luciferase assay. Luciferase assays were performed as described with minor modifications (21Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122Google Scholar). Rats were killed by ether or CO2 overexposure, and liver tissue containing the sites of injection was excised, minced, and homogenized in 1.5 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl sulfate, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin in a Dounce tissue grinder with 20 strokes with a tight pestle. The homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Supernatants were then transferred to fresh 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and 0.1 ml was used for each luciferase assay. A background of 300 arbitrary light units, observed in liver extracts after pA3LUC injection, was subtracted, and total activity was determined based on the total volume of the supernatant. Statistical significance between the untreated and PB-treated samples was tested by one-tailed Student's t test. Injection of DNA of chimeric genes containing −3500 (data not shown) or −272 bp of CYP2C1 5′-flanking region fused to a luciferase reporter gene into rat liver resulted in a low level of expression of luciferase about 2-fold greater than that in liver injected with pA3LUC, a promoterless vector (Fig. 1A). Treatment of rats with 100 mg of PB/kg for 24 h before sacrifice did not increase activity for the CYP2C1 construction. To determine if the CYP2B2 sequence from −2318 to −2155 (PBRE) (12Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar) could confer PB responsiveness to the CYP2C1 promoter, a single copy or three copies of this sequence were inserted 5′ of the CYP2C1 promoter. Insertion of the PBRE had little effect on CYP2C1 promoter activity in untreated rats, but activity was increased about 5- and 15-fold over controls by PB treatment for the constructions containing single and triple copies of the sequence, respectively. To confirm the role of the PBRE in PB induction, single, double, or triple copies of the sequence were also inserted before the −110 to 1 CYP2B1 minimal promoter. The −110 promoter sequence, without the trimer inserted, was about 5-fold more active than the −272 CYP2C1 promoter. Insertion of the PBRE sequences had little effect on promoter activity in untreated animals, but activity was increased by treatment with PB about 2.5-fold for the single copy and 4-5-fold for the double and triple copies (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the PBRE sequence is either a PB-responsive enhancer or that it is a general enhancer which increases basal and PB-dependent transcription mediated by elements in the proximal promoter. To examine the role of the proximal promoter elements in the responsiveness to PB, mutations in the BTE-like motif, the C/EBP element, and the Barbie box sequence were introduced in the context of the −110 to 1 CYP2B1 promoter with the PBRE trimer inserted to the 5′ side (Fig. 2). These mutations in the BTE and C/EBP elements each inhibit CYP2B1 promoter activity by about 70% in transfected HepG2 cells (15Park Y. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 693-701Google Scholar). The mutations in the Barbie box include the core sequence, AAAG, which is highly conserved in this proposed PB-responsive element (8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Google Scholar). Mutation of the BTE-like element resulted in about a 65% reduction in activity in untreated animals (Fig. 1B). Activity was increased about 3-fold by treatment with PB, which is similar to the increase observed with the wild-type −110 to +1 promoter. Mutation of the C/EBP element resulted in a decrease of about 80% in untreated animals, and treatment with PB increased activity about 4-fold, again similar to induction of the wild-type promoter. The BTE-like element and the C/EBP element, therefore, function as PB-independent positive regulators of CYP2B1 promoter activity. Similar PB responsiveness was observed when the Barbie box sequence was mutated. The activity of the BBM1 mutated promoter in the untreated animals was increased about 2-fold (Fig. 1B). However, treatment with PB again increased activity about 5-fold, indicating that the Barbie box sequence was not required for PB responsiveness. The increased activity in the untreated animal suggested that this region might have a modest negative regulatory activity; however, it is also possible that the increase was due to the unintentional creation of a positive regulatory element by the mutation. A second mutation was constructed in this region (BBM2) which gave similar results, although the variability in the experiment was larger than normally observed, and the difference between the PB-treated and untreated groups was not statistically significant in this one case (Fig. 1B). The similar results with two mutations indicate that the small increase in activity is due to the mutated Barbie box and not to inadvertent creation of a new positive regulatory site. The continued PB response with each of the BTE, C/EBP, and Barbie box mutations suggests that the PBRE is a PB-dependent enhancer and not a general enhancer dependent on proximal promoter elements for PB responsiveness. A major impediment to analysis of the genetic mechanisms involved in the PB induction of cytochrome P450 and other drug-metabolizing enzymes has been the lack of a continuous cell culture model system in which promoter activity could be assayed. Primary cultures of hepatocytes (12Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar, 13Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar), cell-free transcription (3Upadhya P. Rao M.V. Venkateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 557-562Google Scholar, 4Ram N.

Fernandez L.M. Ciaramella G. Phillips I.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 793-804Google Scholar), and targeting to the liver of DNA complexed to asialoglycoproteins (5Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Sultana N. Vatsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9628-9632Google Scholar) have been reported as methods in which PB responsiveness is retained. These methods are relatively complex, and the responsiveness in cell-free systems has been very modest compared to the induction observed in vivo. DNA injected directly into rat liver has been shown to be taken up by hepatocytes and expressed (20Malone R.W. Hickman M.A. Lehmann-Bruinsma K. Sih T.R. Walzem R. Carlson D.M. Powell J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29903-29907Google Scholar), and as reported here, is a relatively simple, reproducible method for analysis of PB responsiveness of CYP genes. With the luciferase reporter, results can be obtained less than 2 days after the injection of the DNA, and the range of variability is usually about 2-fold, so that changes of 4-15-fold as observed here are easily detected with small numbers of animals in each treatment group. There are two shortcomings of this system at present. The uptake and expression of DNA is inefficient so that 300-500 μg must be injected in each liver. The low efficiency has precluded the used of an internal standard to allow normalization of the efficiency of uptake and expression of the injected DNA, since only the luciferase assay has sufficient sensitivity for detection. Sensitive chemiluminescent assays of β-galactosidase (24Bronstein I. Fortin J. Stanley P.E. Steward G.S. Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 169-181Google Scholar) may provide a second reporter that could be used for normalization, and this possibility is being examined. The second disadvantage is that dexamethasone treatment is required to increase the efficiency of expression of the injected genes by the liver (20Malone R.W. Hickman M.A. Lehmann-Bruinsma K. Sih T.R. Walzem R. Carlson D.M. Powell J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29903-29907Google Scholar), which might alter the response to other ligands, such as PB. Even with these disadvantages, the simplicity and speed of the assay should permit rapid identification of the elements required for PB induction in CYP and other drug metabolizing enzyme genes. These in situ transfection experiments provide strong support for the role in PB-dependent gene expression of the distal PBRE identified by transfections of primary hepatocyte cultures (12Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar) and are consistent with CYP2B2 transgenic studies (11Ramsden R. Sommer K.M. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21722-21726Google Scholar) which indicated that sequences distal to −800 were required for PB induction. Induction of up to 15-fold with triple copies of the PBRE and 2.5-fold with single copies of the PBRE were observed which are less than the 20-100-fold increases of mRNA levels observed for CYP2B2 and CYP2B1 in vivo (25Adesnik M. Bar-Nun S. Maschio F.M. Zunich M. Lippman A. Bard E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10340-10345Google Scholar, 26Phillips I.R. Shephard E.A. Ashworth A. Rabin B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 24: 41-52Google Scholar, 27Gonzalez F.J. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5962-5968Google Scholar). The low induction may be due to the relatively high expression observed in the injected liver in untreated animals, particularly for CYP2B1, since expression of this gene in vivo is not detectable in untreated animals (28Omiecinski C.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1525-1539Google Scholar). Sequences which mediate the inhibition in vivo might be missing from the constructions or normal chromatin structure may be required for the suppression which is lacking in genes transiently transfected. The PBRE was able to confer PB induction on minimal promoters of its homologous gene as well as a heterologous gene, CYP2C1, as assayed by injection in situ. In primary hepatocyte cultures, this sequence conferred PB responsiveness to the heterologous herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene (12Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar). In the hepatic direct injection assay, like the primary hepatocyte culture (12Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar), the induction was orientation-independent (data not shown), and induction was proportional to increased copies of the PBRE, characteristics common to enhancer sequences. The ability of this element to confer PB responsiveness to heterologous promoters and the continued responsiveness when proximal promoter sequences are mutated establish that this upstream enhancer-like element is a PB-responsive element. The demonstration that this distal region is hypersensitive to DNase I treatment of intact chromatin and that the relative sensitivity is altered by PB treatment provide further support for the regulatory role of this region (29Luc P.V. Adesnik M. Ganguly S. Shaw P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 345-356Google Scholar). In contrast to the distal elements, the in situ transfection experiments do not provide support for a role of the proximal promoter region of CYP2B1 and CYP2C1 in PB induction. It has been suggested that upstream elements might be nonspecific enhancers, with PB regulation exerted at the proximal promoter region (5Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Sultana N. Vatsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9628-9632Google Scholar). However, in the absence of the PBRE, promoter fragments from −3500 to +1 (data not shown), −272 to +1 for CYP2C1, −1400 to +1 (data not shown), and −110 to +1 for CYP2B1 did not exhibit any positive response to PB treatment. Likewise, PB induction was not observed in transfected primary hepatocytes which contained CYP2B2 promoter fragments from −2015 or −1680 to 1 (12Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar). Further, mutation of the known positive regulatory elements in the CYP2B1 promoter (15Park Y. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 693-701Google Scholar) and the proposed PB-responsive element, Barbie box (8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Google Scholar), did not substantially alter the relative induction by PB. Mutation of the BTE and the C/EBP reduced activity 65 and 80%, respectively, in untreated animals, which is similar to the reduction in activity of 70-75% observed for these mutations in HepG2 cells (15Park Y. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 693-701Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Barbie box mutations increased activity 2-3-fold, suggesting that this element might have modest negative regulatory activity. Studies with the mouse Cyp2b10 gene, which is 83% similar in the 5′-flanking region to CYP2B1, transfected in primary hepatocytes, also indicated that distal elements mediate PB induction (13Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). In this mouse gene the Barbie box is split by a 42-bp insertion, and this lack of motif conservation suggests that the Barbie box sequence is not a common PB element in P450 genes. It is possible that PB responsiveness of proximal elements is not detected in the in situ assays either because the assay is not sensitive enough or because of the conditions of the assay compared to other assays. In some cell-free studies, PB responsiveness was modest (17Hoffmann M. Mager W.H. Scholte B.J. Civil A. Planta R.J. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 353-363Google Scholar), less than 2-fold, and this level of induction might be difficult to detect in the in situ injection assay in which induction mediated by the PBRE was considerably less than induction of CYP2B1 in vivo. However, 8-fold and higher induction with only 179 nucleotides of CYP2B2 5′-flanking region was observed in other cell-free studies and when DNA was targeted to the liver as a complex with asialoglycoproteins (3Upadhya P. Rao M.V. Venkateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 557-562Google Scholar, 5Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Sultana N. Vatsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N.

A second caveat is that dexamethasone treatment is required for successful in situ transfection, and dexamethasone has been reported to both increase or decrease PB induction of P450 genes (2Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-592Google Scholar). Dexamethasone has been reported to reduce PB induction mediated by the 179-bp CYP2B1 promoter fragment (4Ram N. Rao M.V. Prabhu L. Nirodi C.S. Sultana S. Vatsala P.G. Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 39-45Google Scholar, 30Rao M.V. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5617-5622Google Scholar). Earlier studies (30Rao M.V. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5617-5622Google Scholar) used doses of dexamethasone 10-50-fold higher than the 1 mg/kg used in these in situ injection experiments, but the more recent studies (4Ram N. Rao M.V. Prabhu L. Nirodi C.S. Sultana S. Vatsala P.G. Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 39-45Google Scholar) reported partial inhibition of PB induction by 0.1 mg of dexamethasone/kg. However, in transgenic mice, dexamethasone is not required, and therefore the lack of PB responsiveness of CYP2B2 transgenes containing 800 bp of 5′-flanking sequence (11Ramsden R. Sommer K.M. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21722-21726Google Scholar) argues against dexamethasone masking of PB-proximal elements as an explanation for their lack of PB responsiveness in the in situ injection assay. The data with the in situ injection assay show that the proximal elements are not required for the PB induction mediated by the distal elements and are most consistent with a major role for the 5′ distal PBRE as a PB-response element and a modest role, if any, for proximal promoter sequences. We thank Siqing Liu for assistance in the assay of the CYP2C1 construction with a single copy of the PBRE inserted."

We have shown previously that the dbl oncogene product, which represents a prototype for a family of growth regulatory proteins, activates Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins by catalyzing the dissociation of GDP from their nucleotide binding site. In the present study, we demonstrate that the acidic phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), provides an alternative mechanism for the activation of Cdc42Hs.

Unlike the Dbl oncoprotein, which requires the presence of (free) guanine nucleotide in the medium to replace the GDP bound to Cdc42Hs, PIP2 stimulates GDP release from Cdc42Hs in the absence of free guanine nucleotide. PIP2, when incorporated into phosphatidylcholine carrier vesicles, binds tightly to the guanine nucleotide-depleted form of Cdc42Hs and weakly to the GDP-bound form of the GTP-binding protein but does not bind to GTP-bound Cdc42Hs, similar to what was observed for the Dbl oncoprotein. However, mutational analysis of Cdc42Hs indicates that the site that is essential for the functional interaction between PIP2 and Cdc42Hs is distinct from the Dbl-binding site and is located at the positively charged carboxyl-terminal end of the GTP-binding protein.

The Rho subfamily of Ras-related GTP-binding proteins, which includes RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs, has been shown to regulate a diversity of cellular functions ranging from actin-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements (11Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Google Scholar) to the stimulation of nuclear mitogen-activated protein kinases (9Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T.

Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Google Scholar). It is now well established that Rac1 is essential for growth factor-stimulated membrane ruffling and lamellipodia formation (35Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar) and acts downstream from Ras in the stimulation of cell growth (Qui et al., 1995), whereas RhoA controls the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes (36Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnson C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar). Cdc42 has been shown to be essential for bud-site assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Johnson D.I. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 143-152Google Scholar), for unidirectional and bidirectional cell growth in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (27Miller P.J. Johnson D.I. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Google Scholar). The macromolecular targets for the Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins are just now beginning to be identified. Both GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42Hs bind to the Mr 85,000 regulatory subunit (p85) of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (45Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Google Scholar; 42Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Google Scholar), to the p70 S6 kinase (7Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 575-583Google Scholar, and to members of the p21-activated serine/threonine kinase (PAK) family (23Manser E. Leung T. Salihiddin H. Zhao J.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Google Scholar; 24Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Google Scholar; Bagrodia et al., 1995). The GTP-bound form of RhoA also has been reported to stimulate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in platelets (43Zhang J. King W.G. Dillon S. Hall A. Feig L. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22251-22254Google Scholar) as well as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase activity (6Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Google Scholar). In addition, it recently has been shown that RhoA and Cdc42Hs can act synergistically with Arf to stimulate phospholipase D activity (39Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Bokoch G.M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14944-14950Google Scholar). Understanding how these different target activities are stimulated and then integrated to yield cytoskeletal changes and nuclear activities represents a formidable challenge. One approach is to determine how Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins are activated, since this should represent the first key step in stimulating their target activities. One mode of activation of Rho-subtype GTP-binding proteins occurs through the stimulation of GDP dissociation (and consequently GTP/GDP exchange) by the family of Dbl-related proteins. The prototype for this family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEFnucleotide exchange factorPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateGSTglutathione S-transferaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)PCphosphatidylcholine. is the Dbl oncoprotein, which was shown to act as a GEF for Cdc42Hs and RhoA (13Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Google Scholar; 14Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar). At present, 15 members of the Dbl-related family have been identified and characterized (5Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar), with each member containing the characteristic Dbl homology domain in tandem with a Pleckstrin homology domain. Many of these proteins have been shown to have GEF activity including Cdc24 (46Zheng Y. Cerione R.A. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Google Scholar), Ost (17Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Google Scholar), Tiam-1 (25Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G.

Similar to the case for the interactions between heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) and agonist-stimulated heptahelical receptors (10Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar), the Dbl-related GEFs bind preferentially to and stabilize the guanine nucleotide-depleted states of Rho-like GTP-binding proteins. nucleotide exchange factor phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate glutathione S-transferase guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) phosphatidylcholine. It is interesting that many of these Dbl-related proteins show a selective tissue distribution, whereas many of the Rho-subtype proteins (e.g. Cdc42Hs, RhoA, and Rac1) appear to be ubiquitous. This suggests that additional but as yet undiscovered Dbl-related proteins exist and/or that other mechanisms may be used to stimulate the activation of Rho-subtype GTP-binding proteins. In the present study, we describe one such potential alternative mechanism where the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is able to strongly stimulate GDP dissociation from Cdc42Hs and RhoA. The small GTP-binding proteins Cdc42Hs, RhoA, Rac1, and Ha-Ras were expressed and purified as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins from Escherichia coli as described previously (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the K-Ras protein and Ras-GRF were kind gifts from Dr. Larry Feig (Tufts Medical School) and were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins. The Rap1a protein was obtained from Dr. P. Polakis (Onyx Pharmaceutical, Emoryville, CA). The cDNA encoding Ran was the generous gift of Dr. M. Rush (New York University Medical Center, New York, NY). To express Ran in E. coli as a GST fusion protein, restriction sites for NcoI and HindIII were introduced immediately adjacent to the initiation and termination codons, respectively, using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product (730 base pairs) was then ligated with NcoI/HindIII-digested pGEX-KG (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the resultant GST-Ran fusion protein was purified from transformed E. coli (JM101). Automated DNA sequencing revealed no mutations in the polymerase chain reaction product. The anti-Cdc42Hs polyclonal antibodies were raised against the unique carboxyl-terminal sequences of Cdc42Hs as described (37Shinjo K. Koland J.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V. Johnson D. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Google Scholar). GST-Dbl protein was expressed in a baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar), and the Cdc42Hs-GTPase-activating protein was expressed and purified from E. coli (2Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.-J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26059-26062Google Scholar). The ΔC7 Cdc42Hs truncation mutant was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the plaque-forming unit DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and the resulting sequences were verified through fluorescence automated sequencing. Lipids were purchased either from Sigma or from Avanti Polar Lipids. All lipids were dissolved in chloroform, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended by sonication in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) immediately prior to use. The pH was adjusted as necessary with NaOH. Radioisotope-labeled guanine nucleotides were obtained from DuPont NEN. GDP dissociation and GTP/GDP exchange assays were carried out as described previously (13Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Google Scholar). Two μg of Cdc42Hs loaded with [3H]GDP was incubated with buffer mixtures containing 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mM MgCl2 (buffer A) with various lipids or Dbl proteins for the indicated times at room temperature. Assays monitoring the dissociation of GDP were stopped by dilution (20-μl aliquots) into 10-ml ice-cold buffer A, and the protein-bound nucleotide was trapped by filtration on nitrocellulose filters. For GTP/GDP exchange assays, 1 mM GTP was also included in the reaction buffer. Assays monitoring the dissociation of GTPγS from Cdc42Hs were performed as described above for GDP, except that [35S]GTPγS was used, and the concentration of Cdc42Hs-GTPγS was ∼0.4 μM. GTPγS binding was determined as in 13Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Google Scholar. Two μg of GDP-bound Cdc42Hs were incubated in buffers containing 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 μM [35S]GTPγS (∼5000 cpm/pmol), and 100 μM PIP2, 0.5 μM GST-Dbl, or 100 μM phosphatidylcholine (PC) at 24°C, and binding was determined at various time points. Direct binding of liposome vesicles containing PIP2 to Cdc42Hs was carried out by adapting the centrifugation protocol by 12Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Google Scholar. Briefly, Cdc42Hs was first loaded with GDP or GTPγS or depleted with nucleotide (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar). One μg of Cdc42Hs was then added to lipid vesicles (100 μl of total volume) with 500 μM carrier PC alone or 100 μM PIP2 incorporated into the PC carrier vesicles through co-sonication. The mixture was incubated for 5 min before centrifugation in an ultraspeed Beckman airfuge (100,000 × g) for 30 min. The vesicles pelleted with this treatment were subjected to SDS-polyacylamide gel electrophoresis and anti-Cdc42Hs Western blot analysis, and the blot was visualized by the ECL method (DuPont NEN). The mode of regulation of Rho family GTP-binding proteins has been an area of intense research investigation (4Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Google Scholar) due to the involvement of these GTP-binding proteins in the stimulation of cytoskeletal changes and transcriptional activities as well as in the regulation of cell growth. In addition to protein factors that directly stimulate the guanine nucleotide exchange activities of Rho-subtype GTP-binding proteins, for which the Dbl oncoprotein is a prototype (5Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar), various phospholipids have been implicated in the regulation of the Rac GTP-binding proteins through their effects on the GDP dissociation inhibitor molecule (8Chuang T.-H. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26206-26211Google Scholar). In addition, the GTP-binding protein Arf, which undergoes GDP dissociation in response to PIP2, appears to act synergistically with Rho-subtype proteins to stimulate (in a PIP2-sensitive manner) phospholipase D activity (; 22Malcolm, K. C., Ross, A. H., Qiu, R.-G., Symons, M., Exton, J. H., (1994) 269, 25951-25954.Google Scholar; 39Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Bokoch G.M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14944-14950Google Scholar; 29Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Google Scholar). The latter finding is particularly interesting since we recently have found that Cdc42Hs is predominantly localized to Golgi membranes in mammalian cells and that its localization is influenced by different Arf mutants in a manner suggesting some type of interplay between Arf and Cdc42Hs. 2Erickson, J. W., Zhang, C.-J., Kahn, R. A., Evans, T., and Cerione, R. A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, in press. Given these findings, we examined whether various phospholipids had any effect on the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle of Cdc42Hs. Fig. 1A shows the results obtained when examining the effects of a panel of phospholipids on the rate of [3H]GDP dissociation from Cdc42Hs. Only PIP2 showed a significant stimulation of GDP dissociation from Cdc42Hs. Essentially no effect was observed when phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidylinositol were incubated with [3H]GDP-bound Cdc42Hs. We also have not detected any effects with inositol trisphosphate under conditions where PIP2 strongly stimulates [3H]GDP dissociation; however, PIP, at concentrations >500 μM, caused a slight increase in the rate of [3H]GDP dissociation (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows that the PIP2-stimulated dissociation of GDP from Cdc42Hs is dose-dependent, with a half-maximal effect occurring at ∼50 μM PIP2. At PIP2 levels ≥200 μM, the rate of GDP release from Cdc42Hs was increased ∼10 fold. The stimulation of GDP dissociation by PIP2 was similar to that elicited by the oncogenic Dbl protein (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows time courses for the dissociation of [3H]GDP from Cdc42Hs in the absence of activators or in the presence of the Dbl oncoprotein (∼0.5 μM) or PIP2 (100 μM). In these experiments, the dissociation of GDP was assayed in the presence of 1 mM GTP in the medium. Under these conditions, the half-time for [3H]GDP dissociation from Cdc42Hs (in the presence of phosphatidylcholine as a control) was ∼25 min, whereas Dbl-catalyzed GDP dissociation occurred with a half-time of ∼1.5 min, and PIP2-stimulated GDP dissociation occurred with a half-time of ∼2.5 min. It is interesting that when GDP dissociation was assayed in the absence of medium GTP, dramatic differences were observed between Dbl and PIP2 (Fig. 2B). Specifically, PIP2 was still capable of providing a strong stimulation of the initial rate of [3H]GDP dissociation, whereas oncogenic Dbl failed to induce any detectable stimulatory effect. These findings can be considered within the context of the generally accepted model for the interactions of guanine nucleotides and GEFs with GTP-binding proteins. It typically has been assumed that GEFs act as antagonists of guanine nucleotide binding and that conversely, nucleotide binding weakens the interactions of GEFs with GTP-binding proteins. Thus, although Dbl weakens the affinity of GDP for Cdc42Hs, the amount of GDP present (i.e. initially bound to Cdc42Hs) is sufficient to maintain occupancy of the nucleotide site, even in the presence of this GEF. However, when a high excess of GTP is included in the medium, it effectively competes with GDP for the nucleotide site, thereby resulting in Dbl-catalyzed GTP-GDP exchange. This differs from the case for PIP2, where this putative GEF is apparently more effective than Dbl in weakening the affinity of Cdc42Hs for guanine nucleotides. PIP2 strongly stabilizes the guanine nucleotide-depleted state of Cdc42Hs; thus, it is difficult to observe a PIP2-stimulated exchange of GDP for [35S]GTPγS. In fact, under conditions where Dbl is able to elicit a strong stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding (when [GTPγS] = 0.5-1 μM), the addition of PIP2 shows no detectable stimulation of GTPγS binding (Fig. 2C). In addition, although PIP2 is more effective than Dbl in weakening the binding of guanine nucleotides to Cdc42Hs, it appears that guanine nucleotides also weaken the binding of PIP2 to a greater extent than the binding of Dbl. Thus, although Dbl shows a weak but measurable stimulation of [35S]GTPγS dissociation from Cdc42Hs, the addition of PIP2 (at 50-100 μM) has no effect (data not shown). Taken together, the results presented in Fig. 2 would suggest that PIP2 is capable of a direct interaction with Cdc42Hs and that this interaction is significantly influenced by the guanine nucleotide bound to the GTP-binding protein. Fig. 3 shows the results of such a direct binding experiment, using PC vesicles containing PIP2. In this experiment, PC vesicles alone and PC vesicles containing PIP2 were first incubated with Cdc42Hs, either in the guanine nucleotide-depleted state or in the GDP-bound state or the GTPγS-bound state, for 10 min at room temperature before pelleting the lipid vesicles by ultracentrifugation. Western blotting the pelleted vesicles with a specific anti-Cdc42Hs antibody revealed that Cdc42Hs, depleted of bound guanine nucleotide, was capable of tightly associating with the PC/PIP2 vesicles, whereas Cdc42Hs containing bound GDP was capable of a weaker association with these vesicles. The GTPγS-bound Cdc42Hs showed no ability to associate with the PC/PIP2 vesicles (i.e. relative to the background association observed with control PC vesicles). Thus, PIP2 shows the same pattern of association with different guanine nucleotide-bound forms of Cdc42Hs as originally observed for the Dbl oncoprotein (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar). It had been earlier reported that PIP2 was able to stimulate the dissociation of [3H]GDP from the Arf GTP-binding proteins (41Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Google Scholar). Given our findings with Cdc42Hs, we were interested in determining whether PIP2 might serve as a potential activator of other GTP-binding proteins, and in particular, other members of the Rho subfamily. As shown in Fig. 4, we found that PIP2 was most effective on Cdc42Hs and RhoA, stimulating the dissociation of greater than 80% of the total bound [3H]GDP within 5 min at room temperature. PIP2 also was able to stimulate GDP dissociation from Rac1 (∼50% of the total bound [3H]GDP was dissociated after 5 min) but showed no ability to stimulate GDP dissociation from the Ha-Ras, Rap1a, or Ran GTP-binding proteins (Fig. 4), even when using PIP2 levels as high as 0.5 mM. We also have found that PIP2 will not stimulate [3H]GDP dissociation from the K-Ras protein, under conditions where the Ras-GRF (38Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Google Scholar) has a stimulatory effect (data not shown). The ability of PIP2 to regulate nucleotide binding to Rho subfamily proteins, as well as Arf, and to directly associate with Cdc42Hs (see Fig. 3) suggested that the Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins must contain a specific PIP2-binding site. Sequence comparisons between Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins and two PIP2-binding proteins, Gelsolin and Villin, indicated that the carboxyl-terminal domains of Cdc42Hs, RhoA, and the Rac proteins, which contain a number of basic amino acids, shared homology with amino acid residues 140-147 of Villin and 150-169 of Gelsolin. These regions of Villin and Gelsolin have been implicated in the binding of these proteins to PIP2 (19Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Google Scholar). Thus, we constructed a deletion mutant of Cdc42Hs that lacked the carboxyl-terminal seven amino acids (including two arginines that were suspected to be involved in PIP2 binding). This truncated Cdc42Hs molecule behaves like wild-type Cdc42Hs with regard to its intrinsic GTP-binding and GTPase activities and its ability to functionally couple to the Cdc42Hs-GTPase-activating protein (data not shown). Although it undergoes a slower rate of [3H]GDP dissociation, compared to wild-type Cdc42Hs, it is still capable of interacting with Dbl and undergoing Dbl-catalyzed GDP dissociation (Fig. 5). However, the carboxyl-terminal truncated Cdc42Hs shows a markedly reduced response to PIP2. These results then strongly argue that although Dbl and PIP2 elicit similar effects (i.e. stimulation of GDP dissociation), they mediate these common effects from distinct binding domains on the GTP-binding protein. In addition to serving as a precursor for the second messengers IP3 and diacylglycerol (3Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Google Scholar) and for the putative messenger PIP3 (40Stephens L. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Google Scholar), PIP2 has been implicated as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, based on its ability to influence actin severing, capping, and bundling proteins in vitro (18Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting that in the present studies, we find that PIP2 binds directly to and influences the nucleotide state of GTP-binding proteins that have been implicated in cytoskeletal regulation, i.e. Cdc42Hs and RhoA. However, these findings raise a number of important issues. One has to do with the mechanism by which PIP2 stimulates GDP dissociation and how this compares with the mechanism by which Dbl stimulates GDP dissociation and guanine nucleotide exchange. Certainly the rate-limiting step in the activation of GTP-binding proteins, which occurs as an outcome of the exchange of GTP for bound GDP, is the dissociation of the tightly bound GDP molecule. Both Dbl and PIP2 strongly catalyze this dissociation event and stabilize the nucleotide-depleted state of the GTP-binding protein. Our data, in fact, would suggest that PIP2 does this even more effectively than Dbl, such that PIP2 can stimulate GDP dissociation from the nucleotide binding site of Cdc42Hs in the absence of added GTP, whereas Dbl cannot. It is possible that the differences exhibited by PIP2 and Dbl reflect differences in the sites on Cdc42Hs (or related proteins) that bind these agents. At the present time, we know very little about the specific sites on Cdc42Hs that are responsible for binding Dbl, although mutations in Cdc42Hs that correspond to mutations in Ras that uncouple its binding to the GEF Sos (30Mosteller R.D. Han J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1104-1112Google Scholar) do not uncouple Cdc42Hs from Dbl. 3Y. Zheng, unpublished results. We would speculate at this point that a key conformational change that is necessary to loosen the binding of GDP to Cdc42Hs is induced by both Dbl and PIP2 from distinct (binding) sites on the Cdc42Hs molecule. Future studies will be aimed at obtaining additional information regarding the conformational change in Cdc42Hs and related Rho subfamily proteins that is necessary for this rate-limiting step for activation. A second key issue raised by these studies concerns whether, in fact, PIP2 acts as a physiological regulator of Cdc42Hs and related proteins, and if so, how? It is tempting to speculate that the actin-regulatory activities of PIP2 are related to the actions of Cdc42Hs and RhoA in mediating cytoskeletal changes such as filopodia formation and/or actin stress fiber formation. This is a particularly interesting possibility given the suggestions that a cascade of Rho subfamily GTPases (i.e. Cdc42Hs, Rac1, and RhoA) is operating in the regulation of cytoskeletal changes in certain cells (32Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Google Scholar) and that a putative target for Cdc42Hs, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (45Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Google Scholar), which generates phosphatidylinositol compounds phosphorylated at the 3 position, may be upstream from Rac1 (15Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Google Scholar; 31Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to Dbl-related proteins, it is possible that phosphatidylinositol metabolites might serve as direct regulators of a signaling cascade that lead to changes in the actin cytoskeleton. It also is possible that phosphatidylinositol compounds work together (cooperatively) with Dbl-related proteins to activate GTP-binding proteins. We have not detected any type of cooperativity between oncogenic Dbl and PIP2 in the stimulation of GDP dissociation from Cdc42Hs (data not shown). However, in some cases, Dbl-related proteins have been shown to bind to Rac without stimulating GDP dissociation (26Miki T. Smith C.L. Long J.E. Eva A. Fleming T.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Google Scholar; 17Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Google Scholar), and in other cases, the presence of Dbl homology domains within proteins (e.g. the Ras-GEFs, Sos and Ras-GRF) have not yet been assigned a function (38Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Google Scholar). Thus, it will be interesting to see if phosphatidylinositol compounds exert some type of regulatory or cooperative effect on the functions of these Dbl-related proteins. Finally, studies with purified phospholipase D indicate that the maximum activation of at least one isoform of the enzyme requires PIP2, and the synergistic actions of the Arf GTP-binding protein (which also binds and is regulated by PIP2 (Terui et al., 1995)) and either RhoA or Cdc42Hs (39Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Bokoch G.M. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14944-14950Google Scholar). In the future, we intend to examine these possibilities further as well as determine just how PIP2 levels in cells might be coordinated with the activation-deactivation cycle of Cdc42Hs and/or RhoA. For example, it is possible that signaling pathways that lead to an increase in PIP2 levels will also promote the generation of guanine nucleotide-depleted Cdc42Hs and/or RhoA. Situations which then lead to a decrease in PIP2 levels (e.g. stimulation of the hydrolysis of PIP2 by phospholipase C enzymes) would then enable cellular GTP to bind to these GTP-binding proteins, thereby stimulating their activation. However, it also is possible that at the cellular levels of GTP (>10 μM), the exchange of GDP for GTP can occur even in the presence of high concentrations of PIP2. Thus far, it has been difficult to test these levels of GTP in conventional GTP-binding assays; however, we hope in the future to be able to use fluorescence spectroscopic approaches to determine if, in fact, such a PIP2-stimulated nucleotide exchange reaction is feasible.

Similarly, dominant negative mutants of p21ras, c-Raf, MEK, and the MAP kinases act to block the ability of NGF to produce the morphological differentiation of PC12 cells into a neuronal phenotype (20Wood T.

There is evidence that NGF treatment of PC12 cells results in the phosphorylation and activation of c-Raf; however, overexpression of an activated form of c-Raf failed to stimulate the activity of the MAP kinases (20Wood T.

NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. The medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM 24 h before treatment. After appropriate treatments with growth factors, the cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mM NaF, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 nM okadaic acid, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin).

PC12 cells were incubated for 5 min with NGF then B-Raf and c-Raf were immunoprecipitated from soluble lysates. The activity of the enzymes was measured by the phosphorylation of recombinant MEK. NGF dramatically stimulated the activity of B-Raf; however, we were unable to detect significant levels of activity associated with the c-Raf immunoprecipitates when assayed under identical conditions (Fig. 1).

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1867-1873PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to independently evaluate the effect of NGF on the phosphorylation level of B-Raf and c-Raf. PC12 cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi, and c-Raf and B-Raf were immunoprecipitated from the same lysates following 5 min of NGF treatment (Fig. 2). NGF stimulated the phosphorylation of B-Raf with the appearance of B-Raf species exhibiting a lower electrophoretic mobility. Similarly, the phosphorylation of c-Raf was significantly stimulated; however, the relative amount of radiolabeled phosphate associated with c-Raf was significantly less than that of B-Raf. These data demonstrate that both c-Raf and B-Raf are phosphorylated in response to NGF treatment and that our failure to detect c-Raf activity was not due to the inability of c-Raf to undergo ligand-stimulated phosphorylation. We also detected a 90-kDa band corresponding to HSP90 in NGF-stimulated B-Raf immunoprecipitates, which was subsequently confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). HSP90 was not found to be present in c-Raf immunoprecipitates performed under identical conditions. We initiated studies to investigate the basis of the differential coupling of these two Raf family members to the MAP kinase cascade. We have previously discovered that B-Raf, isolated from PC12 cells, eluted from gel filtration columns with a much greater apparent molecular mass than expected from the size of the 95-kDa primary translation product (23Jaiswal R. Moodie S. Wolfman A. Landreth G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting it was a component of a larger complex. Soluble lysates from NGF-stimulated PC12 cells were fractionated by chromatography on a Mono Q column. Fractions containing B-Raf and c-Raf were identified by Western analysis. The B-Raf- and c-Raf-containing fractions were then independently pooled, applied to a Superose 12 gel filtration column, and the resulting column fractions were analyzed for their ability to activate the MAP kinase cascade using a coupled assay (Fig. 3, A and B) and by Western analysis (Fig. 3, C and D). B-Raf eluted from the gel filtration column with an apparent molecular mass > 300 kDa (Fig. 3, A and C). Importantly, HSP90 was detected within the same fractions and coeluted with B-Raf. Identical results were obtained when untreated PC12 cells were analyzed (data not shown), indicating that B-Raf and HSP90 complexes normally exist in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). To verify that the HSP90 present in these fractions was associated with B-Raf, the Superose 12 fractions containing B-Raf were immunoprecipitated with anti-B-Raf antibodies and blots then probed using antibodies to B-Raf and HSP90 (Fig. 3E). These data demonstrate that HSP90 was quantitatively removed from the fractions following immunoprecipitation with B-Raf antisera. Identical studies were performed with c-Raf. c-Raf eluted from the gel filtration column at a position consistent with its molecular mass of 70 kDa (Fig. 3, B and D). The c-raf containing fractions obtained from the Mono Q column contain high levels of HSP90, as these two proteins have elution profiles which overlap extensively. However, upon gel filtration HSP90 eluted from the Superose 12 column in a position consistent with the molecular mass of the dimeric HSP90 species and distinct from that of c-Raf (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that c-Raf does not stabily associate with HSP90. The 14-3-3 protein eluted from the Mono Q column in fractions that extensively overlapped that of c-Raf (data not shown). Upon gel filtration chromatography 14-3-3 eluted at a position consistent with the molecular mass of the dimeric species. We did not detect the association of 14-3-3 protein with B-Raf under these conditions (Fig. 3C).Fig. 4HSP90 is associated in a complex with B-Raf but not c-Raf. PC12 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of NGF for 5 min. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with B-Raf antisera, c-Raf antisera, and preimmune sera. HSP90 was immunoprecipitated from control PC12 cells. Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblots probed with antibodies to HSP90 (A), B-Raf (B), and c-Raf (C). D, lysates were prepared from NIH3T3 cells stimulated for 5 min with 50 ng/ml EGF. C-Raf was immunoprecipitated using c-Raf antiserum, and the resulting blot was probed with anti HSP90 antibodies (lane 1) or c-Raf antiserum (lane 3). A recombinant HSP90 standard (lane 2) was included as a positive control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The avidity and specificity of the association of B-Raf with HSP90 was investigated by performing immunoprecipitations under stringent conditions. PC12 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of NGF for 5 min and soluble lysates of the cells subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies to B-Raf and c-Raf. The immunoprecipitates were washed in a buffer containing the ionic detergents SDS and deoxycholate. Western analysis revealed that the antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated B-Raf (Fig. 4B) and c-Raf (Fig. 4C); however, HSP90 was found to be associated only with B-Raf (Fig. 4A). These findings are consistent with the detection of HSP90 in immunoprecipitates of B-Raf, but not c-Raf in metabolically labeled PC12 cells (Fig. 2). We performed control experiments to verify that we could efficiently detect c-Raf·HSP90 complexes In NIH3T3 cells c-Raf activates the MAP kinase cascade in response to EGF. Immunoprecipitation of c-Raf from EGF-treated 3T3 cells, under conditions identical to those used in PC12 cells, revealed the presence of HSP90 in the immune complexes (Fig. 4D). These data demonstrate that in PC12 cells only B-Raf forms a stable association with HSP90, and the ability to form such complexes is correlated with the capacity of B-Raf, but not c-Raf to activate the MAP kinase cascade. Moreover, these complexes are found at equivalent levels in both untreated and NGF-treated cells, indicating that they normally exist as preformed complexes in the cytoplasm We have demonstrated that NGF stimulated the phosphorylation of B-Raf, which was correlated with the activation of the enzyme. NGF also stimulated the phosphorylation of c-Raf, resulting in decrease in electrophoretic mobility; however in contrast to B-Raf, c-Raf exhibited little enzymatic activity. These data indicate that the phosphorylation state of c-Raf is not reflective of its level of enzymatic activation, consistent with previous observations (34Samuels M. Weber M. Bishop M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 35McDonald S. Crews C. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R. Erikson R. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6615-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). There are a number of reports documenting the NGF-mediated activation of c-Raf (6Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Peraldi P. Frodin M. Barnier J. Callejz C. Scimeca J. Filloux C. Calothy G. Van Obberghen E.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1867-1873PubMed Google Scholar); however, a direct comparison of the relative activities of B-Raf and c-Raf reveal that c-Raf activity is quite low relative to B-Raf. These data are consistent with a previous report, which estimated c-Raf could account for only approximately 5% of MEK kinase activity detected in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells (33Zheng C. Ohmichi M. Saltiel A. Guan K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5595-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously in PC12 cells that c-Raf is capable of interacting with p21ras, thus its inability to drive the MAP kinase cascade is not a consequence of its failure to interact with its upstream regulator (23Jaiswal R. Moodie S. Wolfman A. Landreth G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings raise the question of how the cell is able to selectively employ only one Raf isoform to activate the MAP kinase cascade and thus functionally segregate the activities of these two highly related enzymes. The ability of B-Raf to participate in high molecular mass complexes, which include HSP90, is correlated with the capacity of this protein kinase to activate the MAP kinase cascade. Importantly, in PC12 cells c-Raf is not found to be stably associated with HSP90 or other molecules. This finding is of particular interest as Raf-1 has been shown to associate with HSP90 in other cell types (18Wartmann M. Davis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Stancato L. Chow Y. Owens-Grillo J. Yem A. Deibel M. Jove R. Pratt W. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). c-Raf-containing complexes have also been shown to contain other proteins in addition to HSP90, including p50 and an FK506-binding protein (24Stancato L. Chow Y. Hutchinson K. Perdew G. Jove R. Pratt W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21711-21716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Stancato L. Chow Y. Owens-Grillo J. Yem A. Deibel M. Jove R. Pratt W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22157-22161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have been unable to detect the stable association of other proteins (e.g. MEK, 14-3-3, and p50) with B-Raf in PC12 cells following anion exchange chromatography or immunoprecipitation. The association of B-Raf with HSP90 is remarkably stable as interaction of these proteins was unaffected by detergents and geldanamycin (37Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E. DeCosta B. Mers C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). The present data also demonstrate that B-Raf exists in a complex with HSP90 in resting cells; thus its participation in the complex is not likely to be dependent upon its activity. HSP90 functions as a molecular chaperone, interacting with a diverse array of proteins including steroid hormone receptors and v-Src (30Bohlen S. Kralli A. Yamamoto K. Science. 1995; 268: 1301-1304Google Scholar, 31Rutherford S. Zuker C. Cell. 1995; 79: 1129-1132Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HSP90 has been postulated to play a critical role in promoting the association of multiprotein complexes through conformational stabilization of the constituent proteins. There is substantial evidence that one of the primary functions of HSP90 is to mediate transport of proteins that associate in such complexes from one intracellular loci to another (29Pratt W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSP90 has also been shown to associate with a number of protein kinases, including casein kinase II (38Miyata Y. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7042-7047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and eIF2a kinase (39Matts R. Hurst R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15542-15547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and has been suggested to play a role in the stabilization of the activities of these enzymes. Similarly, the activity of the cell cycle regulator wee 1 exhibits an absolute requirement for HSP90, thus indicating a critical requirement for HSP90 in cell cycle control (40Aligue R. Akhavan-Niak H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6099-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance to our observation that B-Raf is linked to activation of the MAP kinase cascade is the recent recognition that HSP90 is an essential component of signal transduction pathways. Specifically, mutations of the Drosophila HSP90 homologue have been shown to be essential for signaling from the sevenless (41Cutforth T. Rubin C. Cell. 1994; 77: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and torso (42Doyle H. Bishop M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) tyrosine kinase receptors. The sevenless pathway has been linked to activation of the MAP kinase cascade, and the requirement for HSP90 is consistent with its postulated role in signaling through this pathway (43Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs W. Zipoursky S. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which HSP90 facilitates these signal transduction events is unclear; however it is likely to be required for the vectorial transport of the B-Raf-containing complexes from the cytosol to the membrane. The participation of Raf kinases in HSP90-containing complexes may also serve to facilitate signal transmission through stabilization of the active state of the enzyme. Recently, it has been reported that c-Raf·HSP90 complexes are resistant to phosphatase inactivation, suggesting that the complex serves to sterically mask critical phosphorylation sites on c-Raf (36Dent P. Jelinek T. Morrison D. Weber M. Sturgill T. Science. 1995; 268: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The existence of a number of parallel cascades that utilize structurally homologous enzymes underscores the complexity of these signaling events. It is of some significance that in yeast the STE5 gene product acts as a molecular scaffold to physically organize elements of the MAP kinase cascade into a functional module (44Faux M. Scott J. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 45Choi K. Satterberg B. Lyons D. Elion E. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This modular organization imparts efficiency to the signal transduction system, but more importantly provides a rational basis for establishing pathway specificity."

The ACG gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. acg− cells developed into normal fruiting bodies with viable spores, but spore germination was no longer inhibited by high osmolarity, a fairly universal constraint for spore and seed germination. ACG activity, measured in aca−/ACG cells, was strongly stimulated by high osmolarity with optimal stimulation occurring at 200 milliosmolar. RdeC mutants, which display unrestrained protein kinase A (PKA) activity and a cell line, which overexpresses PKA under a prespore specific promoter, germinate very poorly, both at high and low osmolarity.

An implication of these results is the ability of human IL-4 to activate IL-4 receptor complexes containing either human or murine common γ chain, thus complicating an analysis of the composition of the signaling competent receptor subunit assembly. In order to study the role of receptor chain dimerization events in signal release by the hIL-4R complex, we generated an expression system for receptor subunits that allowed us to experimentally induce specific and background-free intracellular hetero- and homodimerization. Our results show that the juxtaposition of two intracellular domains of IL-4Rα can act as the trigger of specific signaling, including the activation of Jak1 and Stat6 and the induction of cell proliferation. Surprisingly, a hitherto assumed participation of the cytoplasmic portion of common γ chain and of γc-associated kinase Jak3 is not required.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Google Scholar) encoding the epitope-tagged extracellular domain and transmembrane/intracellular domain of human γc and exchanging them for the corresponding fragments (BamHI/XhoI or XhoI/HindIII) in pKCR-4α. The resulting expression plasmids pKCR-4α/γ and pKCR-pγ/α were cotransfected into Ba/F3 cells as described (16Lischke A. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Google Scholar). Surface expression of receptor constructs was assayed by reacting intact cells with antibodies X 14/38 (16Lischke A. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Google Scholar, 19Bönsch D. Kammer W. Lischke A. Friedrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8452-8457Google Scholar) or P5D4 (20Kreis T.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 929-937Google Scholar) specific for the extracellular portions of recombinant hIL-4Rα or epitope-tagged human γc, respectively, and subsequent detection of bound antibodies by peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies as detailed elsewhere (21Lischke A. Pagany M. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 322-326Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 cells in a microtiter well were incubated on ice for 30 min with 5 μg of antibody in a volume of 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/3% bovine serum albumin. After washing twice, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of a 100 μg/ml solution of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova) and kept on ice for 30 min. Cell-bound secondary antibody was detected by transferring the cells to 50 μl of a solution containing 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5 mM 3-aminophthalhydrazide (Fluka), 400 μM p-coumaric acid (Sigma), 5.4 mM H2O2 and measuring elicited chemiluminescence using a MicroLumat LB 96P. Quantitation of surface-bound antibody molecules was achieved by relating the determined intensity of luminescence to a calibration series of samples containing known concentrations of peroxidase. Cell maintainance and preparation of hIL-4 and mutant Y124D has been described previously (16Lischke A. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Google Scholar). Recombinant murine IL-4 was purchased from Sigma. Cytokine-induced proliferation of cell lines was measured by [3H] thymidine incorporation into de novo synthesized DNA as described (16Lischke A. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Google Scholar). Samples of 3 × 107 cells were incubated at 37°C for 10 min in 1 ml of RPMI containing no cytokine, 7 nM of IL-4, or 50 nM of antibody P5D4 and subsequently lysed as described (16Lischke A. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Google Scholar). Cleared lysates were incubated with 1-5 μg of specific antibody. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were 4G10 (anti-phosphotyrosine, Upstate Biotechnology), E34-1 (22Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 3151-3160Google Scholar) and anti-Jak1 rabbit serum (23Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Kurban R.R. Ralph S.J. Zürcher G. Ziemiecki A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2057-2065Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were precipitated from lysates with 50 μl of anti-mouse IgG-agarose or protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and assayed as described (16Lischke A. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Google Scholar) using peroxidase-conjugated antibody RC20 (Transduction Laboratories) at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Iodination of hIL-4, cross-linking of radioligand to cell-surface receptors, and analysis of immunoprecipitated complexes by electrophoresis was carried out as described (19Bönsch D. Kammer W. Lischke A. Friedrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8452-8457Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from cells stimulated with IL-4 or antibody as described above by suspension of cell pellets in a buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml, and 100 μM sodium ortho-vanadate followed by three freeze-thaw cycles and centrifugation at 4°C and 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatants equivalent to 105 cells were used for bandshift assays performed as described (24Wakao H. Schmitt-Ney Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16365-16370Google Scholar). As a probe, the Stat6-binding sequence 5′-GTCAACTTCCCAAGAACAGAA-3′ derived from the human Iϵ-promoter (25Köhler I. Rieber E.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3066-3071Google Scholar) end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase to a specific activity of 8.000 cpm/fmol was applied. Supershifting of Stat6 containing complexes was achieved by adding to the binding reactions before electrophoretic mobility shift assay 1 μg of a chicken antibody directed to amino acids 637-847 of murine Stat6. 2M. Heim and R. Moriggl, unpublished data. We intended to reconstitute in murine cells a functional interleukin-4 receptor complex activable exclusively by human IL-4, which would not evoke any background signaling due to interference with the endogenous murine IL-4 receptor. To this end, we generated a pair of expression constructs encoding hybrid receptor chains derived from hIL-4Rα and hγc with mutually exchanged intracellular domains (Fig. 1A) and introduced it into the murine pre-B cell line Ba/F3. One clone expressing both 4α/γ and pγ/4α chimeras was termed BAF-4α/γ-pγ/4α. The number of surface-expressed receptor molecules per cell was determined in comparison with cell line BAF-4α-pγ bearing both subunits of the authentic human IL-4R (Fig. 1B). As measured by the binding of specific antibodies recognizing the extracellular receptor domains, in both cell lines surface expression of the receptor chain comprising the intracellular domain of γc was considerably higher than that of the subunit bearing the intracellular part of hIL-4Rα. Irrespective of the “authentic” or “cross-over” composition of the heterologous subunits, similar hIL-4 binding receptor complexes could be formed in both cell lines as revealed by immunoprecipitation of receptor chains cross-linked to radiolabeled hIL-4 (Fig. 1C). To test if the bipartite human IL-4R with exchanged cytoplasmic domains was capable of transmitting specific signals to the cell interior, we measured IL-4-induced cell proliferation. When stimulated with hIL-4, BAF-4α/γ-pγ/4α cells expressing the combination of hybrid receptors, like BAF-4α-pγ cells, showed a proliferative response (Fig. 2A). In BAF-4α-pγ cells, hIL-4 mutant Y124D evoked 60% of the DNA synthesis induced by wild type IL-4. We have previously shown that this degree of reactivity is due to preferential interaction of Y124D with murine γc (16Lischke A. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 100-107Google Scholar). When assaying BAF-4α/γ-pγ/4α cells, we found, as earlier observed with human IL-4 reactive cells (19Bönsch D. Kammer W. Lischke A. Friedrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8452-8457Google Scholar), only 30% of wild type activity for hIL-4 variant Y124D. This result indicates that hIL-4 cross-over receptor, as anticipated and unlike its authentic counterpart, precludes the formation of productive receptor complexes involving endogenous murine common γ chain. Stimulation with hIL-4 resulted in equivalent patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the two cell lines (Fig. 2B). The intracellular domain of hIL-4Rα is a major substrate of ligand-induced phosphorylation as revealed by specific immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Moreover, the modified hIL-4 receptor was found to recapitulate hIL-4-specific activation of janus kinases Jak1 and Jak3. We next employed the model receptor system to address the individual roles of the IL-4 receptor subunits in signaling. The ligand and antibody binding properties of the functionally expressed receptor constructs enabled us to specifically induce all three possible intracellular receptor dimers (Fig. 3A). In BAF-4α/γ-pγ/4α cells, not only hIL-4-induced heterodimerization of the two intracellular receptor domains but surprisingly also antibody-mediated cytoplasmic homodimerization of hIL-4Rα via the extracellular P5D4 epitope tag lead to cell proliferation (Fig. 3B). Antibody-induced homodimerization of γc intracellular domains in BAF-4α-pγ cells did not result in elevated DNA synthesis. The concentrations of hIL-4 and antibody P5D4, respectively, eliciting a proliferative response are in concordance with reported dissociation constants for the binding of hIL-4 to the high affinity hIL-4R of (100 pM) (26Kruse N. Shen B.-J. Arnold S. Tony H.-P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 13: 5121-5129Google Scholar) and for the interaction between antibody P5D4 and its cognate epitope (100 nM) (21Lischke A. Pagany M. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 322-326Google Scholar). The bell-shaped dose-response curve for the antibody-activity on BAF-4α/γ-pγ/4α cells indicates a blocking of receptor cross-linking by monovalent antibody binding at excess concentration and thus underscores our notion of P5D4-induced receptor homodimerization causing proliferation. Comparing the activation of janus kinases known to be involved in IL-4 receptor complex function by hetero- or homodimerization, respectively (Fig. 3C), we found that antibody-induced intracellular homodimerization of hIL-4Rα results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 but not of Jak3. Homodimerization of intracellular γc does not lead to a detectable phosphorylation of Jak1 or Jak3, whereas the heterodimer of α and γ evokes the activation of both kinases. Activation of Stat6, as assayed by its property to bind to a cognate DNA sequence derived from the Iϵ-promoter, is induced not only by an intracellular heterodimer of α and γ but also by an α-α homodimer (Fig. 3D). From these results we conclude that both the cytoplasmic domain of γc and activated Jak3 are not mandatory for Stat activation and for the onset of a signaling cascade leading to cell proliferation. The essential trigger for the release of these events is rather the juxtaposition of two intracellular domains of IL-4 receptor α chain and the concomitant activation of Jak1 by tyrosine phosphorylation. It is to date poorly understood how the common γ chain contributes to signaling mediated by different cytokine receptor complexes and how specificity of these receptors is achieved despite their sharing of a subunit. The only defined biochemical function of γc is the recruitment of Jak3 to the receptor complex (27Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 309-317Google Scholar). This very process, however, has been shown not to be essential for the specific activity of the IL-2 receptor; it can rather be replaced by artificially introducing Jak2 into the assembly (28Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gaffen S.L. Liu K.D. Longmore G.D. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 231-235Google Scholar). In this report we show that in the human IL-4 receptor system neither γc and Jak3 nor any substitute is required for the release of an intracellular signal if the intracellular domain of hIL-4Rα is experimentally homodimerized. Our results raise new questions about the role of γc in the function of the IL-4 receptor. The interaction of ligand with the extracellular domains of both IL-4Rα and γc is necessary for IL-4-induced signal transduction, because mutant forms of hIL-4 defective in contacting γc fail to stimulate cell proliferation (26Kruse N. Shen B.-J. Arnold S. Tony H.-P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 13: 5121-5129Google Scholar, 29Duschl A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 305-310Google Scholar). Functional properties of the intracellular domain of γc in the activation of this particular receptor system have not yet been addressed. Our data indicate that it is not involved in the release of intracellular signals specific for IL-4 and support the notion of a more general role for γc in the formation of the signaling competent IL-4R and probably also other cytokine receptor complexes. In ligand-induced IL-4R activation, one function of γc and Jak3 could be the promotion of a transient assembly of two or more copies of hIL-4Rα, a situation which in turn would lead to specific intracellular signal transduction. Alternatively, in the natural receptor complex, γc-mediated recruitment of Jak3 might result in an activation of Jak1, an event that in our model experiment is mimicked by the juxtaposition of two Jak1 molecules and serves as the master trigger for the various activities of hIL-4Rα. A more general version of such an interpretation of exchangeable Jaks in the hIL-4R complex would be the view that ligand-induced intracellular apposition of several combinations of two Jak molecules would suffice to evoke cell proliferation and the other reactions observed. In this scenario, the major function of the specific receptor chain (here: hIL-4Rα) would be to provide recognition sites for Stats and other downstream components that upon Jak-driven activation mediate the particular effects of IL-4. Directed homodimerization of γc does not result in similiar activities because of its lack of recognition sites for downstream signaling molecules. Also in line with such an explanation would be the notion of cytokine receptor signal transduction being relatively unselective and flexible in terms of interactions between receptor chains and intracellular binding partners. This would imply that the main event regulating specificity in cytokine signaling is the recognition between receptor and ligand and the thereby cross-linked combination of receptor subunits. To discriminate between the two principal explanations compatible with our results (involvement of receptor multimers in “natural” hIL-4 receptor activation or low specificity of Jak activity combined with recruitment of signaling molecules by hIL-4Rα via specific recognition sites), careful investigation of the stoichiometric subunit composition of the active hIL-4 receptor complex and a mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic portion of γc in this context are necessary. Also, the molecular details of Jak recognition, activation, and specificity in the hIL-4R assembly have to be addressed. The expert technical assistance of C. Müller is gratefully acknowledged.

This heptadecapeptide FGGFTGARKSARKLANQ resembles κ-opioid peptide dynorphin A but exhibits an opposite effect to make animals hyperreactive to nociceptive stimulations (Meunier, J.-C., Mollereau, C., Toll, L., Suaudeau, C., Moisand, C., Alvinerie, P., Butour, J.-L., Guillemot, J.-C., Ferrara, P., Monsarrat, B., Mazarguil, H., Vassart, G., Parmentier, M., and Costentin, J.

(1995) Science 270, 792-794). In the present study, it was found that guinea pig brain contains receptors to which nociceptin binds much more strongly than to ORL1 receptors expressed in human 293 cells. Although the Tyr1→ Phe substitution for dynorphin A eliminates almost completely an ability to bind to opioid receptors, the Phe1→ Tyr substitution in nociceptin was found to retain almost fully both receptor binding affinity and in vivo hyperalgesic activity in tail-flick assay. Nociceptin was extremely weak to bind to opioid receptors, while Tyr1-nociceptin exhibited 10-40 times increased affinity, especially for μ receptors, due to its N-terminal sequential identity to opioid peptides. Shortened analogs of dynorphin A are known to retain receptor binding ability and analgesic activity, whereas the removal of C-terminal hexa- or decapeptide from nociceptin totally abolished the affinity for the ORL1 receptor. These results indicated that the mode of interaction between nociceptin and ORL1 receptor is quite different from that between dynorphin and opioid receptor and that the C-terminal portion of nociceptin is crucial for receptor recognition.

The recent finding of a naturally occurring nociceptive peptide named nociceptin (1Meunier J.-C. Mollereau C. Toll L. Suaudeau C. Moisand C. Alvinerie P. Butour J.-L. Guillemot J.-C. Ferrara P. Monsarrat B. Mazarguil H. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Costentin J. Nature. 1995; 377: 532-535Google Scholar) or orphanin FQ (2Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.-P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. Science. 1995; 270: 792-794Google Scholar) has highlighted a possibility to design a novel analgesic. Nociceptin was isolated as a ligand for ORL1 receptor whose primary structure is most closely related to those of opioid receptors (3Mollereau C. Parmentier M. Mailleux P. Butour J.-L. Moisand C. Chalon P. Caput D. Vassart G. Meunier J.-C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 33-38Google Scholar, 4Chen Y. Fan Y. Liu J. Mestek A. Tian M. Kozak C.A. Yu L.

It produced hyperalgesia in rat and mouse in both hot-plate and tail-flick assays and was found to inhibit cAMP accumulation in the Chinese hamster ovary cell-expressing ORL1 receptor. Nociceptin resembles dynorphin A, a κ-receptor selective opioid peptide (6Goldstein A. Fischli W. Lowney L.I. Hunkapiller M. Hood L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7219-7223Google Scholar, 7Tachibana S. Araki K. Ohya S. Yoshida S. Nature. 1982; 295: 339-340Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Both nociceptin and dynorphin A are 17-amino acid peptides and contain 4-5 basic amino acids at the C-terminal portions. It is a question of great interest whether structural similarities between nociceptin and dynorphin A not only in peptide sequences but also in their receptor structures are reflected in the structure-activity relationships of nociceptin. The N-terminal sequences of nociceptin and dynorphin A are very similar, having the same sequence of Gly-Gly-Phe at positions 2-4. Gly3 and Phe4 are essential for activities of opioid peptides. As to Gly at position 2, structural requirements appear to be diverse among opioid peptides and receptors. Chavkin and Goldstein (8Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6543-6547Google Scholar) reported that Gly2 having no side chain is important to the potency of dynorphins for κ receptors. This is in contrast to the fact that small side chain substituents for Gly2 of enkephalin analogs lead to a favorable steric interaction at δ and μ receptors (9Mosberg H.I. Omnaas J.R. Goldstein A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 599-602Google Scholar). The major difference between nociceptin and opioid peptides exists, however, in the N-terminal amino acid: Phe for nociceptin and Tyr for dynorphin A and other opioid peptides. It has been well known that the replacement of Tyr in opioid peptides by Phe, which means the removal of the para-hydroxyl group from β-phenyl, results in inactivity (10Shimohigashi Y. Opioid Peptides: Medicinal Chemistry.in: Rapaka R.S. Barnett G. Hawks R.L. NIDA Research Monograph 69. NIDA-DHHS, U. S. Government Printing Office, Rockville, MD1986: 65-100Google Scholar). The importance of basic amino acid residues (Lys13, Lys11, and Arg7) to the potency of dynorphin A was demonstrated by successive removal of C-terminal amino acids (8Chavkin C. Goldstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6543-6547Google Scholar). In particular, Arg7 was found to be an essential structural element of dynorphins for specific recognition of κ opioid receptors. When this Arg7 was retained, the removal of the C-terminal octapeptide containing two of the other four basic amino acids sustained a full activity of dynorphin A (11Chavkin C. James I.F. Goldstein A. Science. 1982; 215: 413-415Google Scholar, 12Weber E. Evans C.J. Barchas J.D. Nature. 1982; 299: 77-79Google Scholar, 13Corbett A.D. Paterson S.J. McKnight A.T. Magnan J. Kosterlitz H.W. Nature. 1982; 299: 79-81Google Scholar). Dynorphin A has a basic amino acid pair of Arg-Arg at position 6-7. If dynorphin A was proteolytically excised here, the resulting peptide fragment is no longer dynorphin, producing a leucine-enkephalin molecule. On the other hand, nociceptin contains a couple of such basic amino acid pairs, namely two Arg-Lys sequences at positions 8-9 and 12-13 (see Fig. 1). It is interesting to know whether or not these pairs split nociceptin into inactive peptides. In the present study, in order to elucidate fundamental structural essentials of nociceptin, we have synthesized Tyr1-nociceptin, nociceptin-(1Meunier J.-C. Mollereau C. Toll L. Suaudeau C.

Peptides were first purified by the Sephadex G-15 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) column (2.0 × 138 cm) eluted with 30% AcOH after removal of resin and deprotection by reagent K. Further purification was carried out by reversed-phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyi.c.v.intracerebroventricularly. using a prepacked column (2.5 × 25 cm, Cica-Merck LiChrospher RP-18(e), 5 μm) with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% acetonitrile.

The purity was verified by analytical reversed-phase HPLC (0.4 × 25 cm, LiChrospher 100 RP-18(e), 5 μm) and amino acid analysis. high pressure liquid chromatography intracerebroventricularly. The cDNA clone of human ORL1 receptor was obtained by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. The first strand cDNA was synthesized with 5 μg of human total brain RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the First strand synthesis kit (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5′-end (5′-CGGAATTCATGGAGCCCCTCTTCCCCG-CGCCGTTCTGG-3′) and to the opposite strand of the 3′-end of the coding region (5′-GCTCTAGATCATGCGGGCCGCGGTACCGTCTCAGAGGT-3′) were synthesized based on the published sequence (3Mollereau C. Parmentier M. Mailleux P. Butour J.-L. Moisand C. Chalon P. Caput D. Vassart G. Meunier J.-C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 33-38Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out with the first strand cDNA reaction mixture and these primers for 25 cycles. The amplified DNA fragment was isolated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel, digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and cloned into the EcoRI/XbaI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Several cDNA clones were sequenced, and a cDNA clone without unwanted mutations was selected. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To generate stable transfectants, plasmid DNA (5 μg) was transfected into 293 cells using the Lipofectamine method (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 3-cm culture dish. After 24 h, cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes, and geneticin (G418) (600 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to select transfectant clones. Two weeks later, G418-resistant cell clones were isolated, propagated, and screened by ligand binding. The stable cell clone expressing receptors most highly was cultured up to the 25th passages, and the intact cells were used for binding assays. Radioligand receptor binding assays were carried out essentially as described previously (14Shimohigashi Y. English M.L. Stammer C.H. Costa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 583-590Google Scholar). Used radioligands were as follows: [125I-Tyr14]nociceptin (74 TBq/mmol, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) for ORL1 receptor; [3H-D-Ala2,MePhe4, Gly-ol5]enkephalin ([3H]DAGO) (1.80 TBq/mmol, DuPont NEN) for μ opioid receptor; [3H-D-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalyl-Thr6 ([3H]DSLET) (1.51 TBq/mmol, DuPont NEN) for δ opioid receptor; and [3H]U69593 (1.70 TBq/mmol, DuPont NEN) for κ opioid receptor. For assays using [125I-Tyr14]nociceptin, human 293 cells expressing ORL1 receptor or guinea pig brain were utilized, whereas rat and guinea pig brains were utilized for assays with opioid ligands. The membranes of these brains were prepared as previously reported (14Shimohigashi Y. English M.L. Stammer C.H. Costa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 583-590Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out at 25°C for 30 min in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Bacitracin (100 μg/ml) was added as an enzyme inhibitor. Dose-response curves were constructed utilizing 7-10 doses, and the assays were carried out at least in triplicate. The results were analyzed by the computer program ALLFIT (15De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Google Scholar). The hyperalgesic effect of peptides was examined in the tail-flick test. Responses were recorded on an analgesimeter (Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo) that focuses a noxious beam of light on the tail and automatically records the latency to removal. The peptides in a volume of 10 μl were administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) to ICR mouse (25-35 g). The training sessions were performed until mice could flick their tails within 10 s. The latency time was recorded twice (20 and 60 min) after i.c.v. administration. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance test. Tyr14-substituted nociceptin and its monoiodinated derivative were reported to be agonists of almost equivalent potency in the cAMP inhibition assay, and [125I-Tyr14]nociceptin was demonstrated to bind to ORL1 receptors in a saturable manner with high affinity (2Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.-P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Langen H. Monsma Jr., F.J. Civelli O. Science. 1995; 270: 792-794Google Scholar). This was confirmed in the present study when [125I-Tyr14]nociceptin was assayed for intact human 293 cells expressing ORL1 receptors. The dissociation constant (Kd) was 0.52 ± 0.05 nM, and the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) was 5.4 × 104 sites/cell. In the radioligand binding assay using [125I-Tyr14]nociceptin and ORL1-expressing 293 cells, nociceptin and Tyr14-nociceptin exhibited very high binding affinity and were almost equipotent (Table I). Interestingly, Tyr1-nociceptin showed considerably high affinity for ORL1 receptors (IC50 = 3.0 nM) and was only slightly less potent than nociceptin. This indicates that the Phe1→ Tyr substitution, namely the replacement of the para-hydrogen atom by the hydroxyl group on the Phe1-phenyl group, does not affect much the receptor binding characteristics of nociceptin. This is quite different from the fact that the Tyr1→ Phe replacement eliminates completely the ability of opioid peptides to bind to opioid receptors. ORL1 receptor is clearly insensitive to the Phe1→ Tyr substitution at the first position of nociceptin.Table IReceptor binding affinities of nociceptin and its analogs for human 293 cells expressing ORL1 receptors and for guinea pig brain preparations on response to [125I-Tyr14]nociceptinPeptidesIC50293 CellsGuinea pig brainnMNociceptin0.9 ± 0.30.016 ± 0.006Tyr1-nociceptin3.0 ± 0.90.060 ± 0.006Tyr14-nociceptin1.1 ± 0.30.055 ± 0.005Nociceptin-(1-11)>1000209 ± 100Nociceptin-(1-7)>1000>1000 Open table in a new tab In sharp contrast, nociceptin-(1Meunier J.-C.

Nature. 1982; 295: 339-340Google Scholar), which has a sequence cleaved at the amino side of another Arg-Lys at positions 8-9, was also completely inactive. Although dynorphin A is also a 17-amino acid peptide, its shortened analogs lacking C-terminal tetra- to nonapeptides have been reported to be almost as potent as parent dynorphin A (11Chavkin C. James I.F. Goldstein A. Science. 1982; 215: 413-415Google Scholar, 12Weber E. Evans C.J. Barchas J.D. Nature. 1982; 299: 77-79Google Scholar, 13Corbett A.D. Paterson S.J. McKnight A.T. Magnan J. Kosterlitz H.W. Nature. 1982; 299: 79-81Google Scholar). All these data indicate a distinct divergence in structural frames between nociceptin and dynorphin A in interacting with their specific receptors. When the binding assays were carried out using guinea pig brain membrane preparations, [125I-Tyr14]nociceptin bound in a dose-dependent manner and showed a very high binding affinity. Kd was 0.014 ± 0.002 nM, and Bmax was 2.8 fmol/mg protein. Using this [125I-Tyr14]nociceptin, nociceptin and Tyr14-nociceptin were assayed in guinea pig brain. They exhibited a strong inhibition of the binding of [125I-Tyr14]nociceptin in a dose-dependent manner, and the IC50 values were 0.0016 and 0.0055 nM, respectively (Table I). Clearly, guinea pig brain contains the receptors to which nociceptin and its analogs can bind. Tyr1-nociceptin was here again as potent as nociceptin, while shortened analogs were extremely weak or almost inactive (Table I). It should be noted that all these nociceptins are much more potent (about 20-50-fold) in guinea pig brain than in human 293 cells. Meunier et al. (1Meunier J.-C. Mollereau C. Toll L. Suaudeau C. Moisand C. Alvinerie P. Butour J.-L. Guillemot J.-C. Ferrara P. Monsarrat B. Mazarguil H. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Costentin J. Nature. 1995; 377: 532-535Google Scholar) have reported that the sequence of nociceptin appears to be conserved across mammalian species, showing that central amino acids of the peptide ARKSAR were identical in the human, rat, and mouse species. The present results may imply that there is a slight difference in sequence between rodent and human nociceptins. Alternatively, the receptors expressed in guinea pig brain might be different from ORL1. It is also possible that receptors of the intact cells has a ligand sensitivity different from that of receptors in membranes prepared from guinea pig brain. Nociceptin and Tyr1-nociceptin were evaluated for the in vivo activity in mice after intracerebroventricular administration. Nociceptin elicited hyperalgesia with 1 ng to 1 μg i.c.v. per mouse). At a dose of 1 ng, the reaction time was reduced by about 50%, and reaction time was further reduced with as doses increased (Fig. 2A). At the highest dose (1 μg), nociceptin induced a decrease in activity. When Tyr1-nociceptin was tested, a similar activity profile was obtained (Fig. 2B). Tyr1-nociceptin also made mice hyperreactive to nociceptive stimulation. This is certainly the reflection of its high binding affinity for ORL1 receptor. Zhang and Yu (16Zhang S. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22772-22776Google Scholar) have recently reported that dynorphin A activates the potassium channel by stimulating the ORL1 receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This appears to be quite rational for explaining a high activity of Tyr1-nociceptin. The sequence identity between dynorphin A and Tyr1-nociceptin is more than 40%, sharing the N-terminal tetrapeptide YGGF. Shortened analog nociceptin-(1Meunier J.-C. Mollereau C. Toll L. Suaudeau C.

Open table in a new tab When Tyr1-nociceptin was assayed, it exhibited considerably increased (8-37-fold) affinity to all these receptors. In particular, it bound to μ receptors in guinea pig and rat brains considerably strongly (IC50 = 21.7 nM). As mentioned above, Tyr1-nociceptin possesses exactly the same N-terminal sequence of opioid peptides, namely Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe, and became much more similar to dynorphin A, a κ receptor-selective opioid ligand (Fig. 1). In spite of such sequence similarity, Tyr1-nociceptin bound to μ receptors about 10 times more preferentially than to κ receptors. These results emphasize the difference in binding abilities of nociceptin and dynorphin A against nociceptive and opioid receptors. Apparently, the C-terminal sequence of nociceptin is crucial for recognition of ORL1 receptor. The present study indicates that nociceptin is distinct from opioid peptides, and at least the N-terminal 12-amino acid sequence is required for full activation of ORL1 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2058245773,"We demonstrate in this report that the Xenopus DG42 gene product made in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can synthesize authentic high molecular weight hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid; HA) in vitro. Saccharomyces are eukaryotes that do not naturally produce HA or any other molecules known to contain glucuronic acid. Therefore bakers' yeast is a good model system to determine the enzymatic activity of the DG42 protein, which is the topic of recent debate. Membrane extracts prepared from cells expressing DG42 encoded on a plasmid incorporated [14C]glucuronic acid and N-[3H]acetylglucosamine from exogenously supplied UDP-sugar nucleotides into a high molecular mass (10(6) to 10(7) Da) polymer in the presence of magnesium ions. Both sugar precursors were simultaneously required for elongation. Control extracts prepared from cells with the vector plasmid alone or the DG42 cDNA in the antisense orientation did not display this activity. The double-labeled polysaccharide product synthesized in vitro was deemed to be HA by enzymatic analyses; specific HA lyase could degrade the polymer, but it was unaffected by protease or chitinase treatments. The fragments generated by HA lyase were identical to fragments derived from authentic vertebrate HA as compared by high performance liquid chromatography. We conclude that DG42 is a membrane-associated HA synthase capable of transferring both glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine groups."

In vitro, RecA protein serves as a co-protease to cleave LexA repressor, the repressor of the SOS regulon; in addition, RecA protein promotes homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange, steps important to homologous recombination and DNA repair. To determine if these two functions of RecA protein are competing or parallel, the effect of uncleavable LexA S119A repressor on RecA protein-dependent activities was examined. LexA S119A repressor inhibits both the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-dependent ATP hydrolysis and DNA strand exchange activities of RecA protein. As for wild-type LexA repressor (Rehrauer, W.

In contrast, inhibition of DNA strand exchange activity is SSB protein-independent, suggesting that LexA S119A repressor blocks a site required for DNA strand exchange. These results imply that there is a common site on the RecA protein filament for secondary DNA and LexA repressor binding and raise the possibility that the recombination and co-protease activities of the RecA protein filament are competitive.

The ppGpp dependences of early pausing sites within different transcription systems controlled by promoters with known response to enhanced ppGpp levels in vivo were quantitatively characterized. Transcription of stable RNAs and mRNA genes were analyzed. In addition, the in vitro pausing behavior of two promoter variants directing the same sequence but differing in their in vivo ppGpp sensitivity were compared. In the presence of ppGpp we noted a slight general enhancement of specific pauses in all transcription systems. However, genes known to be under stringent or growth rate control in vivo revealed a notably stronger pausing enhancement. The sites of pausing are not changed by the presence of ppGpp but appear to be sequence-specific. The effect of ppGpp on the extent of pausing depends on the particular promoter and closely adjacent sequences that the RNA polymerase has passed during initiation. Pausing enhancement requires the presence of ppGpp during elongation but not during initiation.

Both phenomena affect transcription but also change many other cellular processes substantially, like replication, translation, proteolysis, or transport (1Cashel M. Rudd K.E. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Growth rate regulation causes increase in the synthesis rate for stable RNAs (rRNA and tRNAs) in proportion to the square of the cell growth rate (4Gausing K. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 335-354Google Scholar). Stringent control, on the other hand, summarizes a complex pattern of metabolic changes as a consequence of amino acid deprivation. The most dramatic effect of this regulatory network is the immediate repression of stable RNA synthesis concomitant with a rapid increase in the cellular concentration of the effector molecule guanosine 3′,5′-bisdiphosphate, ppGpp (2Gallant J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1979; 13: 393-415Google Scholar). This hormone-like substance, also termed an “alarmone,” functions as a global transmitter for cellular regulation. Basically it is unclear today how ppGpp exerts transcriptional regulation. Evidence based on mutational analysis (5Glass R.E. Jones S.T. Ishihama A. Mol. Gen.

Acta. 1987; 909: 115-125Google Scholar) indicates that the direct target for ppGpp action is the RNA polymerase itself, although unequivocal proof for this notion is still pending. The effects of ppGpp on both activation and repression of transcription have mainly been related to the initiation step (11Kajitani M. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1951-1957Google Scholar, 12Riggs D.L. Müller R.D. Kwan H.S. Artz S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9333-9337Google Scholar, 13Ohlsen K.L. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6071-6075Google Scholar) in line with the classification of stringent or nonstringent regulated promoters (14Travers A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2605-2618Google Scholar, 15Travers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 973-976Google Scholar). Undoubtedly, at high concentrations of ppGpp (stringent control) different promoters respond in a different way. Outstanding inhibition is observed for ribosomal RNA P1 promoters. Some promoters, like the β-lactamase promoter, are obviously not directly affected, and for several other promoters, like “gearbox” promoters or promoters controlling amino acid biosynthetic operons, de-repression of transcription can be noted at elevated ppGpp concentrations (16Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Nguyen L.H. Jensen D.B. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7982-7989Google Scholar, 17Stephens J.C. Artz S.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the question that structural requirements confer stringent or growth rate dependence has been addressed by numerous investigations, our present knowledge is still incomplete. A GC-rich discriminator motif immediately downstream to the −10 consensus hexamer was shown in vitro and in vivo to be a necessary but not sufficient element for stringent and growth rate-regulated promoters (15Travers A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 973-976Google Scholar, 19Travers A.A. Lamond A.I. Weeks J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 251-255Google Scholar, 20Mizushima-Sugano J. Kaziro Y.

Studies with hybrid promoters show that stringent promoters are defined by the complete promoter context (22Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6271-6275Google Scholar). Effects provoked by the stringent or growth rate control are not only restricted to initiation steps of transcription, however; and several studies have demonstrated ppGpp effects during transcription elongation (23Kingston R. Nierman W. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2787-2797Google Scholar, 24Kingston R.E. Chamberlin M.J. Cell. 1981; 27: 523-531Google Scholar, 25Vogel U. Sørensen M. Pedersen S. Jensen K.F. Kilstrup M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2191-2200Google Scholar). Normally, RNA polymerase does not elongate an RNA chain with constant speed but instead moves unevenly, pausing at specific nucleotide positions for distinct times. The reasons for the occurrence of pauses are not completely understood, and several different mechanistic explanations for pausing are discussed (26Levin J.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 61-84Google Scholar, 27Chan C.L. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20796-20804Google Scholar). Some pauses are believed to play a major role in defining termination and attenuation sites apparently synchronizing transcription and translation (28Yanofsky C. Nature. 1981; 289: 751-758Google Scholar, 29Platt T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 339-372Google Scholar, 30Chan C.L. Landick R. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 297Google Scholar). Often pauses are associated with transcript structure formation or protein binding. Some pauses have been shown to be influenced by ppGpp or other cellular factors (e.g. NusA, template topology). Moreover, pausing has been proposed as a mechanism to regulate heavily transcribed operons (23Kingston R. Nierman W. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2787-2797Google Scholar, 24Kingston R.E.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 581-589Google Scholar), and in recent reports growth rate-dependent changes in the RNA elongation rate, probably due to enhanced pausing, was demonstrated (25Vogel U. Sørensen M. Pedersen S. Jensen K.F. Kilstrup M. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2191-2200Google Scholar, 33Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2807-2813Google Scholar, 34Sørensen M.A. Jensen K.F. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 441-454Google Scholar). In the subsequent study we have carried out in vitro transcription experiments to answer the following questions. (i) Does ppGpp alter the RNA polymerase elongation rate via pausing in a general or specific way? (ii) How do different promoters or different transcribed sequences contribute to putative ppGpp effects on RNA polymerase pausing? (iii) At which stage of the transcription cycle may ppGpp exert its effect? To follow effects exclusively during elongation, we have uncoupled the initiation step by using arrested ternary elongation complexes formed with different templates. Elongation was then resumed in the presence or absence of ppGpp, and pausing of RNA polymerase was accurately quantified by a recently developed analysis procedure (35Theißen G. Pardon B. Wagner R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 254-261Google Scholar). RNA polymerase was isolated according to published procedures (36Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J.

It contains the gene coding for ampicillin resistance (bla), the RNA I gene, and a truncated rrnB operon with the complete rrnB leader sequence including the ribosomal promoters rrnB P1 and P2 up to the 5′ end of the 16 S RNA gene. pMKΔ was derived from pMK-1 by a 453-bp StuI/BstBI deletion, which removes the ribosomal promoters P1 and P2. pMK-7 is a pMK-1 derivative with the 51-bp multicloning site from pUC18 (42Yanisch-Peron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Google Scholar) substituted for the 3360-bp EcoRI/HindIII fragment. In the SmaI/SalI opened multicloning site a 350-bp SalI/SmaI fragment from pPtacW (21Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3357-3363Google Scholar) containing the tac promoter was ligated. pMK-8 was constructed from pMK-1 by replacing the 398-bp BstBI/HindIII rrnB P1 promoter fragment with a 411-bp SmaI/HindIII T7 promoter fragment from pLT7 P1 (43Pardon B. Wagner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 932-941Google Scholar). The plasmids pP2 and pP2F have been described recently (21Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3357-3363Google Scholar). They contain promoter fusions with the rrnB P2 promoter attached to the CAT gene at position +14, with respect to the P2 start. The promoter P2F differs from P2 by a single point mutation at position −5. In contrast to P2, promoter P2F confers growth rate regulation and response to the stringent control in vivo. In pMK-10 the bla gene was brought under the control of the rrnB P1 promoter. It was constructed by replacing the 1238-bp SspI/BstBI fragment from pMK-5 with a 152-bp BstBI/MspA1I fragment from pMK-1, thereby fusing the P1 transcription sequence at position +37 to the bla transcription sequence at position −11. base pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Ternary transcription complexes were obtained and purified as described (26Levin J.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 61-84Google Scholar). The preparation involves the formation of stable elongation complexes stalled at a defined template site. Specific initiation of transcription was achieved using a di- or trinucleotide as primer and a limited subset of NTP substrates. The ternary complexes, consisting of RNA polymerase, the stalled transcript, and the superhelical template were separated from nucleotides and excess polymerase by Sepharose 6B column chromatography with buffer K. Generally, 20-30 nM RNA polymerase was incubated at 30°C with 20-30 nM superhelical plasmid DNA and the appropriate nucleotide mixtures for 3-5 min. The nucleotide compositions for formation of ternary complexes at the different promoters were as follows: (a) U14·RNA I complexes, 30 nM pMKΔ DNA; 5 μM each ATP, GTP, UTP, and [α-32P]UTP (50 μCi/ml), 50 μM ApC as initiating dinucleotide; incubation for 5 min; (b) U15·β-lactamase complexes, 30 nM pMKΔ DNA; 3 μM each ATP, GTP, UTP, and [α-32P]UTP (50 μCi/ml); incubation for 3 min; (c) G34/43·rrnB P1 complexes, 20 nM pMK-1 DNA; 3 μM each ATP, CTP, GTP, and [α-32P]CTP (50 μCi/ml); 25 μM ApCpU as initiating trinucleotide; incubation for 5 min; (d) G34A39·rrnB P1 Bla complexes, same conditions as c: (e) C10/11·rrnB P2 complexes, 30 nM pMK-8 DNA; 1.25 μM each CTP, GTP, and [α-32P]CTP (50 μCi/ml); 60 μM CpC as initiating dinucleotide; incubation for 3 min; (f) C10/11·P2 and C10/11·P2F complexes, same conditions as e. The total reaction volume for ternary complex formation was 150 μl in each case. Precise adherence to the above conditions was important for the correct formation of ternary complexes, and changing the nucleotide concentrations or the incubation times leads to heterogeneous read through complexes or shorter abortive products. Ternary complexes were elongated in the presence of 140 μM each ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP in transcription buffer with or without ppGpp (final concentration, 350 μM) for various reaction times. To resolve the short time intervals, we have connected a repeat pipette with the event marker input of an LKB recorder. 8 or 12 slots of a standard microtiter dish were filled with 8 μl of four NTP mix (1 mM each), and each reaction was started by adding 50 μl of the respective ternary complexes with the repeat pipette. Thus, the start of every single reaction was marked by the recorder. Following incubation the reactions were stopped with an 8- or 12-channel pipette by adding simultaneously 100 μl of ice-cold stop solution (1.5 M NH4Ac, 37.5 mM EDTA, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA) to all elongation reactions. This event was also recorded to calculate the exact times of the elongation reactions. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, lyophilized, and redissolved in 5 μl of loading buffer containing 7 M urea. Separation of the transcripts was carried out on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (15% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea, 1 × TBE buffer at a constant 75 watts). Gels were exposed for autoradiography employing Fuji RX x-ray films at −70°C. Pausing sites were determined by RNA sequencing of transcription products employing the chain termination method (44Axelrod V.D. Vartikyan R.M. Aivazashvili V.A. Beabealashvili R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3549-3563Google Scholar). The nucleotide compositions for sequencing were as follows: A reaction, 100 μM ATP, 400 μM each CTP, GTP, UTP, 200 μM 3′-dATP; C reaction, 100 μM CTP, 400 μM each ATP, GTP, UTP, 500 μM 3′-dCTP; G reaction, 100 μM GTP, 400 μM each ATP, CTP, UTP, 200 μM 3′-dGTP; U reaction, 100 μM UTP, 400 μM each ATP, CTP, GTP, 400 μM 3′-dUTP. Under the kinetic conditions of the transcription analysis employed, the intensity of transcription products over time at a specific nucleotide position within the gel reflects the efficiency and duration of RNA polymerases pausing at this site. Therefore, a time-dependent quantification of band intensities allows us to determine pause strength parameters. The quantitative assessment of transcription products and the corresponding determination of pause strength τ was performed as described recently (35Theißen G. Pardon B. Wagner R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 254-261Google Scholar) by densitometric evaluation of unsaturated autoradiograms using a Zeineh SL-504 XL soft laser-scanning densitometer. The transcription elongation reactions were performed strictly under single round conditions by resuming elongation from the stalled ternary complexes that had been initiated from only one promoter. The amounts of transcription products according to autoradiographic bands on x-ray films are calculated from densitometric integration according to Equation 1: IPci=IPiItot−∑Iter.kt(Eq. 1) with IPci = corrected band intensity at a certain elongation time at nucleotide position i. IPi = band intensity at a certain elongation time at nucleotide position i. Itot−Σ Iter = total radioactivity of the corresponding reaction mixture applied on the gel corrected for all termination events preceding site i (including the fraction of starting ternary complexes that is not chased into longer products). kt = correction factor; this factor corrects for differences in the amounts of reaction products applied to individual gel lanes corresponding to different reaction times. kt were obtained as deviations from the normalized average intensities for elongation-resistant complexes for the different reaction times. Total radioactivity (Itot) was determined by adding the band intensities obtained from the starting ternary complexes (see Fig. 2, lanes a-d) and by taking into account the fraction of the reaction volume of the reference compared with the fraction that had been used for the lanes showing elongation reactions. The calculated IPci values for each elongation reaction were plotted as a function of time (see Fig. 3), and the pause strength τi was determined according to Equation 2: τi=∫0∞IPcidt(Eq. 2) τi = pause strength of pause i. IPci = corrected band intensity at a certain elongation time at nucleotide position i. Each pause strength depends on the number of RNA polymerases that pauses at site i and on the period that each polymerase needs to pass position i. Due to integration over (in principle) unlimited times Equation 2 considers polymerases independently from the time point at which they reach and leave a certain pause site. This allows measurement of not only the first but all subsequent pauses for which transcription becomes increasingly asynchronous. The ratio of pause strength τi in the presence and absence of ppGpp are given as pausing factors in Tables I, II, III, IV, V, VI. Standard deviations from at least two independent determinations are given in parentheses.Table IppGpp-dependent pausing factors of RNA I transcriptionNucleotide positionPausing factorsG341.14 (±0.06)U531.73 (±0.11)A661.46 (±0.03)C691.11 (±0.14) Open table in a new tab Table II.ppGpp-dependent pausing factors of PBla transcriptionNucleotide positionsPausing factorsG261.24C301.27A371.58U380.9C410.66U441.56G51(1.82)aThis number is prone to a large error because of a simultaneous termination at this position.a This number is prone to a large error because of a simultaneous termination at this position.

Open table in a new tab For these investigations we have chosen the following transcription units that are known to respond differentially to changes in the ppGpp concentration. (i) RNA I gene that negatively regulates ColE1 plasmid replication (45Tomizawa J. Itoh Y. Selzer G. Som T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1421-1425Google Scholar). Transcription of this gene is considered to be growth rate-dependent but not under stringent control (46Hecker M. Schroeter A. Mach F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 190: 355-357Google Scholar, 47Lin-Chao S. Bremer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 203: 143-149Google Scholar, 54Lin-Chao S. Bremer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 203: 150-153Google Scholar, 55Herman A. Wegrzyn A. Wegrzyn G. Mol. Gen.

(ii) The β-lactamase gene that is expressed constitutively and not under stringent or growth rate control (48Klotzky R.A. Schwartz I. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 55: 141-146Google Scholar). (iii) Transcripts starting from rrnB P1 (first promoter of the ribosomal rrnB operon). P1 promoters from all seven E. coli rRNA operons are known to be stringently and growth rate-regulated (21Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3357-3363Google Scholar, 49Glaser G. Sarmientos P. Cashel M. Nature. 1983; 302: 74-76Google Scholar, 50Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Google Scholar, 51Gourse R.L. deBoer H.A. Nomura M. Cell. 1986; 44: 197-205Google Scholar). (iv) Transcripts started from rrnB P2 (second promoter of the ribosomal rrnB operon). P2 promoters are considered to respond not or only weakly to stringent or growth rate regulation; however, see also 31Kingston R.E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5249-5254Google Scholar, 52Gafny R. Cohen S. Nachaliel N. Glaser G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 152-156Google Scholar, and 53. (v) CAT gene fusion constructs to either the genuine ribosomal RNA promoter P2 or P2F, a modified P2 promoter. In P2F a discriminator motif has been introduced by a single point mutation at position −5. This base change confers stringent and growth rate sensitivity in vivo (21Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3357-3363Google Scholar, 22Zacharias M. Göringer H.U. Wagner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6271-6275Google Scholar). (vi) A hybrid fusion construct of the rrnB P1 promoter region and the β-lactamase gene. The fusion occurred at position +39, relative to the P1 start to the sequence position −11 of the β-lactamase gene. Specifically stalled transcription elongation complexes were preformed with the above constructs and used for subsequent elongation kinetics in the presence or absence of ppGpp. Fig. 1 shows a schematic summary of the different templates. Ternary complexes stalled at position U14 were prepared for the in vitro transcription elongation of the PRNA I-directed gene employing plasmid pMKΔ. Supercoiled plasmid DNA instead of DNA fragments was used throughout this study to better match the template topology within the cell and to minimize artifacts. In addition, we used high NTP concentrations to approach the in vivo RNA polymerase elongation rate. Fig. 2 shows the results of in vitro transcription reactions in the presence (left panel) and absence of ppGpp (right panel). Characteristic RNA polymerase pausing positions are marked within the 108 nucleotide RNA I transcript. Pauses can be recognized by the characteristic time-dependent appearance and decay of gel bands. In the presence of ppGpp no new pauses were introduced, but at some positions the time course of band appearance is changed. Because band intensities are influenced by upstream pausing events and the time intervals of the kinetics presented in Fig. 2 are not identical for the plus and minus ppGpp experiment, it is difficult to recognize pausing differences by mere visual inspection. Therefore, exact pausing strength values τ have been determined for the nucleotide positions G34, U53, A66, and C69 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In Fig. 3 the relative occupancies at these pausing positions are plotted over time. Integration of the corresponding peak areas yields the pausing strength values τ for these pause sites. The ratio of these numbers obtained in the presence and absence of ppGpp are given in Table I as pausing factors. It can be seen that some pauses, like G34 and C69, are unaltered by ppGpp while others, like U53 and A66, are notably enhanced. The effects are relatively small but clearly significant and reproducible. To rule out possible termination effects on the pause strength values τ we have routinely made a “long time” reaction. Examples are presented in Fig. 2, in which the transcription reactions were performed for 5 min. During that time all active ternary complexes have reached the transcription termination site, and bands between the ternary complex (U14) and the termination site must be considered as dead-end complexes or premature terminations. Apart from a small amount of U14 complexes that resisted elongation, only a weak band between positions U23 and G24 can be observed in all lanes indicative of a dead-end complex or a premature termination event. However, this band is already visible in the original ternary complex before elongation was resumed. Therefore, the observed pauses were not influenced by premature termination events. To be sure that effects on pausing are due to the specific influence of the effector molecule ppGpp and not caused by an increase in the concentration of general guanosine nucleotides, we have performed control elongation reactions where ppGpp was replaced by 5′-guanosine diphosphate. No change in pausing factors for any nucleotide position could be detected in these control experiments ruling out an unspecific guanosine nucleotide effect, for instance at the GTP substrate site (data not shown). Since it is known that in vitro transcription reactions are strongly influenced by changes in the ionic conditions, we have determined the contaminating salt concentration of the ppGpp preparation (39Krohn M. Wagner R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 188-190Google Scholar). Mock experiments with adequate LiCl concentrations were performed but did not affect pausing strength in a measurable way (data not shown). Hence, we can rule out the influence of contamina"
https://openalex.org/W2000972379,"We reported that limulus intracellular coagulation inhibitor type-1 (LICI-1) (Miura, Y., Kawabata, S., and Iwanaga, S. (1994) J. Biol.

The LICI-1 specifically inhibits limulus lipopolysaccharide-sensitive serine protease, factor C (k1 = 2.5 × 106M−1 s−1), whereas LICI-2 inhibits preferentially limulus clotting enzyme (k1 = 4.3 × 105M−1 s−1). In our ongoing studies on limulus serpin, we found another inhibitor, named LICI type-3 (LICI-3), which strongly inhibits (1,3)-β-D-glucan-sensitive serine protease, factor G¯ (k1 = 3.9 × 105M−1 s−1). Thus, the limulus hemolymph coagulation cascade is effectively regulated by at least the three endogenous serpins.LICI-3, newly identified in hemocytes, is a single chain glycoprotein with an apparent Mr = 53,000, the largest one among known limulus serpins. A cDNA sequence for LICI-3 coded a mature protein of 392 amino acids, of which 68 residues were confirmed by peptide sequencing. LICI-3 showed significant sequence similarity to LICI-1 (45.8% identity) and LICI-2 (33.7% identity). LICI-3 contained a putative reactive site, -Arg-Ser-, distinct from that of LICI-2 (-Lys-Ser-) but the same as that of LICI-1. Expression of LICI-3 mRNA was detected only in hemocytes, and not in heart, brain, stomach, intestine, coxal gland, and skeletal muscle. Immunoblotting of the hemocyte-derived large and small granules with antiserum against LICI-3 suggested that it is stored specifically in large granules, as in the case of LICI-1 and LICI-2, and is released in response to external stimuli.

The limulus hemolymph coagulation cascade induced by lipopolysaccharide is composed of three serine protease zymogens, factor C (1Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 511-521Google Scholar), factor B (2Nakamura T. Horiuchi T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 847-857Google Scholar), and proclotting enzyme (3Nakamura T.

Chem. 1984; 259: 8924-8933Google Scholar). This cascade is activated not only by lipopolysaccharide, but also by (1,3)-β-D-glucan, the major cell wall component of fungi (5Morita T. Tanaka S. Nakamura T. Iwanaga S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 318-321Google Scholar, 6Muta T. Miyata T. Misumi Y. Tokunaga F. Nakamura T. Toh Y. Ikehara Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

Miyata T. Misumi Y. Tokunaga F. Nakamura T. Toh Y. Ikehara Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6554-6561Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of coagulin gel. These responses are thought to be important for the host defense in engulfing invading microbes, in addition to preventing the leakage of hemolymph. In our ongoing studies on the molecular mechanism of the limulus clotting pathway, we obtained evidence for the existence of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) in hemocytes of the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) (7Miura Y.

The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 5 min and terminated by the addition of 750 μl of 0.6 M acetic acid. The resulting chromophore was measured at 405 nm. One unit of the inhibitor was defined as the amount of protein that inhibited 1 unit of clotting enzyme (3Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1561-1574Google Scholar). Each protease (10 nM) was preincubated, respectively, with 100 nM LICI-3 in 200 μl of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.15 M NaCl, and 20 mM CaCl2 at 37°C for 30 min. A fluorogenic substrate, Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA (trypsin), Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA (α-chymotrypsin), Boc-Ala-Pro-Ala-MCA (elastase), Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA (plasmin), Glu-Gly-Arg-MCA (urokinase), or carbobenzoxy-Phe-Arg-MCA (kallikrein) was added, respectively, to the mixture at a final concentration of 0.45 mM. The reaction mixture was further incubated at 37°C for 10 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 780 μl of 0.6 M acetic acid. The resulting fluorescence was measured with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm. The second-order rate constants (k1) for the inhibition of LICI-3 toward factor G¯, clotting enzyme, factor C¯, and α-chymotrypsin were determined using the method of Ehrlich et al. (16Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Google Scholar) as follows; each enzyme (final concentration, 5 nM) was incubated with LICI-3 (final concentration, 25 nM) in 1 ml of 0.02 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin and 0.1 M NaCl at 37°C. At appropriate times (15 s to 15 min), 50-μl aliquots were removed, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 950 μl of the buffer containing each substrate (0.6 mM). The concentrations of residual enzymes were calculated from their specific activities. The second-order rate constant (k1) was calculated using the standard equation for a second-order reaction (16Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Google Scholar). Escherichia coli B was used for determination of the antimicrobial activity, by the method of Saito et al. (11Saito T. Kawabata S. Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Cho J. Nakajima H. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1131-1137Google Scholar, 17Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Google Scholar). The purified inhibitor (100 μg) was digested with lysyl endopeptidase (18Aketagawa J. Miyata T. Ohtsubo S. Nakamura T. Morita T. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7357-7365Google Scholar). Peptides were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, using a μBondasphere C8 300A column (Nihon Waters Ltd., Tokyo). Amino acid sequence analysis of purified peptides was performed using a gas-phase sequencer model 473A (Applied Biosystems) with the chemicals and program supplied by the manufacturer. For amino acid analysis, samples were hydrolyzed in 6 M HCl in evacuated and sealed tubes at 110°C for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cysteine was determined as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation or as S-carboxymethylcysteine after iodoacetic acid treatment, with or without dithiothreitol. The hydrolyzates were analyzed using a Hitachi L-8500 amino acid analyzer with the chemicals and program supplied by the manufacturer. The degenerate nucleotide sequences of the primer used for PCR were based on amino acid sequences of peptides K20 (-KGFWET-) and K13 (-DMGMK-), since the location and spatial relationship of these peptides could be deduced from their sequence similarities to the conserved regions of the serpin superfamily. Sense and antisense nucleotides were synthesized with an EcoRI site at the 5′ end, using a DNA synthesizer model 380B and the chemicals and program supplied by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Reactions for PCR contained the cDNA template (corresponding to 0.1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA) and 200 pmol of each primer and were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler. The PCR products were treated with EcoRI and fractionated on low melting point agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). Fragments of interest were then ligated into pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for sequence analysis, as described by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One clone with a 2.3-kilobase pair insert contained the sequence of LICI-3-derived peptides and was used as a probe for screening the λZipLox cDNA library. A λZipLox cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA, as reported previously (20Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Google Scholar). The PCR fragment, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Ready-To-Go™ DNA-labeling kit (Pharmacia) served as a probe to screen the library. After tertiary screening, the plasmids containing the cDNA insert were prepared from the positive plaques, following the manual supplied by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The LICI-3 sequence was compared with all entries in the SWISS-PROT data base (release 30, January 1995) using the Gene Works software package (version 2.4 IntelliGenetics, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Microtiter plates were coated with big defensin (50 μl/well) in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl (TBS) for 1 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. TBS containing 3% dried milk (200 μl/well) was added to block any nonspecific binding. After standing for 1 h at room temperature, the wells were washed three times with TBS buffer. Then, LICIs in blocking buffer (50 μl/well) were added, and the preparation was incubated at 37°C for 1 h, after which the wells were washed three times with TBS buffer. Antisera against LICIs (50 μl/well) were added to each well, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Then, the wells were washed three times with TBS buffer and incubated with 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) for 1 h, washed again three times with TBS buffer and then three times with distilled water. Finally, each well was incubated with 150 μl of 10 mM o-phenylenediamine dissolved in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1% H2O2. The reaction was stopped with 1 M H2SO4 containing 1% sodium sulfate, and the absorbance of each well was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader, model 3550 (Bio-Rad). As a control, antithrombin III and human neutrophil defensin were used. Component sugar analyses were performed on samples hydrolyzed in 4 M trifluoroacetic acid at 100°C for 3 h, using derivatizations with 2-aminopyridine, and quantification of sialic acid was performed as described by Nishimura et al. (21Nishimura H. Takao T. Hase S. Shimonishi Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17520-17525Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from various tissues of an adult male Japanese horseshoe crab (T. tridentatus). First-strand cDNA synthesis from 10 μg of total RNA was performed using SuperScript™ II Rnase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and random primers. Oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification were the same as those used for screening of a cDNA library. One-twentieth of the first-strand cDNA and 50 pmol of each primer were subjected to PCR (30 cycles) with denaturation at 94°C for 0.5 min, annealing at 45°C for 1 min, and extension at 65°C for 2 min. PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized following ethidium bromide staining. An antiserum against LICI-3 was raised in rabbits, as described previously (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 471Google Scholar). LICI-3 (50 μg) was emulsified in synthetic adjuvant, Titer Max™ (Vaxal, Inc., Norcross, GA) and given intradermally. Every 4 weeks, a booster with 50 μg of LICI-3 in the same adjuvant was given. The blood sample taken 1 week after the third injection was stored in serum form at −80°C. SDS-PAGE was performed in 10% slab gels according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, using an electroblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) overnight at 20 V. The membranes were then treated with the LICI-3 antiserum and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, as described elsewhere (8Miura Y. Kawabata S. Wakamiya Y. Nakamura T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 558-565Google Scholar). Exocytosis of hemocytes with ionophore A23187 (Sigma) was performed as described by Miura et al. (8Miura Y. Kawabata S. Wakamiya Y. Nakamura T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 558-565Google Scholar). Concentration of human α-thrombin and α-chymotrypsin was determined by the active site titration with p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate (24Chase T. Shaw E. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 20-27Google Scholar). Active site concentrations of limulus clotting enzyme and factor C¯ were titrated with human antithrombin III by the method of Lawrence et al. (25Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Ericson J. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20293-20301Google Scholar). Concentrations for other proteins were calculated from their extinction coefficients of 1% solution at 280 nm as follows: 7.6 for the clotting enzyme (Mr = 58,000) (3Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1561-1574Google Scholar), 21.3 for factor C¯ (Mr = 123,000) (1Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 511-521Google Scholar), and 10 for factor G¯ (Mr = 110,000) (10Muta T. Seki N. Takaki Y. Hashimoto R. Oda T. Iwanaga A. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 892-897Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified LICI-3 was determined by titration with α-thrombin. The lysate (1,200 ml) prepared from 55 g (wet weight) of hemocytes was first fractionated on a dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B column (5 × 23 cm) with increasing concentrations of sodium chloride from the range 0.15 to 2.0 M (7Miura Y. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 542-547Google Scholar), and fractions were assayed for inhibitory activity toward clotting enzyme, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A). The 0.5 M NaCl fractions containing LICI-2 and a new inhibitor (LICI-3) which are indicated by a bar were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. LICI-3 was separated from LICI-2 by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column (4 × 142 cm), equilibrated with 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 0.05 M NaCl (Fig. 1B). The LICI-3 fractions indicated by the bar were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.05 M NaCl and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (2 × 16 cm) column, equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.05 M NaCl (Fig. 1C). The column was washed extensively with equilibration buffer, then proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05 to 0.35 M NaCl. Active fractions (bar) were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.05 M NaCl. The dialyzed sample was again applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL 6B column equilibrated with the same buffer. After applying the sample, the column was washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.1 M NaCl and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1-0.5 M NaCl in the same buffer (Fig. 1D). All steps of purification procedure were performed at 4°C. The purified LICI-3 gave a single protein band with Mr = 53,000 on SDS-PAGE, under reduced conditions (Fig. 1E). The purification scheme is summarized in Table I. The overall yield was 4.1% with substantial losses occurring especially at the second step of chromatography, but this step was required to remove LICI-2 contaminated in the first step of chromatography.Table IPurification of LICI-3 from the limulus hemocyte lysateStepVolumeTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmlmgunitsunits/mg%-foldHemocyte lysate1,2003,170Dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B46524442.60.21001Sephacryl S-20011018.83.90.29.21.2DEAE SepharosepH 7.5452.53.51.48.27.9pH 8.5200.51.73.24.118.3 Open table in a new tab To determine whether LICI-3 inhibits limulus clotting factors and other mammalian serine proteases, a 10 M excess of the inhibitor was incubated with each protease at 37°C for 30 min, and the remaining amidolytic activity was assayed, as described under “Experimental Procedure.” Limulus factor G¯, factor C¯, and clotting enzyme activities, in addition to α-chymotrypsin, were inhibited by LICI-3 (Table II). Furthermore, LICI-3 inhibited the activities of bovine plasmin, human α-thrombin, urokinase, tissue type plasminogen activator, rat salivary kallikrein, and trypsin. Among the clotting factors, the inactivation of factor G¯ was the most rapid (k1 = 3.9 × 105M−1 s−1). Within the LICIs, LICI-1 did not inhibit the α-chymotrypsin activity, yet LICI-2 and LICI-3 did strongly inhibit such activity. The inactivation of α-chymotrypsin by LICI-3 (k1 = 1.2 × 105M−1 s−1) was three times more rapid than that of LICI-2 (k1 = 3.8 × 104M−1 S−1). A thiol protease, papain, was not inhibited by LICI-3 (data not shown). LICI-3 formed a stable one-to-one complex with factor G¯ and α-chymotrypsin, both of which did not dissociate in the presence of 2% SDS. For example, the interaction of LICI-3 (53 kDa) with the factor G¯-derived protease domain (B-chain, 34 kDa) (26Seki N. Muta T. Oda T. Iwaki D. Kuma K. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1370-1374Google Scholar) yielded a 87-kDa complex, under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2, lane 2). The complex of LICI-3 (53 kDa)-α-chymotrypsin with a 65-kDa product was also detectable (lane 3). During the incubation of LICI-3 with α-chymotrypsin, a new product (Mr = 44,000) appeared with immunoblotting, in addition to the complex between LICI-3 and α-chymotrypsin. This product was thought to be LICI-3 proteolytically modified by the free enzyme, since α-chymotrypsin was not autocatalytically degraded under these conditions and the 44-kDa product was recognized by anti-LICI-3 antiserum.Table II.Second-order rate constants of LICI-1, LICI-2, and LICI-3ProteaseLICI-1aLICI-2bLICI-3Substratem−1 s−1Limulus factor C¯2.5 × 1067.1 × 1044.0 × 104Boc-VPR-pNALimulus clotting enzymeNIcNI, not inhibited under the assay conditions.4.3 × 1053.7 × 104Boc-LGR-pNALimulus factor G¯NI cNI, not inhibited under the assay conditions.8.2 × 1043.9 × 105Boc-E(OBzl)GR-MCAα-ChymotrypsinNI cNI, not inhibited under the assay conditions.3.7 × 1041.2 × 105Suc-AAPF-MCAa,b Taken from documented data(7Miura Y.

Glycosaminoglycans potentiate the anticoagulant activities of antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II (27Björk I. Danielsson A. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Protease Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1986: 489Google Scholar, 28Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Google Scholar). Therefore, effects of glycosaminoglycans (50 and 500 μg/ml) on LICI-3 activity were tested. Glycosaminoglycans including heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and dermatan sulfate had little or no effect on the inhibitory activity of LICI-3, respectively (data not shown). Glucans, such as curdlan, laminarin, and (1,4)-β-D-xylan also had no effect on inhibitory activities of the three LICIs (data not shown). Intact LICI-3 (100 pmol) was subjected to amino acid sequence analysis and the partial NH2-terminal sequence of DYLLDEILHLSDVDQQQLSA- was determined. The NH2-terminal Asp was also confirmed by amino acid sequence analysis of the NH2-terminal-derived peptide. The six peptides derived from LICI-3 were isolated and sequenced, the results of which revealed sequences of 68 amino acids, as shown in Fig. 3. The LICI-3-specific probe with a 0.36-kilobase pair insert was identified with oligonucleotides corresponding to peptides derived from LICI-3, using PCR and DNA sequence analyses. When the probe was used to screen a hemocyte cDNA library (500,000 recombinant phages), the one positive clone with a 2.3-kilobase pair insert was subjected to restriction mapping followed by sequence determination of both strands, by sequential exonuclease digestion. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 3. The cDNA included 1,429 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 1,242 nucleotides. A stop codon TAA (nucleotide position 50) was followed by an initiation Met beginning at position 84. The open reading frame for the LICI-3 cDNA encoded for a mature protein of 392 amino acid residues and a signal sequence of 22 residues with a typical hydrophobic core. Cleavage at the Gly−1-Asn+1 bond with a typical motif for the recognition of signal peptidase (29von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Google Scholar) was presumed to give a mature protein with an NH2-terminal sequence identical with that of the purified LICI-3, except for the NH2-terminal Asp of the purified protein. A DNA fragment of 274 bp coding the NH2-terminal region of the mature protein was then amplified by PCR, using limulus hemocyte cDNA as a template. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product also coded the Asn at the corresponding position (data not shown). The amino acid analysis of LICI-3 agreed well with the amino acid composition deduced from the cDNA (Table III). Like LICI-2 (no cysteine residues in LICI-1), LICI-3 contains two cysteine residues in the deduced amino acid sequence, and 1.9 mol of cysteic acids were detected after performic acid oxidation. These cysteine residues probably form a disulfide bridge, since carboxymethylcysteines were detected only in the hydrolysate of the sample S-alkylated after reduction (data not shown).Table III.Amino acid and sugar compositions of LICI-1, LICI-2, and LICI-3Amino acid/sugarLICI-1aLICI-2bLICI-3residues/molecule cExtrapolated or average values estimated from 24-, 48-, and 72-h hydrolysates.

https://openalex.org/W1546399044,"The α2 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase exhibits kinetic behavior distinct from that of the α1 isoform. The distinctive behavior is apparent when the reaction is carried out under conditions (micromolar ATP concentration) in which the K+ deocclusion pathway of the reaction cycle is rate-limiting; the α1 activity is inhibited by K+, whereas α2 is stimulated. When 32 NH2-terminal amino acid residues are removed from α1, the kinetic behavior of the mutant enzyme (α1M32) is similar to that of α2 (Daly, S. E., Lane, L. K., and Blostein, R. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 23944-23948). In the current study, the region of the α1 NH2 terminus involved in modulating this kinetic behavior has been localized to the highly charged sequence comprising residues 24-32. Within this nonapeptide, differences between α1 and α2 are conservative and are confined to residues 25-27. The behavior of two chimeric enzymes: (i) α1 with the first 32 residues identical to the α2 sequence, α1 (1-32α2), and (ii) α2 with the first 32 residues identical to the α1 sequence, α2(1-32α1), indicates that the distinctive kinetic behavior of α1 and α2 is not due to the 24-32 NH2-terminal domain, per se, but rather to its interaction with other, isoform-specific region(s) of the α1 protein. We also demonstrate that the distinct K+ activation profiles of either α2 or α1M32, compared to α1 is due to a faster release of K+ from the K+-occluded enzyme, and to a higher affinity for ATP. This was determined in studies using two approaches: (i) kinetic analysis of the reaction modeled according to a branched pathway of K+ deocclusion through low and high affinity ATP pathways and, (ii) measurements of the (rapid) phosphorylation of the enzyme (E1 conformation) by [γ-32P]ATP following the rate-limiting formation of the K+-free enzyme from the K+-occluded state (E2(K) → E1+ K+). The observed kinetic differences between α2 and α1 suggest that these Na,K-ATPase isoforms differ in the steady-state distribution of E1 and E2 conformational states.

https://openalex.org/W2076303714,"Pleuragramma antarcticum (suborder Notothenioidei, family Nototheniidae) is the most abundant fish in the antarctic shelf. This pelagic species has a circum-antarctic distribution and is characterized by spawning migration. This species displays the highest multiplicity of major hemoglobins (three); the other notothenioids have a single one (except one species, having two) with relatively low oxygen affinity regulated by pH and organophosphates. The hemoglobins of P. antarcticum display strong Bohr and Root effects; however, they reveal important functional differences in subunit cooperativity and organophosphate regulation and, above all, in the response of oxygenation to temperature. Despite the substitution ValβE11 → Ile found in Hb 2, which decreases the affinity in human mutants, the hemoglobins have similar oxygen affinity, higher than that of the other notothenioids. Hb 1 has the α chain in common with Hb 2 and the β in common with Hb 3. The amino acid sequence of all four chains has been established. Thus the hematological features of P. antarcticum differ remarkably from those of antarctic notothenioids. This unique and sophisticated oxygen transport system may adequately meet the requirements of the unusual mode of life of this fish.

The high-antarctic shelf waters are characterized by low and constant temperatures (−1.6°C to −2.1°C). Confined within the antarctic convergence, fish have developed mechanisms of adaptation to extreme life conditions. Blood has a reduced number of erythrocytes, counterbalancing the viscosity increase due to low temperature, and a lower hemoglobin (Hb) 1The abbreviations used are: HbhemoglobinHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographybisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. content (17Everson I.

The number of Hb components is also reduced. Red-blooded families of the suborder Notothenioidei generally have only a single Hb (Hb 1), accounting for 95-99% of the total content, and often a minor component, Hb 2 (12di Prisco G. D'Avino R.

Our studies on the biochemistry of oxygen transport in antarctic fish have focused on the molecular structure and the oxygen binding properties of Hbs in search of correlations with life style and evolution of Notothenioidei (13di Prisco G. Tamburrini M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 102B: 661-671Google Scholar and 31Tamburrini M. Brancaccio A. Ippoliti R. di Prisco G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 295-302Google Scholar). This suborder is 97% endemic and comprises 95 of the 274 antarctic species so far identified (2Andriashev A.P. Kullander S.O. Fernholm B. Proceedings of the V Congress of European Ichthyologists, Stockholm, 1985. Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm1987: 357-372Google Scholar), which are grouped into the families Bovichtidae, Nototheniidae, Bathydraconidae, Harpagiferidae, Artedidraconidae, and Channichthyidae (recent evidence suggests that Bovichtidae should be divided into Pseudaphritidae and Bovichtidae). Many Hbs of species belonging to the five (or six) red-blooded families have been functionally characterized, and their amino acid sequence has been established (15di Prisco G. D'Avino R. Caruso C.

Pelagic Pleuragramma antarcticum (family Nototheniidae) is overwhelmingly dominant, by number and biomass, in high- antarctic shelf areas. With a key role in the ecosystem and food web of the shelf, this ecologically important species has a circum-antarctic distribution and migrates across different water masses (1Andersen N.C. Steenstrupia. 1984; 10: 1-34Google Scholar; 20Hubold G. Siegfried W.R. Condy P.R. Laws R.M. Antarctic Nutrient Cycles and Food Webs. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1985: 445Google Scholar; 23Kunzmann A. Polar Biol. 1990; 11: 9-18Google Scholar). The reproductive habits (P. antarcticum spawns pelagic eggs) reflect adaptation for pelagic life. The studies on adaptation to extreme conditions have been extended to P. antarcticum in view of its ecological importance and unusual mode of life. This paper reports a thorough study on the oxygen transport system of this species. Among Notothenioidei, P. antarcticum is the only species having three major Hbs. Their amino acid sequence, oxygen binding properties, and thermodynamic features have been investigated. DEAE-cellulose (DE 52) was from Whatman; trypsin (EC) treated with L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethylketone was from Cooper Biomedical; Tris and bisTris were from Sigma; dithiothreitol was from Fluka; sequanal-grade reagents were from Applied Biosystems; and HPLC grade acetonitrile from Lab-Scan Analytical. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. The fish were caught in the Weddell Sea by benthopelagic trawl. Blood samples were drawn from the caudal vein by means of heparinized syringes. Hemolysates were prepared as described (7D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90B: 579-584Google Scholar and 11di Prisco G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90B: 631-637Google Scholar). Cellulose acetate electrophoresis of the hemolysate and of the purified Hb components and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified globin chains were carried out as described (9D'Avino R. Caruso C. Romano M. Camardella L. Rutigliano B. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 707-713Google Scholar and 12di Prisco G. D'Avino R. Antarct. Sci. 1989; 1: 119-124Google Scholar; 24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). In each globin, alkylation of the sulfhydryl groups with 4-vinylpyridine, deacetylation of the α-chain N terminus, tryptic digestions, and cleavage of Asp-Pro bonds were carried out as described (9D'Avino R. Caruso C. Romano M. Camardella L. Rutigliano B. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 707-713Google Scholar; 31Tamburrini M. Brancaccio A. Ippoliti R. di Prisco G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 295-302Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC of the hydrolysates on a μBondapak-C18 column (Waters, 0.39 × 30 cm), equilibrated with eluent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and eluted with a multistep gradient of eluent B (acetonitrile, containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid). Amino acid analyses were performed with an Applied Biosystems automatic derivatizer model 420A, equipped with the hydrolysis option and on-line detection of phenylthiocarbamyl amino acids. Amino acid sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems automatic sequencer model 477A, equipped with on-line detection of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids. Sequencing of Asp-Pro-cleaved globins was performed after treatment with o-phthalaldehyde (3Brauer A.W. Oman C.L. Margolies M.N Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 134-142Google Scholar), which blocked the non-Pro N terminus and reduced the background. Oxygen saturation experiments were carried out at 2°C, as described (8D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 699-705Google Scholar and 12di Prisco G. D'Avino R. Antarct. Sci. 1989; 1: 119-124Google Scholar). Oxygen equilibrium curves were determined tonometrically (19Giardina B. Amiconi G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 417-427Google Scholar) at 2 and 10°C, in the pH range 6.5-8.0. The overall oxygenation enthalpy change ΔH (kcal/mol; 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ) corrected for the heat of oxygen solubilization (−3 kcal/mol) was calculated by the integrated van't Hoff equation: ΔH=−4.574[(T1⋅T2)/(T1−T2)]ΔlogP50/1000(Eq. 1) Electrophoretic analysis on cellulose acetate of the hemolysate of P. antarcticum showed three major Hb components (Hb 1, Hb 2, and Hb 3). These were purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DE 52 (Fig. 1). Elution was carried out at pH 7.6 at 50, 80, and 200 mM Tris-HCl, respectively. Trace amounts of a fourth component coeluted with Hb 3. The globin chains were isolated by reverse-phase chromatography of the purified Hbs, according to a previously described procedure (9D'Avino R. Caruso C. Romano M. Camardella L. Rutigliano B. di Prisco G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 707-713Google Scholar and 12di Prisco G. D'Avino R. Antarct. Sci. 1989; 1: 119-124Google Scholar). Their elution times, amino acid composition, and migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that Hb 1 has the α chain in common with Hb 2 and the β chain in common with Hb 3. Hb 2 and Hb 3 have no chain in common. These observations were subsequently confirmed by the amino acid sequence analysis. Thus, the Hb system of P. antarcticum is made of two α and two β chains. The N terminus of the α chain in common between Hb 1 and Hb 2 (αa) and of the α chain of Hb 3 (αb) was not available to Edman degradation. Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the N-terminal tryptic peptide of the αa and αb chains revealed that the blocking group was acetyl, similar to all teleost Hbs sequenced to date. An internal region became accessible in both α chains after cleavage of an Asp-Pro bond. After treatment with o-phthalaldehyde, sequencing proceeded from Pro96 to Val124 in the αa chain, and from Pro96 to Val122 in the αb chain. Tryptic peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Fig. 2 shows the chromatographic patterns of αa (panel A) and αb (panel B) chains. In αa, all peptides were identified and sequenced except T2. The latter was sequenced directly from the N terminus after deacetylation by acid treatment. This procedure provided the amino acid sequence of T1 and T2 and overlap from T1 to T3. Due to the presence of Lys in both positions 61 and 62, tryptic digestion produced T10A and T10B, both ending at Lys73. T12 and T13 were isolated as individual peptides and in the uncleaved form T(12+13), due to cleavage failure at Arg93. A single peptide was isolated containing the C-terminal region from Ile101 to Arg142 (T14 to T17), as well as another peptide containing residues from Ile101 to Arg140 (T14 to T16). T15 and T17 were also identified. The sequence obtained after Asp-Pro cleavage provided overlap from T13 to T15. In αb, all peptides were identified and sequenced. T1 was sequenced after partial deacetylation of N-terminal Ser. T2 contained two lysyl residues, because trypsin failed to cleave at Lys7. Due to the sequence Arg57-Lys58, T7A and T7B were obtained, both starting with Glu48. Three forms of peptide T8 were isolated due to a deamidation site (Asn65-Gly66) in the native peptide (T8B). Partially deamidated T8 (T8C), having Asp instead of Asn at position 65, was also sequenced; moreover, sequencing of another form of T8 (T8A) stopped at Met64, suggesting the presence of an isoaspartyl residue at position 65 as a result of the deamidation mechanism (18Galletti P. Ciardiello A. Ingrosso D. Di Donato A. D'Alessio G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1752-1757Google Scholar). Due to partial cleavage failure at Lys128, Arg135, and Lys140, C-terminal T(11+12+13+14) from Ile101 to Arg142 and T(11+12) from Ile101 to Arg135 were also isolated. The sequence obtained after Asp-Pro cleavage provided overlap between T10 and T11. Direct sequencing from the N terminus proceeded for 34 residues in the β chain in common between Hb 1 and Hb 3 (βa), and for 30 residues in the β chain of Hb 2 (βb). After cleavage of an internal Asp-Pro bond and treatment with o-phthalaldehyde, sequencing proceeded from Pro100 to Glu125 in βa and from Pro100 to Asn120 in βb. Tryptic peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Fig. 2 shows the chromatographic patterns of βa (panel C) and βb (panel D) chains. All peptides were identified and sequenced. In βb, due to incomplete cleavage at Lys17, peptide T(2+3), from Ala9 to Arg30, was also isolated; moreover, T10 and T11 coeluted. Sequencing from the N terminus provided overlap from T1 to T4 in βa and from T1 to T3 in βb. The sequences obtained after Asp-Pro cleavage provided overlap between T9 and T10 in βa and from T9 to T11 in βb. The complete sequence of the two α and two β chains (142 and 146 residues, respectively) constituting the three Hbs of P. antarcticum is reported in Fig. 3. Alignment of the tryptic peptides was obtained by the described overlaps and by homology with other known fish Hb sequences. The derived chain composition of Hb 1, Hb 2, and Hb 3 is, respectively, αa2βa2, αa2βb2 and αb2βa2. A fourth component, isolated in trace amounts, differed from Hb 3 only in having Glu instead of Gln at position 94 of the β chain. Table I., Table II. summarize the degree of sequence identity among antarctic and non-antarctic fish Hbs. It is worth noting that the chains of Hb 2 and Hb 3 that are not in common with Hb 1 have a high degree of identity with those of minor Hbs from antarctic fish; in particular, the αb chain of Hb 3 has 90-92% identity with α chains of Hb 2 of the other antarctic species, and the βb chain of Hb 2 has 86 and 91% identity with the β chain of Cygnodraco mawsoni Hb 2 (5Caruso C.

Open table in a new tab Hb 1, Hb 2, and Hb 3 showed a very strong, effector-enhanced dependence of oxygen affinity on pH (alkaline Bohr effect). At 2°C the Bohr coefficient (ϕ = Δlog P50/ΔpH, where P50 is the partial pressure of oxygen required to saturate 50% of the hemes) ranged from −0.9 to −1.0 in the absence and from −1.0 to −1.23 in the presence, of chloride and organophosphates (Fig. 4). The oxygen affinity of the three Hbs was very high, P50 at pH 8.0 ranging from 1.97 to 2.99 mm of Hg in the absence and from 2.14 to 3.8 mm of Hg in the presence of the physiological effectors. In comparison with Hb 1 and Hb 2, at 2°C Hb 3 showed a lower cooperativity (enhanced by organophosphates) of oxygen binding, as indicated by the Hill coefficient nH. At pH 6.5, the values of nH were close to one in all components. The Root effect (29Root R.W. Biol. Bull. Mar. Biol. Lab. Woods Hole. 1931; 61: 427-456Google Scholar; 4Brittain T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86B: 473-481Google Scholar) was also displayed by the three components, and its amplitude was enhanced by the effectors (Fig. 5), indicating a strong pH dependence of Hb oxygenation in air. The effect of temperature on the oxygen affinity showed that Hb 1, Hb 2, and Hb 3 had different values of heat of oxygenation both in the absence and the presence of the effectors (Table III). Moreover, in their absence, Hb 3 showed the largest ΔH variation between pH 7.0 and 8.0 (16.4 kcal/mol; 2.5 and 2.8 kcal/mol were shown by Hb 1 and Hb 2, respectively), whereas in the presence of the effectors, it showed the smallest variation (3.5 kcal/mol; Hb 1 and Hb 2 showed 8.8 and 6.3 kcal/mol, respectively).Table IIIHeat of oxygenation of P. antarcticum Hbs100 mM NaCl, 3 mM ATPΔH (kcal/mol O2)pH 7.0pH 8.0Hb 1−−12.8−15.3+−8.6−17.4Hb 2−−3.6−6.4+−1.8−8.1Hb 3−−0.1−16.5+−4.1−7.6 Open table in a new tab Most Notothenioidei have a single Hb (Hb 1), often accompanied by a minor component (Hb 2).

Romano M. di Prisco G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 273-282Google Scholar). A cathodal Hb (Hb C), with the α chain in common with Hb 1, is present in trace amounts, except in T. newnesi, in which it accounts for 20-25% of the total (15di Prisco G. D'Avino R. Caruso C. Tamburrini M. Camardella L. Rutigliano B. Carratore V. Romano R. di Prisco G. Maresca B. Tota B. Biology of Antarctic Fish. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 263Google Scholar). The hemolysate of P. antarcticum (a high antarctic fish with circum-antarctic distribution characterized by spawning migrations) contains three major Hbs. Similar to other antarctic species, there is high sequence identity between the chains of P. antarcticum Hb 1 and those of major Hbs from antarctic fish and low identity with non-antarctic fish globins. The oxygen affinity of the three Hbs is much higher than that of the other notothenioids. In Hb 2, the substitution ValβE11 → Ile, reported to be responsible for lower affinity in engineered human Hb at alkaline pH (27Nagai K. Luisi B. Shi D. Miyazaki G. Imai K. Poyart C. De Young A.

Furthermore, the substitution GluFG1 → Gln in the βa chain, identical in Hb 1 and Hb 3, does not hinder a strong Root effect. Thus, in these Hbs, the Root effect must be due to other mechanisms than formation of a salt bridge between GluβFG1 and HisβHC3, as suggested by 22Ito N. Komiyama N.H. Fermi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 648-658Google Scholar for the Root effect Hb of the antarctic teleost Pagothenia bernacchii, because no such salt bridge was found in the T state. In P. bernacchii AspαG1, AspβG3, and AspβG1 interact with each other, and half of the Root effect has been ascribed to these interactions (22Ito N. Komiyama N.H. Fermi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 648-658Google Scholar); these residues are also found in the Hbs of P. antarcticum. Within the positive charge cluster recently proposed by 26Mylvaganam S.E. Bonaventura C.

The constraints that stabilize the positive charge cluster once again cannot include the bond between GlnβHC1 and GluβFG1 in Hb 1 and Hb 3, because in FG1 Glu is replaced by Gln. Among the other amino acid residues suggested by 28Perutz M.F. Brunori M.

The three Hbs of P. antarcticum are similar in several oxygen binding features, e.g. they all display the Bohr and Root effects, but they show differences and peculiarities that deserve some comments. Organophosphates enhance cooperativity at all pH values higher than 6.5 and lower the oxygen affinity also at pH 8.0 in Hb 3 only, indicating strong interaction with the binding site even under alkaline conditions. However, attention should mainly be addressed to the thermodynamic differentiation of the three components. Hb 1 and Hb 3 show a very strong enthalpy change at pH 8.0 further enhanced by chloride and organophosphates in the former but drastically decreased in the latter; the heat of oxygenation of Hb 2 in the presence and absence of effectors is much lower. A dramatic decrease is observed at lower pH in Hb 3 and also in Hb 2 (ΔH approaches zero in both); in contrast, Hb 1 retains high oxygenation enthalpy (slightly lower in the presence of effectors). These observations clearly indicate a stronger Bohr effect at physiological temperatures in Hb 1 (in the presence of effectors) and Hb 3 (in their absence). In addition, the moderate effect of temperature on Hb 2 in the pH range 7.0-8.0 and on Hb 3 at pH 7.0 is indicative of energy-saving mechanisms of oxygen loading and unloading. The ensemble of thermodynamic features of the three components is likely to reflect highly refined molecular mechanisms of adaptation to a pelagic life style. Among the investigated species of Nototheniidae and of the other red-blooded families of the suborder Notothenioidei, P. antarcticum is the only one having such a high multiplicity of major components. T. newnesi also has three Hbs: Hb C, Hb 1, and Hb 2 (10D'Avino R. Caruso C. Tamburrini M. Romano M. Rutigliano B. Polverino de Laureto P. Camardella L. Carratore V. di Prisco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9675-9681Google Scholar). However, the latter is a minor component, and only one (Hb C) of the two major components displays the Bohr and Root effects. The mode of life of these two notothenioids is widely different. The Hb system of T. newnesi (an active, cryopelagic fish) must conceivably ensure oxygen delivery to tissues also in conditions of acidosis. In turn, P. antarcticum, albeit a migratory, pelagic species, is considered sluggish (see 16Eastman J.T. Antarctic Fish Biology: Evolution in a Unique Environment. Academic Press, San Diego1993Google Scholar, p. 218). The main adaptive feature of the Hb system of this fish should conceivably be the response to the need to save energy during migration across water regions where the low temperature is likely to show significant differences and fluctuations. A single Hb (or none at all) appears sufficient to the other notothenioids, all sedentary bottom feeders. P. antarcticum can instead rely on three major Hbs, which differ in subunit cooperativity, phosphate regulation, and, above all, overall heat of oxygenation and influence of pH on temperature regulation of oxygen affinity. It is tempting to speculate that during evolution the oxygen transport system of P. antarcticum has developed physiological and biochemical adaptations suitable to allow optimal energy savings during the oxygenation-deoxygenation cycle under different and extreme environmental conditions, producing Hbs differing in thermodynamic behavior rather than in pH and organophosphate regulation. From this standpoint and on the basis of their relative amounts, the three components of P. antarcticum, unlike the minor components found in the benthic notothenioids, cannot be considered as evolutionary remnants devoid of physiological significance (15di Prisco G. D'Avino R. Caruso C. Tamburrini M. Camardella L. Rutigliano B. Carratore V. Romano R. di Prisco G. Maresca B. Tota B. Biology of Antarctic Fish. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 263Google Scholar), even though the sequence data reveal high phylogenetic distance between Hb 1 and the globins of Hb 2 and Hb 3 that are not in common (see Table I., Table II.). In fact, as in T. newnesi, the selective advantage offered by multiple Hb genes appears clearly. The expression of multiple genes remains high in these two species also in the adult stage, in closer similarity with juveniles (di Prisco et al., unpublished), suggesting refined mechanisms of regulation within the gene family. It is of interest noting the loss of Hb expression in Hb-less Channichthyidae, in which retention in the genome of inactive α-globin-related sequences has been demonstrated (6Cocca E.

To address the effects of apoA-I modification on cellular unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC) efflux, three recombinant human apoA-I deletion mutants and plasma apoA-I were combined with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and FC to make reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL) discoidal complexes. These particles were characterized structurally and for their efficiency as acceptors of mouse L-cell fibroblast cholesterol. The deletion mutant proteins lacked NH2-terminal (apoA-I (Δ44-126)), central (apoA-I (Δ139-170)), or COOH-terminal (apoA-I (Δ190-243)) domains of apoA-I. The three deletion mutants all displayed lipid-binding abilities and formed discoidal complexes that were similar in major diameter (13.2 ± 1.5 nm) to those formed by human apoA-I when reconstituted at a 100:5:1 (POPC:FC:protein) mole ratio. Gel filtration profiles indicated unreacted protein in the preparation made with apoA-I (Δ190-243), which is consistent with the COOH terminus portion of apoA-I being an important determinant of lipid binding. Measurements of the percent α-helix content of the proteins, as well as the number of protein molecules per rHDL particle, gave an indication of the arrangement of the deletion mutant proteins in the discoidal complexes. The rHDL particles containing the deletion mutants had more molecules of protein present than particles containing intact apoA-I, to the extent that a similar number of helical segments was incorporated into each of the discoidal species. Comparison of the experimentally determined number of helical segments with an estimate of the available space indicated that the deletion mutant proteins are probably more loosely arranged than apoA-I around the edge of the rHDL. The abilities of the complexes to remove radiolabeled FC were compared in experiments using cultured mouse L-cell fibroblasts. All four discoidal complexes displayed similar abilities to remove FC from the plasma membrane of L-cells when compared at an acceptor concentration of 50 μg of phospholipid/ml. Thus, none of the deletions imposed in this study notably altered the ability of the rHDL particles to participate in cellular FC efflux. These results suggest that efficient apoA-I-mediated FC efflux requires the presence of amphipathic α-helical segments but is not dependent on specific helical segments.

https://openalex.org/W1999802160,"The outer envelope protein OEP86 functions as a receptor for precursor proteins in the chloroplastic import machinery. In contrast to most other organellar outer membrane proteins it is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide (preOEP86) in the cytosol and is post-translationally targeted to the organelles. PreOEP86 is targeted to and productively inserted into the chloroplastic outer envelope mediated by a bipartite signal consisting of the presequence and the COOH terminus of the precursor protein.

The vast majority of mitochondrial and chloroplastic protein constituents are nuclear encoded, synthesized in the cytosol, and post-translationally imported into the organelles (1de Boer A.D.

In general, proteins are made as precursors with NH2-terminal transit sequences, which contain the information necessary for targeting to the proper organelle and in many cases also for routing inside the organelle (1de Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Google Scholar). In contrast, nuclear encoded polypeptide constituents of the chloroplastic outer envelope membranes are generally not synthesized as larger precursor proteins but contain internal targeting information (3Soll J.

This insertion process does not require the hydrolysis of ATP or protease-sensitive chloroplast surface components (3Soll J. Alefsen H. Böckler B. Kerber B. Salomon M. Waegemann K Neupert W. Lill R. Membrane Biogenesis and Protein Targeting. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 299Google Scholar). In some cases ATP seems to stimulate insertion (5Fischer K. Weber A. Arbinger B.

In contrast, import of precursor proteins into chloroplasts requires the hydrolysis of ATP at several steps during the process and involves protease-sensitive chloroplast surface components (1de Boer A.D.

Several constituents of the precursor protein import machinery of the chloroplastic outer envelope membrane have been identified recently, namely the outer envelope proteins of 86, 75, 44, and 34 kDa (OEP86, OEP75, OEP44, and OEP34) (9Wu C.

Biochemical data suggest that OEP86 functions as a receptor for precursors (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar), whereas OEP75 could form the central protein conducting channel of the outer envelope translocase (11Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 93-105Google Scholar). OEP86 and OEP75 are both synthesized with NH2-terminal cleavable presequences (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar, 15Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2445Google Scholar). To date OEP86 and OEP75 are the only known proteins of an organellar outer membrane, which are made with a presequence. The presequence of preOEP75 contains typical features of stroma directing envelope transfer domains of “normal” chloroplastic precursors and biochemical evidence indicated that preOEP75 uses components of the general chloroplast protein import machinery (15Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2445Google Scholar). In contrast to stroma targeting signals, the presequence of preOEP86 is unusually long (15 kDa) and highly negatively charged. The productive translocation of preOEP86 into the chloroplastic outer envelope is dependent on ATP and requires protease-sensitive chloroplast surface components but does not use the general import machinery (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar). These data indicate that a unique pathway has developed for the translocation of the protein import receptor into the chloroplastic outer envelope membrane. In this study we have analyzed the role of the cleavable presequence of preOEP86 and that of internal sequences for targeting and insertion into the chloroplastic outer envelope membrane. Surprisingly the presequence of preOEP86 alone does not contain sufficient targeting information for chloroplasts but a productive translocation process requires a bipartite signal that is present in the presequence as well as in the COOH terminus of preOEP86. Our data suggest further that preOEP86 interacts initially with proteinaceous chloroplast surface components in an ATP-dependent step. The COOH terminus of preOEP86 seems to contain two domains, one that serves as a membrane anchor and one that is necessary for productive folding. The cDNA coding for preOEP86 in the vector pET17b (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J.

To obtain a cDNA coding for mOEP86, which could be used for in vitro transcription and translation, an additional NdeI site was introduced at the processing site of preOEP86 by in vitro mutagenesis. The primers used for the PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionpre …precursor form of …SSUsmall subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenaseAMP-PNP5′-adenylylimidodiphosphate. were 5′-CGTCCCAATCATATGGCTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCCATATTGTTGGACC-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was cloned into preOEP86-pET24c after restriction with NdeI, resulting in mOEP86-pET24c. The DNA sequence was controlled by sequencing (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl.

A SphI site was introduced into preOEP86-pET17b by in vitro mutagenesis using the following primers for the PCR 5′-GCTCTACGCATGCAAGGAGC-3′ (reverse) and T7 universal primer (forward). The PCR product was subcloned into the vector pGEM5Zf(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) after restriction with NdeI and SphI resulting in clone pre86-pGEM5Zf(+). A cDNA fragment coding for SSU was obtained by restriction of preSSU-pSP64 (17Lubben T.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The coding sequence of the resulting clone pre86SSU-pET24c was verified by sequencing. It contained amino acids 1-149 of preOEP86 and the entire coding sequence of mature SSU. A SphI/SacI fragment from preSSU-pSP64 (17Lubben T.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Due to poor translation efficiency of SSUc86-pGEM5Zf(+), it was subcloned in one step into the vector pSELECT (Promega) after restriction with SphI/EcoRI. A KpnI/BamHI fragment from SSUc86 in pGEM5Zf(+) was ligated into preSSU-pSP64 (17Lubben T.H. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For transcription-translation and expression in Escherichia coli a NcoI/XhoI fragment of mOEP86-pET24c was cloned into pET21d (Novagen). The COOH-terminal deleted polypeptides preOEP86137, preOEP86347, preOEP86542, preOEP86697, and preOEP86775 were obtained by in vitro transcription-translation after restriction of preOEP86pET17b using PstI, SpeI, HindIII, NcoI, and BanI, respectively. mRNAs were obtained using either SP6 or T7 RNA-polymerase depending on the promoter present in the vector construct. The mRNAs were translated in a reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine as described before (4Salomon M. Fischer K. Flügge U.-I. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5778-5782Google Scholar). OEP86-C699-879 was overexpressed in E. coli BL21De3 cells and recovered in inclusion bodies (18Waegemann K. Soll J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 255-267Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were isolated from pea leaves as described before (13Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Google Scholar). A standard import assay contained chloroplasts equivalent to 30 μg of chlorophyll (19Arnon D.J. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Google Scholar) and was carried out for 15-25 min at 25 or 4°C in a final volume of 200 μl and 2-5% (v/v) translation product. Chloroplasts were treated with the protease thermolysin either before (750 μg of protease mg−1 chlorophyll, 30 min, 4°C) or after import (100 μg of protease mg−1 chlorophyll, 15 min, 4°C). Intact chloroplasts were recovered prior to further experimentation or analysis. The detailed procedure is as outlined in 13Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Google Scholar. ATP was removed from the translation mixture by the addition of hexokinase and glucose (20Schindler C. Hracky R. Soll J. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 103-108Google Scholar). To investigate the insertion of mOEP86 and its precursor form preOEP86, both were synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate and incubated with intact pea chloroplasts (Fig. 1A). PreOEP86 binds to chloroplasts and is processed to the mature form, OEP86 (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Upon protease treatment, processed mature OEP86 is cleaved and a residual 52-kDa proteolytic fragment can be detected (Fig. 1A, lane 2). This 52-kDa fragment of OEP86 represents a COOH-terminal portion of the protein (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar) and can be used as a parameter for the correct folding of the protein in situ and in vitro (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar, 23Waegemann K. Eichacker S. Soll J. Planta. 1992; 187: 89-94Google Scholar). These data indicate that preOEP86 added to chloroplasts had inserted and folded correctly in the chloroplastic outer envelope. In contrast when translation product of mOEP86 was offered to chloroplasts, binding was observed but much less 52 kDa breakdown product was seen (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that the presequence of OEP86 was necessary for a productive translocation process. To characterize further the nature of the interaction between chloroplasts and preOEP86 or mOEP86, respectively, organelles were separated into a soluble and a membrane fraction. The membranes were then extracted at high pH (pH 11, 0.1 M Na2CO3). As shown (Fig. 1B) preOEP86, processed mature OEP86 or mOEP86 were recovered exclusively in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5 and 6) and were resistant to extraction at high pH (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4 and lanes 7 and 8), indicating that preOEP86 as well as mOEP86 interacted with chloroplasts by a protein-lipid interaction. The respective translation products were recovered in the soluble fraction (not shown and 12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar). These data indicate that an insertion or targeting signal exists in the mature form of OEP86, which might help to anchor the protein into the membrane, whereas the presequence of preOEP86 seems to stimulate the productive translocation process. To analyze the role of the presequence of preOEP86 in more detail, a hybrid protein was constructed, which consisted of the presequence of preOEP86, i.e. amino acids 1-149, fused in frame with the mature SSU of Rubisco (pre86SSU) to compare its targeting properties with that of preSSU. We were unable to detect any binding or interaction of pre86SSU translation product to chloroplasts either at 50 μM ATP or 2 mM ATP (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4) not even under very rapid recovery conditions by centrifugation through a silicon oil layer into HClO4 (24Wirtz W.

Although it cannot be excluded that targeting information present in the presequence of preOEP86 is hidden in the hybrid protein pre86SSU in vitro due to improper folding, we conclude that the presequence of preOEP86 does not contain enough information on its own to target a protein to chloroplasts, but additional internal OEP86 sequences are required for a productive targeting and insertion process. We constructed a number of preOEP86 deletions to define further regions in the polypeptide that were responsible for a targeting and productive insertion (Fig. 2B). The mode of interaction between chloroplasts and preOEP86 deletions, for which a binding to chloroplasts was observed, was further analyzed by extraction at pH 11 (0.1 M Na2CO3) (25Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Google Scholar). The detection of a protease-resistant fragment of a preOEP86 construct was taken as a measure for a certain extent of folding and insertion into the membrane. Thus, by using alkaline extraction and proteolytic fragmentation, we could distinguish between two stages in the interaction process of preOEP86 with chloroplasts. Our results (Fig. 2B) indicate that neither the presequence of preOEP86, namely preOEP86137 itself, nor preOEP86347 bound to chloroplasts, whereas preOEP86542 and preOEP86697 bound with low efficiency (10-20% of full-length preOEP86) (Fig. 2B). Only preOEP86 and preOEP86775 bound to chloroplasts with similar yield, i.e. 5-10% of the total translation product added to a binding experiment. Both preproteins were completely recovered in the alkaline insoluble fraction, whereas preOEP86542 and preOEP86697 were recovered in the alkaline-soluble fraction (Fig. 2B). Thus, a short COOH-terminal stretch between amino acids 697-775 of preOEP86 seems to be responsible for the alkaline-resistant interaction with the chloroplastic outer envelope. To obtain further evidence for this notion a NH2-terminal deletion of OEP86 was constructed, namely OEP86-C699-879, which contained only the COOH-terminal 180 amino acids. OEP86-C699-879 inserted into the outer envelope membrane in a way that was resistant to alkaline extraction (Fig. 2B). When chloroplasts were treated with the protease thermolysin after an insertion experiment, no protease protected product could be detected (Fig. 2B) from any of the preOEP86 deletion constructs or from OEP86-C699-879 except for the full-length preOEP86 (Fig. 2B). From these data we conclude that a COOH-terminal portion of preOEP86 anchors the protein into the lipid bilayer. In addition the COOH-terminal portion of preOEP86 and its presequence might have to cooperate to insure not only targeting but a productive integration process of preOEP86 as evidenced by the appearance of the 52-kDa breakdown product from the full-length precursor only. Indeed this conclusion is consistent with studies presented below. The COOH terminus of OEP86 might act as a sorting sequence and membrane anchor for the chloroplastic outer envelope membrane. To study this point we constructed hybrid proteins consisting of either the mature or the precursor form of SSU fused in frame to amino acids 653-879 of preOEP86 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), resulting in the constructs SSUc86 and pre SSUc86. When intact chloroplasts were incubated with SSUc86 translation product in the presence of different ATP concentrations, about 5-10% of the added protein bound to chloroplasts (Fig. 3A, upper panel). The yield of binding was not significantly influenced by the various ATP levels (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 3). No interaction was detected between chloroplasts and SSU translation product (Fig. 3A, lower panel, lanes 1-4), demonstrating that the COOH terminus of OEP86 was responsible for the interaction of SSUc86 with chloroplasts. Chloroplasts bound SSUc86 was susceptible to protease treatment and was completely degraded (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 2 and 4), indicating that import to the inside of the organelle had not occurred. Furthermore the data demonstrate that the SSU portion of the hybrid protein was exposed on the organellar surface and not to the intermembrane space. SSUc86 was recovered in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2) and was resistant to extraction by 0.1 M Na2CO3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Together these data indicate that the COOH terminus of OEP86 can anchor an otherwise soluble protein into the outer envelope membrane in a way that it is exposed to the cytosol.Fig. 4PreSSU cannot function as an efficient envelope transfer stroma targeting domain for the carboxyl terminus of OEP86. A, the radiolabeled precursor proteins preSSUc86 or preSSU were incubated with chloroplasts under binding, i.e. 50 μM ATP, or import, i.e. 2 mM ATP, conditions. The experiment was stopped and chloroplasts either not treated or treated with the protease thermolysin (Th) (see Fig. 1). The preSSU translocation intermediates are labeled Tim 3 and Tim 4 (13Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Google Scholar, 28Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Google Scholar). B, the suborganellar localization of preSSUc86, preSSU, SSUc86, and SSU was tested under binding and import conditions by separating the organelles into a soluble protein (S) and membrane fraction (P). The membrane fraction was further subjected to extraction by pH 11 (0.1 M Na2CO3) (P, pellet; S, soluble protein; for details see Fig. 1). TL, translation product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The presequences of chloroplast proteins localized in the inner envelope, the stroma, or the thylakoids function as an envelope transfer stroma targeting domain, even allowing membrane proteins, which contain multiple α-helical transmembrane helices in vivo, to pass across both the outer and inner chloroplastic envelope membranes (1de Boer A.D. Weisbeek P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 221-253Google Scholar). We thus wanted to know if preSSU could function as an envelope transfer carrier for the COOH terminus of preOEP86 and constructed a hybrid protein in which preSSU was fused to amino acids 653-879 of preOEP86 (see above) resulting in preSSUc86. The fusion protein preSSUc86 bound to chloroplasts in the presence of 50 μM ATP (Fig. 4A, lane 1), conditions that also favor binding of preSSU but that do not allow maximal translocation (Fig. 4A, lane 5) (26Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6724-6729Google Scholar, 27Theg S.M. Bauerle C. Olsen L.J. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6730-6736Google Scholar). When chloroplasts were treated with the protease thermolysin after such a binding experiment, translocation intermediates of preSSU were detected, namely Tim 3 and Tim 4 (Fig. 4A, lane 6), which have been described before (13Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Google Scholar, 28Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Google Scholar). Chloroplast-bound preSSUc86 gave rise to identical translocation intermediates as preSSU (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 6) although with low yield, indicating that some preSSUc86 had entered the general import route across the envelope membranes. Under conditions that allow complete translocation of a precursor protein, i.e. 2 mM ATP, processed mature SSU was detected protease protected inside chloroplasts from preSSU, whereas very little precursor remained at the organellar surface (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8). In contrast most of preSSUc86 remained bound to the chloroplast surface in a protease-accessible way in the presence of 2 mM ATP (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). Between 10-20% of preSSUc86 was found in the processed form, SSUc86, protease protected inside chloroplasts (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4) corroborating our earlier notion that preSSU can indeed function, although with low efficiency, as a carrier for c86. Differences in the interaction of preSSU and preSSUc86 with intact chloroplasts are indicated by differences in localization and mode of interaction. At 50 μM ATP preSSU is recovered together with the membranes, but the majority (between 70 and 80%) is extractable by pH 11 (Fig. 4B, lower panel, lanes 1-4). This is in agreement with data reported before (13Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Google Scholar) under these conditions. Only very little of pre SSUc86 is extractable by 0.1 M Na2CO3 (Fig. 4B, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). The alkaline soluble form of preSSUc86 is most likely the fraction that is bound to the general protein import machinery of chloroplasts via the preSSU portion of the hybrid protein, whereas the insoluble form of preSSUc86 represents the fraction that interacts with the chloroplastic outer envelope via the COOH terminus of OEP86. Processed mature SSU and SSUc86 are recovered in the soluble stroma, and the remaining protein in the membrane fraction is completely alkaline extractable (Fig. 4B, lanes 5-8). The results obtained so far indicated that firstly the presequence of preOEP86 was necessary for an efficient and productive translocation pathway, although it did not contain chloroplast targeting information. Secondly, the COOH terminus of OEP86 is necessary to anchor the protein into the chloroplastic outer envelope. Thirdly, the COOH terminus could also play a role as a sorting signal. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, OEP86-C699-879 was able to insert in an alkaline-resistant way into the chloroplastic outer membrane. Therefore, we wanted to know if overexpressed OEP86-C699-879ex was able to influence binding and insertion of preOEP86 into chloroplasts. In the presence of overexpressed OEP86-C699-879ex proper insertion and folding of preOEP86 translation product was reduced by about 70%, as demonstrated by the reduced yield of mature OEP86 and the 52-kDa fragment (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4). To detect competition at the level of preOEP86 binding to chloroplasts is much more difficult because a significant amount of binding in vitro seems to be nonproductive (see above). Furthermore we do not expect that competition occurs at the level of nonspecific and nonproductive interaction with the bulk lipid phase. However, the results show that OEP86-C699-879ex associates with and partially inhibits most likely proteinaceous components involved in the productive targeting and insertion pathway (Fig. 5). In an attempt to differentiate further between the role of lipids and proteinaceous components in the preOEP86 insertion pathway, chloroplasts were treated with the protease thermolysin prior to an insertion experiment. PreOEP86 bound to chloroplasts either not treated or treated with protease in the presence of ATP. This binding was largely resistant to alkaline extraction (not shown). Only untreated chloroplasts, however, were able to properly insert and fold the protein as deduced from the 52-kDa fragment (not shown). Binding of mOEP86 or OEP86-C699-879 to protease-treated chloroplasts occurred with similar yields as to nontreated chloroplasts. These data indicate that proteinaceous components are involved in the productive binding and insertion process of preOEP86 (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar). When these components are removed a nonproductive interaction occurs in vitro between the outer envelope lipids and preOEP86 most likely via the COOH terminus. To analyze the role of ATP in the translocation pathway, the translation products of preOEP86, preOEP86775, mOEP86, OEP86-C699-879, and preSSU were depleted of ATP by the addition of hexokinase and glucose (20Schindler C. Hracky R. Soll J. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 103-108Google Scholar). This treatment should not influence a potential protein-lipid interaction but only an energy requiring binding process. In the absence of ATP preOEP86, preOEP86775, and preSSU bound only with low yield to chloroplasts in contrast to parallel experiments in the presence of 20 μM ATP, which resulted in a 2-3-fold stimulation of binding depending on the protein used (see Fig. 6). The absence or the presence of ATP, however, did not influence significantly the extent of interaction of those OEP86 forms, which did not contain a presequence, namely mOEP86 and OEP86-C699-879 (Fig. 6). The presequence of OEP86 seems to hinder an unproductive and premature interaction of the COOH terminus with the lipid-phase of the outer envelope membrane. Whether the ATP-requiring step is due to a cytosolic factor present in the reticulocyte lysate or a component in the envelope membranes is not known at the moment. The initial presequence-dependent interaction of preOEP86 with chloroplasts requires ATP (Fig. 6). We wanted to know if further steps, e.g. proper folding were also ATP-dependent. To analyze this, we first studied the temperature dependence of preOEP86 interaction with and insertion into in chloroplasts. Productive translocation of preOEP86 and processing and hence the yield of the 52-kDa proteolytic fragment were clearly temperature-dependent events (Fig. 7A, lanes 1-6). PreOEP86, which had bound to chloroplasts at 4°C, could be chased on the productive translocation pathway after reisolation and supplementation of the chloroplasts with fresh import buffer in the presence of ATP at 25°C as evidenced by the appearance of the 52-kDa fragment (Fig. 7A, lanes 7-10). This experimental set up was subsequently used to study the ATP requirement downstream of binding. Chloroplasts were incubated with preOEP86 in the presence of ATP at 4°C. Organelles were then isolated from the binding assay, washed, and supplemented with new import buffer in the absence or the presence of ATP or a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog (AMP-PNP), and the reaction was allowed to continue at 25°C for 20 min. The results show that ATP is not required for the final translocation steps of preOEP86. The yield of the 52-kDa fragment was similar in the absence or the presence of ATP or the nonhydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP at 25°C (Fig. 7B). To date only two proteins have been identified, namely OEP86 and OEP75, that require an NH2-terminal cleavable presequence for productive targeting to an organellar outer membrane. The common denominator of these proteins is that both are localized in the chloroplastic outer envelopes and both are constituents of the protein import machinery (2Gray J.C. Row P.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 243-246Google Scholar, 8Soll J. Bot. Acta. 1995; 108: 277-282Google Scholar). Although preOEP75 follows the general import pathway (15Tranel P.J. Froehlich J. Goyal A. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2436-2445Google Scholar) it seemed evident from preliminary studies (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar) that preOEP86 uses a unique translocation pathway. In this study we demonstrate that the presequence has to cooperate with a COOH-terminal portion of preOEP86 to guarantee the efficient and productive translocation into the outer envelope. The function of the presequence of preOEP86 seems at least in part different from that of other presequences, because it has no ability to target preOEP86137 and preOEP86347 or a passenger protein, namely pre86SSU to chloroplasts. Our results demonstrate, however, that the presequence of preOEP86 is required for a productive translocation pathway. Firstly, the yield of OEP86 insertion is stimulated 3-4-fold when preOEP86 instead of mOEP86 is offered to chloroplasts. Secondly, only preOEP86 and preOEP86775 show a significant dependence on ATP for binding to chloroplasts, whereas mOEP86 and OEP86-C699-879 do not. The presequence of preOEP86 is negatively charged in contrast to normal chloroplast directing presequences, which carry an overall positive charge. The negative charges might therefore inhibit the interaction with receptor components of the general protein import machinery of chloroplasts and lead to a specific and novel translocation pathway for preOEP86. Although the presequence of OEP86 is necessary for productive insertion of the preprotein, a specialized receptor for it seems not to be present in the outer envelope. PreOEP86137, preOEP86347, and pre86SSU had no capacity to bind to intact chloroplasts. Longer constructs, namely preOEP86542 and preOEP86697, bound with low efficiency; only preOEP86775, OEP86-C699-879, and the full-length precursor exhibited tight binding. These data indicated that preOEP86 contains also internal targeting information. A carboxyl-terminal region between amino acid positions 697-775 was required for an initial binding maybe via an interaction with the chloroplast envelope lipids as indicated by its resistance to extraction at pH 11. However, even preOEP86775 did not yield a protease protected insertion product, suggesting that further information is present in the final carboxyl-terminal stretch of 100 amino acids of preOEP86, which is necessary to ensure a productive folding and insertion cycle of preOEP86. This hypothesis is corroborated by our finding (Fig. 5) that overexpressed OEP86C699-879 ex could compete the productive translocation process of preOEP86. Thus, OEP86 requires bipartite information for targeting and translocation. The NH2-terminal presequence and the extreme COOH terminus seem to be involved in protein-mediated reactions of the translocation pathway, whereas an intermediate sequence (amino acid 697-775) could function as a membrane anchor. Further work is required to prove this idea. The productive translocation of preOEP86 into the chloroplastic outer envelope is not a spontaneous process but requires yet to be identified proteinaceous components. This conclusion is drawn from the evidence that (i) protease-treated organelles are unable to integrate preOEP86; (ii) hydrolysis of ATP is required for productive binding of preOEP86 but not for the final folding reactions; (iii) preOEP86 translocation can be competed with the overexpressed OEP86-C699-879 ex; and (iv) the translocation is strictly temperature-dependent. In general the translocation of other proteins into the chloroplastic outer envelope does not require ATP or protease-sensitive chloroplast surface components (3Soll J. Alefsen H. Böckler B. Kerber B. Salomon M. Waegemann K Neupert W. Lill R. Membrane Biogenesis and Protein Targeting. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 299Google Scholar, 4Salomon M. Fischer K. Flügge U.-I.

Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 709-717Google Scholar) The carboxyl terminus of OEP86 is necessary to anchor the protein into the envelope membrane. However, it can also function as a membrane anchor for a soluble protein as demonstrated for SSUc86. SSUc86 is oriented in the outer envelope in a way that exposes SSU to the cytosol. This orientation is like that in the authentic OEP86, the NH2 terminus of which protrudes also into the cytosol (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar). We were unable to detect a protease-protected fragment from inserted SSUc86 indicating that only a short transmembrane region of SSUc86 was protease-resistant, too short to warrant detection. The other possibility would be that SSUc86 represents a monotopic protein (29Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1499Google Scholar), a possibility that has been considered before for OEP86 (12Hirsch St. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Heijne V.G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Google Scholar). Envelope transfer stroma targeting domains can be used as carriers to import passenger proteins that contain several hydrophobic transmembrane α-helices into the organelle. The COOH terminus of OEP86, i.e. amino acids 653-879, however, represents a strong detour signal, which directs preSSUc86 to the chloroplastic outer envelope. About 10-20% of the hybrid protein enters the general import pathway as demonstrated by the appearance of processed SSUc86 inside the organelle at 2 mM ATP. At 50 μM ATP translocation intermediates were detected that were identical for preSSU and preSSUc86 as expected if translocation proceeds from the NH2 terminus to the COOH terminus and comes to a stop at ATP concentrations that do not allow complete translocation, i.e. 50-100 μM ATP (13Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Google Scholar, 28Waegemann K. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6545-6554Google Scholar)."

The significance of these results is discussed in the context of both the regulation of inducible responses to DNA damage, and the competitive relationship between the processes of SOS induction and genetic recombination. Insults inflicted upon DNA represent a serious challenge to cellular survival in all living organisms. The RecA protein has several distinct roles in maintaining genetic integrity within Escherichia coli. In promoting the recognition and subsequent exchange of strands between homologous DNA molecules (for a recent comprehensive review see 1Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Google Scholar and references therein), the RecA protein is central to recombinational repair events. In addition, the RecA protein coordinates the cellular response to factors that confer DNA damage or interfere with DNA replication by inducing the expression of a set of unlinked genes, recA included, comprising the SOS regulatory system (2Little J.W. Mount D.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 11-22Google Scholar, 3Walker G.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 425-457Google Scholar, 4Witkin E.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 133-141Google Scholar). Initiation of the SOS response occurs when RecA protein becomes activated to stimulate cleavage of the LexA protein, the transcriptional repressor of SOS regulon genes (5Witkin E.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 869-907Google Scholar). The LexA repressor is not the only target of activated RecA protein; cleavage of lytic repressors from various lambdoid bacteriophage accounts for prophage induction (6Roberts J.W. Roberts C.W. Craig N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4714-4718Google Scholar), while maturation of the mutagenesis factor (7Shinagawa H. Iwasaki H. Kato T. Nakata A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1806-1810Google Scholar), UmuD protein, is necessary for bypass of lesions during DNA replication (8Rajagopalan M. Lu C. Woodgate R. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10777-10781Google Scholar). Repair of DNA damage and alleviation of blocks to replication serve to eliminate the signal that activates the RecA protein; consequently, as intact LexA repressor reaccumulates, the expression of SOS genes return to normal uninduced levels. The ability to interact with DNA and a nucleotide triphosphate cofactor is fundamental to the remarkably diverse biochemical activities of the RecA protein. In a series of kinetically discernible steps, in vitro, the RecA protein promotes homologous pairing and transfer of strands between a variety of DNA substrates, provided one possesses some single-stranded character (1Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Google Scholar, 9Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Google Scholar). The elementary stage of the reaction involves assembly of a nucleoprotein complex, through the nonspecific and cooperative binding of the RecA protein to a fully or partially ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAATPγSadenosine 5′-[thio] triphosphateSSBsingle-stranded DNA bindingpoly(dT)polydeoxy(thymidylic acid)etheno M13 ssDNAmodified M13 ssDNA containing 1,N6-ethenoadenosine and 3,N4-ethenocytidine residuesIODintegrated optical density. molecule, in the presence of ATP, that is capable of searching for and establishing homologous contacts with duplex DNA. Similarly, initial studies examining proteolysis of phage repressors by RecA protein also revealed a requirement for both nucleotide triphosphate and single-stranded polynucleotide (6Roberts J.W. Roberts C.W. Craig N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4714-4718Google Scholar, 10Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. Nature. 1980; 283: 26-29Google Scholar, 11Phizicky E.M. Roberts J.W. J. Mol.

A. 1988; 85: 1811-1815Google Scholar) proteins also occurs, in vitro, when RecA protein binds to ssDNA and either ATP, dATP, or the relatively non-hydrolyzable analogue, ATPγS. However, in contrast to a traditional protease, the RecA nucleoprotein filament plays an indirect role as a “coprotease” in stimulating the specific autodigestion of these target proteins (14Little J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1375-1379Google Scholar, 15Little J.W. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 411-421Google Scholar). The relative abundance of free RecA protein and ATP in uninduced cells implicates ssDNA as the critical component responsible for in vivo activation of the RecA protein. Consistent with this proposal, the production of single-stranded regions in damaged DNA through either the helicase activity of the RecBCD protein (16Chaudhury A.M. Smith G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 201: 525-528Google Scholar) or ongoing DNA replication (17Sassanfar M. Roberts J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 79-96Google Scholar) is a prerequisite for derepression of the SOS regulon by various inducing treatments. The role of ssDNA as the activating signal, in vivo, is confirmed by observations that infection by mutant filamentous phage that are defective in complementary (minus) DNA strand synthesis induces the SOS response (18Higashitani N.

The binding of RecA protein to ssDNA and ATP yields a ternary complex that is the functional species in both the homologous pairing of DNA and the proteolytic cleavage of the LexA repressor; since a parallel consequence of this binding is the hydrolysis of ATP, the formation and properties of the ternary complex can be monitored indirectly by measuring the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein. To further our understanding of the mechanisms of and relationship between the cellular processes of SOS induction and genetic recombination, we have compared cleavage of the LexA repressor by this ternary complex to hydrolysis of ATP. As anticipated, considering the shared requirement for ssDNA and ATP, the LexA repressor cleavage and ATP hydrolysis activities of RecA protein display many parallels. The ability of SSB protein to stimulate maximal rates of RecA protein-promoted LexA proteolysis and ATP hydrolysis, in vitro, is consistent with it being genetically critical in both the response to and the recombinational repair of DNA damage (1Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Google Scholar, 19Meyer R.R. Laine P.S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 342-380Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, however, demonstration that the LexA repressor influences the competition between RecA and SSB proteins for limited ssDNA binding sites identifies an additional manner by which inducible responses to DNA damage may be regulated. Despite many earlier studies focusing on either homologous DNA pairing or coprotease activities, it remained unclear whether proteolytic cleavage is independent of or competitive with other RecA protein-promoted reactions. Our characterization of the inhibition of LexA proteolysis by dsDNA and excess ssDNA provides direct biochemical evidence that supports the idea, based on electron microscopy (20Yu X. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 29-40Google Scholar), that interactions between the RecA nucleoprotein filament and either the LexA repressor or a secondary DNA molecule are mutually exclusive. Thus, the cellular processes of SOS induction and genetic recombination may be intrinsically competitive in nature. Studies using a non-cleavable mutant of the LexA repressor protein, presented in the accompanying paper (21Harmon F.G. Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23874-23883Google Scholar), reinforce these views. All chemicals were reagent grade; solutions were made using Barnstead NANOpure water. ATP, dATP, and ATPγS were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Sigma, and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. The nucleotides were dissolved as concentrated stocks at pH 7.5, and their concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 1.54 × 104M−1 cm−1 at 260 nm. The RecA protein was purified from E. coli strain JC12772 using a modified preparative procedure 2S. C. Kowalczykowski, manuscript in preparation. based on spermidine acetate precipitation (22Griffith J. Shores C.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 158-162Google Scholar). SSB protein was purified from E. coli strain RLM727 as described (23LeBowitz J. Biochemical Mechanism of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage Lambda DNA Replication. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore1985Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using molar extinction coefficients of 2.7 × 104M−1 cm−1 for RecA protein and 3.0 × 104M−1 cm−1 for SSB protein, both at 280 nm. LexA repressor was purified from strain JL652 using essentially the protocol of Schnarr et al. (24Schnarr M. Pouyet J. Granger-Schnarr M. Daune M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2812-2818Google Scholar) with the following modifications; phosphocellulose fractions containing LexA repressor were assayed to detect, and pooled to avoid, an overlapping elution of deoxyribonuclease activity; following dialysis, a step elution from a Q-Sepharose column using 100 mM NaCl resolved the intact LexA repressor (≥98% pure based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) from a contaminant having DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity. Concentration of the LexA repressor was determined using a molar extinction coefficient of 7300 M−1 cm−1 at 280 nm (25Schnarr M. Daune M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 171: 207-210Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase were both purchased from Sigma as ammonium sulfate suspensions; working solutions were prepared by centrifuging a homogeneous aliquot and resuspending the protein pellet in reaction buffer. Single- and double-stranded DNA from bacteriophage M13mp7 and plasmid DNA from pBR322 were purified according to procedures outlined by Messing (26Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Google Scholar); duplex DNA from M13 bacteriophage replicative form (“homologous”) and pBR322 (“nonhomologous”) were linearized using EcoRI and NdeI restriction endonucleases, respectively. Molar nucleotide concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients of 8780 M−1 cm−1 for ssDNA and 6500 M−1 cm−1 for dsDNA, both at 260 nm. Etheno M13 DNA was prepared from viral DNA as described (27Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Google Scholar), while poly(dT) was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. and dissolved as a concentrated stock using TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5)); nucleotide concentrations were determined using molar extinction coefficients of 7000 and 8520 M−1 cm−1 at 260 nm, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, incubations and reactions were conducted at 37°C in a standard buffer comprised of 25 mM Tris-hydrochloride (pH 7.5), 10 mM magnesium chloride, 50 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM ATP using the following order of addition: to standard buffer with the indicated amounts of magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, and nucleotide triphosphate cofactor (ATP, dATP, or ATPγS), and a regenerating system consisting of 8 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (Sigma) and 12.5 units/ml pyruvate kinase (25 units/ml for dATP), ssDNA (M13, poly(dT) or etheno M13), and RecA protein were incubated. When present, the SSB protein (0.25 μM) was added 5 min after the RecA protein, unless otherwise noted. All reactions were initiated with the addition of 10 μM LexA repressor. If included, either homologous or nonhomologous linear dsDNA was added immediately prior to the LexA repressor. Cleavage of the LexA repressor by RecA protein was measured using 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (12Little J.W. Edmiston S.H. Pacelli L.Z. Mount D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3225-3229Google Scholar, 28Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 861-874Google Scholar). The integrated optical density (IOD) of resolved bands corresponding to intact LexA repressor, the two proteolytic fragments, and the RecA protein were quantitated from Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels using a Millipore Bioimage Imaging System. Lane-dependent artifacts due to gel loading or running were accounted for in a given reaction by normalizing the IOD values measured for both intact and proteolytic fragments of LexA repressor to that determined for the RecA protein. The extent of LexA repressor cleavage was calculated as a ratio of the normalized IOD value for the intact LexA repressor relative to the sum of each normalized IOD value for the intact LexA repressor and for the two proteolytic fragments. All extents of repressor cleavage are corrected for the amount of cleaved LexA repressor at zero time (≥85% intact). Cleavage rates were determined using the slope of a least squares fit of the initial linear portion of reaction time courses. The single-stranded DNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP was measured using a continuous spectrophotometric assay that couples ADP production to the oxidation of NADH (29Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Google Scholar) as adapted for use with the RecA protein (30Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Google Scholar). Assays were carried out under those indicated conditions used for measuring the rate of LexA proteolysis and included 0.2 mg/ml NADH (Sigma) and 12.5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. In reactions including repressor, the LexA repressor was added last to ongoing assays, and steady state rates of ATP hydrolysis were determined within regions of the time course where the LexA repressor remained at least 50% intact. Both the rates of LexA proteolysis and ATP hydrolysis reported are the average of minimally two independently determined sets of data. Experimental errors in the rates of ssDNA-dependent LexA repressor cleavage and ATP hydrolysis were calculated to be less than or equal to ±9 and ±5%, respectively, of the average values. In the presence of ATP, the binding of RecA protein to ssDNA is stabilized by magnesium ion (27Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Google Scholar). Moreover, characterization of the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein demonstrated that the magnesium ion concentration affects the extent of RecA nucleoprotein filament formation (30Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Google Scholar). Maximum rates of ATP hydrolysis are normally observed at a ratio of one RecA protein monomer per three nucleotides of ssDNA. However, secondary structure intrinsic to ssDNA is stabilized by elevated levels of magnesium ion and prohibits RecA protein from saturating the ssDNA (31Muniyappa K. Shaner S.L. Tsang S.S. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2757-2761Google Scholar); consequently, this results in apparently lower maximal rates of ATP hydrolysis and higher binding stoichiometries (30Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Google Scholar). For this reason, we examined the influence of magnesium ion on LexA repressor cleavage as a function of RecA protein concentration at a fixed amount of M13 ssDNA (Fig. 1). Over an initial range of RecA protein concentration (<0.75 μM), the rates of LexA repressor cleavage are equivalent at either 1 or 10 mM magnesium chloride and increase linearly with respect to the amount of RecA protein. At 10 mM magnesium chloride, proteolytic activity saturates at 0.8 μM/min, yielding an apparent site size of approximately five nucleotides of ssDNA per monomer of RecA protein. However, at 1 mM magnesium chloride, the level at which LexA repressor cleavage plateaus is enhanced (∼1.35 μM/min) and the apparent stoichiometry is decreased to three to four nucleotides/RecA protein monomer. Both of these observations are consistent with the idea that destabilization of secondary structure at reduced magnesium chloride concentrations allows RecA protein to access more ssDNA, thereby resulting in a greater extent of ternary complex. Furthermore, the apparent first order rate constant for LexA proteolysis, as determined from the data at sub-saturating RecA protein concentrations, is virtually the same (kcat∼0.92 min−1) at either 1 or 10 mM magnesium chloride, confirming that the activity directly reflects the amount of active RecA protein ternary complex formed. In support of the critical requirement for ssDNA in activation of RecA protein during SOS induction, the rates of LexA repressor proteolysis were approximately 10-fold lower in the presence of either linear M13 or pBR322 dsDNA (data not shown). Due to a preferential affinity for ssDNA, SSB protein disrupts secondary structure within native ssDNA and, upon being subsequently displaced, allows RecA protein to polymerize on these normally inaccessible regions (30Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Google Scholar, 31Muniyappa K. Shaner S.L. Tsang S.S. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2757-2761Google Scholar, 32Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Google Scholar). Thus, despite being a competitor for limited binding sites, the SSB protein indirectly contributes to the formation of a contiguous RecA nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA (30Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Google Scholar, 33Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J.C. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2A (dashed lines), this effect of the SSB protein is manifest as a stimulation in the ATP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein when M13 ssDNA is used as a substrate at elevated magnesium ion concentrations (28Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 861-874Google Scholar, 30Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Google Scholar). Before binding sites on M13 ssDNA become limiting, the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis increases linearly with RecA protein concentration in a manner unaffected by SSB protein; however, at saturating concentrations of RecA protein, the maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis achieved in the presence of SSB protein (∼21 μM/min) is approximately 2-fold greater than that observed in its absence (∼10 μM/min). In quantitative agreement with the enhanced rate at which ATP hydrolysis plateaus, there is a corresponding decrease in the apparent ssDNA binding stoichiometry derived for the RecA protein from ∼six to ∼three nucleotides of ssDNA per protein monomer. These findings argue that in the presence of SSB protein more of the M13 substrate is available to support the ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of RecA protein. To assess the effect of SSB protein on LexA repressor digestion, proteolysis was examined under conditions identical to those used for ATP hydrolysis. As observed for ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2A), inclusion of SSB protein enhances the rate at which proteolytic cleavage saturates (∼1.15 μM/min) relative to reactions in which it was omitted (∼0.65 μM/min) (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the need for 1.5- to 2-fold higher RecA protein concentrations to achieve maximal rates of both LexA repressor cleavage and ATP hydrolysis in the presence of SSB protein indicates that the SSB protein enables the RecA protein to utilize the native ssDNA more completely. These results are consistent with the interpretation that by removing normally inaccessible regions of secondary structure from native ssDNA, SSB protein facilitates formation of the RecA protein ternary complex and, consequently, stimulates those biochemical activities dependent on it (i.e. ATP hydrolysis, LexA repressor cleavage). However, in contrast to ATP hydrolysis, LexA proteolysis is attenuated at sub-stoichiometric concentrations of RecA protein (≤0.50 μM) in reactions containing SSB protein (Fig. 2B). To determine the origin of this reduction in cleavage activity, the hydrolysis of ATP was also examined in the presence of LexA repressor (Fig. 2A, solid lines). Addition of the LexA repressor to reactions containing SSB protein results in a decrease in ATP hydrolysis at less than stoichiometric concentrations of the RecA protein, similar to that observed in the proteolysis assay. This inhibition of RecA protein activity is SSB protein-dependent as the LexA repressor has no effect on ATP hydrolysis in the absence of SSB protein (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, optimal inhibition of the ssDNA-dependent activities of the RecA protein caused by the LexA repressor requires saturating amounts of SSB protein (i.e. either reducing the SSB protein concentration or increasing the M13 ssDNA concentration diminished the relative amount of inhibition, data not shown). Collectively, these observations indicate not only that the observed inhibition is a direct result of RecA protein being supplanted from the ssDNA by SSB protein but that the LexA repressor acts in an auxiliary manner to bring about this replacement of the RecA protein-ATP-ssDNA complex. Similar to most protein-nucleic acid complexes (34Record Jr., M.T. Anderson C.F. Lohman T.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 103-178Google Scholar), the stability of RecA protein-ssDNA complexes decreases with increasing salt concentrations (27Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Google Scholar). However, this sensitivity to disruption by salt is not due to competitive binding effects associated with cation displacement from the ssDNA phosphate backbone but rather is the result of anion displacement from the RecA protein during complex formation (35Menetski J.P. Varghese A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10400-10404Google Scholar). Consequently, interactions between LexA and RecA proteins may destabilize the RecA protein-ATP-ssDNA ternary complex and thus account for the repressor-dependent increase in the inhibition of RecA protein activities by SSB protein. Since ATP hydrolysis and LexA proteolysis require formation of the same ternary complex, to address this possibility the salt sensitivities of these ssDNA-dependent activities of RecA protein were examined in parallel. As shown in Fig. 3, increasing amounts of sodium chloride cause a decrease in the ability of the RecA protein to promote either the hydrolysis of ATP or the cleavage of LexA repressor, in both the absence and presence of SSB protein. The concentrations of sodium chloride resulting in 50% inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and LexA proteolysis in the absence of SSB protein are similar (150 and 170 mM, respectively); in assays containing SSB protein, 250 mM sodium chloride is necessary for this degree of inhibition of hydrolysis, compared with 225 mM for proteolysis. In the case of either activities, SSB protein increases the apparent salt resistance by enhancing the formation of a more complete nucleoprotein filament. Furthermore, the amounts of sodium chloride required to reduce ATP hydrolysis by RecA protein to half-maximal levels, in either the absence or presence of SSB protein, are relatively unaffected by LexA repressor (Fig. 3A). Thus, based on the comparable salt sensitivities for these M13 ssDNA-dependent activities of the RecA protein, the LexA repressor does not drastically alter the steady-state stability of the RecA protein-ATP-ssDNA complex. The stability and structure of the RecA nucleoprotein complexes are modulated by interaction with nucleotide cofactors. Binding of ATP increases the equilibrium affinity of the RecA protein for ssDNA (27Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Google Scholar) and yields an extended conformation of the RecA protein-ssDNA complex (36Stasiak A. Egelman E.H. Kucherlapati R. Smith G.R. Genetic Recombination.

Timmins P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 557-570Google Scholar); besides being fundamental to certain enzymatic activities, the high affinity ssDNA-binding state induced by ATP is required for RecA protein to be able to compete with, and displace, the SSB protein (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Google Scholar). In order to investigate the effects of repressor on the interaction of RecA protein with nucleotide cofactors, and to compare the requirements for nucleotide in ATP hydrolysis and LexA proteolysis, each of these ssDNA-dependent activities was examined as a function of the nucleoside triphosphate concentration (Fig. 4). As has been shown by others (39Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Google Scholar, 40Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5872-5881Google Scholar, 41Menetski J.P. Varghese A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1205-1212Google Scholar), the ATP hydrolysis activity of RecA protein is sigmoid with respect to nucleotide concentration. The ATP concentration needed to achieve half-maximal rates of hydrolysis defines an apparent Km of 120 ± 4 μM for the RecA protein (Fig. 4A), which is similar to previously reported values (39Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Google Scholar, 40Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5872-5881Google Scholar, 41Menetski J.P. Varghese A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1205-1212Google Scholar). While maximal rates of ATP hydrolysis attained are unchanged, the presence of the LexA repressor shifts the apparent Km of the RecA protein to a slightly higher ATP concentration (160 ± 8 μM). Furthermore, inclusion of repressor partially inhibits the M13 ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the RecA protein at ATP concentrations between 60 and 200 μM (Fig. 4A). In agreement with earlier characterizations (6Roberts J.W. Roberts C.W. Craig N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4714-4718Google Scholar, 10Craig N.L. Roberts J.W.

This indicates that activation of ribonucleotide reductase gene expression is specific for nucleotide excision repair in mammalian cells and not part of a general response to DNA damage. Ribonucleotide reductase is a key enzyme in DNA synthesis because it catalyzes the direct reduction of ribonucleotides to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides (1Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev.

Each subunit is inactive by itself, but together they form an active enzyme complex. Mammalian ribonucleotide reductase has been purified to homogeneity, and full-length cDNA clones encoding mouse R1 and R2 proteins have been isolated (4Caras I.W. Levinson B.B. Fabry M. Williams S.R.

There is a close correlation between mammalian ribonucleotide reductase activity and the rate of DNA synthesis with no detectable activity in G0/G1 cells and maximal activity in S-phase cells (1Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Google Scholar, 2Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Google Scholar). Holoenzyme activity is regulated during the cell cycle by S-phase-specific de novo synthesis and subsequent breakdown of the R2 subunit that is limiting for enzyme activity (8Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Google Scholar, 9Engström Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9114-9116Google Scholar). The R1 protein levels in proliferating cells are in excess and constant throughout the cell cycle. Expression of both the R1 and R2 mRNAs is S-phase-specific with no detectable transcripts in G0/G1 cells (10Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Google Scholar). The R2 gene expression is regulated by an early, proliferation-specific induction of the promoter in combination with a G1-phase-specific transcriptional block 2S. Björklund, D. Filatov, E. Skogman, M. Thelander, and L. Thelander, manuscript in preparation. (11Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Google Scholar). There are four DNA-protein interaction regions in the mouse R2 promoter.2 The three upstream elements, β, γ, and δ (from nt −672 to nt −527), are required for proliferation-specific induction of the R2 promoter. The region most proximal to the R2 transcription start, α (nt −93 to −56), contains a CCAAT-motif binding the NF-Y transcription factor that is required for continuous activity of the R2 promoter through the S-phase (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). An R2 promoter lacking the upstream regions is not serum-inducible but retains basal levels of transcription provided the proximal NF-Y binding element is present2 (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). Exposure of mammalian cells to 254 nm UV light leads to the introduction of a number of photoproducts in their DNA. These are removed by a nucleotide excision repair mechanism involving excision of the damaged nucleotides together with a number of nucleotides adjacent to the damage (13Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). The resulting gaps are then filled in by a DNA polymerase and sealed by a ligase. It is reasonable to assume that ribonucleotide reductase may be involved in the repair, at least in nonproliferating cells, since deoxyribonucleotides are present in very low levels in cells outside S-phase (1Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Google Scholar, 2Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Google Scholar). A number of human excision repair genes have been cloned (13Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), and an in vitro system capable of complete repair synthesis using purified protein components was recently described (14Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protic M. Hübscher U. Egly J.-M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Google Scholar). However, most of these genes seem not to be significantly induced in response to DNA damage. In contrast, other mammalian genes encoding transcription factors, growth factors, and growth factor receptors are activated at the transcriptional level by UV irradiation (13Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). In some cases, the primary inducing signal is generated outside the nucleus possibly involving free oxygen radicals and membrane-associated tyrosine kinases, whereas other data suggest a direct role of DNA damage (13Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). There are few direct indications that mammalian ribonucleotide reductase is DNA damage-inducible. It has been shown that the DNA-damaging, alkylating agent chlorambucil induced expression of ribonucleotide reductase in mouse cells, but the drug also directly inhibited the activity of the enzyme (15Hurta R.A.R. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7066-7071Google Scholar). In contrast, there are a number of indirect indications that ribonucleotide reductase may be important for excision repair. These data are obtained from studies using UV irradiation in combination with the specific protein R2 inhibitor hydroxyurea and addition of deoxyribonucleosides to the medium of irradiated tissue culture cells (16Yew F.F.-H. Johnson R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 562: 240-251Google Scholar, 17Snyder R. Mutat. Res. 1984; 131: 163-172Google Scholar, 18Holmberg M. Mutat. Res. 1989; 218: 33-39Google Scholar). Much more is known about the inducibility and possible role of ribonucleotide reductase in DNA repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RNR1 and RNR3 (large subunits) as well as the RNR2 (small subunit) genes in yeast are induced to different levels by DNA damaging agents such as UV light, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide, methyl methanesulfonate, and also by hydroxyurea (19Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Google Scholar). A DNA damage-responsive element in the yeast RNR2 promoter was identified together with four interacting protein factors likely to mediate the DNA damage response. In the present study we demonstrate that the promoters of the mouse R1 and R2 genes are UV-inducible. In contrast, the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate has no affect on the R2 promoter activity indicating that the induction only occurs in response to DNA damage causing nucleotide excision repair. The UV induction observed in resting cells utilizes a different pathway from the proliferation-induced activation of the R2 promoter. We also demonstrate a preferential accumulation of the smaller 1.6-kb R2 transcript in logarithmically growing R2-overproducing mouse TA 3 cells after UV irradiation. Balb/3T3 cells (ATCC CCL 163) and hydroxyurea-resistant, R2-overproducing mouse TA 3 cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum as described earlier (5Thelander L. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3433-3442Google Scholar). For serum synchronization, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 14-cm dish. After 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); 25 ml of medium containing 0.6% fetal calf serum were added; and the cells were incubated for another 48 h. In experiments with serum-released cells, DMEM containing 20% horse serum was added to PBS-washed cells after 48 h of serum starvation. Transfection of cells was made by electroporation as described (11Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Google Scholar), and stable transformants were selected in the presence of Geneticin base (Sigma). Resistant clones were expanded, tested for luciferase activity or for the presence of the luciferase gene fused to R2 promoter sequences by polymerase chain reaction, and frozen in liquid nitrogen as described (11Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Google Scholar, 12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). Usually, two to three independent clones were tested for each particular construct. The plasmids p19lucR2 1.5 (nt −1497 to +17 of the R2 promoter) and p19lucR2 0.5 (nt −470 to +17 of the R2 promoter) were described earlier2 (11Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Google Scholar). The plasmid p19lucR2 0.11 was constructed by cleaving the p19lucR2 1.5 with BstDI that has one site in the R2 promoter exactly at the 5′ end of the α region (nt −93) and two sites in the p19luc vector, and SacI that has one site in the polylinker between the R2 promoter and the luciferase cDNA. The small BstDI-SacI fragment representing the region of the R2 promoter including the α region, the TTTAAA box, and the transcription start, and a small piece from the p19luc polylinker was isolated and ligated to p19luc cleaved with HincII and SacI (20van Zonneveld A.-J. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5525-5529Google Scholar). All constructs contain the R2 transcription start but not the ATG representing the translation start of the R2 gene. The plasmid p19lucR2 (1.0-α) was made as described (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar) and had 33 nucleotides (nt −80 to −47) deleted from the DNA-protein binding α region. This deletion abolished the specific binding of the NF-Y transcription factor to this region (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). The plasmid p19lucR2 TTTAAA contains only the TTTAAA box and the transcription start from the R2 promoter (nt −47 to +17) ligated to the luciferase reporter gene (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). The plasmid p19lucR2Ex2-ATG is described elsewhere.2 This plasmid contains the full-length R2 promoter, the first exon with the original ATG start codon mutated to ATC and the first intron ligated to the luciferase reporter gene. The plasmid therefore harbors the transcriptional block region located to the first intron of the R2 gene (11Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Google Scholar). All R2 plasmid constructs are summarized in Fig. 1. The plasmid p19lucR1 1.0 contains a fragment from the mouse R1 promoter starting at nt −812 and ending at nt +242 relative to the major transcription start (21Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Google Scholar). All plasmid constructs were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing. All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 RNA/DNA synthesizer and purified by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 columns. Before irradiation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prewarmed to 37°C. Then the saline was removed, and the cells were irradiated at a distance of 25 cm using a Universal UV lamp (CAMAG, Typ TL-900/U) preferentially emitting 254 nm UV light (0.8 J/m2/s from this distance). The UV dose was monitored using a radiometer UVX-25 (Ultra-Violet Products, Inc., USA). Immediately after irradiation, the same conditioned prewarmed medium was added back to avoid serum stimulation, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for the indicated time before harvesting. In the experiment where UV irradiation was combined with release of the cells into S-phase, the G0/G1-synchronized cells were washed with PBS after 48 h of starvation in DMEM containing 0.6% fetal calf serum and irradiated, and prewarmed DMEM containing 20% horse serum was added. In the case of methyl methanesulfonate treatment, the cells were washed as described above and then incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of prewarmed PBS containing the drug at 2.36-118 μM concentrations. The drug was removed, and the cells were washed twice with prewarmed PBS before the same conditioned prewarmed medium was added. The cells were then incubated for different periods at 37°C. In experiments with hydroxyurea, the drug was added directly to the medium at a final concentration of 0.5 to 2 mM and was present in the medium during the course of the experiment. The cells were harvested every 30 min during a 5-h period. Aliquots of 0.2-1.0 × 106 cells were removed for fixation in a phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde solution and subsequent flow cytometry analyses of DNA content (8Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Google Scholar). Harvesting of cells and preparation of cell extracts for luciferase assays were performed as described (11Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured as the number of light units emitted during a 10-s period per μg of total protein, determined by the Bradford protein assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a medium containing [14C]thymidine to label the DNA. After serum starvation and treatment with UV light, DNA single strand breaks were measured by the method developed by Erixon and Ahnström (23Erixon K. Ahnström G. Mutat. Res. 1979; 59: 257-271Google Scholar). This involves alkali treatment, neutralization, and sonication and then single and double-stranded DNA are separated by hydroxylapatite chromatography at 60°C. Radioactivity in the eluted fractions were measured in a Beckman LS 6000 SE counter. Before use, the elution profile of the hydroxylapatite column was tested using a linear gradient of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (24Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). The RNA was denatured with glyoxal, electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, blotted to a nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized to a full-length R2 cDNA probe as described (5Thelander L. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3433-3442Google Scholar, 25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 8.5-cm dishes at a density of 103-106 cells per dish in 10 ml of DMEM plus 10% horse serum. After 10 h, the cells were irradiated as described above and incubated for 7 days. Colonies were counted and compared with nonirradiated control cultures. It has been reported that murine cells such as Balb/3T3 fibroblasts have very low but detectable levels of excision repair (26Kusewitt D.F. Ley R.D. Henderson E.E. Mutat. Res. 1991; 255: 1-9Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the amount of single-stranded DNA in G0/G1-synchronized Balb/3T3 cells after exposure to two different doses of 254 nm UV light. The amount of single-stranded DNA is directly proportional to the amount of single strand breaks in a DNA molecule after UV exposure (23Erixon K. Ahnström G. Mutat. Res. 1979; 59: 257-271Google Scholar). However, we had difficulties detecting significant levels of breaks because only about 7% (that is very close to the lower level of detection by this method) and about 13% of single-stranded DNA was detected using 3 and 10 J/m2, respectively. The finding that the amount of single-stranded DNA increased with increasing UV dose indicates that the cells do perform excision repair but at a very low level. Hydroxyurea treatment causes single-strand break accumulation in human cells after UV irradiation (17Snyder R. Mutat. Res. 1984; 131: 163-172Google Scholar). When 2 mM hydroxyurea was added to the medium 3 h prior to UV irradiation, the percent of single-stranded DNA increased also in our murine cells and reached 21 and 28% for 3 and 10 J/m2, respectively (Fig. 2). Hydroxyurea treatment without irradiation did not affect the amount of single-stranded DNA (data not shown). This indicates that in the presence of hydroxyurea there is an accumulation of excised gaps in DNA that cannot be filled in with newly synthesized DNA most probably due to lack of deoxyribonucleotides. Fig. 3A shows luciferase activity after UV light irradiation of G0/G1-synchronized mouse fibroblast cells stably transformed with the p19lucR2 1.5 plasmid (Fig. 1). The R2 promoter-controlled luciferase activity increased immediately to peak at 5 and 8 h after irradiation with a dose of 3 and 10 J/m2, respectively. The 3 J/m2 dose resulted in about 90% cell survival, and the 10 J/m2 dose resulted in about 12% survival when measured after 7 days. The luciferase values represented a 2- and 5-6-fold increase, respectively, compared with the nonirradiated control cells. A dose response could be observed where increasing dose resulted in increasing promoter activity (Fig. 3A) and the higher dose of UV irradiation delayed the maximal response compared with the lower dose. The increase in promoter activity was transient, and the luciferase activity returned back to control levels after 9 and 15-25 h after UV irradiation, using 3 and 10 J/m2, respectively. The UV-induced activation of the R2 promoter was not caused by stimulation of the resting G0/G1 synchronized cells to proliferate since flow cytometry analyses of the cells after UV irradiation showed no changes in cell cycle distribution. About 85% G0/G1- and 10% S-phase cells were detected within 15 h after exposure to 10 J/m2 (Fig. 3B), and the same result was obtained for cells irradiated at 3 J/m2 (data not shown). Logarithmically growing Balb/3T3 cells stably transformed with the p19lucR2 1.5 plasmid (Fig. 1) were irradiated with a dose of 10J/m2. Luciferase activity was measured at different time points during a 12-h period after irradiation and compared with the activity in nonirradiated control cells (Fig. 4). A clear increase in activity was observed throughout the experiment. However, the increase was less pronounced than the one observed in nonproliferating cells with the same construct, and no clear peak was evident (cf. Fig. 3A). In the logarithmically growing cells, about 40% of the cells were in G1-phase and 50% in S-phase as shown by flow cytometry (data not shown). To further analyze the mechanism of R2 promoter activation by UV irradiation, we measured luciferase activity in UV-irradiated, serum-synchronized G0/G1 cells stably transformed by the p19lucR2 1.5 construct after the readdition of serum to start proliferation. Nonirradiated, synchronized cells were used as a control. As shown earlier, the R2 promoter was activated very early when cells pass from quiescence to proliferation (Fig. 5). However, UV irradiation increased the luciferase activity about 24-fold compared with the 9-10-fold increase in the nonirradiated cells. Our data so far demonstrate UV-induced activation of the R2 promoter. To study if this activation also results in increased R2 mRNA levels, logarithmically growing, hydroxyurea-resistant, R2-overproducing mouse TA 3 cells were irradiated with a dose of 10 J/m2. Total RNA was extracted at 0, 4, and 7 h after irradiation and analyzed by Northern blotting using an R2 cDNA probe (Fig. 6). Interestingly, in these cells a preferential accumulation of the minor 1.6-kb R2 transcript was seen 4 h after irradiation, whereas the levels of the major 2.1-kb transcript were relatively constant in repeated experiments. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the expression of the R2 gene is induced by UV light, hydroxyurea, and by the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (19Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Google Scholar). We tested the effects of methyl methanesulfonate on the R2 promoter activity in G0/G1-synchronized p19lucR2 1.5-transformed mouse cells but could not detect any significant changes in luciferase activity within 5 h of treatment. The same concentrations of drug as those reported by Elledge and Davis (27Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4932-4940Google Scholar) and those reported in the literature to cause a considerable amount of alkylated bases in mammalian DNA were used (28Slamenová D. Bohusová T. Oravec C. Mutat. Res. 1990; 242: 127-134Google Scholar) (Table I). Only a very slight increase in luciferase activity was detected 3 and 4 h after treatment of G0/G1-synchronized cells with three different doses of drug (2.36, 11.8, and 118 μM). Furthermore, no significant increase was observed when logarithmically growing Balb/3T3 cells were exposed to different doses of drug (80-1700 μM, data not shown).Table ILuciferase activity in methyl methanesulfonate-treated, p19lucR2 1.5-transformed, G0/G1-synchronized Balb/3T3 cellsTime after exposureLuciferase activity in drug-treated cells divided by the activity in nontreated control cells, methyl methanesulfonate concentrations2.36 μM11.8 μM118 μMh11.001.131.0221.161.301.2131.181.401.2841.001.231.3750.771.101.09 Open table in a new tab Hydroxyurea is a specific inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase acting by reducing and labilizing the iron center of mammalian R2 and also by a direct 1-electron reduction of the tyrosyl free radical (29Nyholm S. Thelander L. Gräslund A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11569-11574Google Scholar, 30Lassmann G. Thelander L. Gräslund A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 879-887Google Scholar). In our stably transformed cell lines, hydroxyurea alone did not affect the R2 promoter activity in any significant way. Addition of hydroxyurea to a G0/G1-synchronized culture of p19lucR2 1.5-transformed mouse fibroblasts did not increase the luciferase expression within 5 h of treatment. Moreover, addition of hydroxyurea (0.5-2 mM) to logarithmically growing cultures of the same cells did not result in any significant increase in luciferase activity up to 3 h after the addition of the drug (data not shown). Finally, addition of 2 mM hydroxyurea to the medium 3 h prior to UV irradiation of serum-synchronized cells stably transformed with the p19lucR2 1.5 construct did not result in any increased luciferase activity compared with cells irradiated in the absence of hydroxyurea (data not shown). To localize regions in the R2 promoter responsible for the UV-induced activation, the experiments with resting cells were repeated with cells stably transformed with the p19lucR2 0.5 plasmid (Fig. 7). This plasmid contains the first 470 base pairs upstream from the transcription start of the R2 gene including the proximal DNA-protein binding α region but not the β, γ, and δ regions (Fig. 1). This construct has been shown to maintain basal levels of transcription but is not serum-inducible.2 The same qualitative pattern of luciferase activity was observed with this reporter construct as with the p19lucR2 1.5. However, the induction was more pronounced with a 3- and 9-10-fold increase after 3 and 10 J/m2, respectively (Fig. 7). To further localize the region of the R2 promoter important for UV activation, another luciferase reporter gene construct, p19lucR2 0.11 (Fig. 1), containing only the first 93 base pairs upstream from the transcription start of the R2 gene was used in similar experiments as above. The p19lucR2 0.11 construct, like the p19lucR2 0.5, was shown to maintain basal levels of transcription, could not respond to serum stimulation, but showed UV induction similar to p19lucR2 0.5 (data not shown). A reporter gene construct, p19lucR2 (1.0-α), where the α region is deleted but the upstream β, γ, and δ elements are still present (Fig. 1) was earlier shown to respond to serum stimulation, but the response was transient and started to decay before cells entered the S-phase (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this construct showed a similar UV induction of the R2 promoter activity in G0/G1-synchronized cells as the induction obtained with the full-length promoter (data not shown). A p19lucR2 TTTAAA construct contains only the TTTAAA element and the transcription start, whereas all the DNA-protein binding sites (α, β, γ, and δ) are deleted (Fig. 1). No luciferase activity could be measured in extracts from serum-stimulated, -synchronized cells stably transformed with this construct or in logarithmically growing cells (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). Likewise, no UV induction was observed (data not shown). The presence of the R2 promoter fragment linked to an intact luciferase gene in the stably transformed cells was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). We were interested to study how the G1-specific transcriptional block earlier located to the first intron of the R2 gene would influence UV induction of the R2 expression in resting cells. Therefore, serum-starved cells stably transformed with the p19lucR2Ex2-ATG construct (Fig. 1) were UV-irradiated, and the luciferase expression was measured. The same pattern of UV-induced luciferase activity was seen as the one observed for the p19lucR2 1.5 (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The plasmid p19lucR1 1.0 contains the R1 promoter (nt −812 to +242) ligated to the luciferase reporter gene (21Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Google Scholar). G0/G1-synchronized cells stably transformed with p19lucR1 1.0 were irradiated with a dose of 10 J/m2, and luciferase activity was measured during a 25-h period (Fig. 8). The luciferase activity started to increase 4 h after UV irradiation and peaked at 10 h showing a 2-3-fold stimulation of the R1 promoter activity. The activation was transient and the luciferase activity returned to control values after 15-20 h. Like the results with the R2 promoter-reporter gene constructs, addition of 2 mM hydroxyurea to logarithmically growing cultures of p19lucR1 1.0-transformed cells did not result in any significant increase in luciferase activity (data not shown). Nonproliferating mammalian cells contain no detectable ribonucleotide reductase activity and have no detectable levels of R1 protein as shown using immunochemical techniques (31Mann G.J. Musgrove E.A. Fox R.M. Thelander L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5151-5156Google Scholar). Furthermore, after serum starvation, G0/G1 cells contain less than two molecules of R1 and R2 mRNAs per cell (10Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Google Scholar). Nucleotide excision repair is used by the cell to repair DNA damages caused by UV irradiation. This repair may occur outside of S-phase when the pools of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are very low (2Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Google Scholar). In this case the cell must have mechanisms by which it can supply the repair DNA synthesis with precursors. The only way to synthesize the precursors de novo is to induce ribonucleotide reductase. In yeast cells ribonucleotide reductase expression is induced outside of S-phase in response to many different DNA-damaging agents (19Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Google Scholar). Using mouse R1 and R2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs, we now demonstrate activation of the mouse R1 and R2 gene promoters by UV light. In serum-starved G0/G1-cells, the UV-stimulated luciferase expression increased up to 3-fold for the R1 promoter and up to 10-fold for the R2 promoter using 10 J/m2. Maximal values were obtained 8-12 h postirradiation and then declined to values obtained in nonirradiated cells. This should be compared with up to a 10-fold increase in R2 promoter-controlled luciferase activity after serum release of G0/G1-synchronized cells (11Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Google Scholar). The increase occurred without any measurable perturbation in the distribution of cells in the different cell cycle phases as shown by flow cytometry. Therefore, our data show that also in mouse cells, ribonucleotide reductase can be induced outside S-phase by UV-induced DNA damage. Only 93 base pairs of the proximal R2 promoter together with the transcriptional start were required to give a UV response. This includes the proximal DNA-protein binding α region (nt −93 to −56) that has been shown to bind the NF-Y transcription factor. Together with the upstream β, γ, and δ elements, the α region is absolutely required for S-phase-specific expression of the R2 gene (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). No UV induction was observed for a promoter-luciferase construct containing only the TTTAAA box and the transcriptional start, and this construct did not support any basal levels of R2 transcription. A luciferase reporter gene construct containing only the upstream β, γ, and δ DNA-protein binding regions but lacking the proximal DNA-protein binding α region showed activation of the R2 promoter in G0/G1-synchronized cells after UV irradiation. It has been shown that the R2 promoter lacking the CCAAT box-containing α region is serum-inducible in G0/G1 cells, but its activity starts to decay before cells enter the S-phase, and the transcriptional block is released (12Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Google Scholar). Taken together these data indicate that the UV inducibility of the R2 promoter requires only a basal level of transcription that can be maintained by either the three upstream β, γ, and δ regions or the single proximal DNA-protein binding α region of the R2 promoter in combination with the TTTAAA box and the transcriptional start. Therefore, the induction of the R2 promoter in resting cells after UV treatment is clearly different from the proliferation-specific response of the same promoter requiring all four DNA-protein binding regions.2 This result and the finding that the UV response is additive to the normal proliferation response suggest that the UV-induced activation of the R2 promoter uses different mechanisms than the proliferation-specific induction. Furthermore, the transcriptional block that regulates the S-phase-specific expression of the R2 gene seems not to be involved in regulating the UV-induced activation of R2 expression in nonproliferating cells. UV induction of the R2 promoter was observed also in logarithmically growing cells. This may reflect activation of inactive R2 promoters in early G1 cells or further stimulation of already activated promoters in late G1/S-phase cells or a combination of both. Gel shift experiments did not reveal any additional protein binding to the four regions of the R2 promoter after UV irradiation (data not shown). This is similar to the finding that no additional DNA-protein binding can be observed to the c-jun promoter after UV irradiation, although this promoter is induced about 100-fold in UV-irradiated cells (32Rozek D. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5490-5499Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the transcription factors that regulate UV response in mammalian cells undergo posttranslation modifications, such as phosphorylation, to be able to induce transcription after UV irradiation. Based on our data we favor the hypothesis that the R2 gene in mouse cells requires only a minimal promoter, supporting basal levels of transcription, for UV induction. However, this does not answer the question about the specificity of the UV response, and only a certain set of genes are induced after UV irradiation of mammalian cells (13Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). It is difficult to measure the levels of R2 mRNA in normal mouse cells because of very low concentrations of the transcripts (10Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Google Scholar). Therefore, we used hydroxyurea-resistant, R2-overproducing mouse mammary tumor TA 3 cells that have an amplified R2 gene and overexpress the R2 mRNA to about 40 times higher levels compared with native TA 3 cells. However, the S-phase-specific expression of R2 mRNA is still retained (5Thelander L. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3433-3442Google Scholar, 8Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Google Scholar, 10Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Google Scholar). When the R2 mRNA levels vary during the normal cell cycle, the minor 1.6-kb transcript is always around 10% of the major 2.1-kb transcript 3L. Thelander, unpublished results. (5Thelander L. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3433-3442Google Scholar). Exposure of logarithmically growing, hydroxyurea-resistant, TA 3 cells to UV light unexpectedly led to a preferential transient accumulation of the minor 1.6-kb R2 transcript. A similar preferential accumulation of the smaller of two transcripts, differing in the utilization of polyadenylation signals, has been reported for the rat ornithine decarboxylase gene after induction by UV light (33Rosen C.F. Dragan G. Qi J. Drucker D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1103-C1110Google Scholar). This may indicate similar mechanisms for the UV induction of these two genes. The R2 promoter activation was not increased when the amount of single strand breaks was increased by combining UV irradiation with hydroxyurea. This indicates that the gaps themselves are not part of the cellular signaling pathway for R2 promoter induction. Also, the absence of any clear effect of hydroxyurea on the R1 or R2 promoter activity in logarithmically growing cells indicates that decreasing pools of deoxyribonucleotides are not the immediate signal to activate ribonucleotide reductase expression. This is quite different from the situation in yeast where hydroxyurea is a strong inducer of ribonucleotide reductase expression (19Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Google Scholar). Methyl methanesulfonate unlike UV light does not cause bulky lesions in DNA but causes base damages by alkylation. These type of damages are thought to be repaired by short-patch repair mechanisms or dealkylation requiring very little if any deoxyribonucleotides (13Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Methyl methanesulfonate did not activate the mouse R2 promoter indicating that in mammalian cells ribonucleotide reductase is specifically induced only by DNA damage requiring nucleotide excision repair. Again this differs from the situation in yeast where a number of different agents such as UV light, methyl methanesulfonate, and hydroxyurea all induce ribonucleotide reductase in a more general type of response (19Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 333-339Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with previous reports on the lack of such a general response in mammalian cells (13Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Taken together our data show that both the R1 and R2 genes of mouse ribonucleotide reductase are UV-inducible by mechanisms different from the proliferation-specific promoter activation. Clearly, more studies are required to identify the signaling pathways in mammalian cells that can specifically induce genes such as ribonucleotide reductase in response to DNA damage by UV irradiation to allow repair of DNA even outside of S-phase.

This mutant was folded correctly as it bound Ca2+ with a similar affinity as GDFX and was also activated by the Russell's viper venom at similar rate, but it cleaved the chromogenic substrates with a Gly at the P2 positions poorly. The mutant, instead, cleaved the APC-specific chromogenic substrates efficiently.

BCRs are composed of antigen binding units, the membrane immunoglobulins (mIg), noncovalently associated with transducing subunits, the Ig-α/Ig-β heterodimers. The cytoplasmic tails of these associated chains become phosphorylated after cross-linking of mIg (1Gold M.R. Matsuuchi L. Kelly R.B. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pleiman C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 123-126Google Scholar). By adsorbing B cell lysates on fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α or Ig-β, the unphosphorylated cytoplasmic domains were shown to bind to different kinases. The cytoplasmic tail of Ig-α interact with fyn and lyn and with an unidentified molecule of 38 kDa, whereas the cytoplasmic tail of Ig-β binds to two unidentified phosphoproteins of 40 and 42 kDa (9Clark M.R. Campbell K.S. Kazlauskas A. Johnson S.A. Hertz M. Potter T.A. Pleiman C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 123-126Google Scholar). The activation of tyrosine kinase is followed by an increase of intracellular calcium concentration (10Baixeras E. Kroemer G. Cuende E. Marquez C. Bosca L. Martinez J.E.A. Martinez A.-C. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 132: 5-47Google Scholar). Typical cytoplasmic calcium increase includes an initial release of calcium from intracellular stores followed by an influx of extracellular calcium, which is involved in lymphocytes activation (11Gelfand E.W. Cheung R.K. Mills G.B. Grinstein S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 917-922Google Scholar, 12Dennis G.J. Mizuguchi J. McMillan V. Finkelman F.D. Ohara J. Mond J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4307-4312Google Scholar). However, both cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α and Ig-β, like associated subunits of T cell antigen receptors or Fc receptors, contain an ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), which contains conserved tyrosine and leucine or isoleucine amino acids (YXX(L/I)XXXXXXXYXX(L/I)) (13Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Google Scholar). One particularity of Ig-α and Ig-β ITAMs is their high homology because they mostly differ by the four amino acids located before the second conserved tyrosine, the same four residues determining the in vitro association of Ig-α with fyn (14Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Google Scholar).Functional analysis of Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic domains in B cells established that both are able to induce an increase of intracellular calcium concentration (15Sanchez M.

Cassard S. Malissen B. Korn H. Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6491-6497Google Scholar). Although Ig-β was as efficient as Ig-α in triggering protein-tyrosine kinase activation, only Ig-α-containing chimeras were able to trigger an efficient signal transduction leading to an extracellular calcium influx and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in the IIA1.6 B cell line. Ig-β triggered an oscillatory release from intracellular calcium stores and no IL-2 secretion (18Choquet D. Ku G. Cassard S. Malissen B. Korn H. Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6491-6497Google Scholar). Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic domains therefore possess their own distinct signaling capabilities. In this study, the molecular basis of the different signaling capacities of Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic tails were analyzed. We showed that BCR subunits transducing activities are based on the ITAM conserved sequence, but they may be regulated by unconserved sequences located inside or outside the motif.RESULTSThe intracellular signaling activity of mIg-associated subunits, Ig-α and Ig-β, was analyzed by expressing, in the B cell line IIA1.6, chimeras fusing the cytoplasmic domain of either Ig-α or Ig-β to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of FcγRII. Both chimeras activated tyrosine kinases (Fig. 1a), but only Ig-α chimeras (c.Ig-α) stimulation induced intracellular calcium modifications composed of an initial release from intracellular stores followed by an extracellular calcium influx, whereas Ig-β chimeras (c.Ig-β) stimulation triggered an oscillatory release of calcium from intracellular stores (Fig. 1b) (18Choquet D. Ku G. Cassard S. Malissen B. Korn H. Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6491-6497Google Scholar). Interestingly, only Ig-α chimeras, as well as endogenous mIg, were efficient to induce the secretion of cytokines.The role of calcium influx in B cell signaling was analyzed by measuring IL-2 secretion after stimulation of Ig-α chimera or mIgG in conditions that prevented the extracellular calcium influx. Cells expressing c·Ig-α were incubated with EGTA to chelate the extracellular calcium or in a calcium free medium. Cross-linking of c.Ig-α or of mIgG in the 1 mM EGTA-containing medium (or in calcium-free medium) prevented calcium influx (data not shown) and IL-2 secretion by transfected cells (Fig. 1c). Both signaling events were restored by adding 1 mM CaCl2. Extracellular calcium influx is therefore required for the triggering of cytokine secretion after cross-linking of Ig-α chimera or the whole BCR. Moreover, although the cytoplasmic tail of Ig-α and Ig-β both contain an ITAM, only Ig-α induced efficient signal transduction. Ig-α therefore accounts for the ability of BCR to induce calcium influx and subsequent cell activation events. Peptide sequence of Ig-α and Ig-β ITAM must determine their interactions with specific cytoplasmic effectors that induce either calcium influx and cytokine secretion or calcium oscillatory release.Requirements of the Conserved ITAM Tyrosine Residues for the Signaling Capacities of Ig-α and Ig-β TailsTo identify the peptide sequences of Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic tails involved in the induction of calcium influx, a mutational analysis was performed by using FcR-based chimeras (see Table I). The cytoplasmic tails of Ig-α and Ig-β were shown to interact with different tyrosine kinases, and the phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues constituting their ITAM enhanced these interactions. To evaluate in our model the role of the tyrosine residues present in the ITAM, they were individually mutated to alanine in the cytoplasmic domain of Ig-α (c.Ig-α A23 and c.Ig-α A34) or mutated together in the Ig-β tail (c.Ig-β A15,A26). These constructions were stably expressed in IIA1.6 cells, and surface expressions were evaluated by flow cytometry using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2).Table IChimeric constructs of FcR type II and cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α and Ig-βFcR-Ig-α/β chimeras and mutantsCytoplasmic domains23 34↓↓c.Ig-αRKRWQNEKFGVDMPDDYEDENLYEGLNLDDCSMYEDISRGLQGTYQDVGNLHIGDAQLEKPc.Ig-α A23RKRWQNEKFGVDMPDDYEDENLAEGLNLDDCSMYEDISRGLQGTYQDVGNLHIGDAQLEKPc.Ig-α A34RKRWQNEKFGVDMPDDYEDENLYEGLNLDDCSMAEDISRGLQGTYQDVGNLHIGDAQLEKPc.Ig-α QTATRKRWQNEKFGVDMPDDYEDENLYEGLNLDQTATYEDISRGLQGTYQDVGNLHIGDAQLEKPc.Ig-α mRKR——Δ——-EDENLYEGLNLDDCSMYEDISRGLQGT——–Δ——–15 26↓↓c.Ig-βRKRDGKAGM________EEDHTYEGLNIDQTATYEDIVTLRTGEVKWSVGEHPGQEc.Ig-β A15,A26RKRDGKAGM________EEDHTAEGLNIDQTATAEDIVTLRTGEVKWSVGEHPGQEc.Ig-β DCSMRKRDGKAGM________EEDHTYEGLNIDDCSMYEDIVTLRTGEVKWSVGEHPGQEc.Ig-β mRKR–Δ—________EEDHTYEGLNIDQTATYEDIVTLRTGE—–Δ—— Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Surface expression of Ig-α and Ig-β chimeras in IIA1.6 transfected cells by indirect fluorescence.

Our previous results showed that the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α and Ig-β are able to trigger phosphorylation of similar major intracellular proteins (Fig. 1a). As expected, c.Ig-α A23 and c.Ig-α A34 or c.Ig-β A15,A26 were inefficient to trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, whereas in control experiments, stimulation of mIg triggered tyrosine phosphorylation in all the transfectant cells (Fig. 3a). The stimulation of these mutated chimeras was also inefficient to induce any changes of the intracellular calcium concentration, as measured at the single cell level by video imaging (Fig. 3b), and they did not trigger IL-2 secretion (Fig. 3c). All the transfected cells were responsive to stimulation via mIg. Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic tails trigger two different signaling pathways, which are therefore both dependent on ITAM tyrosine residues. As shown by others (15Sanchez M. Misulovin Z. Burkhardt A.L.

Because both chains activate different signaling pathways, some Ig-α or Ig-β specific amino acids must modulate their signaling activities.Fig. 3The mutation of the tyrosine residues in the entire cytoplasmic tail of Ig-α (c.Ig-α A23 and c.Ig-α A34) or Ig-β (c.Ig-β A15,A26) prevent the triggering of intracellular signaling events.

The peptide sequence DCSM is present in Ig-α, whereas Ig-β contains the sequence QTAT. This difference has been related to the specific binding of src family kinases to the cytoplasmic tails of Ig-α or Ig-β. In a nonphosphorylated status, only the molecules bearing the four amino acids DCSM bind the tyrosine kinase fyn (14Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Google Scholar). The role of these four amino acids in the signaling activity of Ig-α and Ig-β was investigated by expressing two chimeras containing a switch of the sequences QTAT versus DCSM in Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic tails (c.Ig-α QTAT and c.Ig-β DCSM) (see Table I and Fig. 2). The cross-linking of c.Ig-β DCSM triggered the phosphorylation of numerous intracellular proteins and an extracellular calcium influx leading to IL-2 secretion (Fig. 4, a, b, and c). The exchange of QTAT by DCSM inside the entire Ig-β cytoplasmic domain was therefore sufficient to convert the transducing phenotype of Ig-β in that of Ig-α tail. Because the cross-linking of c.Ig-β was not able to trigger a calcium influx, the capacity of c.Ig-α and c.Ig-β DCSM to trigger a calcium influx is probably determined by the presence of the DCSM polypeptide sequence in their cytoplasmic tail. In contrast, the conversion of the DCSM sequence into QTAT in the Ig-α tail did not prevent the triggering of calcium influx and tyrosine kinase activation (Fig. 4, a, b, and c). In all these experiments, the transfectant cells were responsive to anti-IgG. The results obtained with the switching mutants showed that the ability of Ig-β to trigger different intracellular events may be modulated by amino acids located between the conserved ITAM residues, whereas the similar switch (QTAT) in the entire Ig-α cytoplasmic tail does not affect its signaling capacity. The conformation induced by the peptide sequences surrounding Ig-β ITAM must be important to induce its interactions with specific intracellular effectors.Fig. 4The inversion of the peptide sequences DCSM and QTAT change the transducing capacities of Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic domains. a, tyrosine kinase activation after cross-linking of the two chimeras containing the inversion (c.Ig-β DCSM and c.Ig-α QTAT) in the same conditions than before. b, intracellular calcium measurement after cross-linking of the chimeras.

Boxed curves show examples of a single cell response. c, IL-2 secretion after cross-linking of the chimeras or after cross-linking of mIg for control experiments. The measurements were done in the same conditions as in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Activity of Ig-β ITAM Is Regulated by Flanking SequencesThe sequences flanking the two motifs are different between Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic tails. To test whether flanking sequences affect the signaling capacities of ITAMs, chimeras containing isolated Ig-α or Ig-β motifs (c.Ig-α m and c.Ig-β m; Table I) were expressed in IIA1.6 cells (Fig. 2). The stimulation of c.Ig-α m induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates similar to those induced by the cross-linking of c.Ig-α, with a maximum of phosphorylation intensity after 1 min of stimulation (Fig. 5a). The pattern of calcium signaling obtained after cross-linking of c.Ig-α m was similar to the pattern obtained after stimulation of c.Ig-α, comprising a release of calcium from the intracellular stores and an influx of extracellular calcium (Fig. 5b). This calcium response triggered by the cross-linking of c.Ig-α m was followed by later events of signals transduction, as measured by IL-2 secretion (Fig. 5c). Thus, when isolated, the Ig-α ITAM was as efficient as the entire Ig-α cytoplasmic tail and as the whole BCR in triggering cytokine production. The ITAM of Ig-α is therefore fully functional inside the entire Ig-α tail environment, and it is not regulated directly by its flanking sequences.Fig. 5Ig-α ITAM functions as the entire cytoplasmic tail of Ig-α, whereas the motif of Ig-β does not function as the entire intracellular domain of Ig-β. a, intracellular protein phosphorylation induced by the cross-linking of the chimeras for the indicated times. The cells were also stimulated by their endogenous mIgG (arrow). b, measurement of intracellular calcium concentration after cross-linking of chimeras containing the Ig-α or Ig-β ITAM (c.Ig-α m and c.Ig-β m, respectively). The arrows indicate the triggering of the stimulation, and the boxed curves represent an example of a single cell response. c, stimulation of both chimeras triggered IL-2 secretion. The cells all produced IL-2 after cross-linking of mIgG. This experiment was done under the same conditions as described in the legend to Fig. 3, Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Surprisingly, the isolated Ig-β ITAM had different signaling abilities than the entire cytoplasmic tail of Ig-β. In contrast to intracellular calcium oscillations induced by Ig-β chimeras, the cross-linking of c.Ig-β m triggered a complete calcium response composed of an initial calcium release from intracellular stores followed by an extracellular calcium influx (Fig. 5b), like the cross-linking of mIg, c.Ig-α, or c.Ig-α m. Moreover, the stimulation of c.Ig-β m was very efficient in inducing IL-2 secretion (Fig. 5c). In contrast, no clear differences of phosphoproteins were detected after cross-linking of c.Ig-β m or c.Ig-β, whereas the maximum intensities of the phosphorylations were respectively observed after 2 and 1 min of cross-linking (Figs. 1a and 5a). Thus, the isolated Ig-β ITAM and the entire cytoplasmic tail of Ig-β are both able to activate tyrosine kinases but differ in terms of calcium signaling and triggering of IL-2 secretion.These results show that the two isolated Ig-α and Ig-β ITAMs are able to trigger the same intracellular events leading to cytokine production and that the unconserved environment of an ITAM can regulate the signaling activity of this kind of tyrosine-based activating motifs.DISCUSSIONStimulation of BCR triggers intracellular events such as protein kinase activation and increase of intracellular calcium concentration resulting in cell activation. In the present work, we evaluated the relative contributions of different domains of Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic tails in B cell signaling. The cytoplasmic domain of Ig-α, and more specifically its ITAM, reflects the transducing capacities of the whole BCR in terms of phosphoproteins induction, calcium mobilization, and IL-2 secretion, which is dependent on the triggering of a calcium influx. In contrast, Ig-β ITAM activity is modulated by amino acids located between the conserved residues and by the ITAM flanking sequences, although the signaling capacities of both ITAMs require conserved tyrosine residues.The transducing events triggered by Ig-α ITAM are similar to those triggered by the entire intracellular domain of Ig-α and by the whole BCR. In this cascade of intracellular signaling events, the triggering of extracellular calcium influx is a crucial step of B cell activation, which may be inhibited by the cross-linking of mIg with FcR for IgG (22Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Drake J.R. Choquet D. Hunziker W. Guillet J.-G. Webster P. Sautes C. Mellman I. Fridman W.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1808-1812Google Scholar, 23Choquet D. Partiseti M. Amigorena S.

In addition, chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA inhibits the triggering of both calcium influx and lymphokine secretion after stimulation of either BCR or Ig-α chimeras (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, Ig-β chimera stimulation did not efficiently induce lymphokine secretion, although this molecule triggered intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation and oscillatory releases of intracellular calcium stores without extracellular influx (18Choquet D. Ku G. Cassard S. Malissen B. Korn H. Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6491-6497Google Scholar). It has been shown that in T cells, IgM-Ig-β and CD8-Ig-β chimeras were able to trigger IL-2 after cross-linking (20Burkhardt A.L. Costa T. Misulovin Z. Stealy B. Bolen J.B. Nussenzweig M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1095-1103Google Scholar, 17Taddie J.A. Hurley T.R. Hardwick B.S. Sefton B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13529-13535Google Scholar), but T cells could lack an intracellular effector that regulates Ig-β activity in B cells. The triggering of late B cell activation events as assessed by lymphokine secretion is therefore based on the signaling capacities of Ig-α cytoplasmic domain, which may be reduced to its ITAM.The Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic tails therefore triggered distinct intracellular events, whereas, strikingly, the isolated ITAMs have the same efficient transducing capacities. Stimulation of both chimeras containing the isolated motifs induced the phosphorylation of the same intracellular substrates and triggered both calcium influx and IL-2 secretion. These results are consistent with data obtained with similar μCD8-based chimeras containing the isolated ITAM of Ig-α or Ig-β (25Law D.A. Chan V.W.F. Datta S.K. DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 645-657Google Scholar). They showed that cross-linking of these chimeras triggered the same protein tyrosine phosphorylations and calcium mobilization and induced the interaction of the motifs with the same kinases lyn, fyn, and syk. Another study has also shown that phosphorylated ITAMs of Ig-α or Ig-β have similar abilities to interact with fyn in vitro (14Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the ITAM tyrosine therefore seems to be a crucial step to induce the transducing cascade because the mutation of ITAM-conserved tyrosine residues totally abolished the signaling capabilities of both Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic tails (Fig. 3; 15Sanchez M. Misulovin Z. Burkhardt A.L. Mahajan S. Costa T. Franke R. Bolen J.B. Nussenzweig M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1049-1055Google Scholar and 19Flaswinkel H. Reth M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 83-89Google Scholar, 20Burkhardt A.L. Costa T. Misulovin Z. Stealy B. Bolen J.B. Nussenzweig M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1095-1103Google Scholar, 21Williams G.T. Peaker C.J.G. Patel K.J. Neuberger M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 474-478Google Scholar), perhaps by preventing the interaction with fyn or with other kinase(s). Therefore, as already described, the ITAM-tyrosine residues are required to give to Ig-α and Ig-β their transducing capabilities.The specificity of Ig-α and Ig-β tails to trigger different signaling events seems determined by nonconserved sequences between the cytoplasmic tails of Ig-α and Ig-β. One of the differences between the two ITAM-amino acid sequences is constituted of four amino acids located between the conserved tyrosine residues (DCSM in Ig-α and QTAT in Ig-β). Our results show that this difference of four amino acids do not seem to play a role in the transduction events triggered by the isolated motifs (Fig. 5), but it is important when the motifs are examined in their entire cytoplasmic environment. Indeed, the conversion of the four amino acids QTAT into DCSM in the Ig-β cytoplasmic tail changed the signaling activity of Ig-β into those of Ig-α (Fig. 4), perhaps by enhancing the basal level of fyn associated with the chimera, because only the DCSM-bearing ITAMs were able to interact with fyn in vitro (14Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Google Scholar). In contrast, when the amino acids DCSM were changed into QTAT in Ig-α cytoplasmic tail, the transducing capacities of Ig-α were not switched, showing that QTAT is necessary but not sufficient to inactivate the calcium influx and/or to activate calcium oscillations. These results indicate that there are other amino acids inside or outside the Ig-β ITAM that also regulate its signaling capacities.The ITAM of Ig-β, in contrast to the entire cytoplasmic domain of Ig-β, is fully efficient to trigger intracellular events leading to lymphokine secretion. This indicates that ITAM flanking sequences regulate the activity of the Ig-β ITAM. These sequences are inefficient, however, when the four amino acids QTAT are replaced by DCSM (Fig. 4). This suggests that other amino acids that differ between the two motifs, like the four amino acids located before the first tyrosine of the two motifs (DENL in Ig-α and EDHT in Ig-β), may play a role in the regulation capacity of flanking regions of Ig-β ITAM. This sequence could regulate the Ig-β ITAM by interacting with intracellular proteins, like the two unidentified p40 and p42 phosphoproteins (9Clark M.R. Campbell K.S. Kazlauskas A. Johnson S.A. Hertz M. Potter T.A. Pleiman C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 123-126Google Scholar), which bind specifically to Ig-β. Two nonexclusive models may be proposed to account for the specificity of Ig-α and Ig-β intracellular signaling. First, the nonconserved sequences located inside or outside the ITAM induce conformational modifications, which modulate the affinity of cytoplasmic effectors for conserved tyrosine residues located in the ITAM. Second, each domain of the cytoplasmic tails of Ig-α and Ig-β (QTAT, DCSM, or flanking sequences) may interact with distinct intracellular effectors, which are specifically recruited by receptor aggregation and thus determine the activation of different intracellular signaling pathways. However, the fact that the deletion of one of the flanking sequences is enough to allow Ig-β to trigger IL-2 secretion after stimulation (data not shown) supports a conformational role for the flanking sequences.The signaling activity of the BCR-associated subunits can be regulated by cross-linking of mIg with FcR (22Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Drake J.R. Choquet D. Hunziker W. Guillet J.-G. Webster P. Sautes C. Mellman I. Fridman W.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1808-1812Google Scholar, 26Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Google Scholar) involving the phosphatase PTP1C, which acts as a trans-regulator of the Ig-α/Ig-β ITAM activity (27D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.H. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Google Scholar). Our results show that QTAT or flanking sequences regulate Ig-β ITAM signaling activities, meaning that these activating motifs can be regulated in a cis-position. It remains to establish what is the function of these sequences in the whole BCR complex and whether cytoplasmic ligands of Ig-β cytoplasmic tail may regulate the signaling activity carry out by Ig-α cytoplasmic tail, as is suggested by results showing that mIg stimulation of spleen B cells could trigger calcium oscillations (28Wilson H.A. Greenblatt D. Poenie M. Finkelman F.D. Tsien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 601-606Google Scholar). During B cell activation and differentiation, BCR composition may vary because heterodimers with cytoplasmic deleted isoforms of Ig-α or Ig-β have been reported (29Friedrich R.J. Campbell K.S. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2814-2822Google Scholar, 30Ishihara K. Wood Jr., W.J. Wall R. Sakaguchi N. Michnoff C. Tucker P.W. Kincade P.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2253-2262Google Scholar). The heterodimers that contain one of these deleted forms therefore probably have the signaling capacities of either Ig-α or Ig-β. Variations in cytosol composition could also determine the activation of one chain more than the other or could trigger different events depending on the effectors present in the cells, like for Ig-β chimeras in T cells that are able to induce IL-2 secretion (17Taddie J.A. Hurley T.R. Hardwick B.S. Sefton B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13529-13535Google Scholar, 20Burkhardt A.L. Costa T. Misulovin Z. Stealy B. Bolen J.B. Nussenzweig M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1095-1103Google Scholar). The analysis of relative signaling capacities of Ig-α and Ig-β and their peptide sequence requirement is a first step in understanding BCR signaling events during the different stages of B cell differentiation or activation. INTRODUCTIONThe transducing capacities of BCR 1The abbreviations used are: BCRB cell antigen receptor(s)mIgmembrane immunoglobulinIL-2interleukin-2FcRFcγRIImmotif. are based on its multimolecular structure. BCRs are composed of antigen binding units, the membrane immunoglobulins (mIg), noncovalently associated with transducing subunits, the Ig-α/Ig-β heterodimers. The cytoplasmic tails of these associated chains become phosphorylated after cross-linking of mIg (1Gold M.R. Matsuuchi L. Kelly R.B. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3436-3440Google Scholar) and associate with intracellular effectors (2Campbell K.S. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 441-448Google Scholar) including the src kinases lyn, fyn, blk, lck (3Yamanashi Y. Kakiuchi T. Mizuguchi J. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Science. 1991; 251: 192-194Google Scholar, 4Burkhardt A.L. Brunswick M. Bolen J.B. Mond J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7410-7414Google Scholar, 5Lin J. Justement L.B. J.

Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Google Scholar, 8Yamada T. Taniguchi T. Yang C. Yasue S. Saito H. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 455-459Google Scholar), as well as other kinases such as PI-3 kinase and unidentified phosphoproteins (9Clark M.R. Campbell K.S. Kazlauskas A. Johnson S.A. Hertz M. Potter T.A. Pleiman C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 123-126Google Scholar). By adsorbing B cell lysates on fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α or Ig-β, the unphosphorylated cytoplasmic domains were shown to bind to different kinases. The cytoplasmic tail of Ig-α interact with fyn and lyn and with an unidentified molecule of 38 kDa, whereas the cytoplasmic tail of Ig-β binds to two unidentified phosphoproteins of 40 and 42 kDa (9Clark M.R. Campbell K.S. Kazlauskas A. Johnson S.A. Hertz M. Potter T.A. Pleiman C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 123-126Google Scholar). The activation of tyrosine kinase is followed by an increase of intracellular calcium concentration (10Baixeras E. Kroemer G. Cuende E. Marquez C. Bosca L. Martinez J.E.A. Martinez A.-C. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 132: 5-47Google Scholar). Typical cytoplasmic calcium increase includes an initial release of calcium from intracellular stores followed by an influx of extracellular calcium, which is involved in lymphocytes activation (11Gelfand E.W. Cheung R.K. Mills G.B. Grinstein S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 917-922Google Scholar, 12Dennis G.J. Mizuguchi J. McMillan V. Finkelman F.D. Ohara J. Mond J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4307-4312Google Scholar). However, both cytoplasmic domains of Ig-α and Ig-β, like associated subunits of T cell antigen receptors or Fc receptors, contain an ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), which contains conserved tyrosine and leucine or isoleucine amino acids (YXX(L/I)XXXXXXXYXX(L/I)) (13Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Google Scholar). One particularity of Ig-α and Ig-β ITAMs is their high homology because they mostly differ by the four amino acids located before the second conserved tyrosine, the same four residues determining the in vitro association of Ig-α with fyn (14Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Google Scholar).Functional analysis of Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic domains in B cells established that both are able to induce an increase of intracellular calcium concentration (15Sanchez M.

Cassard S. Malissen B. Korn H. Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6491-6497Google Scholar). Although Ig-β was as efficient as Ig-α in triggering protein-tyrosine kinase activation, only Ig-α-containing chimeras were able to trigger an efficient signal transduction leading to an extracellular calcium influx and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in the IIA1.6 B cell line. Ig-β triggered an oscillatory release from intracellular calcium stores and no IL-2 secretion (18Choquet D. Ku G. Cassard S. Malissen B. Korn H. Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6491-6497Google Scholar). Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic domains therefore possess their own distinct signaling capabilities. In this study, the molecular basis of the different signaling capacities of Ig-α and Ig-β cytoplasmic tails were analyzed. We showed that BCR subunits transducing activities are based on the ITAM conserved sequence, but they may be regulated by unconserved sequences located inside or outside the motif."

https://openalex.org/W2069138122,"Rabbit, rat, and pigeon are species representative of three cardiac muscle mitochondrial ATPase regulatory classes, a, b and c, respectively. Class a species contain a full complement of higher affinity ATPase inhibitor subunit, IF1, in their cardiac muscle mitochondria and show marked IF1-mediated mitochondrial ATPase inhibition during myocardial ischemia. Class b species contain low levels of higher affinity IF1 and show very little IF1-mediated ATPase inhibition during ischemia. Class c species contain a full complement of a lower affinity form of IF1 and show a low-to-moderate level of IF1- mediated ATPase inhibition during ischemia. In the present study we perfused hearts of a member of each regulatory class through the coronary arteries with the uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), before making them ischemic. We then compared net rates of cell ATP depletion during ischemia in the FCCP-treated hearts to identically treated FCCP-free hearts. Thus, we tested the relative capacities of cardiac muscle mitochondria of the three species to avert a potentially greatly increased net rate of cell ATP depletion due to ATP hydrolysis by the fully uncoupled mitochondrial ATPase. We found that FCCP-uncoupling in situ had a relatively small effect on ATP depletion during ischemia in rabbit hearts, that it dramatically accelerated ATP depletion in ischemic rat hearts, and that it had an intermediate effect on ATP depletion in ischemic pigeon hearts. These results demonstrate for the first time the relative extents to which IF1-mediated mitochondrial ATPase inhibition can slow cell ATP depletion due to the fully uncoupled mitochondrial ATPase in these three classes of hearts. They show that, in contrast to the situation in rabbit hearts, the low level of higher affinity IF1 present in the cardiac muscle mitochondria of the rat is, under these conditions, essentially nonfunctional, while the full complement of the lower affinity form of IF1 present in the cardiac muscle mitochondria of the pigeon is partially functional in that it appeared to provide an intermediate level of protection against rapid cell ATP depletion.

A variety of studies suggest that the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor subunit, IF1, is not required for ATP synthesis, but that it operates as a check on ATP hydrolysis by the mitochondrial ATPase under nonenergizing conditions. Thus, for example, Tagawa and co-workers (1Ishikawa N. Yoshida Y. Hashimoto T. Ogasawara N. Yoshikawa H. Imamoto F. Tagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6274-6278Google Scholar, 2Yoshida Y. Sato T. Hashimoto T. Ichikawa N. Nakai S. Yoshikawa H. Imamoto F. Tagawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 49-53Google Scholar) have studied an IF1-minus mutant of bakers' yeast that can make ATP by oxidative phosphorylation just as well as wild-type cells, but, unlike the wild-type, it cannot survive exposure to mitochondrial uncoupling agents. Thus, while the wild-type can tolerate uncouplers because it possesses a means of slowing ATP hydrolysis by the unenergized mitochondrial ATP synthase, the mutant cannot overcome the effects of an uncoupler challenge on ATP depletion. Functional ATPase inhibitor subunit is also missing in Luft's disease (3Yamada E.W. Huzel N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 143-147Google Scholar), a rare human mitochondrial myopathy described as non-thyroidal hypermetabolism (4DiMauro S. Bonilla E. Lee C.P. Schotland D.L. Scarpa A. Conn Jr., H. Chance B. J. Neurol. Sci. 1976; 27: 217-232Google Scholar). While the disease is characterized by normal phosphorylation capacity, there is “loose coupling” (4DiMauro S. Bonilla E. Lee C.P. Schotland D.L. Scarpa A. Conn Jr., H. Chance B. J. Neurol. Sci. 1976; 27: 217-232Google Scholar). Finally, work by ourselves has demonstated that so-called fast heart rate mammalian species like the rat have low levels of IF1 in their cardiac muscle mitochondria (5Rouslin W. Am. J.

Biomembr. 1995; 27: 117-125Google Scholar), yet these IF1-poor mitochondria clearly make ATP normally both in situ and in vitro. In the present study we examined for the first time the effects of the uncoupler, FCCP, 1The abbreviations used are: FCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidRHMPrabbit heart mitochondrial particlesSMPsubmitochondrial particles. introduced in situ through the coronary arteries, on net rates of ATP depletion during myocardial ischemia in three species representative of three different cardiac mitochondrial ATPase regulatory classes. FCCP uncoupling in situ had little effect on net rates of ATP depletion in ischemic rabbit hearts which possess a full complement of a higher affinity form of IF1. However, it greatly accelerated net rates of ATP depletion in ischemic rat hearts, which possess only low levels of a higher affinity form of IF1. Last, FCCP had an intermediate accelerating effect on ATP depletion in ischemic pigeon hearts which possess a full complement of a lower affinity form of IF1. These studies demonstrate that, while the cardiac muscle mitochondria of the rat and pigeon lack an effective complement of IF1, they suggest that mitochondria, which lack a functional complement of IF1, may employ other mechanisms of inner mitochondrial membrane proton blockade and that these alternative mechanisms appear to be at least as effective as IF1 in preventing ATP hydrolysis by the mitochondrial ATPase during myocardial ischemia in the absence of uncouplers. carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid rabbit heart mitochondrial particles submitochondrial particles. One and one-half-kg male New Zealand White rabbits, 300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats, and 800-g American Show Racer pigeons of either sex were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (intravenously to effect for rabbits or intraperitoneally to effect for rats and pigeons) and killed by the rapid removal of their hearts while the animals were fully anesthetized. Upon removal, the hearts were placed immediately into either ice-cold 180 mM KCl, 10 mM EGTA2 (KE solution) for hearts used for the immediate preparation of mitochondria or IF1 or cold Krebs-bicarbonate buffer for hearts to be cannulated and perfused. For the preparation of mitochondria, the hearts were minced finely in ice-cold 180 mM KCl, 10 mM EGTA, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2 (KEAM solution) and mitochondria prepared from the cardiac muscle minces by Polytron homogenization as described earlier (7Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9657-9661Google Scholar, 8Rouslin W. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: H743-H748Google Scholar)). For experiments utilizing control-energized mitochondria (Table I), the mitochondria were energized by shaking them vigorously for 10 min at 37°C in 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2 (SEM solution), with 6.25 mM glutamate, 6.25 mM malate, and 2.5 mM Pi. This procedure served to maximally activate the mitochondrial ATPase. IF1-depleted rabbit heart particles (RHMP) used in the experiments depicted in Fig. 1 were prepared essentially by the same method used to prepare “regular” submitochondrial particles except that sonication was carried out at pH 9.0 in the presence of 1.0 mM MgATP and they were centrifuged after sonication for 60 min at 226,000 × g. This procedure served to strip away at least 90% of the endogenous IF1 present on the particles. IF1-containing extracts used either for rebinding to IF1-depleted RHMP as in the experiments presented in Fig. 1, or for the determination of IF1 content, as in the experiments presented in Table I, were prepared by alkaline extraction of intact mitochondria as described earlier (9Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3769Google Scholar, 10Frangione B. Rosenwasser R. Penefsky H.S. Pullman M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7403-7407Google Scholar, 11Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3472-3476Google Scholar, 12Rouslin W. Pullman M.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 661-668Google Scholar). The in vitro incubations of inhibitor-containing extracts with IF1-depleted RHMP for the experiments presented in Fig. 1 were carried out for 20 min at 37°C at pH 6.2 in a final volume of 2.0 ml. The incubation medium contained 0.25 M sucrose, 0.1 mM MgATP, and 20 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.2, in the presence of the KCl concentrations indicated. Aliquots of RHMP containing the equivalent of 0.5 mg of rabbit heart mitochondria were added from a pooled suspension of RHMP made from a known amount of mitochondria. Aliquots of mitochondrial extracts from each species that contained the amount of IF1 present in 0.5 mg of mitochondria were added to the particles. Thus, the naturally occurring or species-endogenous ratios of IF1 to ATPase were employed in these experiments. The rat heart SMP titration procedure described by us previously (5Rouslin W. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: H622-H627Google Scholar, 11Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3472-3476Google Scholar, 12Rouslin W. Pullman M.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 661-668Google Scholar, 13Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 68-75Google Scholar) was used for the normalization of the IF1-containing extracts for the experiments presented in Fig. 1. Mitochondrial ATPase activity was measured in sonicated mitochondria (Tables I) or in RHMP (Fig. 1) using a modification of the method of Tzagoloff (14Tzagoloff A. Byington K.H. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2405-2412Google Scholar) as described by us previously (5Rouslin W. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: H622-H627Google Scholar, 7Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9657-9661Google Scholar, 8Rouslin W. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: H743-H748Google Scholar, 11Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3472-3476Google Scholar). The IF1 content determinations presented in Table I were carried out as described previously using our rat heart SMP titration procedure (5Rouslin W. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: H622-H627Google Scholar, 11Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3472-3476Google Scholar, 12Rouslin W. Pullman M.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 661-668Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiration and degrees of respiratory coupling remaining in mitochondria from FCCP-free and -treated hearts (Fig. 2) were measured polarographically at 30°C using a Gilson model K-IC Oxygraph equipped with a Clark oxygen electrode as described earlier (15Rouslin W. Erickson J.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1986; 18: 1187-1195Google Scholar). Briefly, approximately 1.5 mg of mitochondria were used per assay, and the assay medium contained 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM Pi, 6.25 mM glutamate, and 6.25 mM malate. Respiration was initiated by the addition of approximately 500 nmol of ADP. For the ATP depletion time course experiments (Fig. 3), the hearts were cannulated through the aorta and perfused retrogradely at 37°C with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, bubbled continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The perfusion buffer was pumped at 20 ml/min for rabbit and pigeon hearts or at 10 ml/min for rat hearts. Once cannulated, the hearts were perfused for 10 min (control hearts) followed by 30 s at the same rate of flow with the same buffer containing 20 μM FCCP (FCCP-treated hearts). After perfusion, the hearts were rapidly removed from the cannula and quickly sectioned into ventricular myocardial samples of roughly equal size. The tissue samples were then made ischemic by placing them into sealed Ziploc plastic bags immersed in a circulating water bath at 37°C as described earlier (5Rouslin W. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: H622-H627Google Scholar, 6Rouslin W. Frank G.D. Broge C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 117-125Google Scholar, 7Rouslin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9657-9661Google Scholar, 8Rouslin W. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: H743-H748Google Scholar). At the times indicated, they were removed from the bags and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were lyophilized overnight and the lyophilized tissue samples finely powdered and extracted with trichloroacetic acid. The acid extracts were then deproteinated by centrifugation and known amounts of the total removed for the enzymatic assay of ATP (Fig. 3) or lactate as described by us previously (16Rouslin W. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1988; 20: 999-1007Google Scholar, 17Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Grupp I.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H1759-H1766Google Scholar). Protein was estimated by the Lowry procedure (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Table I lists the IF1 contents, the maximal energized mitochondrial ATPase activities, and the ratios of the two in rabbit, rat, and pigeon heart mitochondria. As reported by us earlier (6Rouslin W. Frank G.D. Broge C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 117-125Google Scholar, 19Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 103-111Google Scholar, 20Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 443-450Google Scholar), the rabbit, rat, and pigeon are representative of three distinct mitochondrial ATPase regulatory classes. These are, respectively, (a) species that contain a full complement of higher affinity ATPase inhibitor subunit, IF1, in their cardiac muscle mitochondria and show marked IF1-mediated mitochondrial ATPase inhibition during myocardial ischemia, (b) species that contain low levels of higher affinity IF1 and show very little IF1-mediated ATPase inhibition during ischemia, and (c) species that contain a full complement of a lower affinity form of IF1 and show a low-to-moderate level of IF1-mediated ATPase inhibition during ischemia. Fig. 1 shows the effect of varying ionic strength on the inhibition of the ATPase in rabbit submitochondrial particles by species-endogenous levels of IF1 from rabbit, rat, and pigeon heart mitochondria. As is evident from Fig. 1, physiological ionic strength interferes significantly more with ATPase inhibition by the pigeon inhibitor than by rabbit IF1. At species-endogenous levels, the rat inhibitor has very little effect on ATPase activity at any ionic strength. However, as we have shown earlier, when the concentration of the rat inhibitor is increased to the level present in rabbit heart mitochondria, it behaves much like the rabbit inhibitor in the face of increasing ionic strength (6Rouslin W. Frank G.D. Broge C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 117-125Google Scholar, 20Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 443-450Google Scholar). The rationale for choosing ionic strength as a parameter that might prove useful for distinguishing between possible species-related differences in IF1-ATPase interaction was based largely on earlier studies, which showed that increasing ionic strength interfered with IF1-mediated ATPase inhibition in bovine heart SMP (21Van de Stadt R.J. Van Dam K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 347: 240-252Google Scholar). While pigeon was the lower affinity IF1-possessing species chosen for the present study, it may be noted that this ATPase regulatory class also includes guinea pig, turtle, and frog (6Rouslin W. Frank G.D. Broge C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 117-125Google Scholar). Thus while three of the four members of this ATPase regulatory class that have been studied by us are either a bird, a reptile, or an amphibian, of the 15 vertebrate species examined by us thus far, the guinea pig is the only mammalian species found to contain a lower affinity ATPase inhibitor (6Rouslin W. Frank G.D. Broge C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 117-125Google Scholar). In that the guinea pig system resembles that present in birds, reptiles and amphibians (6Rouslin W. Frank G.D. Broge C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 117-125Google Scholar, 19Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 103-111Google Scholar, 20Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 443-450Google Scholar), it may be useful to regard it as an evolutionarily less modern system than that present in the other mammals that have been investigated. Indeed, work by others on molecular phylogenetic relationships between guinea pigs and rodents and between guinea pigs and other mammalian orders suggests that the old classification of guinea pigs as rodents should be abandoned (22Li W.-H. Gouy M. Sharp P.M. O'Huigin C. Yang Y.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6703-6707Google Scholar). The guinea pig would appear to be a member of a separate order of mammals that branched off from the vertebrate evolutionary tree earlier than rodents but somewhat later than marsupials, birds, and reptiles (22Li W.-H. Gouy M. Sharp P.M. O'Huigin C. Yang Y.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6703-6707Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows representative polarographic tracings for mitochondria isolated from FCCP-free (control) and FCCP-perfused rabbit, rat, and pigeon hearts. While mitochondria from control hearts exhibited good respiratory control and coupling, those isolated from hearts perfused for 30 s with 20 μM FCCP were completely uncoupled. It may be mentioned that the FCCP-perfused hearts stopped beating prior to the conclusion of FCCP perfusion. Fig. 3 presents representative ATP depletion time courses for control and FCCP-treated rabbit, rat, and pigeon hearts during total ischemia. It is evident from the data that total uncoupling of the mitochondrial ATPase in situ had relatively little effect on the net rate of ATP depletion in the ischemic rabbit heart. In contrast, FCCP uncoupling in situ had a marked accelerating effect on the rate of ATP depletion in ischemic rat hearts. Thus, while total ATP depletion took approximately 30 min in FCCP-free rat hearts, it took only approximately 2 min in the FCCP-perfused rat hearts. The results with pigeon hearts were intermediate in that the effect of uncoupling in situ was marked, but not nearly as extreme as in the rat. These results demonstrate directly for the first time the relative extents to which IF1-mediated mitochondrial ATPase inhibition can slow cell ATP depletion due to the fully uncoupled mitochondrial ATPase in these three classes of hearts. They show that, in contrast to the situation in rabbit hearts, the low level of higher affinity IF1 present in the cardiac muscle mitochondria of the rat is, under the conditions used, essentially nonfunctional, while the full complement of the lower affinity form of IF1 present in the cardiac muscle mitochondria of the pigeon is partially functional in that it appeared to provide an intermediate level of protection against rapid cell ATP depletion. In an earlier study we demonstrated that oligomycin inhibition of the mitochondrial ATPase in situ in canine hearts significantly slowed net rates of ATP depletion during a subsequent ischemic interval (17Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Grupp I.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H1759-H1766Google Scholar). These same studies showed that oligomycin inhibition in situ had little ATP-sparing effect in ischemic rat hearts due to a variety of factors discussed in that study (17Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Grupp I.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: H1759-H1766Google Scholar) and in a later report (23Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C209-C216Google Scholar). In the present study, rat hearts were perfused with buffer for 5 min followed by 10 μM oligomycin for 5 min followed by 20 μM FCCP for 30 s as a control for the “FCCP alone” protocol. While FCCP alone caused a cessation of rat heart contraction in approximately 20 s and a concomitant very rapid ATP depletion already evident in the zero time ischemic samples (Fig. 3), in contrast, oligomycin perfusion of rat hearts caused the heart rate to decrease approximately 5-fold from 251 ± 8 beats/min (n = 4) to a sustained rate of 56 ± 10 beats/min (n = 4), but, interestingly, during the subsequent 30 s FCCP perfusion, the heart rate actually increased by approximately 30% to 74 ± 6 beats/min (n = 4). This important and interesting observation may be explained by an increased glycolytic rate supported by the resumption of mitochondrial electron flow due to FCCP uncoupling of oligomycin inhibited, but still coupled electron transport. Thus, lactate accumulation increased from 20.5 μmol/g wet weight after 10 min of ischemia in hearts treated with oligomycin alone to 37.5 μmol/g wet weight after 10 min in hearts treated with oligomycin followed by FCCP. The resumption of mitochondrial electron flow in the oligomycin-inhibited mitochondria in situ presumably facilitated the reoxidation of cytosolic NADH to NAD+ (via the α-glycerophosphate and/or malate-oxaloacetate shuttle) required for the glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase reaction thereby increasing glycolytic ATP generation. Thus, not only did an initial oligomycin inhibition in situ preempt the cessation of contractile activity that would have occurred upon subsequent FCCP perfusion by blocking an uncoupler stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by the mitochondrial ATPase, but it also made possible an increased rate of contractile activity upon the introduction of FCCP through the effect of the uncoupler on glycolytic ATP production. As interesting as these results are in themselves, they raise additional questions about possible fundamental interspecies differences in mechanisms of mitochondrial inner membrane proton blockade. Thus, in the absence of uncoupler, the two so-called fast heart rate species studies here, the rat and pigeon, appeared to resist ATP depletion during ischemia somewhat better than the rabbit, the slow heart rate species studied (Fig. 3). In earlier reports we showed that, while phosphate carrier-mediated Pi/H+ symport is the primary channel for equilibrating protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane of cardiac muscle mitochondria of slow heart rate species including rabbit (19Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 103-111Google Scholar, 24Rouslin W. Broge C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15224-15229Google Scholar) and dog (23Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C209-C216Google Scholar), these same studies demonstrated that rat and pigeon heart mitochondria did not require added Pi to equilibrate protons across the inner membrane (19Rouslin W. Broge C.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 103-111Google Scholar, 24Rouslin W. Broge C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15224-15229Google Scholar). While both slow and fast heart rate species presumably possess an active phosphate carrier in their cardiac muscle mitochondria, fast heart rate species may also employ some additional means of trans-membrane proton equilibration. Thus, there appears to be something fundamentally different between these two classes of species with respect to the mechanisms they employ both for equilibrating protons and for maintaining proton gradients across the inner membrane. In a similar vein, Jones and co-workers (25Andersson B.S. Aw T.Y. Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C349-C355Google Scholar, 26Aw T.Y. Andersson B.S. Jones D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C356-C361Google Scholar) have suggested that, in anoxic rat hepatocytes, mechanisms exist to preserve the mitochondrial transmembrane proton distribution so that the pH gradient across the mitochondrial membrane is preserved under anaerobic conditions. Thus, species like the rat that lack a functional complement of IF1 in many of their tissues (6Rouslin W. Frank G.D. Broge C.W. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 117-125Google Scholar), appear to possess alternative mechanisms for mitochondrial inner membrane proton blockade that may be at least as effective as IF1 under nonenergizing conditions in situ. Why species employ one mechanism of proton blockade (or equilibration) as opposed to another in their cardiac muscle mitochondria remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2102928083,"We present evidence that the mitochondrial channel, VDAC, when reconstituted into a phospholipid membrane, can catalyze the insertion of other VDAC channels. This property called “auto-directed insertion” was first proposed by 45Zizi M. Thomas L. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 121-129Google Scholar to explain observations on asymmetric VDAC channels. We found that 2 M urea or guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) caused a burst of insertions of VDAC channels when added to the same side as VDAC addition. More strikingly, when added to the opposite side they caused a 10-60-fold sustained yet reversible increase in insertion rate. Protein stabilization by sarcosine eliminated the effect of urea and GdmCl on VDAC insertion. Control experiments showed that water flow, ionic strength, osmotic force, phospholipid type, and membrane potential were not involved. Therefore, although both urea and GdmCl affect the properties of phospholipid membranes, it is more likely that these agents act either by changing the structure of the pre-inserted channels, allowing them to be more effective catalysts for VDAC insertion, or by flowing through the channels and acting on nearby VDAC channels inducing them to insert. Either way, insertion must be occurring next to pre-inserted channels. Urea and GdmCl may mimic chaperones by partially unfolding VDAC and keeping it in an insertion-competent state. “Auto-directed insertion” may ensure both correct targeting and orientation of nascent proteins in vivo.

INTRODUCTIONThe insertion of intrinsic membrane proteins into biological membranes is generally believed to be catalyzed by insertion machinery. Yet some proteins, such as toxins, insert spontaneously (27Merrill A.R. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8529-8534Google Scholar; 44Zhan H. Choe S. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Eisenberg D. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11254-11263Google Scholar). Indeed, there is evidence for large protein domains easily crossing membranes. Here we report experiments on a channel located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, called VDAC (mitochondrial porin), that has been reported not only to insert spontaneously into membranes but once inserted it also seems to catalyze the insertion of other VDAC channels and determine the direction of this insertion. This process, termed auto-directed insertion, was proposed by Zizi and co-workers to explain the voltage-dependent behavior of VDAC channels rendered asymmetric by a site-directed mutation (45Zizi M. Thomas L. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 121-129Google Scholar). Although the evidence presented was quite compelling, no direct demonstration of increased rate of channel insertion was reported. Here we report direct evidence that a VDAC channel in a membrane catalyzes the insertion of other channels.A VDAC channel consists of one 30-kDa polypeptide and forms an aqueous pore approximately 3 nm in diameter (for review see 6Colombini M. Curr. Top. Membr. 1994; 42: 73-101Google Scholar). VDAC channels are highly conserved in mitochondria from all eukaryotic kingdoms. They exist in a high conductance, open, state at low membrane potentials (<20 mV) and enter closed states at elevated potentials using two separate gating processes. Thus channel insertion at low potentials exhibits a characteristic staircase appearance because channels rarely close. Treatments that increase or decrease the rate of insertion change the steepness of this staircase.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll experiments were conducted using the planar phospholipid bilayer method of 28Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Google Scholar as revised by 38Schein S.J. Colombini M. Finkelstein A.V. J. Membr. Biol. 1976; 30: 99-120Google Scholar and 5Colombini M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 465-475Google Scholar. Briefly, a Teflon chamber was divided into two compartments by a Saran partition with a 0.15-mm diameter hole. The partition was coated with 5% (w/v) petrolatum in petroleum ether solution and allowed to dry for 10-15 min. Aqueous solutions (1 M KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acidGdmClguanidinium chlorideDPyPCdiphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine. pH 5.8, or as indicated) were then layered in the bottom of each compartment of the Teflon chamber, and 20-30 μl of a 1% (w/v) asolectin or diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine, 0.2% cholesterol solution in hexane was layered on top. 5-10 min were needed for hexane evaporation, leaving a phospholipid monolayer on the surface of the water solution in each compartment. The two monolayers were raised to form a phospholipid bilayer across the hole in the partition. Once this membrane was formed, a 2-10-μl aliquot of Neurospora crassa VDAC dissolved in 15% dimethyl sulfoxide, 2.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0, solution was added to one side of the chamber (VDAC was purified as described previously, 10Freitag H. Benz R. Neupert W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 286-294Google Scholar, as modified by 3Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Google Scholar). VDAC inserted spontaneously and was studied under voltage-clamp conditions.The two compartments of the chamber were named cis and trans, respectively. The voltage in the trans side was maintained at virtual ground by the amplifier (Fig. 1). The desired voltage was applied to the cis side. Calomel electrodes were used to interface with the solution. In this paper the applied voltage for all data shown was −10 mV. The currents were converted to conductances for the convenience of the reader.The conductance increase was indeed an increase in the number of channels. The stepwise insertion of channels is visible in most records, but the reduction in size required to display the figure makes individual insertions more difficult to see (see Fig. 4 for blown-up regions). Added urea, up to 5 M, had no significant effects on the gating of these channels.Fig. 4Experiments on membranes made with the neutral lipid, DPyPC. For the top record the membrane was bathed in the standard solution (Fig. 2) supplemented with 2 M NaCl, for the rest the standard solution was used. All membranes were made with 1 part diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine, 0.2 parts cholesterol. VDAC was added to the trans compartment for the top two records. No VDAC was added for the bottom records. From top to bottom, membranes were perfused with the standard solution supplemented with either 2 M GdmCl, 5 M urea, 2 M GdmCl, or 5 M urea, respectively. The break in the bottom two panels was for 1 min each. In these experiments, GdmCl increased the insertion rate from 1.3 to 39 channels/min, whereas urea increased it from 2.5 to 89 channels/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Perfusions were performed in the cis compartment by displacing the solution present with a denser one without stirring. Usually 8 chamber volumes were used to ensure total replacement (probably overkill). A small Teflon tube linked to a separatory funnel delivered the new, denser solutions. A P-10 pipette tip was used to maintain the level of the aqueous solution by aspiration (Fig. 1). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated.RESULTSThe addition of triton-solubilized VDAC channels to the aqueous phase on one side of a planar phospholipid membrane results in the spontaneous insertion of some of these channels into the membrane. Typically, the addition of 2-10 μl of the VDAC-containing sample into the 4-5-ml aqueous phase results in channel insertion after a variable delay. The rate of insertion becomes reasonably constant for a while before slowing down and sometimes terminating. The maximal rate of insertion is roughly linear with the concentration of VDAC in the sample as long as the added triton is constant and in a reasonable range. If sufficient VDAC was added to the chamber to yield a slow rate of channel insertion, the further addition of 2 M urea or GdmCl resulted in a marked acceleration of the rate of insertion. When the side to which VDAC had been added (cis side) was perfused with either GdmCl or urea (Fig. 2), a burst of channel insertions was observed. This leveled off shortly and the conductance remained steady.Fig. 2Records of experiments in which VDAC was added to the side of the membrane that would be perfused. The membranes were bathed in 1 M KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MES, pH 5.8, the standard solution. A small aliquot of VDAC solution was added in cis side of the membrane made from soybean phospholipids. After channel insertion was proceeding at a steady rate, the membranes were perfused with about 40 ml of the above solution supplemented with either 2 M GdmCl, 2 M urea, nothing, 1 M sucrose, or 5 M urea. The arrowhead indicates the conductance increase caused by the addition of the 2 M guanidinium chloride. Sucrose caused a large drop in conductance by changing the single-channel conductance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The burst of insertions coincided with the time at which the perfusing solution reached the level of the channels that were already present in the membrane. This is indicated by the conductance changes immediately preceding the burst of insertions. In the case of GdmCl, the buffered 1 M KCl solution was replaced by one containing both 1 M KCl and 2 M GdmCl. In this solution (trans side unchanged), the conductance of the channels is 80% higher, based on single-channel observations (data not shown). The calculated increase in conductance due to the change in salt concentration is indicated by the horizontal arrow (Fig. 2). Note that the burst of insertions coincides with this conductance increase. This was the case for all experiments. In the case of urea perfusion of the cis compartment, the burst of insertions is preceded by a small dip because the single-channel conductance in the presence of urea is a bit smaller.The mechanical process of perfusion was not responsible for the burst of insertions because perfusion with fresh, buffered KCl solution caused no burst of insertions. Insertion merely ceased as expected from a wash-out of the VDAC channels in solution by the perfusion process. The generation of an osmotic gradient was also not responsible for the burst of insertions because supplementing the perfusion solution with 1 M sucrose was without effect (Fig. 2).If the concentration of urea in the perfusing solution was raised to 5 M, no burst of insertion was seen. Insertion ceased but the channels already in the membrane continued to conduct normally. Thus, high (perhaps denaturing) levels of urea inhibited the insertion of additional channels in the membrane.A pronounced and sustained stimulation of the insertion rate was achieved if urea or GdmCl were introduced into the chamber on the opposite side of the membrane to which VDAC had been added (Fig. 3). VDAC was added to the trans side, and the cis side was perfused with 2 M GdmCl solution. As before, the increase in insertion rate was immediately preceded by a GdmCl-induced conductance increase. However, the rate of VDAC insertion did not increase transiently but increased (by a factor of 10-60) at a fairly steady rate until the membrane broke. Perfusion of the opposite side did not wash out VDAC from the trans compartment and thus allowed insertion to proceed indefinitely at the new, accelerated rate. Similar results with urea required the use of a 5 M solution (Fig. 3). When a 2 M urea solution was used, the rate of insertion was increased but by a smaller amount (2-5 fold) as compared with that observed when GdmCl was used (data not shown).Fig. 3Records of experiments in which VDAC was added to the compartment that would not be perfused (trans compartment). The experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 2 except that the standard solution in the cis compartment was perfused with solution supplemented with either 2 M GdmCl, 5 M urea, or 2 M NaCl. The arrowhead in the top panel indicates the conductance increase caused by the addition of guanidinium ions. *2, the scale decreased by a factor of 2. *5, the scale decreased by a factor of 5. The decrease and increase in conductance shortly after the initiation of the perfusion in the middle and lower record, respectively, were due to changes in single-channel conductance. In these experiments, GdmCl increased the insertion rate from 5.3 to 111 channels/min, whereas urea increased it from 5 to 133 channels/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The ability of both urea and GdmCl to stimulate insertion from the opposite side of the membrane is best explained as acting through the channels already inserted into the membrane. However, these agents do change the properties of phospholipid membranes and thus could, in principle, facilitate VDAC insertion by altering the structure of the phospholipid portion of the membrane. This possibility was tested by using very different phospholipids for making the membrane and using substances that mimic the properties of either urea or GdmCl but without the ability to unfold proteins.The stimulation of insertion by both urea and GdmCl was observed in membranes made with diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPyPC) instead of the mixed soybean phospholipids present in asolectin (Fig. 4). DPyPC has very little net charge at neutral pH as opposed to the highly negatively charged asolectin. Thus, GdmCl is probably not acting by simply screening the charges on the membrane. Being a pure lipid, DPyPC is unlikely to contain any special ingredient that would catalyze channel insertion.The possibility that GdmCl is acting by increasing ionic strength was also eliminated by perfusing with the buffered KCl solutions supplemented with 2 M NaCl (VDAC trans and NaCl cis). The NaCl had no effect, but subsequent reperfusion with 2 M GdmCl resulted in the normal acceleration of channel insertion (data not shown).Because urea partitions significantly into the membrane, the possibility exists that it increases the volume of the membrane and thus stimulates the insertion of the channels. However, perfusion with solutions supplemented with 2-5 M glycerol (VDAC trans and glycerol cis) had no effect on the insertion rate (Fig. 5). The reperfusion of the compartment with 2 M GdmCl resulted in the expected acceleration of channel insertion. Because glycerol partitions as readily into a membrane as urea (30Orbach E. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1980; 75: 427-436Google Scholar), it should increase the volume of the membrane to the same extent. Thus it seems unlikely that the urea acts by dissolving into the membrane.Fig. 5Glycerol is ineffective in accelerating insertion. This figure illustrates one complete experiment beginning at the bottom and ending at the top. The membrane was bathed in standard solution, and the VDAC sample was added to the trans compartment. The high gain used for the bottom trace shows the clear insertion of two single channels. At *10, the scale was decreased by a factor of 10. The membrane was first perfused on the cis side with standard solution supplemented with 2 M glycerol. The insertion rate did not change. Then the membrane was perfused on the cis side again with standard solution supplemented with 2 M GdmCl, and this time the rate of insertion increased dramatically. The break in the record is 2 min. In this experiment, GdmCl increased the insertion rate from 1.1 to 44 channels/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In control experiments, both urea and GdmCl had no significant effect on membrane conductance at the concentrations used in these experiments (Fig. 4). The sign and magnitude of the applied potentials had no significant effect on the rate of insertion of VDAC channels (Table I).Table ISummary of experimental resultsPerfusing solutionsVDAC in cisVDAC in transBuffer−−1 M sucrose−−High salt (2 M NaCl + 1 MKCl)−−Glycerol (2-5 M)−2 M urea+++ (transient)+5 M urea−+++2 M GdmCl+++ (transient)+++4 M sarcosineCompletely stopped insertion2 M GdmCl + 4 M sarcosine−5 M urea + 2.5 M sarcosine−Voltage (−40 to −120 mV)−Voltage (+40 to +120 mV)− Open table in a new tab To further demonstrate that the accelerated insertion was due to the action of either GdmCl or urea on VDAC protein structure, sarcosine, an osmolyte existing in some organisms, which can stabilize protein structure, was introduced into the perfusing solutions. Perfusing the opposite side (cis) of the membrane (VDAC in trans) with a buffered 1 M KCl solution supplemented with 2 M GdmCl and 2 M sarcosine caused a delayed increase in VDAC insertion rate, indicating the opposite function of sarcosine to that of GdmCl on VDAC structure. If the concentration of sarcosine in the perfusing solution was raised to 4 M, no increase in VDAC insertion rate was seen. 4 M sarcosine might have completely offset the unfolding effect of 2 M GdmCl (Fig. 6). The same result could be seen when perfusing the membrane with the KCl solution supplemented with a mixture of 5 M urea and 2.5 M sarcosine, showing the similar effect of sarcosine on urea (Fig. 6). If the membrane was perfused with 1 M KCl solution supplemented with 4 M sarcosine alone, VDAC insertion was completely stopped (data not shown). All these were done on the opposite side of membrane as VDAC, indicating these agents are likely to be functioning on pre-inserted VDAC channels in the membrane.Fig. 6Sarcosine's effect on the rate of VDAC insertion. All membranes were made with 1 part diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine, 0.2 part cholesterol. For the top two records the membranes were bathed in the standard solution (Fig. 2) supplemented with 2 M NaCl. For the bottom record the standard solution was used. VDAC was added to the trans compartment. From top to bottom, membranes were perfused on the cis side with the standard solution supplemented with 2 M GdmCl plus 2 M sarcosine, 2 M GdmCl plus 4 M sarcosine, or 5 M urea plus 2.5 M sarcosine, respectively. The break in the middle panel was 1 min. The arrowheads indicate the change in conductance caused by perfusion, i.e., when the replacing solutions reached the phospholipid membranes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The opposite effects of the chaotropic agents and sarcosine on VDAC insertion could also be tested by adding VDAC directly to the solutions containing these agents. Planar phospholipid membranes were made with one side bathed in buffered salt solution, the other side bathed in these agents. When a large amount of VDAC protein was added directly to solutions supplemented with 2 M GdmCl or 2-5 M urea bathing the membrane, no insertion was detected. This indicates the importance of having pre-inserted channels in the membrane to act as catalysts. Subsequent addition of VDAC to the other side of the same membrane (salt solution) resulted in fast insertion at a high rate. When VDAC was stirred into KCl solutions supplemented with 2-4 M sarcosine bathing the membrane, no insertion occurred either, probably because the structure of the protein in these solutions was not flexible and thus not insertion-competent. Insertion did occur with subsequent addition of VDAC to the opposite side (salt solution) but at a much slower rate compared with the normal insertion process. Further, replacing the sarcosine solution with a solution containing 2 M GdmCl resulted in the expected accelerated insertion. Moreover, when VDAC was added into a solution supplemented with a mixture of 5 M urea and 1-2 M sarcosine, the normal insertion was observed. (The best results were obtained at 1.5 M sarcosine.) If the sarcosine concentration in the mixture was higher (2.5-4 M), again, no insertion could take place, probably because the effect of sarcosine was dominating (data not shown). These observations suggest that the change in the ability of VDAC to insert is due to the opposite effects of these agents on VDAC structure and those two opposite effects can be offset by an increase in one or the other reagent. All these results are summarized in Table I.If urea and GdmCl act by unfolding a domain or increasing the flexibility of VDAC in the membrane and thus allow VDAC to act as a better catalyst for protein insertion, the process must be cooperative. The acceleration of protein insertion varies with the urea concentration on the cis side in a highly nonlinear manner (Fig. 7). Although the variation in the amount of acceleration achieved limits the information that can be gleaned, the data can be fitted to a theoretical line if the urea concentration dependence is raised to the 17th power. While not putting too much credence in this number, its value not only indicates a high cooperativity as expected from many sites of urea interaction with the protein but also is quite small (compared with the expected number of H-bonds) indicating a small domain being affected.Fig. 7Dependence of VDAC insertion rate on the urea concentration. The ratio of the insertion rate after urea addition to that before urea addition is plotted as a function of the final urea concentration. The experimental conditions are the same as in Fig. 2. The results of 28 experiments are shown as arithmetic means with standard error bars. In order to work with data whose distribution approximates a gaussian, the data were log transformed, and the standard error was determined on the transformed data. The antilog of the standard error of the transformed data is the number that the mean of the original data should be multiplied or divided by to determine the limits of the standard error. This is what is shown in the figure by the error bars. The solid line is a theoretical line for the equation: Ratio = 1 + 0.0001*[urea]17.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, the actions of urea and GdmCl are immediately reversible. Perfusing away these reagents during the accelerated insertion of VDAC reduced the insertion to normal rates just as soon as the new solution reached the membrane. The rate could once again be accelerated by restoring the urea or GdmCl (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Urea produces a reversible increase in the VDAC insertion rate. Phospholipid (DPyPC) membranes were made with standard solutions on both sides. VDAC was added to the trans compartment, and the channels were inserted slowly into the membrane in a stepwise manner (2.3 channels/min). The cis compartment was perfused with the standard solution enriched with 5 M urea at the point indicated. The VDAC insertion rate increased to 38 channels/min. Displacement of the urea-containing solution in the cis compartment with a denser standard solution enriched with 1 M sucrose reduced the insertion rate to 3.0 channels/min. The final reintroduction of urea involved perfusion with a less dense solution of 5 M urea in standard solution, and thus the replacement may not have been complete. The insertion rate increased to 30 channels/min. The arrowheads indicate when the replacing solutions were applied. It took about 5-7 min to perfuse as about 8 times the chamber volume was used. At the asterisk the scale was decreased by a factor of 20.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONUrea and GdmCl are believed to act by hydrogen bonding with biological molecules more strongly than water. In this way they destabilize intramolecular hydrogen bonding and cause unfolding of proteins (21Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 491-505Google Scholar). By using relatively low concentrations in these experiments, an acceleration in VDAC insertion has been achieved without damaging these channel-forming proteins.The benign effect of these agents is demonstrated by the fact that VDAC can insert into the membranes bathed in these agents from the opposite side and form functional channels with normal voltage-dependent gating processes (data not shown). Thus the VDAC protein in the membrane is not denatured by these agents. In addition, the fact that the action of these agents is immediately reversible indicates that their effects are likely to be limited to small portions of the protein that can almost immediately refold to their previous conformation.Many control experiments were done to test the possibility that urea or GdmCl caused the accelerated insertion by changing the phospholipid bilayer membrane. Neither these agents nor sarcosine (data not shown) changed the membrane conductance, indicating no membrane disruption. Actually, it has been reported that the lamellar phase of phospholipids such as phosphotidylethanolamine is stabilized by urea and GdmCl and is prevented from undergoing a transition to the hexagonal II phase (43Yeagle P.L. Sen A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7518-7522Google Scholar). The hexagonal phase is more likely to be involved in such dynamic membrane processes as fusion, so the action of these agents on phospholipid membranes seems to be in the wrong direction. At room temperature, urea has no detectable perturbing effect on the permeability of phospholipid vesicles (1Anchordoguy T.J. Carpenter J.F. Cecchini C.A. Crowe J.H. Crowe L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 356-361Google Scholar). However, these agents do affect some properties of phospholipid membranes such as phase transition temperature. However, so does the nature of the phospholipids. By using two very different types phospholipids to make the membranes used in these experiments and finding essentially the same results, the likelihood that lipid effects are responsible for the accelerated insertion is diminished but not eliminated. The observations that no insertion could occur if VDAC was added directly into 2 M GdmCl or 2-5 M urea also indicate that the importance of having pre-inserted channels in the membrane to catalyze the insertion process.The ability of urea and GdmCl to accelerate insertion when added from the opposite side of the membrane makes it less likely that any disruption of hydrogen bonding at the head groups of the phospholipids on one side of the membrane will somehow affect insertion from the other side, although structural changes could, in principle, be transmitted to the other side of the membrane. In addition, properties such as charge and lipid solubility of urea and GdmCl are quite different, and mimicking these properties with NaCl or glycerol was without effect. It is clearly the chaotropic properties of these molecules that are acting on the insertion process as supported by the antagonistic effects of sarcosine.The effects of urea and GdmCl on VDAC can be offset by sarcosine, an osmolyte that is a protein stabilizer (42Yancey P.M. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Google Scholar; 36Santoro M.M. Liu Y. Khan S.M.A. Hou L. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5278-5283Google Scholar). Because urea and GdmCl are thought to change protein structure by weakening hydrogen bonds (21Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 491-505Google Scholar), sarcosine may do the reverse as it favors the preferential hydration of proteins (2Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biophys. J. 1985; 47: 411-414Google Scholar). Combinations of urea and methylamines (such as trimethylamine-N-oxide, betaine, and sarcosine) are used in some organisms to increase cytoplasmic osmotic pressure without altering the flexibility of cytoplasmic proteins (42Yancey P.M. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Google Scholar). The opposing effects of urea and methylamines were reported to balance when the ratio of the concentration of urea and methylamines is about 2:1. We found the same thing. A mixture of 5 M urea and 2.5 M sarcosine resulted in no change in the rate of VDAC i"

In this study we employed four different experimental approaches (co-immunoprecipitation with proPC2, facilitation of pro-PC2 maturation, acquisition of enzymatic activity, and thermal protection assays) to identify structural elements of 7B2 important for bioactivity. Inspection of the sequence of 7B2 indicated potential involvement of a polyproline helix-like (PPII) structure, with similarities to those present within SH3 domain ligands, in the interaction of 7B2 with proPC2. Site-directed point mutagenesis of this proline-rich region confirmed the involvement of this area. Replacement of prolines in positions critical to helix formation (Pro90, Pro91, Pro93, and Pro95) either severely impaired or totally abolished 7B2 bioactivity, as gauged by the four assays described. In addition, constructs longer than residues 1-121 were still functional, whereas those shorter than residues 1-109 were not. Computer-assisted analysis predicts the presence of an α-helix structure between residues 107 and 123. We conclude that both the proline-rich region and the α-helix contribute to 7B2 activity.

https://openalex.org/W1990657171,"Glutamatergic neurotransmission is associated with release of arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids of both neurons and astrocytes. Since free AA has been shown to enhance glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission, it can be postulated that glutamate release and AA formation constitute a positive feed-back mechanism for sustained excitatory neurotransmission.In the present study, we examined whether the glutamate-evoked release of AA could be modulated by peptides. Using mouse cortical neurons in primary cultures, we show that the release of AA evoked by glutamate is potentiated by vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). This effect is mediated through the activation of PACAP I receptors. However, several arguments show that this potentiating mechanism does not involve the cAMP/PKA pathway. 1) Increasing intracellular cAMP by either cholera toxin, forskolin, or 8-Br-cAMP treatments does not affect the glutamate-evoked release of AA; 2) potentiation of the glutamate response by PACAP is not prevented by the PKA inhibitor 8-Br-Rp-cAMPS. Also, an involvement of the phospholipase C protein kinase C pathways is unlikely since inhibitors of both phospholipase C (i.e. U-73122) and protein kinase C (i.e. Ro 31-8220) do not affect the potentiation of the glutamate response by PACAP.

Nonconservative replacements are not permitted at position 33, indicating that Trp-33 may play an important structural role. Strikingly, the relatively conservative substitution of Trp-33 by phenylalanine results in major reductions in binding affinity for both the cardiac and neuronal channel isoforms as measured by ion flux, whereas substitution with tyrosine is tolerated and exhibits near wild-type affinities, suggesting that either the ability to form a hydrogen bond or the amphiphilic nature of the side chain are important at this position. Electrophysiological analysis of W33F indicates that its diminished affinity is primarily due to a decreased association rate. Analysis of a panel of mutants at Trp-45 shows only modest changes in apparent binding affinity for both channel isoforms but significant effects on Vmax. In neuronal channels, the maximal levels of uptake for W45A/S/F are about 50% those seen with ApB. This effect is also observed for W45A and W45S in the cardiac model, wherein W45F is normal.

https://openalex.org/W2046228466,"The transmembrane glycoprotein HEF and its acylation deficient mutant M1 were expressed in Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus and in CV1 mammalian cells using the vaccinia T7 system. In insect cells (Sf9), both wild type HEF and HEF(M1) are synthesized in their precursor form HEF0, which appears as a double band in SDS gels. Digestion with glycopeptidase F and endoglycosidase H reveals that the larger 84-kDa form is modified by the attachment of unprocessed carbohydrates of the high mannose type whereas the smaller 76-kDa form is non-glycosylated. As revealed by in vitro labeling experiments with palmitic acid another modification of HEF is the attachment of a long chain fatty acid to cysteine residue Cys-652 which is located at the internal border of the cytoplasmic membrane. After labeling with [3H]palmitic acid in both systems only HEF(WT) is acylated, whereas HEF(M1) is not. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the fatty acids bound to HEF(WT) expressed in Sf9 insect cells reveals nearly 80% of palmitic acid. In contrast to this finding, the acylation pattern of HEF expressed in CV1 cells shows nearly the same amounts of stearic and palmitic acid (40%). Since the interconversion of the input [3H]palmitic acid to stearic acid is even lower in CV1 cells than in insect cells, it follows that only HEF expressed in mammalian, but not in insect cells selects for stearic acid during its biosynthetic acylation. We extended our study to acylation of endogenous proteins in Sf9 cells. In finding only palmitate linked to protein we present evidence that, in contrast to mammalian cells, insect cells (Sf9) cannot transfer stearic acid to polypeptide. This finding favors the hypothesis of enzymatic acylation over non-enzymatic mechanisms of acyl transfer to protein. The transmembrane glycoprotein HEF and its acylation deficient mutant M1 were expressed in Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus and in CV1 mammalian cells using the vaccinia T7 system. In insect cells (Sf9), both wild type HEF and HEF(M1) are synthesized in their precursor form HEF0, which appears as a double band in SDS gels. Digestion with glycopeptidase F and endoglycosidase H reveals that the larger 84-kDa form is modified by the attachment of unprocessed carbohydrates of the high mannose type whereas the smaller 76-kDa form is non-glycosylated. As revealed by in vitro labeling experiments with palmitic acid another modification of HEF is the attachment of a long chain fatty acid to cysteine residue Cys-652 which is located at the internal border of the cytoplasmic membrane. After labeling with [3H]palmitic acid in both systems only HEF(WT) is acylated, whereas HEF(M1) is not. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the fatty acids bound to HEF(WT) expressed in Sf9 insect cells reveals nearly 80% of palmitic acid. In contrast to this finding, the acylation pattern of HEF expressed in CV1 cells shows nearly the same amounts of stearic and palmitic acid (40%). Since the interconversion of the input [3H]palmitic acid to stearic acid is even lower in CV1 cells than in insect cells, it follows that only HEF expressed in mammalian, but not in insect cells selects for stearic acid during its biosynthetic acylation. We extended our study to acylation of endogenous proteins in Sf9 cells. In finding only palmitate linked to protein we present evidence that, in contrast to mammalian cells, insect cells (Sf9) cannot transfer stearic acid to polypeptide. This finding favors the hypothesis of enzymatic acylation over non-enzymatic mechanisms of acyl transfer to protein. HEF transmembrane glycoprotein is coded for by influenza C virus, which is an enveloped virus. HEF mediates the receptor-binding (hemagglutinin) and receptor-destroying activities (esterase) as well as the fusion activity of influenza C virus (1Herrler G. Dürkop I. Becht H. Klenk H.-D. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 839-846Google Scholar). It appears on the surface of influenza virus-infected cells and is a typical type I transmembrane protein. HEF is synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes as an inactive precursor polypeptide (HEF0) and is biosynthetically assembled to trimers (2Hewat E.A. Cusack S. Verwey C. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 175-193Google Scholar, 3Formanowski F. Meier-Ewert H. Virus Res. 1988; 10: 177-192Google Scholar). In addition HEF is subject to processing and terminal glycosylation of N-linked carbohydrates (4Nagele A. Ph.D. thesis. Technical University, Munich1983Google Scholar). Another posttranslational modification occurring only in certain cell types is the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor HEF0 by a cellular protease, which is required for the viral fusion activity (5Ohuchi M. Ohuchi R. Mifune K. J. Virol. 1982; 42: 1076-1079Google Scholar, 6Kitame F. Sugawara K. Ohwada K. Homma M. Arch. Virol. 1982; 73: 357-361Google Scholar). The cleavage products HEF1 and HEF2 are held together by disulfide bonds (7Herrler G. Compans R.W. Meier-Ewert H. Virology. 1979; 99: 49-56Google Scholar). The mobility of HEF0 analyzed with SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRIPA bufferradioimmune precipitation buffer. under reducing conditions suggests a molecular mass of about 85 kDa, which is in accordance with the size range expected from the published sequence data (8Nakada S. Creager R.S. Krystal M. Aaronson R.P. Palese P. J. Virol. 1983; 50: 118-124Google Scholar, 9Pfeifer J.B. Compans R.W. Virus Res. 1984; 1: 281-296Google Scholar). Recently Veit et al. (10Veit M. Herrler G. Schmidt M.F.G. Rott R. Klenk H.-D. Virology. 1990; 177: 807-811Google Scholar) detected a further posttranslational modification of HEF, the attachment of fatty acids via a thioester-type linkage. In contrast to the majority of acylated proteins, which are mainly modified with palmitic acid, the predominant fatty acid bound to HEF in influenza C-infected MDBK cells was found to be stearic acid (10Veit M. Herrler G. Schmidt M.F.G. Rott R. Klenk H.-D. Virology. 1990; 177: 807-811Google Scholar). The reason for this preference of stearic acid could be related to specific structural features of HEF and/or depend on the cell type under study. While substantial evidence points to a crucial role of the length of the C-tail in acyl selection (11Veit M. Reverey H. Schmidt M.F.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 163-172Google Scholar), nothing is known about the potential contribution of cellular factors in this process. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis radioimmune precipitation buffer. In this report, we therefore compare the biosynthesis of HEF after expression of the cloned gene in insect (Sf9) and mammalian (CV1) cells using baculovirus or vaccinia virus, respectively. In particular, we show here that HEF expressed in insect cells selects for palmitic acid during acylation, whereas mammalian cells prefer stearic acid to acylate HEF. Since we identify the same cysteine residue (position 652) of HEF as acylation site in both cell types, different cellular factors must be involved in HEF acylation in mammalian and insect cells, which contribute to the selection of fatty acid species in this process. These surprising results prompted us to study acylation in insect cells more closely. The outcomes obtained indicate that Sf9 insect cells lack the machinery to stearoylate proteins in general. Implications for the current issue of enzymatic versus chemical acylation will be discussed. To construct a HEF mutant (M1) where the putative acylation site cysteine 652 is replaced by a serine residue cDNA coding for HEF wild type (WT) (9Pfeifer J.B. Compans R.W. Virus Res. 1984; 1: 281-296Google Scholar) was cloned into the replicative form DNA of m13 bacteriophage using standard techniques (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a commercial kit (oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system; Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany) based on the phosphorothioate method (13Taylor J.W. Ott J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8765-8785Google Scholar). cDNA coding for HEF(WT) and mutated HEF(M1) were cloned into the SmaI site of baculovirus expression vector pVl1393. The plasmids and linearized AcMNPV DNA (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) were transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9) by Insectin (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's procedure. Recombinant viruses AcMNPV-HEFwt and AcMNPV-HEFm1 containing HEF(WT) or HEF(M1), respectively, were plaque-purified and amplified (14King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, London1992Google Scholar). Positive viral clones were monitored for HEF expression by [35S]methionine labeling of infected cells and immunoprecipitation with polyclonal influenza C virus antiserum, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Sf9 cells were grown in TC-100 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. For metabolic labeling Sf9 insect cells (1 × 106) in 35-mm diameter culture dishes were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 virus particles/cell. Metabolic labeling was performed 2 days after infection. cDNA coding for HEF(WT) and mutated HEF(M1) were cloned into the SmaI site of pTM1 plasmid (15Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Google Scholar) behind the promotor of bacteriophage T7 polymerase. CV1 mammalian cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Berlin, Germany) containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Grown to 80% confluence in 35-mm diameter culture dishes, CV1 cells were infected with vTF7-3 vaccinia virus (16Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units per cell. At 2 h postinfection the virus inoculum was replaced by a transfection mix containing 3 μg of pTM1-HEF(WT) or pTM1-HEF(M1) DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Metabolic labeling was performed 4 h after transfection. Cells were labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml in medium without methionine; 1200 Ci/mmol, Expre35S35S protein labeling mix, DuPont, Bad Homburg, Germany) or with [3H]palmitic acid (1 mCi/ml medium; 33 Ci/mmol, DuPont) for the time periods as indicated in the figure legends. Processing of the cells after labeling period was as follows. Cells were scraped from the culture dishes in culture medium, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, pelleted (3 min, 3000 × g), washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM KH2PO4, 6 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and lysed in 600 μl of RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM iodoacetamide). Cells were freeze-thawed three times, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 20000 × g). CV1 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently lysed in 600 μl of RIPA buffer. Cell lysate was tranferred to Eppendorf tubes, and insoluble material was removed as described above. Polyclonal serum against influenza C virus was added at a dilution of 1:100 to the cell lysates, and samples were agitated overnight at 4°C. After an additional incubation with 30 μl of Protein-A-Sepharose Cl-4B (1:1 in RIPA buffer; Sigma) for 2 h, antigen-antibody complexes were washed three times with RIPA buffer. Antigen was solubilized by incubation in gel-loading buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% mercaptoethanol for 2 min at 95°C and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), followed by fluorography for 2 days (35S) or 7 days (3H) using salicylate (18Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitic acid-labeled HEF was purified by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. After localizing HEF bands by fluorography, the respective regions were excised from the dried gel and scintillator was removed by washing with water. Subsequently, gel pieces were dried in a desiccator and fatty acids were cleaved by treatment with 6 N HCl for 16 h at 110°C in tightly closed glass tubes. Fatty acids were extracted from the hydrosylate three times with hexane and the upper phases combined. After metabolic labeling, cells were extracted three times with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (v/v 2:1) and twice with 1 ml of methanol. Total delipidated cellular protein was pelleted (15 min, 20,000 × g) and hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl for 16 h at 110°C. Fatty acids were extracted from the hydrolysate three times with hexane and the upper phases combined. After metabolic labeling, cells were extracted three times with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (v/v 2:1). The organic extracts were separated from cellular protein (15 min, 20,000 × g), tranferred into a glass tube, dried under nitrogen, and hydrolyzed in 600 μl of 6 N HCl for 16 h at 110°C. Fatty acids were extracted from the hydrosylate three times with hexane and the upper phases combined. Combined hexane extracts from the above described procedures were dried under nitrogen and redissolved in 50 μl of methanol containing 100 μg of unlabeled myristic, palmitic, and stearic acid. Samples were separated by HPLC using a Nova-Pak C18 column (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) and 90% acetonitrile as a solvent at a flow rate of 0.5 or 0.8 ml/min (see figure legends). Unlabeled fatty acids were monitored by an absorbance detector (Waters) set at 214 nm. Fractions were collected and analyzed by scintillation counting. A full-length HEF-gene wild type (WT) and a HEF mutant, designated HEF(M1), coding for a serine instead of the putative acylation site cysteine (Cys-652) were cloned into the baculovirus expression plasmid pVl1393 behind the strong promotor of the polyhedrin gene. As described under “Materials and Methods,” Sf9 insect cells were infected with high titer, recombinant baculovirus stock and expression of HEF was monitored by radiolabeling, immunoprecipitation and PAGE analysis of immunoprecipitates. Fig. 1 shows that two populations of HEF can be resolved under reducing conditions with an estimated size of about 76 and 84 kDa, corresponding to the size of HEF calculated from sequence data (8Nakada S. Creager R.S. Krystal M. Aaronson R.P. Palese P. J. Virol. 1983; 50: 118-124Google Scholar, 9Pfeifer J.B. Compans R.W. Virus Res. 1984; 1: 281-296Google Scholar). Therefore it can be concluded that, in insect cells, biosynthesis of recombinant HEF0 occurs without proteolytic cleavage to HEF1 and HEF2, which have molecular masses of 65 and 30 kDa, respectively (7Herrler G. Compans R.W. Meier-Ewert H. Virology. 1979; 99: 49-56Google Scholar). Utilizing glycopeptidase F and endopeptidase H, we reveal in Fig. 2A that the 76-kDa population of recombinant HEF in insect cells must represent a non glycosylated form, because its molecular mass does not shift after digestion with these endoglycosidases. All the carbohydrates present in the 84-kDa form of the same protein must be in the high mannose form, since no material remains in the 84-kDa region of the gel after endopeptidase H treatment (Fig. 2A, two lanes on right). This is in accordance with former results on the “glycosylation machinery” of insect cells, which apparently lack the enzymes for terminal processing of N-linked carbohydrates (19Kuroda K. Geyer H. Geyer R. Doerfler W. Klenk H.-D. Virology. 1990; 174: 418-429Google Scholar, 20Davidson D.J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6167-6174Google Scholar, 21Ponimaskin E. Veit M. Schmidt M.F.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1163-1167Google Scholar). The same results as shown in Fig. 2A are obtained when HEF(M1) is expressed in this system instead of wild type HEF (data not shown).Fig. 2A, glycosylation of HEF protein expressed in Sf9 insect cells. HEF(WT) protein expressed in insect cells, labeled with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal influenza C virus antiserum was digested with endopeptidase H (lane 2), glycopeptidase F (lane 3), or left untreated (lane 1).

Sf9 insect cells were infected with AcMNPV-HEFwt (lane 1) or AcMNPV-HEFm1 (lane 2) and 2 days postinfection labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. HEF was immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next we asked whether acylation of HEF occurs in insect cells. This is indeed the case because wild type HEF can be strongly labeled with [3H]palmitic acid (Fig. 2B) in a hydroxylamine-sensitive manner (results not shown). It is noteworthy that only the upper 84-kDa band shows fatty acid label (Fig. 2B) indicating either that the non-glycosylated population of HEF may not reach the intracellular site of palmitoylation or that it develops a conformation unsuitable for fatty acid transfer. If the mutation at the putative acylation site in position 652 (Cys-652 → Ser) abolishes the acylation observed in HEF(WT), it can be surmised that this site is critical for fatty acid transfer, or serves for attachment of fatty acid. Fig. 2B (lane 2) reveals that this is indeed the case, since no radioactivity at all becomes visible in the respective region even during extended fluorography after PAGE of [3H]palmitic acid-labeled HEF(M1). Thus, insect cells show the same requirement of Cys-652 for S-acylation of HEF as mammalian cells (11Veit M. Reverey H. Schmidt M.F.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 163-172Google Scholar). Since almost all of the above described features of biosynthesis parallel those observed during expression of HEF in mammalian cells (22Szepanski S. Veit M. Pleschka S. Klenk H.-D. Schmidt M.F.G. Herrler G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1023-1030Google Scholar), it remained to be tested whether the unusual selectivity of HEF for stearic acid (15Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Google Scholar) would be retained during its biosynthesis in insect cells. In order to achieve this, we had to compare the 3H-fatty acid species present in HEF isolated from the protein after expression in the presence of [3H]palmitate with the pattern of lipid-bound fatty acids from the same cells. Using fatty acid analysis by HPLC of the acyl chains bound to HEF(WT) expressed in insect cells, one main peak was revealed after scintillation counting of individual fractions (Fig. 3A). Comparison with the retention time of the unlabeled fatty acid standards showed that this peak represents [3H]palmitic acid. Only very low amounts of stearic and myristic acid were detectable in HEF, although analysis of lipid-bound fatty acids reveals that considerable amounts of [3H]stearic and [3H]myristic acid are present after the 4-h labeling period with [3H]palmitic acid utilized in this experiment (Fig. 3). This selection for palmitic acid from the total acyl pool during HEF acylation in insect cells clearly differs from the reported stearoylation of HEF in MDBK cells infected with influenza C virus (15Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Google Scholar). This unusual acyl selection may be insect cell-specific, but can also be the result of the sole expression of HEF protein without any other viral proteins present during expression. If other viral proteins are necessary for binding of stearic acid to HEF, HEF expressed in mammalian CV1 cells should also lose its specificity for stearic acid binding. We addressed this question by using the vaccinia T7 expression system (Fig. 4A). Fatty acid analysis after a 4-h labeling period with [3H]palmitic acid revealed that nearly half of the recombinant HEF protein expressed in CV1 cells is acylated with stearic acid (Fig. 4B, left panel), although [3H]palmitate conversion into stearic acid in CV1 cells was even lower than in insect cells (compare Figs. 3A and 4B, right panel). This indicates a strong preference of HEF for C18:0 chains from the different acyl substrates present in the mammalian cells. Therefore the nearly exclusive attachment of palmitate to HEF expressed in insect cells is a peculiarity of these cells and not due to the lack of other viral proteins. This surprising result led us to ask whether acylation in mammalian cells and Sf9 cells may differ in its substrate utilization. In order to ensure steady state conditions for acylation of general polypeptides in insect cells during [3H]palmitate labeling, we studied long term kinetics of acyl incorporation into total cellular lipid and protein. The results from these experiments presented below indicate that the selection for palmitic acid is not restricted to the HEF protein, but seems to be a general feature of Sf9 insect cells. Analysis of all the protein-bound fatty acids in Sf9 cells after increasing labeling periods up to 24 h with [3H]palmitic acid showed beside palmitate only traces of stearate covalently linked to total polypeptides (Fig. 5), which is in contrast to mammalian cells where up to 40% of stearic acid were detectable in proteins (23Towler D. Glaser L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 878-884Google Scholar, 24McIlhinney R.A.J. Chadwick J.K. Pelly S.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 109-115Google Scholar), similar to our results with HEF (Fig. 4B, left panel). Fatty acid species in lipids did only marginally change from the pattern shown after 4 h (Fig. 3A, right panel) over the whole labeling. We therefore suggest that cellular factors are involved in the differential acylation of viral and cellular acylproteins in insect and mammalian cells. This may be the acyltransferases themselves, which could have evolved to higher complexity in mammalian cells to attach specific fatty acids to individual proteins. This would be also reminiscent of N-linked glycosylation in insect cells, which lacks the complexity described for mammalian cells (19Kuroda K. Geyer H. Geyer R. Doerfler W. Klenk H.-D. Virology. 1990; 174: 418-429Google Scholar, 20Davidson D.J. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6167-6174Google Scholar, 21Ponimaskin E. Veit M. Schmidt M.F.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1163-1167Google Scholar). Our results have implications for the current issue of chemical versus enzymatic acylation. Chemical acylation can be achieved in vitro by adding activated fatty acids (e.g. acyl-CoA) to purified donor proteins or peptides (25Quesnel S. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 3307: 13340-13348Google Scholar). 2C. Bañó and A.I. Magee, personal communication. Obviously, acylation without an enzyme should show no preference for a particular fatty acid, but reflect the availability of the individual carbon chains present in the cellular lipid pool. Such non-enzymatic acylation is very unlikely in vivo, since (i) significant differences occur apparently in the acylation pattern of HEF and other proteins in insect and mammalian cells, although the complete spectrum of acyl-CoA lipid substrates (e.g. stearoyl-CoA) is present in both cell types (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) and (ii) the concentration of free acyl-CoA is very low in vivo (more that 95% of it is bound to a acyl-CoA-binding protein) (26Rasmussen J.T. Börchers T. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 849-855Google Scholar, 27Rosendal J. Etbjerg P. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 321-326Google Scholar). The possible involvement of acyl-CoA-binding proteins in S-acylation and/or acyl chain selectivity is an interesting subject for future studies. We are grateful to C. Palissa for expert technical assistance."

Hydrogenases catalyze the heterolytic cleavage of molecular hydrogen into a hydride and a proton (1Krasna A.L. Rittenberg D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 3015-3020Google Scholar, 2Rittenberg D. Krasna A.I. Disscuss. Faraday Soc. 1955; 20: 185-189Google Scholar), and the oxidation of the hydride to a proton and two electrons. The protons are released, and the electrons are transferred to an electron acceptor. Hydrogenases also catalyze the reverse reaction. All hydrogenases, which can activate hydrogen in the absence of added cofactors, contain transition metals as essential components. On the basis of their amino acid sequences and metal contents, hydrogenases can be divided into two classes. One class consists of enzymes containing only iron. These enzymes are called Fe-hydrogenases or Fe-only hydrogenases (3Adams M.W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 115-145Google Scholar). The Fe-hydrogenases contain at least two classical (4Fe-4S) clusters (4Voordouw G. Brenner S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 515-520Google Scholar, 5Meyer J. Gagnon J. Biochem. 1991; 30: 9697-9704Google Scholar), in addition to a special cluster involving 4-7 Fe atoms (6Pierik A.J. Wolbert R.B.G. Mutsaers P.H.A. Hagen W.R. Veeger C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 697-704Google Scholar), originally proposed to be a novel 6Fe cluster forming the hydrogen-activating site (H-cluster) (7Hagen W.R. van Berkel-Arts A. Krüse-Wolters K.M.

The second class comprises hydrogenases containing nickel in addition to iron. These enzymes are called Ni-hydrogenases (also Ni-Fe or [NiFe] hydrogenases). The nickel ion is essential for activity (9Friedrich B. Heine E. Finck A. Friedrich C.G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1144-1149Google Scholar, 10Graf E.-G. Thauer R.K.

They were earlier considered to be a subclass of the Ni-hydrogenases. Comparison of the amino acid sequences (18Voordouw G. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 397-422Google Scholar), however, shows that the basic unit of all known Ni-hydrogenases is the same (14Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 167-204Google Scholar) and the only difference in the Se-containing enzymes is a replacement of a conservative Cys residue by a Sec 1The abbreviations used are: SecselenocysteinemTmillitesla. residue (17Sorgenfrei O. Linder D. Karas M. Klein A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1355-1358Google Scholar). selenocysteine millitesla. Depending on the redox potential, the nickel ion can have an unpaired electron. Consequently, nickel hydrogenases have been intensively studied by EPR spectroscopy. Most hydrogenases, when aerobically purified, show two distinct EPR signals due to Ni(III), often within the same preparation. The major difference in the EPR signals is the position of the gy line of the rhombic signal: it can be either at g = 2.24 or at g = 2.16 (the gx lines around 2.3 and the gz lines around 2.0 differ only slightly). Fernandez et al. (19Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 832: 69-79Google Scholar) discovered that enzyme preparations showing a Ni(III) signal with a gy value of 2.16 were activated by hydrogen within a few minutes, but that several hours were required to activate enzyme molecules with Ni(III) showing a gy line at 2.24. The states were termed termed “ready” and “unready,” respectively. Complete reduction resulted in an active enzyme. In this paper, nickel in ready and unready enzyme will be referred to as Nir and Niu, respectively. In the literature these states have been called Ni-a and Ni-b (20Albracht S.P.J. Kalkman M.L. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 724: 309-316Google Scholar) or Ni-B and Ni-A (21Teixeira M. Moura I. Xavier A.V. Huynh B.H. DerVartanian D.V. Peck Jr., H.D. LeGall J. Moura J.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8942-8950Google Scholar), respectively. Nickel in active enzyme is called Nia. It must be remembered that both the ready and unready enzymes are still inactive and need a reductive activation. During reductive redox titrations, the S = 1/2 EPR signals of Ni(III) disappear and EPR-silent intermediates are obtained (22Teixeira M. Moura I. Xavier A.V. DerVartanian D.V. LeGall J. Peck Jr., H.D. Huynh B.H. Moura J.J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 481-484Google Scholar), in which the nickel ion is considered to be in the divalent, diamagnetic state (14Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 167-204Google Scholar). At temperatures below 10°C the enzyme remains inactive (23Coremans J.M.C.C. Redox Properties of Hydrogenase. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands1991Google Scholar). Only after a reductive treatment at elevated temperatures can the enzyme become active, and only then is it possible to further reduce the divalent nickel ion. This leads to another S = 1/2 EPR signal with g values of 2.19, 2.14, and 2.02 (13Kojima N. Fox J.A. Hausinger R.P. Daniels L. Orme-Johnson W.H. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 378-382Google Scholar, 19Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 832: 69-79Google Scholar, 21Teixeira M. Moura I. Xavier A.V. Huynh B.H. DerVartanian D.V. Peck Jr., H.D. LeGall J. Moura J.J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8942-8950Google Scholar, 22Teixeira M. Moura I. Xavier A.V. DerVartanian D.V. LeGall J. Peck Jr., H.D. Huynh B.H. Moura J.J.G. Eur. J.

Fontijn R.D. Slater E.C. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 271-277Google Scholar). As this signal was the third EPR signal from nickel in hydrogenases, it is often called Ni-C. It corresponds to an active state of the enzyme. In the Se-containing enzyme from Desulfovibrio baculatus, this state has slightly different g values (2.23, 2.17, and 2.01) (26He S.H. Teixeira M. LeGall J. Patil D.S. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. DerVartanian D.V. Huynh B.H. Peck Jr., H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2678-2682Google Scholar). This signal is maximal in enzyme under 1% H2 (27Coremans J.M.C.C. van Garderen C.J. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 148-156Google Scholar) and then represents about 55% (pH 8-9) to 90% (pH 6) of the nickel concentration. Complete reduction under 200 kPa of H2 leads to a loss of this EPR signal. Van der Zwaan et al. (25van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Fontijn R.D. Slater E.C. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 271-277Google Scholar) discovered that the species responsible for this signal in the Chromatium vinosum enzyme is light-sensitive at temperatures below 77 K and proposed that this photodissociation involves the breakage of a bond between monovalent nickel and some form of hydrogen. The corresponding state of nickel will be denoted here as Nia(I)·H2 (or Ni-C). Illumination of this state with white light resulted in an EPR spectrum with the lowest g value at 2.05. When performed in D2O, the rate of photodissociation was nearly 6 times slower and the EPR lines before illumination were slightly sharper (maximally 0.5 mT) than in H2O. After photodissociation the EPR lines were equally sharp in H2O and D2O. In this report the photoproduct of the Nia(I)·H2 state will be referred to as Nia(I)[H2]. It has been reported that treatment of Ni-hydrogenases in the most reduced state (under 200 kPa of H2, here called the Nia(0) state) with the competitive inhibitor CO leads to yet another EPR signal (28van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Fontijn R.D. Roelofs Y.B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 872: 208-215Google Scholar, 29Cammack R. Patil D.S. Hatchikian E.C. Fernandez V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 98-109Google Scholar). The CO-induced species Nia(I)·CO was also light-sensitive (28van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Fontijn R.D. Roelofs Y.B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 872: 208-215Google Scholar). Illumination resulted in an EPR signal virtually identical to that obtained after illumination of the Nia(I)·H2 state. Hence it was ascribed to a Nia(I)[CO] state. Indeed, when prepared with 13CO, a nearly isotropic 2-fold splitting of the EPR signal was obtained due to the I = 1/2 spin of the 13C nucleus (30van der Zwaan J.W. Coremans J.M.C.C. Bouwens E.C.M. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 101-110Google Scholar). No effect of 13C on the spectrum was observed after illumination. Likewise, no effects of replacement of H2O by D2O, neither on the line widths nor on the rate of photodissociation, could be observed in this case. The authors concluded that hydrogen and CO can apparently bind to nickel at the same position, resulting in different EPR spectra in the dark, but identical spectra after photodissociation. As the EPR of the Nia(I)·13CO species clearly showed an interaction between the unpaired spin of the nickel and the 13CO nucleus (30van der Zwaan J.W. Coremans J.M.C.C. Bouwens E.C.M. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 101-110Google Scholar), the question arose as to why bound hydrogen only gave a slight line broadening, although the proton is a much stronger magnet than 13C. More recently, we have reported (31Sorgenfrei O. Klein A. Albracht S.P.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 291-297Google Scholar) that the anaerobically purified selenium-containing F420-nonreducing hydrogenase from M. voltae also displays a light-sensitive EPR signal with all the characteristics of the Nia(I)·H2 state (unpaired electron in an orbital with a predominantly dz2 character). With 77Se-enriched enzyme, an anisotropic splitting due to the I = 1/2 nuclear magnetic moment of the isotope was observed, which was 5.3 mT in the z direction, but much smaller (about 0.96 and 1.49 mT) in the x and y directions. After photodissociation of bound hydrogen, the resulting EPR signal (lowest g value at 2.05, so unpaired electron no longer in a dz2 orbital) showed a nearly isotropic splitting due to 77Se. A reasonable way to explain these data was to assume a 90° flip of the electronic z-axis upon photodissociation. No effects on the line widths could be observed when experiments were performed in D2O. This means that in the Nia(I)·H2 state the unpaired spin in a dz2 orbital is pointing to Se, but not to hydrogen. Consequently, it was concluded that hydrogen could be bound perpendicular to the Ni-Se axis. Since it is assumed that CO and hydrogen bind to the same site (30van der Zwaan J.W. Coremans J.M.C.C. Bouwens E.C.M. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 101-110Google Scholar), such a proposal can be checked by studying the Nia(I)·13CO state in the Se-enzyme. In this contribution we describe the EPR properties of CO-treated selenium-containing F420-nonreducing hydrogenase from M. voltae. We have used normal or 77Se-enriched enzyme treated with normal CO or 13CO to further investigate the interactions of the unpaired electron of the nickel center. In addition, we have investigated whether there is a pH effect on the anisotropy of the splitting caused by 77Se in the Nia(I)·H2 species. The results are discussed in light of the recent finding that the active site of [NiFe] hydrogenases is a bimetallic complex containing iron and nickel (32Surerus K.K. Chen M. Van der Zwaan J.W. Rusnak F.M. Kolk M. Duin E.C. Albracht S.P.J. Münck E. Biochem. 1994; 33: 4980-4993Google Scholar, 33Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Google Scholar). M. voltae PS (DSM 1537) was grown at 37°C in 10-liter batch cultures with a H2/CO2 (80:20) gas phase. A small amount of H2S was added to the gas phase. Cells were harvested anaerobically during late exponential growth, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. A medium according to Whitman et al. (34Whitman W.B. Ankwanda E. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 852-863Google Scholar) was used with the following modifications. Cysteine and sodium sulfide were omitted. H2S was used as a reductant and the sulfur source. Selenite, either the natural isotope mixture or 77Se-derived, was added to a final concentration of 1 μM. 77Se (92.4 atom %) was obtained from Promochem (Wesel, Germany). For oxidation to selenite, the elementary selenium was dissolved in concentrated nitric acid to give a 1 M solution. This solution was used to obtain 1 μM final concentration of selenite in the medium. The selenium concentration in the medium without selenite addition was lower than 3 nM as determined by hydride atomic absorption spectroscopy (Biodata, Linden, Germany). On this basis the 77Se enrichment was calculated to be 92%. 13CO (99 atom %) was obtained from ICN (Eschwege, Germany). To ensure that the CO used was free of traces of oxygen, 0.1 ml of an anaerobic solution of glucose (200 mM in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) and glucose oxidase per milliliter gas volume was added to the gas vessel. Hydrogenase was purified as previously reported (17Sorgenfrei O. Linder D. Karas M. Klein A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1355-1358Google Scholar). Enzyme solutions were concentrated by ultrafiltration through Centricon 30 microconcentrators (Amicon, Witten-Herdecke). This concentrated hydrogenase solution was anaerobically transferred into an EPR tube. The gas atmosphere in the EPR tube was replaced by 100% hydrogen by repeated evacuation and subsequent flushing with hydrogen. Afterward, the sample was incubated for 30 min at 0°C. The gas atmosphere was then adjusted to 10% CO/90% H2 by injection of the appropriate volume of CO into the EPR tube, and the tube was then kept at 0°C for 2.5 min. During this time good equilibrium with the gas phase was promoted by flicking the EPR tube. Subsequently the tube was quickly frozen. As with C. vinosum hydrogenase (28van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Fontijn R.D. Roelofs Y.B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 872: 208-215Google Scholar), only about one quarter of the enzyme molecules could be converted to the Nia(I)·CO state and the EPR signal disappeared if hydrogen was completely replaced by CO. EPR spectra at X band (9 GHz) were obtained with a Bruker ECS 106 EPR spectrometer at a field-modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Cooling of the sample was performed with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 cryostat with a ITC4 temperature controller. The magnetic field was calibrated with an AEG magnetic field meter. The X-band frequency was measured with a HP 5350B microwave frequency counter. Illumination of the samples was carried out in the helium cryostat by shining white light (Osram Halogen Bellaphot, 150 watts) via a light guide through the irradiation grid of the Bruker ER 4102 ST cavity. Dark adaption of illuminated samples was carried out by placing the samples for 10 min in cold (200 K) ethanol in the dark. For computer simulations, the program EPR (35Neese F. Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange. Program No. QCMP 136, Indiana, U. S. A1995Google Scholar) or programs of S. P. J. Albracht (36Beinert H. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 245-277Google Scholar) were used. Normalized double-integral values (i.e. the spin concentrations) of the simulated spectra were calculated and used to determine the weights necessary for the simulation of the various spectra. After reduction and treatment with CO, the hydrogenase from M. voltae yielded the EPR spectrum shown in Fig. 1, trace A. The most prominent EPR line at g = 2.11 is the gxy line of an apparently axial signal, which proved to be light-sensitive and was attributed to the Nia(I)·CO species. The gz line of this signal is expected to be around g = 2.02 (28van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Fontijn R.D. Roelofs Y.B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 872: 208-215Google Scholar, 29Cammack R. Patil D.S. Hatchikian E.C. Fernandez V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 98-109Google Scholar), but was hidden under additional lines originating from reduced Fe-S clusters (lines below g = 2.05) and radical species (line around g = 2) in the sample. Illumination of the sample led to the disappearance of the feature at g = 2.11. The illuminated sample exhibited lines with g values at 2.33 (plus a shoulder at 2.32), 2.28, 2.12, and 2.05, in addition to the lines of Fe-S clusters and radicals (Fig. 1B). The photodissociation could be reversed by warming of the sample to 200 K for 10 min in the dark. A difference spectrum, “dark” minus “light” is shown in Fig. 1C. This enabled us to observe the changes of the light-sensitive Nia(I) species only. Since the gas atmosphere of the sample was a mixture of H2 and CO, a remainder of the Nia(I)·H2 signal could sometimes be observed at g-values of 2.21 and 2.15 (compare trace C and trace D in Fig. 1). Trace D is the difference spectrum of the dark minus light spectrum of the enzyme as isolated under 5% H2. A comparison of traces A and B with trace D shows that the lines at g = 2.21 and g = 2.15 are due to the Nia(I)·H2 form and the line at g = 2.28 and part of the line at g = 2.11, as well as part of the line at g = 2.05, are due to the Nia(I)[H2] form. The EPR spectrum of the Nia(I)[CO] state consists of lines around g = 2.33, 2.12, and 2.05. The bars in the spectrum indicate the g positions of the several signals as determined by computer simulations (see below). In trace E, a difference of the spectra shown in trace C and D is displayed. In this spectrum, the signals of the Nia(I)·CO and Nia(I)[CO] species can be clearly observed. EPR spectra of 77Se-enriched Se-containing hydrogenases have shown that this element is a ligand to nickel (26He S.H. Teixeira M. LeGall J. Patil D.S. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. DerVartanian D.V. Huynh B.H. Peck Jr., H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2678-2682Google Scholar, 31Sorgenfrei O. Klein A. Albracht S.P.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 291-297Google Scholar). The observed interactions of the nickel-based unpaired electron with the 77Se nuclear magnetic moment (31Sorgenfrei O. Klein A. Albracht S.P.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 291-297Google Scholar) opened the possibility to use the Ni-Se axis as an internal reference frame. This already led to the conclusion (31Sorgenfrei O. Klein A. Albracht S.P.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 291-297Google Scholar) that in the Nia(I)·H2 state, the bound hydrogen cannot be present as a ligand to nickel in a position opposite to Se, since spectra recorded with a sample in D2O were not distinguishable from those prepared in H2O. As this is an important observation in the frame of the discussion in this paper, we show the spectra in Fig. 2. Carbon monoxide enriched in 13C had a prominent effect on the EPR spectrum of the Nia(I)·CO species in the C. vinosum enzyme (30van der Zwaan J.W. Coremans J.M.C.C. Bouwens E.C.M. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 101-110Google Scholar), showing that the electronic z-axis was along the Ni-CO bond. As outlined in the Introduction, it was assumed that H2 and CO could bind to the same position. This raised the question why bound 13CO caused a strong hyperfine splitting, whereas bound hydrogen had only a minor effect. To further address this problem, we have investigated the binding of CO and 13CO to active Se-containing M. voltae enzyme with and without 77Se. Both 77Se and 13C have a nuclear spin of I = 1/2 and can introduce a 2-fold splitting of the nickel EPR signals if the free electron is interacting with the magnetic ligand. This effect is expected to be considerable if the orbital containing the unpaired spin is pointing toward the ligands. Fig. 3 displays the spectra obtained with a sample treated with 13CO. In trace A, the dark (Nia(I)·13CO) spectrum is shown. Comparison with Fig. 1A shows that the gxy line at g = 2.11 apparently undergoes a 2-fold splitting (2.0 mT) caused by the introduction of the 13C nuclear spin. This points to an interaction between the nuclear spin of the 13C nucleus and the unpaired electron of the nickel. Trace B shows a spectrum recorded after illumination of the same sample in the cavity. Although this light (Nia(I)[13CO]) signal is rather anisotropic, one can detect the low-field features around g = 2.33 and the high-field line at g = 2.05. Theses lines show neither hyperfine splitting nor line broadening (compare Fig. 1B). This indicates that after illumination there is no longer an interaction between the unpaired electron of the nickel and the nuclear spin of the 13C, in line with the assumption that illumination leads to photolysis of the Ni-CO bond. Trace C displays the difference spectrum dark minus light. Comparison with Fig. 1E indicates that the gz line of the Nia(I)·13CO signal around g = 2.01 is split by 13C as well. This region of the spectrum might be somewhat less reliable because the sharp feature in the dark and light spectra can cause some artifacts in the difference spectrum. It can also be seen that the highest g value of the Nia(I)[CO] state is at 2.33, whereas the highest g value of the Nia(I)[H2] state (Fig. 1D) is at 2.285. This is unlike the situation observed in the C. vinosum enzyme (25van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Fontijn R.D. Slater E.C. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 271-277Google Scholar, 30van der Zwaan J.W. Coremans J.M.C.C. Bouwens E.C.M. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 101-110Google Scholar). A sample enriched in 77Se and treated with CO yielded a spectrum as shown in Fig. 4. Trace A displays the dark spectrum. Here a 2-fold splitting (4.6 mT) of the gxy line at g = 2.11 can be observed, indicating an interaction between the unpaired electron of the nickel and the nuclear spin of the 77Se. The gz line at 2.01 is hidden under signals from Fe-S and radical species in the sample. After illumination of the sample, the spectrum shown in trace B was obtained. The splitting introduced by the 77Se nuclear spin is well resolved in the high-field line at g = 2.05 (see arrows), but apparently not in the low-field lines. Thus also after illumination the 77Se nucleus still interacts with the unpaired electron of the nickel. The difference spectrum of the dark minus light spectrum is displayed in trace C. In this spectrum, a splitting of the gz line of the light-induced signal at g = 2.05 can be seen more clearly (compare Fig. 1E). The feature observed around g = 1.98 (Fig. 4C, arrow) is most likely a member of the split gz line of the dark signal, as has become evident from analysis of the spectra with the help of simulations (see below and Table I). The splittings caused by 77Se in the Nia(I)·CO signal appear rather anisotropic (see below). As before, the region around g = 2 might be less reliable due to the strong radical signals in the parent spectra.Table IParameters used for the simulation of the EPR spectra of F420-nonreducing hydrogenase (Approach I)Signalg valuesLine width (mT)Hyperfine splitting (mT)gxgygzWxWyWzAxAyAzDark 1CO/Se2.10942.10942.01232.5882.5881.248———13CO/Se1.211.211.75CO/77Se3.903.9011.76Dark 2CO/Se2.10842.10842.01231.0231.0231.248———13CO/Se2.262.261.75CO/77Se4.684.6811.76Light 1CO/Se2.04842.10902.32000.9001.2001.598———CO/77Se3.497.390.95Light 2CO/Se2.04842.13032.33150.9000.6000.618———CO/77Se3.491.301.01 Open table in a new tab As mentioned in the Introduction, an anisotropic splitting due to 77Se was observed in 77Se-enriched samples in the Nia(I)·H2 state. This could have been an effect of partial protonation of the selenol group. It has been speculated that this group might serve as a basic group, which could bind the proton originating from the heterolytic cleavage of H2. In this case the shape of the spectrum might be expected to change with changing pH. This notion was tested by taking spectra of 77Se-enriched samples in the Nia(I)·H2 state in the range of pH 6 to 9 (Fig. 5). In this range no changes in the spectra were observed. The data in Figs. 1, 3, and 4 show that in the dark state the unpaired electron of nickel interacts with both the 77Se nucleus and the 13C nucleus of CO. After illumination interaction with the 13C nucleus was lost. In contrast, the 77Se nucleus still interacted with the unpaired spin after illumination. To verify this interpretation and to more precisely determine the g values and hyperfine tensors, simulations of the experimental spectra were made. Where necessary, the contributions to the spectra of the Nia(I)·H2 and Nia(I)[H2] species were subtracted. Dark minus light difference spectra as in Fig. 1D (or from a 77Se-enriched sample) were used for this purpose. In view of the limited quality of the EPR spectra, resulting from the limited amounts of isotope-enriched enzyme and overlapping Fe-S, radical, and other background signals (Figs. 1, 3, and 4), two different approaches for computer simulations were applied. In this approach, the line shapes of the dark minus light difference spectra were obtained after conversion of all spectra to the same microwave frequency (9420 MHz). It was assumed that features below g = 2.03 in the difference spectra were not very reliable due to sharp lines in the parent spectra. Simulation were performed with the program of F. Neese (35Neese F. Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange. Program No. QCMP 136, Indiana, U. S. A1995Google Scholar). Comparisons of experimental and simulated spectra are shown in Fig. 6. The Nia(I)·CO signal was best simulated as the sum of two axial signals with slightly different gxy values, but with considerably different Wxy values. In addition, the Nia(I)[CO] spectrum was simulated as a sum of two different rhombic signals. For each simulation, the enrichment in 77Se was taken into account (7.58% for normal samples and 92% for the 77Se-enriched samples). Hence, every simulated difference spectrum consisted of a sum of eight signals. The EPR parameters of these eight spectra are summarized in Table I, and the relative intensities, used to compose the spectra in Fig. 6 (traces B, D, and F) are given in Table II. Note that the ratio of the two dark signals equals the ratio of the two light-induced signals. Using this approach, it thus seems that two slightly different species of the Nia(I)·CO form were present. It was noted that the ratio of these forms was constant in all simulations of spectra of several different samples. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the simulated spectra fitted quite well in the region above g = 2.03, but below that value too much intensity was obtained for the gz line of the Nia(I)·CO signal.Table IIRelative intensities (%), based on g value-normalized double-integral values, of the individual spectra used to compose the simulations of Fig. 6, traces B, D, and FTraceDark 1Dark 2CO/SeCO/77Se13CO/Se13CO/77SeCO/SeCO/77Se13CO/Se13CO/77SeB58.814.8233.612.76D58.814.8233.612.76F5.0958.552.9133.45TraceLight 1Light 2CO/SeCO/77Se13CO/Se13CO/77SeCO/SeCO/77Se13CO/Se13CO/77SeB−58.81−4.82−33.61−2.76D−58.81−4.82−33.61−2.76F−5.09−58.55−2.91−33.45 Open table in a new tab Here it was assumed that, like in our previous studies on the Nia(I)·H2 state (31Sorgenfrei O. Klein A. Albracht S.P.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 291-297Google Scholar), the region below g = 2.03 was also a reliable representation of the EPR line shapes of the Nia(I)·CO and Nia(I)·[CO] states. For an overall comparison, slight differences in experimental microwave frequency among the EPR tube were not corrected. Illumination of a sample did not change this frequency. The programs of S. P. J. Albracht (36Beinert H. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 245-277Google Scholar) were used. The Nia(I)·CO spectrum was simulated as a single axial signal, whereas the spectrum obtained after illumination, the Nia(I)[CO] state, was an overlap of two signals with different gz (and Wz) values around g = 2.33, but the same gy and gx values and widths. Fig. 7 summarizes the results (see also Table III, Table IV). Now the features below g = 2.03 fitted reasonably well.Table IIIParameters used for the simulation of the EPR spectra of F420-nonreducing hydrogenase (Approach II)Signalg valuesLine width (mT)Hyperfine splitting (mT)gxgygzWxWyWzAxAyAzDarkCO/Se2.10842.10842.01232.052.051.7———13CO/Se2.22.22.35CO/77Se4.64.612.1Light 1CO/Se2.04842.11372.32001.22.72.68———CO/77Se3.813.810Light 2CO/Se2.04842.11372.33151.22.71.04———CO/77Se3.813.810 Open table in a new tab Table IVRelative intensities (%), based on g value-normalized double-integral values, of the individual spectra used to compose the simulations of Fig. 7,traces B, D, and FTraceDarkCO/SeCO/77Se13CO/Se13CO/77SeB92.427.58D92.427.58F8.092.0TraceLight 1Light 2CO/SeCO/77SeCO/SeCO/77SeB−58.81−4.84−33.61−2.76D−58.81−4.84−33.61−2.76F−5.09−58.55−2.91−33.45 Open table in a new tab Simulations according to approach I gave quite good fits, except for the region below g = 2.03. Following approach II, much better fits were obtained for this particular region, but now the low-field shoulder around g = 2.13 in Fig. 7A could not be accounted for. In using approach II, it was noticed that all simulations shown in Fig. 7 differed in the g = 2.13 region in the same way from the experimental dark minus light spectra of the three different samples, and hence this difference was not sensitive to 13CO or 77Se. It is presumably due to a light-sensitive change not related to the nickel site. It was this feature that determined whether the spectrum of the Nia(I)·CO state was simulated as one species (approach II) or two species (approach I). In view of the better overall fits with approach II, we conclude that there is presumably only one Nia(I)·CO state."

We have assessed the effects of adhesion of the representative monocytoid cell lines, THP-1 and U937, to purified extracellular matrix proteins on their expression of plasminogen receptors. After adhesion to immobilized fibronectin, adherent and nonadherent subpopulations of cells were separated. Plasminogen binding to the nonadherent population of cells increased 3-fold, whereas binding to the adherent population decreased by 60%. These changes were due to differences in the plasminogen binding capacities of the cells, while the affinities of the cells for plasminogen were unchanged. The up-regulation of receptor expression in the nonadherent cell population was: 1) induced rapidly and reversibly, 2) independent of new protein synthesis, 3) required an interaction between adherent and nonadherent cell populations, and 4) associated with an enhanced ability of the cells to promote plasminogen activation and to degrade fibronectin. Other immobilized adhesive proteins, laminin and vitronectin, also supported up-regulation of plasminogen receptors in the nonadherent cells. Carboxypeptidase B treatment eliminated the increment in the plasminogen binding capacity of the nonadherent cells, suggesting that the increase in binding was due to exposure of new carboxyl-terminal lysyl residues on the cell surfaces. Furthermore, both the adherence of the cells and up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites was abolished by β1-integrin monoclonal antibodies. These results suggest that proteins found in extracellular matrices have the capacity to modulate the expression of plasminogen binding sites, thus regulating local proteolysis and cell migration.

The ability to modulate plasminogen binding capacity provides a mechanism for regulation of cell surface proteolytic activity. Expression of plasminogen receptors on U937 monocytoid cells is up-regulated by interferon-γ and vitamin D3 (15Lu H. Mirshahi M. Krief P. Soria C. Soria J. Mishal Z. Bertrand O. Perrot J.Y. Li H.

Blood. 1988; 72: 628-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of differentiation inducing agents (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and vitamin D3), monocytoid cells (THP-1 and U937) change their adhesive properties and up-regulate plasminogen binding site expression (18Felez J. Miles L.A. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The importance of cell adhesion in modulating the cell-surface association of components of the plasminogen system has been emphasized by studies showing that adhesion modulates the expression and distribution of urokinase and its receptor (19Pollanen J. Hedman K. Nielsen L.A. Dano K. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and the identification of the matrix-associated protein, vitronectin, as a ligand for the urokinase receptor (20Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has now been established in many reports that cells respond to the presence and composition of the extracellular matrix by adhering, spreading, migrating, differentiating, and altering gene transcription and cellular phenotype (reviewed in 21Jones P.L. Schmidhauser C. Bissell M.J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 137-154PubMed Google Scholar). These matrix-dependent effects are exemplified in studies demonstrating that extracellular matrix attachment influences mammary epithelial cell differentiation (reviewed in 22Quin C.Q. Bissell M.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 737-743Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and expression of milk proteins (23Lin C.Q. Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix also induces metalloproteinase expression (24Tremble P.M. Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Matrix. 1992; : 212-214Google Scholar). Many of these responses require attachment to the extracellular matrix via β1-integrins (reviewed in 25Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In other cell types, integrin-mediated attachment to the extracellular matrix suppresses apoptosis in both two-dimensional (26Meredith J.B. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) and three-dimensional cultures (27Boudreau N. Sympson C.J. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Science. 1995; 267: 891-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). In view of the close interrelationship between cell adhesion and proteolysis, we have examined the effect of adherence of monocytoid cells to purified extracellular matrix proteins (in the absence of exogenously added agonists) on plasminogen receptor expression. Adhesion is shown to directly influence the plasminogen binding capacity of cells, and a role for β1-integrins in receptor expression is demonstrated. Data are developed to indicate that a specific subset of plasminogen receptors is altered by cell adhesion, and this subset influences plasmin generation. The ability of adhesion to modulate plasminogen receptor expression has important implications in several diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes.

Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar) was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Whittaker/MA Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) containing penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.05 M HEPES, pH 7.35, 5 × 10−4%β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% fetal calf serum (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA). U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were prepared for the ligand binding assays by washing two times in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.6 mM MgSO4, and 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.35 (HBSS-HEPES), and resuspended in HBSS-HEPES containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Calbiochem) (HBSS-BSA). The cells (at 106/ml) were incubated with 125I-plasminogen (100 nM), or cells (at 5 × 106/ml) were incubated with 125I-scu-PA (1 nM) in a total volume of 200 μl at 37°C for 1 h. Triplicate 50-μl aliquots were layered over 300 μl of 20% sucrose in HBSS-BSA and centrifuged for 2.5 min in a Beckman Microfuge (Beckman Instruments). The tube tips were cut off and counted in a gamma counter (Iso Data, Inc., Palatine, IL). Specific binding data are given for all experiments and were determined by subtracting the nonspecific binding. For plasminogen, nonspecific binding was defined as counts bound to the cells in the presence of 200 mMϵ-aminocaproic acid. For scu-PA, nonspecific binding was determined as counts bound in the presence of 100 nM unlabeled scu-PA. The level of nonspecific binding determined for both ligands was ∼10% at the ligand concentrations specified above. The number of molecules of ligand bound per cell was calculated based on the specific activities of the ligands. Fn (100 μg, unless otherwise indicated), Vn (100 μg), or Lm (160 μg) in volumes of 10 ml in PBS were coated onto 100-mm Petri dishes (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) for 18 h at 4°C. The dishes were postcoated with 1% BSA for 90 min at 22°C. THP-1 cells (1.5 × 107) in 10-ml volumes of cell culture medium were added to the coated dishes and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in an atmosphere with 95% humidity and 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were recovered by gentle decanting and collected, followed by addition of 5 ml of the cell culture medium and recovery of additional cells with a plastic Pasteur pipette (twice). Adherent cells were recovered by flushing with a plastic Pasteur pipette until no cells were detected microscopically. Control cells were incubated in uncoated Petri dishes that also had been postcoated with 1% BSA. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and cell recovery by counting in a hemocytometer. Samples were prepared with sample buffer (2% SDS, 63 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose and 0.02% bromphenol blue) containing 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM benzamidine, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1.2 units/ml Trasylol, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed under reducing condition on 5% polyacrylamide slab gels in the buffer system of Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (203947) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried, and autoradiograms were developed with XRP-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) using an intensifier screen. Autoradiograms were scanned by laser densitometry. Molecular weights were estimated relative to protein standards obtained from Bio-Rad. THP-1 cells were washed once in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.05 M HEPES, pH 7.35, 5 × 10−4β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated with 25 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN Biochemicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) for 2 h at 37°C in an atmosphere with 95% humidity and 5% CO2. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into protein was determined as counts precipitable in 10% trichloroacetic acid from cells lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 80, 50 mM octylglucoside, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% NaN3, 10 mM EDTA, 5 units/ml Trasylol, 10 mM benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Data are given as mean ± S.D. Carboxypeptidase B was from Sigma. The plasmin substrate, D-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (S-2251) was from Kabi Vitrum, Malmo, Sweden. Goat anti-mouse IgG and normal mouse IgG were from Calbiochem. Transwell dishes were from Costar, Cambridge, MA. Ascites containing mAb W632 was kindly provided by Dr. Martin Schwartz, The Scripps Research Institute. We tested whether adhesion of THP-1 monocytoid cells to isolated extracellular matrix proteins could modulate plasminogen receptor expression. THP-1 cells were allowed to adhere to Petri dishes coated with either Fn, Vn, or Lm or to uncoated control wells. The cells adhered to the three matrix proteins, but not to the uncoated dishes. By producing a limited surface, a nonadherent and an adherent cell population could be recovered separately from each substrate and 125I-plasminogen binding was measured. Plasminogen binding to the nonadherent cell population was greatly enhanced compared to the control cells incubated in uncoated dishes. A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 1. With the different matrix proteins, the percent plasminogen binding (relative to control cells at 100%) was 310 ± 55 (Fn) (n = 22), 167 ± 20 (Vn) (n = 3), and 140 ± 35 (Lm) (n = 3). In contrast, plasminogen binding to the adherent population decreased with each matrix protein compared to the control cells: the percent 125I-plasminogen binding was 61 ± 16 (Fn, n = 22), 45 ± 9 (Vn, n = 3), and 64 ± 35 (Lm, n = 3). The relationship between extent of adhesion and receptor up-regulation was then explored. Since the greatest degree of adherence and receptor up-regulation was attained with Fn (Fig. 1), this substrate was used in subsequent experiments. Petri dishes were coated with varying quantities of Fn to attain different degree(s) of cellular adhesion. Maximal adhesion of the cells (85% adherence) was attained when the wells were coated with 50 μg of Fn (Fig. 2, panel A). Plasminogen receptor expression in the nonadherent cells increased with increasing adhesion (Fig. 2, panel B). In contrast, plasminogen binding to the adherent cells decreased to 60 ± 16% (n = 6) relative to control cells (data not shown) without any apparent relation to the extent of adhesion. As specific examples, with 85, 64, and 38% adhesion, the decrease in plasminogen binding of the adherent cells was 31, 18, and 40%. The role of adhesion was also examined by comparing up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites in an additional cell type. In parallel experiments, using dishes coated with 100 μg of Fn, THP-1 cells were 94% adherent and U937 monocytoid cells were 76% adherent. Plasminogen binding to the nonadherent THP-1 cells increased 2-fold over controls, while plasminogen binding to the nonadherent U937 cells increased 1.6-fold. Moreover, the up-regulation of plasminogen receptors did not reflect a general effect on cell surface receptors. When 125I-scu-PA binding to the cells was examined in parallel with a 1 nM input concentration of 125I-scu-PA, 1.19 ± 0.26 × 104 (n = 3) and 1.38 ± 0.29 × 104 (n = 3) molecules were bound per cell in the nonadherent and adherent THP-1 cell populations, respectively. To further explore the requirement for adherence to substratum, we tested whether soluble Fn could induce plasminogen receptor up-regulation in the nonadherent cell population. Cells (1.5 × 107) were incubated in polypropylene tubes in the presence of 100 μg of soluble Fn. Under this condition, no up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites was observed. In parallel experiments in which the cells were incubated with immobilized Fn, 70% adhesion was achieved, resulting in a 4.5-fold up-regulation of plasminogen receptor expression in the nonadherent population. Next, the time dependence of plasminogen receptor up-regulation in the nonadherent cell population was investigated (Fig. 3). THP-1 cells were incubated with Fn-coated dishes for varying times. The nonadherent population was recovered and plasminogen binding and percent adhesion were determined. Plasminogen receptor up-regulation was induced rapidly, and could be detected by 10 min, reaching a maximum between 30 and 120 min. The receptor up-regulation decayed rapidly after 120 min. Interestingly, the extent of adhesion paralleled the receptor up-regulation until 120 min, but decayed more slowly. We tested also whether the up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites was reversible. Cells were incubated with Fn-coated dishes, and 69% of the cells adhered. The nonadherent population was recovered and then allowed to adhere to a second Fn-coated dish. Sixty-eight percent adherence was obtained. Therefore, the distinction between adherent and nonadherent populations was not due to an unique subpopulation of cells, but, apparently, to the availability of surface for adherence. As discussed above, plasminogen receptors were up-regulated ∼2-fold in the nonadherent cell population during the first adhesion step (Table I). Following the second adhesion of the nonadherent population of cells, plasminogen receptor expression was further up-regulated by ∼2-fold in the newly nonadherent population and was downregulated ∼2.5-fold in the newly adherent population (Table I). Thus, both up-regulation and down-regulation of plasminogen binding site exposure was reversible. To determine whether the increase in plasminogen binding was due to a change in affinity and/or capacity of the nonadherent cells for plasminogen, binding isotherms were constructed for the cells that did not adhere to Fn and for control cells incubated in uncoated dishes. Under equilibrium binding conditions, the isotherms gave evidence of saturation and, therefore, the data were plotted in Scatchard plots (Fig. 4). Straight lines were obtained and provided good fits for both sets of data points (r = −0.98 for control cells and r = −0.99 for the nonadherent cells), suggesting a single class of plasminogen binding sites with respect to affinity. The affinities of both cell populations for plasminogen were not statistically different: Kd values of 447 ± 141 nM and 393 ± 25 nM were calculated for nonadherent and control cell populations, respectively (n = 3). However, the number of binding sites was 4-fold higher in the nonadherent population: βmax = 28 ± 5 × 106 molecules/nonadherent cell versus 7 ± 1 × 106 molecules/control cell. Thus, the increase in plasminogen binding to the nonadherent cells was due to a change in capacity but not in affinity for plasminogen. In order to determine whether de novo protein synthesis was required for plasminogen receptor up-regulation, THP-1 cells were treated with cycloheximide prior to exposure to the immobilized Fn. To insure that cycloheximide was exerting its anticipated effects, we verified that [35S]methionine incorporation into total cellular protein was inhibited by greater than 90% (Table II). Under this condition, plasminogen receptor up-regulation was not affected (Table II). In controls, cycloheximide treatment altered neither cell viability nor the ability of the cells to adhere to Fn. The possibility that soluble factors released during the adhesion step could be responsible for the up-regulation was explored. Conditioned medium was collected after adhesion of the cells to Fn for 1 h and was then added to fresh THP-1 cells in uncoated dishes for 1 h. No plasminogen receptor up-regulation was observed in the cells exposed to the conditioned medium (106 ± 3% (n = 3) relative to control cells exposed to nonconditioned medium). To test whether a transiently active soluble factor, released from the adherent cells during the adhesion step, might induce receptor up-regulation, a second experimental format was used. Cells were cultured in transwell dishes with 3-μm pore size nucleopore polycarbonate membranes. Fn was coated onto the surface of the lower chamber, and no Fn was present in the upper chamber. Thus, in the lower chamber, both adherent cells and nonadherent cells were present; in the upper chamber, all cells were nonadherent. Under these conditions, no up-regulation of plasminogen receptors was observed in cells cultured in the upper chamber, although in the bottom chamber, a 2.3 ± 0.2-fold up-regulation (n = 3) was induced in the nonadherent population. Thus, no evidence was obtained for up-regulation of plasminogen receptors by soluble factors. The role of β1-integrins in up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites following adherence to fibronectin was explored. Cells were preincubated with two anti-β1-integrin monoclonal antibodies that block adhesion to fibronectin, SG19 (32Miyake K. Hasunuma Y. Yagita H. Kimoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and 4B4 (33Morimoto C. Letvin N.L. Boyd A.W. Hagan M. Brown H. Kormacki M. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3762-3769PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, no adherent cells were recovered (Fig. 5B), and plasminogen binding sites were not increased in the nonadherent population (Fig. 5A). Using the activating mAb, 8A2 (34Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), adherence was not blocked and plasminogen binding sites were up-regulated 3.7-fold compared to control cells incubated in the absence of Fn. Cells incubated with Fn in the presence of an irrelevant mAb exhibited a 2.5-fold up-regulation in plasminogen binding ability compared to the control cells. We found no up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites when cells were incubated with the activating antibody, 8A2, in uncoated dishes (data not shown), excluding the possibility that 8A2 could stimulate the cells to increase plasminogen binding sites in the absence of a β1-integrin ligand. To examine whether the up-regulation observed in the nonadherent population might require attachment followed by release of cells, we tested whether up-regulation could occur when adherent cells were prevented from detaching. Petri dishes were incubated with goat-anti-mouse IgG to capture either mAb W632, directed against the major histocompatiblity complex, or normal mouse IgG as described (37Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The THP-1 cells adhered to each type of coating, presumably via an interaction with Fc receptors and/or the major histocompatiblity complex (Fig. 6B). Nonadherent and adherent cell populations were recovered from these dishes and plasminogen binding compared with nonadherent and adherent cells recovered from fibronectin-coated dishes. Under all conditions that induced adherence, plasminogen binding was increased to a similar extent in the nonadherent cell populations and decreased in the adherent populations, compared to control cells incubated in uncoated dishes (Fig. 6A). Therefore, the up-regulation in receptor expression in the nonadherent population cannot be attributed to changes occurring when cells detach from a surface. Proteins with carboxyl-terminal lysyl residues are candidate plasminogen receptors (38Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We sought to determine the extent to which plasminogen receptor up-regulation depended upon exposure of carboxyl-terminal lysyl residues. Adherent and nonadherent populations were generated in the presence of immobilized Fn. Then these populations and control cells were separately treated with carboxypeptidase B (CPB) prior to measuring 125I-plasminogen binding. CPB treatment did not decrease viability of either the nonadherent, adherent or control cells, as determined by trypan blue exclusion. With the control and adherent cells, CPB treatment decreased plasminogen binding in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a plateau at approximately 60% inhibition (Fig. 7), consistent with previously published data (38Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 39Camacho M. Fondaneche M. Burtin P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 40Felez J. Chanquias C.J. Fabregas P. Plow E.F. Miles L.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 2433-2441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the nonadherent cell population, CPB treatment decreased plasminogen binding to the level of the CPB-treated control cells (Fig. 7). These results suggested that the up-regulated plasminogen binding sites are composed predominantly of proteins exposing carboxyl-terminal lysyl (or arginyl) residues on the cell surface. We sought to determine whether up-regulation of plasminogen receptors was associated with an increased ability of the cells to promote plasminogen activation. Adherent and nonadherent cell populations were produced after incubation with Fn-coated dishes. These cells and control cells were incubated with 15 μM Glu-plasminogen. The unbound plasminogen was removed by centrifugation and u-PA and the plasmin substrate, S-2251, were added. Plasmin activity was measured as cleavage of the S-2251. After 30 min, the plasmin amidolytic activity of the nonadherent cells was 3.5 times higher than that of the adherent cells and 2.5 times higher than the control cells (Fig. 8). The extent of promotion of plasminogen activation correlated with the plasminogen binding capacities of the cells in this experiment. Plasminogen binding to the nonadherent cells was approximately 2.5- and 2-fold higher than to either the adherent or control cells, respectively. The relationship between plasminogen receptor expression and the ability of the cells to degrade a representative extracellular matrix component, Fn, was explored. Nonadherent cell populations were generated by adherence of THP-1 cells to Fn-coated plates and control cells were incubated in uncoated plates. These cells were incubated with 10 μM Glu-plasminogen and washed to remove unbound ligand. Then u-PA and soluble 125I-Fn were added and incubated with the cells. After incubation for 2 h, 125I-Fn was degraded to a major product with a Mr(app) of 190,000 (Fig. 9, lanes 2 and 3), while the integrity of either Fn alone or Fn plus u-PA was not changed between 0 and 2 h (data not shown). The extent of degradation in the nonadherent cells was ∼2-fold greater than that of the control cells, as determined by laser densitometric scanning of autoradiograms of the gels. After 20 h of incubation, intact 125I-Fn was no longer detectable after incubation with the cells (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 5). At this time point, the 190,000 band was further degraded into smaller fragments. The decrease in intensity of the 190,000 band was more extensive (∼4-fold) in the nonadherent cell population compared to control cells. Greater than 95% of the 125I-Fn remained intact following incubation with buffer or with u-PA for 20 h (data not shown). Thus, the ability of the cells to degrade Fn was enhanced in the nonadherent cell population coinciding with plasminogen receptor up-regulation. In this study, we provide the first evidence that adhesion of monocytoid cells to extracellular matrix proteins, via β1-integrins, induces increased expression of plasminogen binding sites. The up-regulation of these sites occurred in the subpopulation of cells that was nonadherent, although the presence of adherent cells was required. Three different adhesive proteins, fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin, supported this up-regulation. The following conclusions can be drawn from our analyses. 1) The presence of a population of cells adhering to the extracellular matrix in an integrin-dependent manner is sufficient to induce up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites in the nonadherent population of cells. In contrast, plasminogen binding to the adherent cells is decreased compared to cells maintained in suspension. 2) The up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites is a reversible process; when nonadherent cells are allowed to adhere to substratum, exposure of plasminogen binding sites is down-regulated. This reversibility suggests that the nonadherent cells did not represent a distinct subpopulation within the cell line. Furthermore, this implies that proteolysis does not play a role in the up-regulation. 3) The up-regulation is rapid and independent of new protein synthesis. 4) The newly available plasminogen receptors are proteins exposing carboxyl-terminal lysines or arginines. These receptors exhibit the same affinity for plasminogen as the receptors on resting cells. 5) Up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites increases the ability of the cells to promote plasminogen activation and to degrade Fn. The ability of cells to promote plasminogen activation is absolutely dependent upon binding of plasminogen to the cell surface (41Ellis V. Behrendt N. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Felez J. Miles L.A. Plow E.F. Fabregas P. Lijnen H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 1232Google Scholar). Both protein (38Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and nonprotein (e.g. gangliosides) (43Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Levin E.G. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 280: 9337-9343Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) components of the cell membrane bind plasminogen. In the present study, the increase in plasminogen binding capacity of the nonadherent cells was entirely sensitive to CPB. Thus, these new binding sites are predominantly proteins exposing carboxyl-terminal lysines. Furthermore, the nonadherent cells exhibiting enhanced plasminogen binding were 3.5-fold more effective than control cells in promoting plasminogen activation. These observations indicate a role of newly exposed carboxyl-terminal lysines in enhancing plasminogen activation and support the dependence of cell surface plasminogen activation on plasminogen receptor occupancy. The presence of a population of cells that adhered to extracellular matrix proteins was necessary and sufficient to induce up-regulation of plasminogen receptors in the nonadherent cell population. The up-regulation of plasminogen binding sites did not require the addition of exogenous agonists. The adherence of the THP-1 cells to Fn was dependent upon β1-integrin(s). β1-Integrins are known to transmit external signals from the extracellular matrix to stimulate intracellular signaling pathways (reviewed in 44Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8889) Google Scholar). However, activation of β1-integrins on the monocytoid cells using an activating antibody in the absence of β1 ligands, was not sufficient to up-regulate plasminogen binding site expression. The ability to induce plasminogen receptor up-regulation was not limited to extracellular matrix proteins: Adherence of cells to immobilized antibodies also induced plasminogen receptor up-regulation in the nonadherent cell population, suggesting that the predominant determinant of up-regulation is the presence of adherent cells and may not be dependent upon intracellular signaling. In analyzing plasminogen binding site up-regulation, we were unable to detect the presence of a soluble factor which could induce receptor up-regulation in the nonadherent cell population. Furthermore, plasminogen binding site up-regulation was not diminished by pretreatment with cycloheximide, suggesting that new protein synthesis was not required to achieve up-regulation. Another potential mechanism which could explain up-regulation is proteolytic modification of cell surfaces to increase the number of plasminogen binding sites (39Camacho M. Fondaneche M. Burtin P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 45Gonzalez-Gronow M. Stack S. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, plasminogen binding site expression was down-regulated when nonadherent cells were allowed to adhere to a new surface. This observation argues that proteolytic digestion of membrane proteins is not responsible for the up-regulation induced by adherence. With elimination of the foregoing potential mechanisms to explain up-regulation of plasminogen receptor expression in the nonadherent cells, the following model is most compatible with our results. Direct contact between the adherent cell population and nonadherent cells induces reversible reorganization of the cell membrane which increases surface exposure of proteins with carboxyl-terminal lysines. The adhesion step induced down-regulation of receptor expression in the adherent cells. Furthermore, when the nonadherent cells (that exhibited receptor up-regulation) were allowed to adhere, adhesion induced receptor down-regulation. Down-regulation, likewise, may be induced by reorganization of the cell membrane during adhesion. The ability of cells to regulate their expression of plasminogen receptors is critical for local regulation of proteolysis. When cells encounter an adhesive substrate, receptor expression is up-regulated in the nonadherent cell population. When this increase is combined with clustering of urokinase receptors at the leading edge of the cell (46Estreicher A. Mühlhauser J. Carpentier J.-L. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), focal proteolytic activity is generated on the cell surface to promote matrix degradation. After the cells adhere, plasminogen receptors and, consequently, cell surface proteolytic activity are down-regulated, to aid in the establishment of stable cell-substratum contacts. This regulation of proteolytic activity at local environments should have important consequences for biological processes in which cells must degrade extracellular matrices in order to migrate, such as in wound healing, inflammation, metastasis, and angiogenesis.

In this study, we specifically examined how deletion or transposition of the site of N-linked glycosylation in the CD59 polypeptide affects its MAC inhibitory function. Our data demonstrate that the inhibitory potency of CD59 is unaffected when glycosylation is transposed from Asn18 to another site in the polypeptide. Furthermore, we show that CD59 retains normal MAC regulatory function when mutated to eliminate all potential sites for N-linked glycosylation.

Moreover, the mouse MPG (and particularly the amino-terminal half of the mouse MPG in a mouse/human hybrid protein) showed repair of 7-methylguanine and 3-methylguanine at a higher rate than did human MPG or the amino-terminal half of human MPG in human/mouse hybrid protein (when the levels of both proteins were adjusted to release 3-methyladenine at comparable rate). This result indicates that the amino-terminal half of MPG is more critical for the recognition of 3-methylguanine and 7-methylguanine (31Roy R. Kennel S.J. Mitra S.

We also observed that deletion of the amino-terminal residues led to greater solubility of overexpressed protein, and deletion of 44 or 48 residues apparently did not affect enzyme activity for 3-methyladenine release. 2R. Roy, T. Hazra, G. Roy, D. T. Grabowski, and S. Mitra, submitted for publication. Results from the chimeric mouse/human MPG suggest that the protein is organized in discrete substructures or domains. If so, how do these domains interact during substrate binding and catalysis? In this study controlled proteolysis was employed to identify the domains of mouse MPG in solution and to characterize their possible functions. NΔ48 mMPG, overexpressed in bacteria, was purified essentially to homogeneity as described previously (27Roy R. Brooks C. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15131-15140Google Scholar) in four steps by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30-55%), anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), cation exchange chromatography on phosphocellulose P11 (Whatman) and finally FPLC on MonoS (Pharmacia). The yield of mouse MPG was about 15 mg of protein/20 g of cells (wet weight), and the purity was >95%. After dialysis against buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1.0 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol) containing 0.1 M NaCl and 50% glycerol, purified mouse MPG was stored at −20°C. Protease digestion was performed by treating 75 μg of mouse MPG with different amounts of various proteases (sequencing grade, Sigma), e.g. trypsin at an enzyme to substrate (E/S) ratio of 1:500, endoprotease Lys-C (E/S = 1:500), endoprotease Arg-C (E/S = 1:500), endoprotease Glu-C (E/S = 1:50) or endoproteinase Asp-N (E/S = 1:50), in buffer A containing 0.1 M NaCl. After incubation for appropriate periods at 25°C, the digestion products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (20.1% polyacrylamide; 32Giulian G.G. Moss R.L. Greaser M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 277-287Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and photographed. MPG (100 μg) was digested with endoprotease Arg-C at E/S of 1:800 for 5 min and then applied to a 2.0-ml single-stranded DNA-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 M NaCl. The column was washed with 100 mM NaCl in buffer A and was sequentially eluted at room temperature with 1.0 ml each of 150 mM, 200 mM, 250 mM, and 300 mM of NaCl in buffer A. The fractions were collected on ice and mixed with trichloroacetic acid, and the protein precipitates centrifuged and suspended in 15 μl of H2O and 5 μl of 4 × sample buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 400 mM dithiothreitol, 8% SDS, 0.4% bromphenol blue, and 40% glycerol) prior to loading for SDS-PAGE. MPG was assayed by incubating purified MPG or proteolytic fragments with an excess substrate, [3H]methyl-labeled calf thymus DNA (370 cpm/μg DNA; 109 fmol of m7G and 20 fmol of m3A in a total of 960 pmol of adenine and 640 pmol of guanine/μg of DNA), as described previously (27Roy R. Brooks C. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15131-15140Google Scholar). MPG (2.3 nmol) was incubated with either substrate ϵA-oligonucleotide or control A-oligonucleotide (single-stranded or duplex, 25-mer) at a 1:1 molar ratio for 10 min at 25°C and the reaction mixture was digested with trypsin at (E/S = 1:100) at 25°C for 5, 25, and 60 min. The digests were then electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and photographed. DNA-bound MPG (with binding performed as in the protease protection assay) or MPG (2.3 nmol) alone was incubated with 3 mM DTSSP for 2 and 4 h. The reaction was then stopped by addition of the quencher 100 mM ethanolamine, pH 8.0. The reaction mixture was adjusted to 0.1% SDS and digested with endoprotease Glu-C (E/S = 1:10) for 60 min at 25°C. The digests were then electrophoresed on 20.1% SDS-PAGE ± 100 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. MPG (2.6 μM, dithiothreitol-free) was mixed with ϵA-containing duplex oligonucleotide (6 μM, 25-mer) or A-containing control oligonucleotide (7.5 μM, 25-mer), and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The MPG·DNA mixtures and MPG alone were then mixed separately with 68-fold excess of Ellman's reagent (DTNB, Pierce), in the presence of 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and the reaction was monitored by the change in A412 in a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Circular dichroism spectra were measured with an Aviv 62 DS spectropolarimeter. To acquire a full range of near- and far-ultraviolet (UV) circular dichroism (CD) spectra, fused quartz cuvettes with path lengths of 0.01 and 0.1 cm were used for protein and DNA solutions with concentrations around 10−5M. Since the Kd for DNA-protein complex formation is 2 × 10−8M (27Roy R. Brooks C. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15131-15140Google Scholar), the spectra for the 1:1 DNA-protein complex must be that of the complex with negligible amount of free protein or DNA. Each spectrum was recorded with a 0.5-nm increment and 1-s interval. For each sample multiple repetitive scans were obtained and averaged. The amino-terminal sequences of MPG or its proteolytic fragments, attached to a Sequelon-AA membrane, were determined in an Applied Biosystems 475/477A protein sequencer. Protein concentrations were measured by the bicinchoninic acid procedure (33Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallion A.K. Gartner F.H. Porvenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Radioactivity in liquid samples was quantitated with Scintiverse II (Fisher Biotech) in a Beckman LS6000SC liquid scintillation counter. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite chemistry. Adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine CE phosphoramidites were obtained from Applied Biosystems and special ethenoadenine CE phosphoramidite from Glen Research. Domains are independently folded units of protein structure (reviewed in 34Schulz G. Schirmer R. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1979Google Scholar and 35Janin J. Chothia C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 420-430Google Scholar). Fifty to 150 amino acids typically form a domain; a protein composed of more than 150 amino acids may contain multiple domains connected by flexible loops (36Blatter E.E. Ross W. Tang H. Gourse R.L. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1994; 78: 889-896Google Scholar). In general, controlled proteolysis provides a classical approach to define domain organization (36Blatter E.E. Ross W. Tang H. Gourse R.L.

Proteases preferentially cleave the solvent-exposed loops and domain-linking regions to yield domain fragments without affecting their tertiary structures. The domains often become susceptible to further proteolysis only under denaturing conditions. The individual domains sometimes retain some of the functions assigned to the intact protein (40Pabo C. Sauer R. Sturtevant J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1608-1612Google Scholar, 44Kumar A. Abbotts J. Karawya E.M. Wilson S.H.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2940-2946Google Scholar). We used controlled proteolysis to cleave the mouse MPG into discrete fragments. Because the protein contains multiple cleavage sites for several proteases such as trypsin (Trp), endoprotease Lys-C (endoLys-C), endoprotease Arg-C (endoArg-C), endoprotease Glu-C (V8) and endoproteinase Asp-N (endoAsp-N), different fragments were generated by these proteases. Digestion with trypsin for different times under nondenaturing condition cleaved MPG into three stable fragments (p13, p8, and p6), which were resistant to further proteolysis, although each of the fragments contained a number of trypsin cleavage sites; p13 had 6 Arg, 5 Lys, p8 had 9 Arg, and p6 had 5 Arg and 2 Lys residues. Additionally, fragments p29 and p20 were transiently observed at earlier time points and yielded the same stable fragments, p8, p6, and p13, after further digestion (Fig. 1A). The identity of these fragments was confirmed by sequencing their amino-terminal residues (Table I). Proteolysis with endoLys-C generated three discrete fragments: p18, p16, and p13 (Fig. 1B). However, amino-terminal sequence analysis shows that p13 (endoLys-C) was equivalent to p13 (Trp), and that p16 is generated from p18, which is equivalent to the combination of p8 (Trp) and p6 (Trp) fragments (Table I). Digestion with endoArg-C generated two transient fragments, p29 and p20, but longer digestion produced only one stable fragment, p13 (Fig. 1C). Amino-terminal sequencing of p13 revealed two bands, one equivalent to the carboxyl-terminal p13 (Trp), and the other to the combination of p8 (Trp) and p6 (Trp) fragments (Table I). Table I also shows that the first 30-40 amino acid residues at the amino terminus are not folded into a protease-resistant structure, because the region was hypersensitive to all the tested proteases, including trypsin, endoLys-C, and endoArg-C. Although MPG had cleavage sites for V8 and endoAsp-N, only ∼25 residues were released from the amino terminus when these enzymes were used under nondenaturing conditions, at a level 10-fold higher than that of the other proteases (Fig. 2). This observation suggests that these protease sites are located within the tightly folded domains. Taken together, these results lead to the model that the MPG polypeptide is organized in three tightly folded, protease-resistant domains linked by protease-sensitive hinge regions, and has a protease-sensitive amino-terminal region.Table I.N-terminal sequences of MPG fragmentsProteolytic fragmentFragment primary structureYield at Cycle 1Measured N-terminal sequence and locationC terminusaThe C terminus was defined by the enzyme specificity and approximate fragment size on SDS-PAGE.pmolA.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Production of domain fragments produced by digestion of MPG with endoproteinase Glu-C (panel A) and endoAsp-N (panel B) (E/S = 1/50). Products were analyzed as for Fig. 1. The markers were midrange (14.0-94 kDa) molecular mass proteins from Bio-Rad.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The unstructured region at the amino terminus of the truncated MPG consists of nearly 40 amino acid residues. The p8 domain starts at residue 93, the center domain (p6) at residue 166, and the carboxyl-terminal domain (p13) includes the region beyond residue 223 (Fig. 3). As a DNA glycosylase specific for certain modified bases, MPG should have at least three broad functions: binding to nontarget DNA, recognizing a damaged base (substrate), and finally, catalyzing cleavage of the DNA glycosyl bond. In order to determine whether the ability to bind nontarget DNA is localized in a specific domain, we performed affinity chromatography on single-stranded DNA-cellulose of the domain fragments generated by endoArg-C digestion (Fig. 4). The p5 did not bind to DNA, while p13 fragments were co-eluted at 150 mM NaCl. The largest fragment, p29, was eluted at 300 mM NaCl. The transient p20 fragment, (consisting of domains p5, p8 and p6) was eluted at 200 mM NaCl. Although not shown here, the individual domains produced in a trypsin digest (p8, p6, and p13) did not bind to DNA at 100 mM NaCl. However, a transient fragment, p20 (consisting of domains p6 and p13), was retained on the column and eluted at 200-250 mM NaCl. The NaCl concentration required for elution reflects the strength of nonspecific DNA binding by the protein fragments. Fig. 5 summarizes the results from DNA-cellulose affinity chromatography, indicating that p6, derived from both the p20 fragments, appears to be the common denominator in binding to nontarget DNA; however, another domain, from either the amino or carboxyl terminus, appears to be needed to anchor nontarget DNA. In order to elucidate the involvement of individual domains in damage recognition, we determined protease sensitivity of the enzyme bound to the substrate. Fig. 6 shows the results of protease protection experiments with MPG·DNA complexes. The transiently formed fragment p20 (lanes 1-3), became stable to trypsin treatment in the presence of duplex control DNA (lanes 4-6). More interestingly, in the presence of substrate DNA, a larger transient fragment, p29, was also stable for up to 60 min of digestion (lanes 7-9). This result indicates that the binding of nonspecific DNA protects a cleavage site in p20, which consists of domains p6 and p13. The substrate DNA induces protection of an additional domain (p8) in the p29 fragment. This difference implies that specific and nonspecific DNA binding do not induce identical structural perturbation, as judged by changes in patterns of proteolytic digestion. Our results, including those obtained from the DNA-cellulose column binding assay, also indicate that p20 (consisting of p6 and p13 domains) is necessary for nontarget DNA binding, while the p8 domain in the p29 fragment is necessary for recognition of the substrate. Single-stranded substrate DNA was also able to protect MPG from protease digestion, but to a lesser extent than the duplex DNA (Fig. 6, last panel); the difference may be due to reduced affinity of the enzyme for single-stranded DNA. We may point out in this context that MPG removes N-methylpurines from single-stranded DNA at a rate 3-4-fold lower than from duplex DNA. 3R. Roy and S. Mitra, unpublished observation. The difference in the protease resistance patterns of protein complexed with nonspecific DNA versus substrate DNA (Fig. 6) may indicate 1) a rigid body movement of domains in response to DNA binding, 2) DNA-induced changes in the secondary or tertiary structure of individual domains, or 3) a combination of both possibilities. Three types of experiments: chemical cross-linking, UV CD spectroscopy, and kinetics of thiol exchange reaction with DTNB, were performed to asses any conformational change. We reasoned that any conformational change within the protein during recognition of substrate DNA, may alter the interdomain distances. In order to test this hypothesis, we used a thiol-cleavable homobifunctional protein cross-linker, DTSSP, which can cross-link reactive amino groups up to 12 Å apart. Thus domains with primary amino groups oriented such that they are closer than 12 Å will be cross-linked, and the bond can be cleaved by a reducing agent such as β-mercaptoethanol. Incubating MPG with DTSSP for up to 2 h did not yield any higher molecular weight products, and the protein remained mostly in the monomeric form (Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 5). Because the DNA-protein complex was resistant to trypsin, we digested cross-linked MPG or (cross-linked) DNA-bound MPG with endoproteinase Glu-C (V8) under mild denaturing conditions (0.1% SDS) for 1 h. After digestion of MPG alone with V8, four fragments (designated as B, B*, C, and D) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7A, lane 2). The amino-terminal sequences showed that the V8 protease cleaves MPG at the carboxyl end of the glutamic acids at positions 145 and 265 (generating fragment B), at 153 and 265 (forming B*), at 52 and 145 (forming C), and at 265, forming fragment D (residues 265-333; Fig. 7C). The presence of cross-linker generated a new set of bands (A1-A3) after V8 treatment in the absence of DNA (Fig. 7A, lanes 3 and 4), their amino-terminal sequences showed that A1, A2 and A3 started from Glu145, Glu153, and Glu52, respectively (Fig. 7C). Thus, “A” consists of fragments C and B (Fig. 7D). The fragment sizes were different due to the availability of V8 cleavage sites. However, fragments “C,”“B,” and “D” corresponded to domains p8, p6, and p13, respectively. After treatment with β-mercaptoethanol the bands in group “A” disappeared, generating B, B*, C, D, and a new band C* (a carboxyl-terminal truncation product of C) (Fig. 7A, lanes 7 and 8), indicating that the bands in “A” group were specifically cross-linked products, that p8 and p6 domains involved in cross-linking had to be closer than 12 Å. Furthermore, p13 domain was far enough away to prevent its being cross-linked with p8·p6 complex. The V8 digestion of MPG bound to control DNA-generated peptide fragments (Fig. 7B, lane 2) identical to those formed after digestion of MPG alone with V8 (Fig. 7A, lane 2). The p8 and p6 were again cross-linked with DTSSP in presence of control DNA (Fig. 7B, lane 1), but those domains were not cross-linked in the presence of substrate DNA (Fig. 7B, lane 3). These results suggest that the p8 and p6 domains move away from each other as a result of substrate recognition and binding. CD spectra of MPG and MPG·DNA complexes were measured. Difference CD spectra generated by subtracting the spectra of uncomplexed DNA from that of the complexes showed a small change in molar ellipticity in the region of 230-280 nm (data not shown). Regardless of the nature of DNA, nonspecific or substrate, the spectra of complexes were not additives of uncomplexed protein and DNA. These results imply that the DNA and/or protein structures were perturbed as a consequence of complex formation; because both DNA and protein could contribute to the spectral changes in the region of 230-280 nm, no attempts were made to dissect the respective contributions to the observed spectral changes. Nevertheless, the changes around 240-260 nm could be consequence of perturbation in cysteine or cysteine environments. Thus, we directly tested the effect of DNA binding on the accessibility of cysteines in MPG by measuring the rate of the thiol-exchange reaction with DTNB (Ellman's reagent). The 31-kDa protein has 5 cysteine residues, 2 in the p6 and 3 in the p13 domain. These residues were much less reactive when the protein was bound to substrate DNA than they were in the free protein or in the presence of control DNA. Fig. 8 shows that the pseudo-first order rate of the reaction was about 5-fold lower in the presence of substrate DNA (t1/2 = 24.8 min) than that of the protein in the presence of control DNA (t1/2 = 5.0 min). The rate of reaction of the protein (t1/2 = 2.0 min) in the absence of any DNA was about 2.5 times faster (t1/2 = 5.0 min) than that in the presence of control DNA. To identify the domain containing the catalytic site, we separately digested MPG with endoprotease Arg-C for 5 min and trypsin for 15 min and attempted to separate the resulting fragments on different chromatographic and affinity columns. Endoprotease Arg-C-digested MPG was resolved on a single-stranded DNA-cellulose affinity column into p5 (the amino-terminal unstructured region), a p14/p13 mixture, p20 (a combination of p5, p8, and p6), and p29 (the intact protein without p5). Analysis of the enzymatic activity of these fragments showed that p5 was inactive. However, p29, generated after loss of p5, retained activity comparable to that of intact MPG. None of the individual domains or the transient fragments had any activity. However, a purified mixture of p14 (a combination of p8 and p6) and p13 retained about 8% of the original activity (Table II). It is not clear whether this residual activity was due to the presence of a small amount of undegraded enzyme in the column eluate, or to an intrinsic ability of noncovalently linked fragments to carry out catalysis. That fragments p14 and p13 could not be separated from each other by either ion exchange chromatography (Mono Q and Mono S) or chromatofocusing (Mono P) suggested strong association under nondenaturing conditions. We hope to resolve this issue by assaying enzyme activity of a mixture of p13 and p14 recombinant polypeptides individually overexpressed in E. coli.Table IIN-Methylpurine-DNA glycosylase activity of proteolytic fragmentsN-Methylpurine-DNA glycosylase or fragmentProduction methodSpecific activity(fmol/min/mg protein) × 104Intact MPG3.4p29, p20, p13, and p5 (not resolved)EndoArg-C, in situ1.07p31EndoAsp-N3.0p29EndoArg-C3.1p20EndoArg-C<0.003p20Trypsin<0.002p14 (residues 92-221) and p13 (residues 222-333)EndoArg-C0.23p5EndoArg-C<0.001 Open table in a new tab DNA glycosylases act in the first step of the base excision repair pathway and constitute an important class of enzymes because they are responsible for removal of modified bases from DNA. Among these enzymes, uracil-DNA glycosylases have been extensively studied, and the structures of the human and herpesvirus-coded uracil-DNA glycosylases enzymes have recently been elucidated by x-ray crystallographic analysis (51Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Alseth I. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 869-878Google Scholar, 52Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-490Google Scholar). The MPGs are also critical DNA glycosylases because they are involved in repair of many spontaneous and induced base lesions in DNA. Mammalian MPGs do not share significant sequence homology with the E. coli MPGs, yet both recognize many common substrates that differ widely in their structural features. These unusual enzymatic properties set the MPGs apart from uracil-DNA glycosylases and other DNA glycosylases that are specific for a single substrate, and raise the possibility that MPGs possess unusual structural features. The three-dimensional structures of MPGs have yet to be elucidated, and the amino acid residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis have not been identified. As a first approach to these issues, we asked whether the MPG polypeptide is organized in substructures or domains, and if so, how these interact in substrate recognition. Our results indicate that the mouse MPG has three well defined, non-overlapping globular regions arranged in a linear array of p8-p6-p13 domains, in addition to a protease-sensitive region at the amino terminus. “Exon shuffling” has been proposed as being responsible for diversification of protein sequences during evolution (53Gilbert W. Glynias M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 135: 137-144Google Scholar). Because domains are analogous to modules with discrete structures of their own, we examined whether the MPG domains are coded by distinct exons in its gene. However, comparison of the exon boundaries with the coding sequence defining the domain boundaries does not show equivalence (Fig. 9). This result suggests that the domains of MPG did not evolve as independent modules. The contributions of the distinct domains to nonspecific DNA binding, substrate lesion recognition, and glycosyl bond cleavage have been analyzed by deletion mutagenesis and by examining the role of specific domains in these activities. We have already shown that up to 100 and 18 amino acid residues can be removed from the amino and carboxyl terminus of the full-length MPG, respectively, without loss of activity.2 Examination of the domain boundaries in this protein indicates that not only is the loosely structured amino terminus dispensable for enzyme activity, but also that 8 residues of the p8 domain and up to 18 residues of the p13 domain are not required for glycosylase activity. However, further deletion of additional residues from both termini resulted in a loss of activity, but did not reduce the binding of substrate DNA. The substrate DNA binding activity was retained in truncated proteins with deletion of 65 residues from the carboxyl terminus of the p13 domain. At the same time, this activity was lost when 23 or more residues were deleted from the amino terminus of the p8 domain. Our results suggest that the domains' structural integrity, which should be essential for catalysis, is preserved despite partial truncation. The inhibition of the cleavage of interdomain hinge regions in the presence of DNA suggests that p6, in combination with p13, binds DNA nonspecifically as a prerequisite to specific DNA binding. Furthermore, specific binding to the damaged base requires interaction of all three domains. Studies of protein cross-linking suggest movement of the p8 domain away from or toward the p13·p6 complex in the presence or absence of substrate DNA, respectively. Finally, sequestration of cysteine residues (present in the p13·p6 complex in the protein) from the thiol exchange reaction supports the possibility of induced change in the domains' conformations as a result of substrate binding. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model proposed for conformational change of MPG during its binding to control and substrate DNA (Fig. 10). In the absence of DNA, the p8 and p6 domains are in close proximity to each other, with the p13 domain somewhat removed in space. In the presence of nonspecific DNA, p6 binds to DNA, with additional interaction by the p13 domain. When DNA containing a substrate lesion is available, p8 moves away from p6, with a significant change in overall conformation of the protein. However, all three domains appear to be involved in binding substrate DNA. Although our experiments have not directly addressed the question of how the same enzyme recognizes distinct substrate lesions in DNA with widely different structures, it is reasonable to expect that the three domains can interact among themselves in subtly different ways in order to allow “induced fit” of the substrates. This intrinsic structural flexibility may contrast MPGs from uracil-DNA glycosylases, which has a rigid recognition pocket for uracil, its only substrate (51Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B.

https://openalex.org/W2045851668,"Final extents of fusion of influenza virus (A/PR/8/34 strain) with neutral and partially acidic liposomes were monitored with (i) a fluorescence resonance energy-transfer assay in which the liposomes were labeled and (ii) by the dequenching of octadecylrhodamine, initially incorporated in the viral membrane. The latter assay was also employed in the fusion of influenza virus and Sendai virus with erythrocyte ghosts. In all cases, a phenomenon of partial fusion activity of the virus was observed, which is distinct from low pH inactivation. The unfused influenza or Sendai virions, which were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation from liposomes or erythrocyte ghosts exhibited again partial fusion activity toward freshly added liposomes or ghosts, respectively. The conclusion is that the fraction of initially bound and unfused virions does not consist of defective particles, but rather of particles bound to the target membranes via inactive sites on the virus (or on cellular membranes), or else, partial fusion activity is a manifestation of a certain probability of production of fusion inactive sites by irreversible association of viral glycoproteins or peptides in the target membrane. Final extents of fusion of influenza virus (A/PR/8/34 strain) with neutral and partially acidic liposomes were monitored with (i) a fluorescence resonance energy-transfer assay in which the liposomes were labeled and (ii) by the dequenching of octadecylrhodamine, initially incorporated in the viral membrane. The latter assay was also employed in the fusion of influenza virus and Sendai virus with erythrocyte ghosts. In all cases, a phenomenon of partial fusion activity of the virus was observed, which is distinct from low pH inactivation. The unfused influenza or Sendai virions, which were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation from liposomes or erythrocyte ghosts exhibited again partial fusion activity toward freshly added liposomes or ghosts, respectively. The conclusion is that the fraction of initially bound and unfused virions does not consist of defective particles, but rather of particles bound to the target membranes via inactive sites on the virus (or on cellular membranes), or else, partial fusion activity is a manifestation of a certain probability of production of fusion inactive sites by irreversible association of viral glycoproteins or peptides in the target membrane. INTRODUCTIONAnalysis of final extents of virus-liposome fusion demonstrates that all three viruses studied, influenza virus (1Nir S. Stegmann T. Wilschut J.

Acta. 1993; 1147: 223-236Google Scholar), exhibit partial fusion activity toward liposomes of certain compositions, e.g. in certain cases only 20-40% of the virions fuse. For influenza virus and Sendai virus fusing with cells, the results in several cases indicate complete fusion activity, i.e. close to 100% of the virus particles can fuse with erythrocyte ghosts and with several suspension cells, provided that the number of virions per cell does not exceed a certain limit of the order of tens to hundreds, depending on the size and composition of the cellular membranes (3Nir S.

Nir S. Turco S.J. Flanagan T.D. Epand R.M Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4676-4683Google Scholar) do indicate incomplete fusion activity of these viruses with cellular membranes. Furthermore, in the case of several immunodeficiency viruses, such as HIV-1, only a small fraction of the virions fuse with the cellular target membranes (8Larsen C.E. Nir S. Alford D.R. Jennings M. Lee K.-D. Duzgunes N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 223-236Google Scholar, 16Stamatatos L. Duzgunes N. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 74: 1043-1054Google Scholar).In the current study, we first present details of the mechanisms of partial fusion activity of influenza virus toward liposomes. At pH 5 and 37°C, influenza virus exhibits 100% fusion activity toward the acidic liposomes PS and cardiolipin, whereas only 20-40% of the virions are capable of fusing with liposomes composed of PC/PE with or without cholesterol and gangliosides (2Nir S. Stegmann T. Hoekstra D. Wilschut J. Ohki S. Doyle D. Flanagan T.D. Hui S.W. Mayhew E. Molecular Mechanisms of Membrane Fusion. Plenum Press, New York1988: 451Google Scholar, 4Stegmann T. Nir S. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1698-1704Google Scholar). The phenomenon of partial fusion activity should not be confused with low pH inactivation of fusion activity that has been observed in the case of influenza virus (3Nir S. Duzgunes N. Lima M.C.P. Hoekstra D. Cell Biophys. 1990; 17: 181-201Google Scholar, 4Stegmann T. Nir S. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1698-1704Google Scholar, 13Duzgunes N. Lima M.C.P. Stamatatos L. Flasher D.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1977-1987Google Scholar). Thus, the reduction in the fusion rate constant upon exposure of influenza virus to low pH is similar when the target membrane of a liposome is composed of PS or PC/PE/cholesterol with or without gangliosides, but the final extents of fusion are 100% and 20-40%, respectively (4Stegmann T. Nir S. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1698-1704Google Scholar). Furthermore, at neutral pH, Sendai virus and HIV-1 are not inactivated but they exhibit partial fusion activity toward liposomes. Following a previously described procedure (22Haywood A.M. Boyer B.P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6041-6046Google Scholar), results with Sendai virus fusing with liposomes 2S. Nir, K. Klappe, H. Hoff, and D. Hoekstra, unpublished data. (3Nir S. Duzgunes N. Lima M.C.P. Hoekstra D. Cell Biophys. 1990; 17: 181-201Google Scholar), indicated that bound, unfused virions can be released by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The separated unfused virions subsequently fused when incubated with a “fresh” batch of liposomes. Hence, the fraction of initially bound unfused Sendai virions does not consist of defective particles, but rather of particles bound to liposomes via “inactive” sites.In the current study, we also looked at the effect of temperature on the final extents of fusion of Sendai virus and influenza virus with liposomes and erythrocyte ghosts. Interestingly, in most cases, the fraction of fusing virions increased with temperature, despite the accelerated inactivation of influenza virus at higher temperatures.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPC, PS, and PE were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Cholesterol and gangliosides were from Sigma, C12E8 was from Calbiochem, R18, NBD-PE and Rh-PE were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR).MethodsVirus PreparationsInfluenza virus, A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) strain, was obtained from SPAFAS Inc. (Preston, CT). The virus was grown for 48 h at 37°C in the allantoic cavity of 11-day-old embryonated eggs, purified by discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation and stored at −70°C in phosphate-buffered saline. Sendai virus (hemagglutinating virus of Japan) Z strain was obtained from SPAFAS Inc. (Preston, CT). The virus was grown for 72 h in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated eggs, purified by differential centrifugation, and stored at −70°C in phosphate-buffered saline.Liposome PreparationLarge unilamellar lipid vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by the reverse phase evaporation method in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, as described (23Szoka F.Jr. Papahadjopoulos D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioenerg. 1980; 9: 467-508Google Scholar). The vesicles were sized through 0.1-μm polycarbonate filters, and their concentration was determined by a phosphate assay. For the RET assay (24Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Google Scholar), LUVs were prepared with 0.6 mol% of both NBD-PE and Rh-PE incorporated in the lipid membrane.Virus LabelingViral preparations were labeled with octadecylrhodamine B chloride as described previously (25Hoekstra D. DeBoer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar, 26Hoekstra D. Klappe K. DeBoer T. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4739-4745Google Scholar). The final self-quenching concentration of added probe corresponded to approximately 5 mol% of total viral lipid and that of ethanol was less than 1% (v/v). The mixture was incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. R18-labeled virus was separated from noninserted fluorophore by chromatography on Sephadex G-75 (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) using 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, as elution buffer. The protein concentration of the labeled virus was determined by the Lowry assay.Experiments with LiposomesWith the R18 assay fusion between labeled influenza virus particles (10 μg/ml viral protein) and unlabeled LUVs (25 μM) was monitored continuously by the relief of R18 fluorescence self-quenching (25Hoekstra D. DeBoer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar, 26Hoekstra D. Klappe K. DeBoer T. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4739-4745Google Scholar). Excitation was set at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm. With the RET assay, fusion between unlabeled influenza virus (20 μg/ml) and NBD/Rh-labeled (0.6 mol% each) lipid vesicles (5 μM) was followed by an increase of NBD fluorescence with 465 nm and 530 nm set in the excitation and emission monochromators, respectively (24Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Google Scholar).The final incubation volume was always 1.5 ml in 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM sodium acetate, 5 mM Mes, 5 mM Hepes buffer. Following an initial 15-min incubation at pH 7.4, the virus-liposome suspension was acidified to pH 5.0, and fusion was monitored for the times and at the temperatures indicated below. The fluorescence scales were calibrated, such that the initial fluorescence of virus-liposome mixtures was set at 0% fluorescence. The value obtained by detergent lysis after each experiment was set at 100% fluorescence. With the R18 assay, Triton X-100, at a final concentration of 1% (v/v), was used. In the case of the RET assay, final fluorescence levels were obtained with C12E8 (1 mM).All fluorescence measurements were performed in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 luminescence spectrometer or in a SPEX Fluorolog spectrofluorimeter. The sample chamber was equipped with a magnetic stirring device, and the temperature was controlled with a thermostatted circulating water bath.Separation of Unfused Virus Particles and Second Round Fusion ExperimentsIn “second round” fusion experiments, both assays were carried out as described above. However, following the appropriate times for fusion at different temperatures and at pH 5.0, the mixtures were then neutralized and overlaid on discontinuous sucrose density gradients. Gradients were then centrifuged at 250,000 × g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge to recover unfused virus particles from the gradient and thus separate them from LUVs and fusion products. Recovered virus particles were diluted in experimental buffer and their fusion activity toward LUVs of fresh batches was assayed using the same procedure (i.e. same liposome concentrations) as in the “first round,” only in this case with a final addition of detergent. Control experiments showed that the use of virus concentrations below 10 μg/ml viral protein did not affect the final extent of fluorescence increases in the application of the R18 assay.Experiments with Erythrocyte GhostsHuman erythrocyte ghosts were prepared as described (27Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Google Scholar). Fusion activity of Sendai virus and influenza virus toward erythrocyte ghosts was monitored as a function of R18 dequenching, as in the case of the experiments using LUVs as target membranes. The experimental temperatures and respective times of incubation are mentioned under “Results.” In all experiments, the concentration of viral protein in the first round was 2.5 μg/ml and that of erythrocyte ghost protein was 10 μg/ml. While Sendai virus fuses immediately at neutral pH, influenza virus was always allowed to bind to the target membranes for 15 min at pH 7.4, after which the medium was acidified to pH 5.In first round experiments, an initial fluorescence reading (F0) was taken before the onset of fusion. Following the incubation times required to obtain final extent levels of fluorescence, the mixture was neutralized (in the case of influenza virus) and ghosts were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 0°C), thus removing unbound virions. Fluorescence in the resuspended pellet (bound and/or fused virus particles) was measured before (Ft) and after the addition of detergent (F∞). The percentage of fusion in this case only takes into account bound virions and was calculated according to the formula: % fusion = 100·(Ft− F02)/(F∞− F02) with F02 = F0·F∞/F∞,0 where F∞,0 corresponds to the fluorescence intensity obtained when detergent was added directly to the initial virus preparation (with fluorescence F0).In second round experiments, an initial fluorescence reading (F0) was also taken before the onset of fusion. Following final extent incubations, the mixture was neutralized (in the case of influenza virus), and ghosts were again pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was then resuspended and layered on a sucrose density gradient, and unfused virus particles were recovered by ultracentrifugation as described for LUV experiments. These recovered virions were diluted in buffer, and their (quenched) fluorescence was measured (f0). The fraction (β) of ghost protein added as a target membrane in this second round was calculated by the formula β = f0/F0 so as to maintain the same virus/ghost ratio in the second round. After mixing recovered virus with fresh ghosts, R18 dequenching was again monitored for the same time as in the first round (at neutral pH for Sendai virus; at low pH following a binding period of 15 min at pH 7.4 for influenza virus). When the incubation was concluded, ghosts were again pelleted by centrifugation and fluorescence in the resuspended pellet was measured before (ft) and after (f∞) the addition of detergent. The percentage of fusion in the second round was then calculated using the formulas mentioned above for first round experiments.RESULTSThe first aim of the experiments was to test whether virions that do not fuse with the liposomes are capable of fusing with freshly added liposomes after their separation by prolonged centrifugation in sucrose gradients. The experiments also tested the effect of temperature on partial fusion activity of influenza virus. In order to avoid a possible criticism that exchange of the R18 probe can occur, we have employed two fusion assays. In the application of the R18 assay (25Hoekstra D. DeBoer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Google Scholar, 26Hoekstra D. Klappe K. DeBoer T. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4739-4745Google Scholar), the labeled virus interacted with unlabeled liposomes in large excess. In this assay, probe dilution into liposomal membranes results in an increase in fluorescence intensity. Hence, if all the virions are capable of fusing, the increase in fluorescence intensity can approach 100% (6Nir S. Klappe K. Hoekstra D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8261-8266Google Scholar). In the application of the RET fusion assay (24Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Google Scholar) where N-NBD-PE and N-Rh-PE were incorporated in the bilayer of the liposomes, fusion of liposomes with the virus was monitored by an increase in the fluorescence intensity of NBD due to its dilution within the fusion products. According to the analysis (1Nir S. Stegmann T. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 257-266Google Scholar), the extent of fluorescence intensity increase in the application of the RET assay is limited to 50% in the presence of a large excess of virions, whereas for a suspension consisting of equal numbers of fusion-active virions and liposomes, the extent of fluorescence increase is below 40%. Consequently, we employed the R18 fusion assay in fusion experiments with PC/PE (2:1) and PC/PE/cholesterol (2:1:1) liposomes (Table I), in which cases the percents of influenza virions capable of fusing could be estimated in the range of 20-40% according to the results of 4Stegmann T. Nir S. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1698-1704Google Scholar, whereas the RET assay was used in fusion studies with PC/PE/PS/cholesterol (1:1:1:1) where the percent of fusion-active virions was larger (Table II). We have also carried out a few experiments in which both assays were employed with the same liposome compositions (Table III). The tables also provide the estimated percents of virions capable of fusing in the first round. The calculations assumed that the binding of fusion-inactive virions was essentially irreversible (6Nir S. Klappe K. Hoekstra D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8261-8266Google Scholar).Table IFinal intensity (I) levels and percents of virions fusing for influenza virus labeled by R18 interacting with excess of liposomesLiposome compositionTemperatureFirst roundTime of incubation at pH 5Second roundI (%)% fusion activityI (%)% fusion activity(°C)hPC/PE3723.5 ± 426 ± 4612.3 ± 214 ± 2(2:1)2013.5 ± 1.515 ± 1.587.4 ± 1.58.5 ± 1.5PC/PE/cholesterol (2:1:1)3724.7 ± 427 ± 4815.2 ± 217 ± 2 Open table in a new tab Table IIFinal intensity (I) levels and percents of virions fusing for influenza virus interacting with labeled liposomesLiposome compositionTemperatureFirst roundTime of incubation at pH 5Second roundI (%)% fusion activityI (%)% fusion activity(°C)PC/PE/PS/cholesterol (1:1:1:1)3720.3 ± 355 ± 515 min8.8 ± 240 ± 102024.8 ± 365 ± 51 h5.4 ± 324 ± 12424.2 ± 363 ± 57 h5.8 ± 2.525 ± 10 Open table in a new tab Table IIIFinal intensity (I) levels and percents of virions fusing for influenza virus labeled by R18 interacting with excess of liposomes: effect of the ganglioside GD1aLiposome compositionTemperatureFirst roundTime of incubation at pH 5Second roundI (%)% fusion activityI (%)% fusion activity(°C)PC/PE378.8 ± 215 min34.6 ± 338.5 ± 36 hPC/PE/GD1a3726.9 ± 4.515 min54 ± 560 ± 56 h—a59.1 ± 265.7 ± 36 h3734.5 ± 415 min26.2 ± 228.5 ± 255 ± 461 ± 46 h31.2 ± 234 ± 22050.4 ± 155 ± 11 h22 ± 324 ± 362 ± 169 ± 18 h28.1 ± 331 ± 3—a66 ± 3.573.1 ± 48 h447.9 ± 153.5 ± 17 h54.5 ± 260.5 ± 224 h(RET)37b24 ± 260.2 ± 56 h20b28.2 ± 2.870.8 ± 78 h Open table in a new tab a,b These cases employed another batch of virus for a comparison between the results with the R18 assay (a) and the RET assay (b). See Table II for details.Tables I and II show that at 37°C influenza virus exhibits partial fusion activity toward the liposomes of the compositions used, the percents of virions capable of fusing varying from 26 to 55. In all three cases, the released virions were capable of fusing with freshly added liposomes. The fractions of virions capable of fusing in the second round varied from 14 to 40%. No further increase in fluorescence intensity at 37°C was observed by prolonging significantly the incubation times beyond the indicated values. The explanation that is favored is that the virions that did not fuse in the first round happened to bind to the liposomes via sites on the viral membrane, in such a fashion that the virus could not fuse and that this binding was essentially irreversible.A comparison of the results obtained by the application of both assays (Table III) illustrates that despite the significantly smaller extents of fluorescence increase with the RET assay, the estimated percents of virions capable of fusing in the first fusion round were similar, albeit somewhat larger with the R18 assay. This difference is indicative of a small degree of probe exchange with the R18 assay, but the trend is similar. It should be recalled that the lipid concentration of the liposomes was about 10-fold larger than that of the virions. The RET assay is less suitable for monitoring the percent of virus fusion in the second round due to a reduction in (unlabeled) virus concentrations. The calculated percents of second round fusion with the RET assay are probably underestimated.Next we studied the effect of temperature on the percents of virions capable of fusing in the first and second rounds. To account for the slower kinetics of fusion at lower temperatures, we extended the incubation times at the lower temperatures. The fractions of virions which fused with PC/PE liposomes at lower temperatures were less than those at 37°C, whereas for PC/PE/PS/cholesterol liposomes an apparent maximum was observed at 20°C, but statistically it was not significant. In all cases, a fraction of the released virions fused in the second round.It was of interest to examine whether partial fusion activity of influenza virus also occurs toward liposomes which include receptors for the virus, e.g. gangliosides (28Weis W. Brown J.H. Cusack S. Paulson J.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1988; 333: 426-431Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, we illustrate the kinetics of fusion of influenza virus with PC/PE liposomes containing 5 mol% of the ganglioside GD1a. At 37°C, the initial rate of fusion is faster than at 20°C, but after 2 min the extent of fusion at 20°C exceeds that at 37°C. This pattern is similar to earlier observations (20Stegmann T. White J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4231-4241Google Scholar) and is explained by the fact that both fusion and inactivation rate constants increase with temperature (3Nir S. Duzgunes N. Lima M.C.P. Hoekstra D. Cell Biophys. 1990; 17: 181-201Google Scholar, 13Duzgunes N. Lima M.C.P. Stamatatos L. Flasher D. Friend D.S. Nir S. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 27-37Google Scholar, 14Ramalho-Santos J. Nir S. Duzgunes N. Carvalho A.P. Lima M.C.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2771-2779Google Scholar). The final extents of fusion (Table III) demonstrate partial fusion activity of the virus toward PC/PE/GD1a liposomes and the ability of the unfused virus to fuse when released after a long incubation time with the liposomes at pH 5.The effect of temperature on the final extents of fusion of Sendai virus and influenza virus with erythrocyte ghosts is shown in Tables IVand V, respectively. In both cases, a decrease in temperature results in a significant decrease in final extents of fusion.Table IVFinal extents of fusion of Sendai virus with erythrocyte ghosts: effect of temperature on percent of virus fusionTemperatureFirst roundSecond round37°C65.1 ± 3.931.1 ± 4.615°C42.8 ± 4.219.3 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Table V.Final extents of fusion of influenza virus with erythrocyte ghosts: effect of temperature on percent of virus fusionTemperatureFirst roundSecond round37°C63.4 ± 3.617.1 ± 520°C36.6 ± 16.1 ± 315°C20.1 ± 2.5NDaND, not determined.37°C (batch 2)58.8 ± 437°C (batch 2)39.2 ± 3.2(2-fold dilution of virions and cells)a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In both cases, the release of bound virus (after 20 h of incubation) resulted in its partial fusion activity toward erythrocyte ghosts, albeit reduced relative to the first round. It should be noted that the final extents of fusion in the second round (Table IV andTable V) are underestimates, since the concentrations of particles were smaller, while keeping the ratios the same as in the first round. Control experiments (see Table V) demonstrate that lower particle concentrations result in smaller extents of fluorescence increase.We performed another test for the hypothesis that a fraction of the virions bind in nonfusing conformations to the target membranes. In this test we used PC/PE/GD1a liposomes. Following a 6-h incubation at pH 5 and 37°C, where the extent of fluorescence reached equilibration, new R18-labeled virions were added to the medium (same amount as in the beginning of the experiment). We observed dequenching due to the freshly added virus (29.8%± 5.8% after another 6 h). Addition of labeled virions to erythrocyte ghosts after 20 h also resulted in dequenching, 22%± 3.8 with influenza virus and 17.7%± 4.9 with Sendai virus. This result also rules out the possibility that the target membranes were inactivated by the incorporation of fusion-inhibiting molecules.DISCUSSIONThe phenomenon of partial fusion activity of viruses toward certain target membranes is distinct from the phenomenon of low pH inactivation. We have pointed out that Sendai virus (3Nir S. Duzgunes N. Lima M.C.P. Hoekstra D. Cell Biophys. 1990; 17: 181-201Google Scholar, 5Amselem S. Barenholz Y. Loyter A. Nir S. Lichtenberg D. Biochim.

In the case of influenza virus, low pH inactivation did reduce the final extents of fusion with liposomes of a variety of compositions, but 100% of the inactivated virions fused with PS liposomes albeit at a very slow rate (4Stegmann T. Nir S. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1698-1704Google Scholar). It is remarkable that the virus released from the liposomes after long incubation at pH 5 could still fuse in the second round, but the fractions of virions that could fuse in the second round were 2/3 to 1/3 of those fusing in the first round. In the case of Sendai virus (3Nir S. Duzgunes N. Lima M.C.P. Hoekstra D. Cell Biophys. 1990; 17: 181-201Google Scholar), the corresponding reduction was 5/6 to 2/3. Thus, most of the reduction in the percent of fusion-active influenza virions is due to low pH inactivation, and part might be due to the loss of activity resulting during the sequence of binding and release that might have impaired the structure and function of viral glycoproteins.In experiments with erythrocyte ghosts, the fractions of Sendai and influenza virions that could fuse in the second round were about 1/2 and 1/6 to 1/4, respectively. Again, the reduced fraction in the case of influenza virus might be largely due to low pH inactivation and partly due to dilution of particle concentrations in the second round.Our experiments eliminate the possible explanation for partial fusion activity that the virus preparation is heterogeneous, in the sense that a certain fraction of the virions cannot induce membrane destabilization of membranes of certain compositions, although binding can occur. The experiments demonstrate that the virions that did not fuse in the first round are not necessarily incapable of fusing, since upon their release a certain fraction can fuse. Thus we tend to accept the proposal that partial fusion activity is a manifestation of heterogeneity at the viral surface. It has been formulated (3Nir S. Duzgunes N. Lima M.C.P. Hoekstra D. Cell Biophys. 1990; 17: 181-201Google Scholar) that if virus binding to a liposome does not occur at an “activ"
https://openalex.org/W2058248230,"Abstract We have isolated suppressors (tsr1 to tsr5) of the thermosensitive growth of the scr2.II-13 mutation, which affects the stability of the signal recognition particle. The growth of these mutants is largely affected in the SCR2 context at 34°C. We have studied the synthesis and secretion of an alkaline extracellular protease (AEP) in both wild-type and tsr1-1(SCR2+) thermosensitive mutant strains. Pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation of this protein showed that the level of AEP precursors in the tsr1-1(SCR2+) strain is 70% less than in the wild-type strain under conditions where the global protein synthesis is practically unaffected. This defect was observed as early as 10 min after the shift to nonpermissive temperature. In neither strain was there any effect on the kinetics of secretion, and no cytoplasmic accumulation was detected. We have cloned the TSR1 gene by complementing the thermosensitive phenotype of a tsr1-1(SCR2+) mutant. Analysis of the TSR1 DNA sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1383 base pairs, encoding a serine-rich protein of 461 amino acids with an amino-terminal signal peptide, and a membrane-spanning domain of 20 amino acids that could act as a stop transfer signal to ensure membrane localization of Tsr1p. Two homologues of the TSR1 gene were identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YHC8) and Hansenula polymorpha (YLU2). Disruption of the TSR1 gene revealed that it is an essential single-copy gene. The TSR1 gene encodes a single mRNA of 1.5 kilobase pairs. The study of the synthesis and secretion of AEP in the complemented tsr1-1(SCR2+,TSR1+) strain revealed that the TSR1 gene ensures complete recovery of the synthesis defect and thus could encode an important component of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane involved in the early steps of the signal recognition particle-dependent translocation pathway."

D419N-prothrombin was converted to the related molecules D419N-meizothrombin and D419N-thrombin by limited proteolysis by Echis carinatus and Oxyuranus scutellatus venom protease, respectively, and affinity-purified using an immobilized modified C-terminal hirudin-derived peptide.

Thus, both D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin combine for the first time hirudin-neutralizing properties with the advantages of recombinant production of human coagulation factors. Hirudin, the 65-residue peptide anticoagulant from the salivary gland of the European leech Hirudo medicinalis, is the most specific and most effective inhibitor of the blood protease thrombin (1Markwardt F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 141-152Google Scholar, 2Markwardt F. Haemostasis. 1991; 21: 11-26Google Scholar). The hirudin-thrombin complex has a very low equilibrium dissociation constant in the femtomolar range. From this complex, hirudin may only be liberated by heat denaturation of thrombin (3Markwardt F. Walsmann P. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1958; 312: 85-98Google Scholar). Thrombin (coagulation factor IIa) is the activation product of prothrombin (coagulation factor II) that initiates the final stages of blood coagulation. It is a serine protease that cleaves the fibrinogen molecule into fibrin monomers and activates coagulation factor XIII, which then catalyses fibrin cross-linking reactions. Thrombin also controls other reactions in the blood clotting system by a feedback mechanism and is a highly potent stimulant of platelets (4Lundblad R.L. Fenton J.W. Mann K.G. Chemistry and Biology of Thrombin. Ann Arbor Science, Ann Arbor, MI1977Google Scholar). In vivo thrombin is liberated when prothrombin is activated by factor Xa, factor V, and calcium ions (5Jackson C.M. Nemerson Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 765-811Google Scholar). Based on pharmacological and clinical profiling of recombinant hirudin, clinical indications such as surgical anticoagulation, medical anticoagulation, adjunctive administration with thrombolytic agents, anticoagulation during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, postoperative thrombosis prophylaxis, prevention of rethrombosis, microvascular surgery, and anticoagulant in hemodialysis and extracorporeal circulation are explored (6Markwardt F. Thromb. Res. 1994; 74: 1-23Google Scholar, 7Fareed J. Walenga J. Hoppensteadt D. Iyser L. Piffarre R. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1991; 17: 137-144Google Scholar, 8Bichler J. Fritz H. Ann. Hematol. 1991; 63: 67-76Google Scholar). A main concern in the use of such potent and specific thrombin inhibitors is the risk of bleeding associated with the potential effect of this drug on hemostasis, particularly when the therapy is combined with invasive procedures, fibrinolytic treatment, or the predisposition of the patient to abnormal bleeding (1Markwardt F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 141-152Google Scholar, 6Markwardt F. Thromb. Res. 1994; 74: 1-23Google Scholar, 7Fareed J. Walenga J. Hoppensteadt D. Iyser L. Piffarre R. Semin. Thromb.

Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 165-177Google Scholar). Thus, availability of an antagonist to hirudin would be essential for instant neutralization of the antithrombotic action. However, such a hirudin antagonist is unavailable at this time. A hirudin-neutralizing agent should exhibit the following properties: 1) it should bind to hirudin as strong as thrombin; 2) the agent should not produce immune or allergic reactions; 3) it should be well tolerated in vivo be inert to the coagulation and fibrinolytic system. In this report, we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization of two derivatives of human prothrombin, D419N-thrombin 1The abbreviations used are: D419N-thrombinrecombinant thrombin with Asp419 replaced by Asnr-prothrombinrecombinant prothrombinr-thrombinrecombinant thrombinD419N-prothrombinrecombinant prothrombin with Asp419 replaced by AsnD419N-meizothrombinrecombinant meizothrombin with Asp419 replaced by AsnFIIcoagulation factor IIr-hirudinrecombinant hirudinAcOH·HD-CHG-Ala-Arg-pNAD-cyclohexylglycyl-alanyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydroacetate. and D419N-meizothrombin. Neither D419N-thrombin nor D419N-meizothrombin exhibited thrombin activity but did bind and neutralize hirudin in both the purified system and in human plasma. Characterization of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin in an animal model showed that both recombinant derivatives neutralized hirudin in the circulation, thus providing evidence on the safe and effective antagonism of hirudin in vivo. recombinant thrombin with Asp419 replaced by Asn recombinant prothrombin recombinant thrombin recombinant prothrombin with Asp419 replaced by Asn recombinant meizothrombin with Asp419 replaced by Asn coagulation factor II recombinant hirudin D-cyclohexylglycyl-alanyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydroacetate.

The expression vectors used in this study essentially are based on pSVβ (11MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2356Google Scholar). From pSVβ, β-galactosidase insert and polylinker sequence were removed, and a new multiple cloning site was inserted upstream of the intron. Into the resulting plasmid, FII cDNA from pTMemc-PT2, which represents pTM3 (12Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Google Scholar) with a FII cDNA insert from pTKgpt-PTHBβ (13Falkner F.G. Turecek P.L. MacGillivray R.T.A. Bodemer W. Scheiflinger F. Kandels S. Mitterer A. Kistner O. Barret N. Eibl J. Dorner F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 119-124Google Scholar), was inserted yielding wild-type FII expression vector pSV-FII. The D419N mutant was constructed via polymerase chain reaction. The EcoRV/DraIII fragment from pSV-FII was substituted for a corresponding fragment introducing the D419N mutant via a primer mismatch yielding FII mutant expression vector pSV-FII D419N (Fig. 1). All cloning steps were verified by sequencing. Dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (14Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4220Google Scholar) were cotransfected with pSV-FII/pSV-dihydrofolate reductase or pSV-FII D419N/pSV-dihydrofolate reductase, respectively, essentially as described (15Graham F. Eb L. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-487Google Scholar), and stably transfected cells were selected (16Fischer B. Mitterer A. Schlokat U. DenBouwmeester R. Dorner F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 345-348Google Scholar). Highly r-prothrombin and D419N-prothrombin-expressing clones were grown in high cell perfusion fermenters under serum-free conditions. Recombinant human prothrombin and D419N-prothrombin were isolated from fermentation supernatant by combination of anion exchange chromatography and calcium ion filtration (17Fischer B. Mitterer A. Dorner F. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 38: 129-136Google Scholar). Conversion of r-prothrombin and D419N-prothrombin into r-thrombin and D419N-thrombin, respectively, and conversion of D419N-prothrombin into D419N-meizothrombin were performed by incubation of the proteins in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2 with O. scutellatus venom and E. carinatus venom at a prothrombin/venom ratio of 50:1 at room temperature for 16 h. r-Thrombin, D419N-thrombin, and D419N-meizothrombin were purified from the activation mixtures by affinity chromatography. The synthetic peptide NH2-Lys-Pro-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ser-His-Ala-Asp-Gly-Asp-Phe-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Leu-COOH was covalently bound to NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow, yielding a new affinity matrix specific for thrombin anion exobinding site. The activation mixtures were filtered through the affinity matrix and washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Bound protein was eluted with 1.2 M KSCN in Tris-HCl buffer and immediately desalted. Thrombin activity was determined photometrically by the hydrolysis of the synthetic thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate AcOH·HD-CHG-Ala-Arg-pNA at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% albumin, and a final substrate concentration of 200 μM. The release of p-nitroaniline resulting from the hydrolysis of the peptidyl p-nitroanilide substrate was followed by measuring the increase in absorbance at 410 nm. A thrombin concentration standard was used to prepare the calibration curve. Partial thromboplastin time was determined by mixing 50 μl of mouse citrate-anticoagulated plasma with 50 μl of factor II-deficient plasma and 100 μl of partial thromboplastin reagent at 37°C for 3 min. Blood coagulation was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of 25 mM CaCl2. Thrombin time was determined by mixing 50 μl of mouse citrate-anticoagulated plasma with 150 μl of coagulation factor II-deficient plasma for 1 min at 37°C. Blood coagulation was initiated by an addition of 100 μl of thrombin standard solution of 7 units ml−1. Plasma concentrations of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin were determined by adding serial plasma dilutions to immobilized r-hirudin followed by detection of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin with sheep antithrombin IgG peroxidase conjugate (18Fischer B. Mitterer A. Dorner F. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 157-162Google Scholar). Reference curves were prepared with D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin concentrations ranging from 3 ng ml−1 to 100 ng ml−1. 100 μl of r-hirudin (2 μg ml−1 in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) was coated on microtiter plates at 4°C for 16 h. Excess unbound hirudin was removed and microtiter plates were washed three times with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 ml 1−1 Tween 20 (TBS-Tween) to prevent further protein from being adsorbed onto the surface. Individual wells were first incubated with 100 μl of different concentrations of protein for 60 min and were then washed three times with TBS-Tween. 100 μl of solution of sheep anti-human thrombin IgG-peroxidase conjugate (1:2000 dilution in TBS-albumin) was applied onto each well, and microtiter plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Excess unbound conjugate was removed by washing three times with TBS-Tween. Then 100 μl of peroxidase substrate solution (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide) was added to each well and incubated for 5 min. Peroxidase reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl/well of 1 M H2SO4. Color intensity at 450 nm was measured by an automated plate reader (absorbance at 450 nm). Color intensity data were corrected for background readings. Electrophoretic analysis of proteins was performed under reducing conditions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% acrylamide slab gels using the buffer system described by Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of thrombin in its complex with hirudin showed that the COOH-terminal region of hirudin binds to the anion binding exosite of the enzyme, and the N-terminal part of hirudin binds to the thrombin active site (20Rydel T.J. Ravichandran G.K. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton J.W. Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Google Scholar). The active site of thrombin comprises Ser525, Asp419, and His363 (prothrombin numbering). The activity of thrombin is mediated by the sequential removal of a proton from the serine hydroxyl group to histidine. Positive charge histidine is then stabilized by the negative charged side group of aspartate. Both Ser525 and His363 contribute to the binding of Ile1′ of hirudin at the active center of thrombin (20Rydel T.J. Ravichandran G.K. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton J.W. Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Google Scholar). Thus, to prepare inactive thrombin but to preserve hirudin binding activity, active site aspartate at position 419 was changed to asparagine in the human prothrombin cDNA. D419N-prothrombin was then produced by high cell density perfusion fermentation of recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells. D419N-prothrombin was purified from cell supernatant by combination of anion exchange chromatography and calcium specific filtration (17Fischer B. Mitterer A. Dorner F. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 38: 129-136Google Scholar). 20 mg of purified D419N-prothrombin was isolated from 1 liter of fermentation supernatant (Fig. 2, lane a). For comparison, r-prothrombin was prepared (Fig. 2, lane b). D419N-prothrombin was then converted to D419N-meizothrombin and D419N-thrombin by limited proteolysis (Fig. 3B). 3 mg of purified D419N-meizothrombin and 1.9 mg of purified D419N-thrombin were obtained from 6 mg of D419N-prothrombin. D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin were analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. While D419N-thrombin was composed of the thrombin A- and B-chain, D419N-meizothrombin contained the thrombin B-chain and the F1/F2/A-chain. For comparison, r-prothrombin was converted to r-thrombin (Fig. 3A). Both D419N-thrombin, D419N-meizothrombin, and r-thrombin were purified from activation mixtures by affinity chromatography on a newly designed peptide matrix. A synthetic modified derivative of the C-terminal part of hirudin (amino acids 45-64) was covalently bound to Sepharose, yielding an affinity matrix with thrombin anion binding exosite specificity.Fig. 3Conversion of r-prothrombin to r-thrombin (A) and D419N-prothrombin to D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin (B). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at reducing conditions of r-prothrombin (lane a), r-thrombin (lane b), D419N-prothrombin (lane c), D419N-thrombin (lane d), and D419N-meizothrombin (lane e). Positions of molecular weight markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin were analyzed for thrombin activity. Both D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin exhibited no enzyme activity toward the thrombin-specific chromogenic peptide substrates AcOH·HD-CHG-Ala-Arg-pNA, while r-thrombin exhibited a specific activity of 98.4 nmol min−1μg−1 protein. Using p-nitrophenyl-guanidinobenzoate (21Doyle M.F. Haley P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 299-312Google Scholar), active site titration of r-thrombin resulted in 16.34 nmol mg−1 protein, but no active site was detected for D419N-thrombin and D419Nmeizothrombin. To screen whether D419N-thrombin, D419N-meizothrombin, and r-thrombin exhibit hirudin binding activity, r-hirudin was immobilized at the solid phase of microtiter plates and was incubated with different protein concentrations. D419N-meizothrombin, D419N-thrombin, and r-thrombin bound to immobilized r-hirudin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). D419N-prothrombin and r-prothrombin exhibited no hirudin binding activity. Similar to thrombin (18Fischer B. Mitterer A. Dorner F. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 157-162Google Scholar), the binding of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin to immobilized r-hirudin was inhibited by the addition of soluble r-hirudin at an equimolar concentration (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Effect of soluble r-hirudin on the binding of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin to immobilized r-hirudin. D419N-thrombin and and D419N-meizothrombin (final concentrations 3.4 nM) were mixed with various concentrations of soluble r-hirudin (final r-hirudin concentrations are indicated). Two minutes after mixing, 100-μl samples of D419N-thrombin/hirudin and D419N-meizothrombin/hirudin were applied to each well. Percent binding of D419N-thrombin (▵) and D419N-meizothrombin (+) to immobilized r-hirudin is presented in dependence on soluble r-hirudin concentration. Binding of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin to immobilized hirudin without an addition of hirudin is 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether D419N-meizothrombin and D419N-thrombin neutralize hirudin in a purified system, different concentrations of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin were mixed with a constant concentration of r-hirudin. After 1 min of incubation, remaining thrombin activity was determined spectrophotometrically (Fig. 6). Substrate hydrolysis of a thrombin solution was measured in the spectrophotometric assay. The release of p-nitroaniline was followed over a period of 15 min. r-Hirudin was added after 3 min, and inhibition of thrombin activity was reflected by the slowing of the reaction rate. After another 4 min, D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin, respectively, were added to the reaction mixtures, and the release of p-nitroaniline was followed for a period of 8 min (Fig. 7). It appears that the addition of either D419N-thrombin or D419N-meizothrombin to the thrombin-hirudin complex results in a restoration of thrombin activity. Interestingly, it took approximately 2 min for restoration of thrombin activity. Thus, both D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin bind the r-hirudin that dissociated from the thrombin-hirudin complex. After 2 min the balance between the thrombin-hirudin complex and free thrombin was shifted in favor of free thrombin, with the main portion of hirudin apparently bound to D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin, respectively. Neutralization of r-hirudin by D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin was analyzed in plasma by determination of the partial thromboplastin time. Human citrate-anticoagulated plasma was mixed with a constant amount of r-hirudin (final concentration 85 nM), partial thromboplastin reagent, and various concentrations of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin, respectively. Coagulation time was determined after the addition of calcium ions (Fig. 8). From the results it appears that neither D419N-meizothrombin nor D419N-thrombin affect the coagulation of pure human plasma. By contrast, at a low concentration of D419N-meizothrombin and D419N-thrombin, respectively, after the addition of r-hirudin the coagulation time was greatly prolonged. However, with increasing concentrations of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin, respectively, the coagulation time returns to base-line values. At final concentrations of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin of 240 nM (8.6 μg ml−1) and 90 nM (6.4 μg ml−1), respectively, coagulation time is normal (Fig. 8). The hirudin-neutralizing effects of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin were studied in mice. Three minutes after a single intravenous dose of r-hirudin at 0.5 mg/kg of body weight, D419N-thrombin (2.5 mg kg−1 body weight) and D419N-meizothrombin (5.0 mg kg−1 body weight) were injected, respectively. Mouse citrate-anticoagulated plasma was obtained and analyzed for partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and plasma concentration of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin, respectively (Table I).Table ICoagulation parameters after a single intravenous dose of r-hirudin followed by an intravenous injection of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombinParameterD419N-thrombin test groupD419N-meizothrombin test group12345678Injection time0 minSalineHirudinSalineJirudinSalineHirudinSalineHirudin3 minSalineSalineD419N-THD419N-THSalineSalineD419N-MZD419N-Mz6 minHPHPHPHPHPHPHPHPPartial thromboplastin time(s)23.842.324.026.222.438.221.021.8Thrombin time(s)11.419.811.611.711.619.311.212.0Plasma concentration001610003916 Open table in a new tab The data in Table I show that injection of r-hirudin (test groups 2 and 6) resulted in an increase in partial thromboplastin time of about 75%, an increase in thrombin time of about 60%, and no detection of thrombin in plasma. Injection of D419N-thrombin (test group 3) and D419N-meizothrombin (test group 7) alone resulted in no significant change in coagulation parameters compared to test groups 1 and 5, respectively, but detection of both proteins in mice plasma. Injection of r-hirudin followed by D419N-thrombin (test group 4) and injection of hirudin followed by D419N-meizothrombin (test group 8) resulted in the normalization of partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time. Apparently, both proteins neutralized hirudin in the circulation, thus reducing the free r-hirudin concentration. The hirudin complexed forms of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin are less reactive toward immobilized hirudin; thus lower concentrations of D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin were detected in plasma. The development of recombinant hirudin has added a new dimension to the area of therapeutic and surgical anticoagulation (2Markwardt F. Haemostasis. 1991; 21: 11-26Google Scholar, 6Markwardt F.

For cautionary reasons in case of bleeding, it would be advantageous to have available a hirudin-neutralizing agent to antagonize instantly the antithrombotic action of hirudin (1Markwardt F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 141-152Google Scholar, 6Markwardt F. Thromb. Res. 1994; 74: 1-23Google Scholar, 7Fareed J. Walenga J. Hoppensteadt D. Iyser L. Piffarre R. Semin. Thromb.

Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 165-177Google Scholar). Using D419N-prothrombin produced by industrial scale fermentation of recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells as a starting material, we have prepared, purified, and characterized two derivatives, D419N-meizothrombin and D419N-thrombin. Apart from the point mutation at amino acid position 419 and the cleavage of the peptide chain between Arg320 and Ile321, D419N-meizothrombin corresponds to prothrombin and is composed of the F1/F2/A-chain (Ala1 to Arg320) and the B-chain (Ile321 to Glu579) linked by a single disulfide bond. D419N-thrombin contains the A-chain (Thr272 to Arg 320) and the B-chain lined by the same disulfide bond. While human prothrombin is an inactive precursor molecule, human meizothrombin and human thrombin hydrolyze low molecular weight peptidyl substrates. However, only human thrombin is able to convert fibrinogen to fibrin. The molecular basis of the hirudin-thrombin binding includes interactions of the anion binding exosite of the thrombin molecule and the C terminus of hirudin and interactions of the active-site cleft of the enzyme and the N terminus of the inhibitor (20Rydel T.J. Ravichandran G.K. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton J.W. Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Google Scholar). It is commonly thought that the inactivity of meizothrombin toward physiological substrates such as fibrinogen is caused by the presence of the F1/F2-peptide which may alter the enzyme specificity and/or block fibrinogen from binding to the anion binding exosite. However, our results show clearly that both enzymatically inactive prothrombin derivatives D419N-meizothrombin and D419N-thrombin bind the thrombin-specific inhibitor hirudin both in vitro and in vivo. Modification of the active site histidine of human thrombin resulted in a 106-fold reduced affinity for hirudin (25Stone S.R. Braun P.J. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4617-4624Google Scholar) and active site serine Oγ makes a hydrogen bond with Ile1′ of hirudin (26Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Google Scholar), thus contributing to the binding of the inhibitor. By contrast, the hirudin binding site is preserved in both D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin. Neutralization of hirudin in vitro in a purified system produced similar results for both D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). By contrast, in vitro in human plasma (Fig. 8) and in vivo in the animal model (Table I) D419N-meizothrombin neutralized hirudin more effectively than D419N-thrombin. In the animal model both proteins failed to exhibit any effects on the coagulation system. By contrast to any synthetic hirudin antagonist, D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin are human-like proteins. Since both proteins have been made inactive by an amino acid exchange at the center of the molecule, there is no possibility of regaining activity or liberating any toxic serine protease inhibitor, as might happen if active site inhibited thrombin were used as a hirudin-neutralizing agent. Thus, both D419N-thrombin and D419N-meizothrombin combine for the first time hirudin-neutralizing properties with the advantages of recombinant production of human blood proteins."
