https://openalex.org/W2133250947,"Wolbachia are maternally inherited intracellular bacterial symbionts that are estimated to infect more than 60% of all insect species. While Wolbachia is commonly found in many mosquitoes it is absent from the species that are considered to be of major importance for the transmission of human pathogens. The successful introduction of a life-shortening strain of Wolbachia into the dengue vector Aedes aegypti that halves adult lifespan has recently been reported. Here we show that this same Wolbachia infection also directly inhibits the ability of a range of pathogens to infect this mosquito species. The effect is Wolbachia strain specific and relates to Wolbachia priming of the mosquito innate immune system and potentially competition for limiting cellular resources required for pathogen replication. We suggest that this Wolbachia-mediated pathogen interference may work synergistically with the life-shortening strategy proposed previously to provide a powerful approach for the control of insect transmitted diseases.

Vector-borne diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis and dengue, cause a tremendous impact on human mortality and morbidity worldwide. With increasing human movement (Adams and Kapan, 2009Adams B.

Dengue is currently the most significant arboviral disease afflicting tropical and sub-tropical communities worldwide with an estimated global annual incidence of 50 million cases leading to tens of thousands of deaths (WHO, 2009WHODengue and Dengue Hemorragic Fever.in: Organization W.H. Fact Sheet. WHO, 2009Google Scholar). Between 2004 and 2007, unprecedented outbreaks of CHIKV occurred in islands of the western Indian Ocean, the Indian subcontinent and Europe (Staples et al., 2009Staples J.E. Breiman R.F. Powers A.M. Chikungunya fever: an epidemiological review of a re-emerging infectious disease.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2009; 49: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Aedes aegypti is considered the primary vector of both DENV and CHIKV. As effective vaccines do not exist for these viruses, prevention of human cases relies almost exclusively on control of the mosquito vectors. Despite some recent successes utilizing copepods as larval biological control agents (Kay and Vu, 2005Kay B. Vu S.N. New strategy against Aedes aegypti in Vietnam.Lancet. 2005; 365: 613-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), most control approaches are proving neither effective nor sustainable, and dengue is increasing in its geographic distribution, frequency of outbreaks and severity of disease (Kyle and Harris, 2008Kyle J.L. Harris E. Global spread and persistence of dengue.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). A new approach to dengue control has recently been proposed that targets mosquito longevity rather than abundance, through the introduction of a life-shortening strain of the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis into A. aegypti populations (Brownstein et al., 2003Brownstein J.S.

Wolbachia is an intracellular inherited bacterium, predicted to naturally infect more than 60% of all insect species worldwide (Hilgenboecker et al., 2008Hilgenboecker K. Hammerstein P.

From parasite to mutualist: rapid evolution of Wolbachia in natural populations of Drosophila.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e114Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Since the extrinsic incubation period of viruses and parasites within the mosquito vector is long relative to insect lifespan, Wolbachia infections that can invade mosquito populations and reduce adult A. aegypti lifespan are predicted to reduce pathogen transmission without eliminating the mosquito population (Brownstein et al., 2003Brownstein J.S.

The successful introduction of the life-shortening wMelPop-CLA strain of Wolbachia from Drosophila melanogaster into A. aegypti has recently been reported (McMeniman et al., 2009McMeniman C.J. Lane R.V. Cass B.N. Fong A.W. Sidhu M. Wang Y.F. O'Neill S.L. Stable introduction of a life-shortening Wolbachia infection into the mosquito Aedes aegypti.Science. 2009; 323: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Mosquitoes carrying this Wolbachia strain show around a 50% reduction in adult female lifespan compared to uninfected mosquitoes. Recent studies in Drosophila have shown that Wolbachia infections can protect against RNA viruses (Hedges et al., 2008Hedges L.M. Brownlie J.C. O'Neill S.L. Johnson K.N. Wolbachia and virus protection in insects.Science. 2008; 322: 702Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, Teixeira et al., 2008Teixeira L. Ferreira A. Ashburner M. The bacterial symbiont Wolbachia induces resistance to RNA viral infections in Drosophila melanogaster.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e2Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The Wolbachia strains wMelCS and wMelPop that infect D. melanogaster were found to delay mortality in flies when they were infected with a range of pathogenic viruses including Drosophila C virus, Flock House virus and Cricket paralysis virus. It is currently unknown how general this anti-viral effect is in terms of both the diversity of Wolbachia strains that can confer protection and the range of viruses that are affected by it although recent studies in Drosophila indicate that the effect appears limited to certain Wolbachia strains (Osborne et al., 2009Osborne S.E. Leong Y.S. O'Neill S.L. Johnson K.N. Variation in antiviral protection mediated by different Wolbachia strains in Drosophila simulans.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000656Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Given that the wMelPop strain of Wolbachia provides protection against RNA viruses in Drosophila, and that the derived wMelPop-CLA strain of Wolbachia was introduced into the mosquito A. aegypti to shorten lifespan, we hypothesized that wMelPop-CLA infected mosquitoes may have altered vector competence for arboviruses. To test this hypothesis we exposed Wolbachia-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes to two important human pathogens; dengue and Chikungunya viruses. We also tested the same mosquito strains with the avian malaria parasite, Plasmodium gallinaceum. We tested the effect of Wolbachia on vector competence in two mosquito genetic backgrounds: the original inbred PGYP1 line, stably transinfected with wMelPop-CLA (McMeniman et al., 2009McMeniman C.J. Lane R.V. Cass B.N. Fong A.W. Sidhu M. Wang Y.F. O'Neill S.L. Stable introduction of a life-shortening Wolbachia infection into the mosquito Aedes aegypti.Science. 2009; 323: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and the same strain after five generations of backcrossing to the F1 progeny of wild-caught A. aegypti, collected in Cairns, Australia (PGYP1.out). These mosquito strains were compared to tetracycline-treated counterparts that were genetically identical but lacked the Wolbachia infection, named PGYP1.tet and PGYP1.out.tet, respectively. In addition, a wild-type strain of A. aegypti established from field-collected material in Cairns, Australia (Cairns3) was used as an additional negative control. Mosquitoes were fed an artificial blood meal spiked with DENV-2 in four independent experiments to examine possible interactions with Wolbachia. The presence of DENV-2 in whole mosquito bodies was examined 7 and 14 days post exposure using a cell culture enzyme immunoassay (CCEIA) (Knox et al., 2003Knox T.B. Kay B.H. Hall R.A. Ryan P.A. Enhanced vector competence of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) from the Torres Strait compared with mainland Australia for dengue 2 and 4 viruses.J. Med. Entomol. 2003; 40: 950-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In three separate experiments no Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes (PGYP1.out) tested positive for DENV-2, but DENV-2 infection rates in Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes (PGYP1.out.tet and Cairns3) ranged from 30%–100% (Table 1, Exp 1–3). Body viral infection rates in PGYP1.out.tet mosquitoes ranged from 30%–100% after 7 days and 48%–97% after 14 days, while the body viral infection rates in Cairns3 ranged from 50%–95% after 7 days and 57%–95% after 14 days. The disseminated viral infection rates measured through the presence of virus in mosquito legs in tetracycline-treated A. aegypti ranged from 10%–23% and 37%–43% after 7 and 14 days, respectively. Disseminated infections in the Wolbachia-free wild-type Cairns3 strain of A. aegypti ranged from 5%–13% and 20%–33% after 7 and 14 days, respectively (Table 1) (p < 0.001, chi-square). In one experiment (Table 1, Exp 4) when mosquitoes were fed the highest titer (107.8 Logs) of DENV-2 a small number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes tested positive for DENV-2 at both 7 and14 days post infection (5 and 8%, respectively) but this was significantly fewer than Wolbachia uninfected controls (63%–78% and 70%–75%, respectively) (p < 0.001, chi-square).Table 1Effect of Wolbachia on DENV-2 InfectionPGYP1.out(+ Wolb)PGYP1.out.tet(− Wolb)Cairns3(− Wolb)ExperimentLog DENV-2 per mLDays post-infection% body infection (n)% disseminated infection (n)% body infection (n)% disseminated infection (n)% body infection (n)% disseminated infection (n)16.370 (25)0 (25)NAaThis mosquito line was unavailable for experiment 1NA64 (25)12 (25)140 (27)0 (27)NANA57 (30)23 (30)26.070 (40)0 (40)100 (30)10 (30)95 (40)5 (40)140 (40)0 (40)97 (30)37 (30)95 (40)20 (40)35.370 (40)0 (40)30 (40)23 (40)50 (40)13 (40)140 (40)0 (40)48 (40)43 (40)73 (40)33 (40)47.875 (40)3 (40)78 (40)63 (40)63 (40)45 (40)148 (40)5 (40)70 (40)65 (40)75 (40)70 (40)A. aegypti were orally infected with fresh DENV-2 and viral load determined by cell culture ELISA.a This mosquito line was unavailable for experiment 1 Open table in a new tab A. aegypti were orally infected with fresh DENV-2 and viral load determined by cell culture ELISA. To provide a more conservative test of Wolbachia-mediated interference, mosquitoes were intrathoracically injected with DENV-2. These experiments circumvented the midgut barrier to infection (Woodring et al., 1996Woodring J.L. Higgs S. Beaty B.J. Natural Cycles of Vector-Borne Pathogens.in: Beaty B.J. Marquardt W.C. The Biology of Disease Vectors. University Press of Colorado, Boulder, CO1996: 51-72Google Scholar) and allowed for the delivery of a repeatable inoculating dose (around 2,750 infectious particles/mosquito) of DENV-2 that produced consistent high-titer infections in control mosquitoes. Accumulation of genomic (+RNA) and anti-genomic (-RNA) RNA strands was assessed at 5 and 14 days post injection by quantitative real time PCR using DENV-2 specific primers (Richardson et al., 2006Richardson J. Molina-Cruz A. Salazar M.I. Black 4th, W. Quantitative analysis of dengue-2 virus RNA during the extrinsic incubation period in individual Aedes aegypti.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2006; 74: 132-141PubMed Google Scholar). At both time points, the amount of DENV-2 RNA present was reduced by up to 4 logs in both the PGYP1 and PGYP1.out Wolbachia-infected mosquito strains compared to their paired tetracycline treated counterparts (Figure 1, and Table S1 available online). Furthermore, when mosquito saliva collected from mosquitoes 14 days postinjection was tested for the presence of infectious virus by CCEIA, none of the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes samples tested positive for virus (data not shown). A dramatic reduction in viral protein synthesis was also observed by immunofluorescent microscopy (IFA) (Figures 2A–2F) and western blot analysis (Figure S1).Figure 2Localization of Wolbachia and Dengue Virus in A. aegypti MosquitoesShow full captionDouble immunofluorescence staining of mosquito sections showing the localization of dengue virus (red) and Wolbachia (green).

Double immunofluorescent staining of paraffin sections of Wolbachia-uninfected control mosquitoes 14 days post-injection showed DENV-2 infection predominantly in mosquito fat body, ommatidia (Figures 2A–2F) and nervous system. DENV-2 was not detected in any of these tissues in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes (PGYP1 and PGYP1.out) whereas Wolbachia was clearly visible in the fat tissue, ommatidia (Figure 2), brain, ovaries, and malpighian tubules. Only in a few rare individuals was DENV-2 detected in patches of fat tissue in PGYP1.out mosquitoes. However in these cases Wolbachia and DENV-2 were not co-localized in the same cells and DENV-2 was only seen in occasional patches of cells that were not infected with Wolbachia (Figure 2G). The presence of DENV-2 in some injected PGYP1.out mosquitoes was also confirmed by western blot (Figure S1A). We then went on to determine if the virus interference phenotype would extend to the alphavirus CHIKV. The virus strain used in the experiments contained the Ala to Val mutation in the membrane fusion glycoprotein E1 gene (E1-A226V), which has been linked to increased infectivity in A. albopictus (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007Tsetsarkin K.A. Vanlandingham D.L. McGee C.E. Higgs S. A single mutation in chikungunya virus affects vector specificity and epidemic potential.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e201Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). An Australian population of A. aegypti was recently shown to also be a highly efficient laboratory vector of this virus strain (van den Hurk et al., 2009van den Hurk, A.F., Hall-Mendelin, S., Pyke, A.T., Smith, G.A., and Mackenzie, J.S. (2009). Vector competence of Australian mosquitoes for Chikungunya virus. Vector-borne and Zoonotic Diseases, doi: 10.1089=vbz.2009.0106.Google Scholar). Mosquitoes were exposed to a blood/virus mixture containing 106.4 CCID50/ml of CHIKV, and at various time points postexposure, mosquitoes were processed to quantify the number of viral RNA copies using qPCR and CHIKV-specific primers and probes (van den Hurk et al., 2009van den Hurk, A.F., Hall-Mendelin, S., Pyke, A.T., Smith, G.A., and Mackenzie, J.S. (2009). Vector competence of Australian mosquitoes for Chikungunya virus. Vector-borne and Zoonotic Diseases, doi: 10.1089=vbz.2009.0106.Google Scholar). Immediately after feeding, the number of CHIKV genomic (+ RNA) RNA copies in the body and head were comparable for all three lines, suggesting that they imbibed similar amounts of virus (Table 2). The median number of copies decreased in all three lines on day 2, prior to it increasing in the PGYP1.out.tet and Cairns3 mosquitoes to its highest level at day 14-postexposure. Day 14 infection rates were 87% and 79% for the PGYP1.out.tet and Cairns3 controls and 17% for the Wolbachia infected PGYP1.out line (p < 0.001, chi-square).Table 2Effect of Wolbachia on CHIKV infectionPGYP1.outPGYP1.out.tetCairns3Days post-infectionInfected (%)Disseminated (%)Median copies in Bodies/ Heads (N)Percentiles (25 - 75%)Infected (%)Disseminated (%)Median copies in Bodies/ Heads (N)Percentiles (25 and 75%)Infected (%)Disseminated (%)Median copies in Bodies/ Heads (N)Percentiles (25 and 75%)01002010.2 (10) n.s.10.0-10.41002010.2 (10)9.8-10.61001010.0 (10)n.s.9.8-10.528009.1 (8)n.s.8.5-9.450309.6 (5)9.3-10.270409.5 (7)n.s.9.2-9.842007.8 (2)∗7.3-8.2606010.4 (6)9.7-10.8503010.0 (5)n.s.9.6-11.771007.3 (1)n.a.n.a.10010011.1 (10)10.8-11.31009010.39 (10)∗8.4-10.81000(0)n.a.n.a.606010.8 (6)10.6-10.9909010.6 (10) n.s.10.4-11.3141707.7 (3)∗∗6.7-8.08510011.8 (26)10.9-11.9809011.3 (23)∗10.3-11.6A. aegypti were orally infected with fresh CHIKV and viral load (Log10) determined by quantitative RT-PCR in bodies and heads or wings/ legs (for viral dissemination).

In all three mosquito groups, CHIKV RNA was detected in the legs and wings immediately after feeding (Table 2). This may represent either direct contact between the legs and/or wings and the blood/virus mixture or a rupture of the mesenteron, which released virus directly in the hemolymph (Turell, 1988Turell M.J. Reduced Rift Valley fever virus infection rates in mosquitoes associated with pledget feedings.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1988; 39: 597-602PubMed Google Scholar). After day 0, CHIKV was not detected in the legs and wings of any PGYP1.out (+ Wolb) mosquitoes. In contrast, on all days postexposure, virus was detected in the legs and wings of PGYP.out.tet and Cairns3 control mosquitoes (- Wolb) and by day 14, the virus was detected in the legs and wings of 100% and 90%, respectively, of mosquitoes that had positive bodies and heads (p = 0.125, chi-square). Considering that the viral interference effect appeared robust for two unrelated arboviruses we then tested the effect on the protozoan parasite P. gallinaceum. While not a human pathogen, this species of malaria parasite is known to be able to infect A. aegypti mosquitoes in the laboratory. Since no species of anopheline mosquitoes are known to carry natural Wolbachia infections and stable Wolbachia transinfected lines have yet to be generated, we considered the A. aegypti – P. gallinaceum model system most appropriate for testing effects on malaria parasites. Wolbachia-infected and uninfected A. aegypti mosquitoes (PGYP1.out and PGYP1.out.tet strains) as well as a susceptible strain of Aedes fluviatilis were fed in parallel on P. gallinaceum infected chickens. A. fluviatilis has a broad geographical distribution in Latin America and has been used in the laboratory as a safe avian malaria (P. gallinaceum) model vector, as it does not naturally transmit DENV or yellow fever virus (Tason de Camargo and Krettli, 1981Tason de Camargo M. Krettli A.U. Aedes fluviatilis (Lutz), a new experimental host for Plasmodium gallinaceum brumpt.J. Parasitol. 1981; 64: 924-925Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Seven days post-feeding on infected chickens, mosquito midguts were dissected and presence and number of Plasmodium oocysts assessed. The wMelPop-CLA infection significantly reduced (p < 0.0001, chi-square) the frequency of mosquitoes in the population infected with at least a single oocyst and so potentially able to transmit Plasmodium (Figure 3A) from 74% (tet controls) down to 42%. The presence of Wolbachia also reduced the number of oocysts present in mosquitoes that were infected with the parasite (Figures 3A and 3B). To quantify the difference in parasite loads, 15 days after infection mosquitoes were collected and the DNA was extracted. The relative abundance of Plasmodium genomic DNA was measured by qPCR of the 18S ssu rRNA gene (Schneider and Shahabuddin, 2000Schneider D. Shahabuddin M.

The results showed the same pattern of interference as observed from oocyst count data. In PGYP1.out mosquitoes Plasmodium genomic DNA was 26-fold less abundant than in PGYP1.out.tet lines (Figure 3C). Immunofluorescence analysis using an anti-CSP (Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein) monoclonal antibody showed the presence of mature oocysts in both mosquito species (Figure S2B), but very rarely in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. When we incubated the mosquito sections with an anti-Wolbachia (wsp) antibody we serendipitously discovered a Wolbachia infection in A. fluviatilis mosquitoes indicating that this species of mosquito was naturally infected with Wolbachia. PCR using Wolbachia general wsp primers (Braig et al., 1998Braig H.R. Zhou W. Dobson S.L. O'Neill S.L.

Sequence of the amplified DNA indicated that this Wolbachia strain (named wFlu) belongs to the Wolbachia B supergroup and is distantly related to wMelPop-CLA. qPCR analysis revealed that the density of wFlu in A. fluviatilis is about 20-fold lower than the density of wMelPop-CLA in A. aegypti (Figure S3). We then examined the tissue localization of Wolbachia in both mosquito species and whereas wMelPop-CLA is distributed throughout most tissues of the mosquito including the fat body, anterior midgut, muscle, nervous tissue, malpighian tubules and ovaries, wFlu is present only in ovaries, malpighian tubules and less frequently in the head, but absent from ommatidia (Figures 4 and S3). To examine whether resistance of Wolbachia infected mosquitoes to pathogen infection may be related to stimulation or priming of the mosquito innate immune system, we quantified the expression of a sample of immune genes. It was recently demonstrated that some immune genes are differentially regulated in A. aegypti mosquitoes infected with dengue virus (Xi et al., 2008Xi Z. Ramirez J.L. Dimopoulos G. The Aedes aegypti toll pathway controls dengue virus infection.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000098Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Interestingly, regulation of the immune pathway genes in these mosquitoes was also stimulated by their natural gut microbiota and rearing mosquitoes aseptically, and so depleting their bacteria"

Here we show that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can also colonize their tumors of origin, in a process that we call ""tumor self-seeding."" Self-seeding of breast cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma tumors in mice is preferentially mediated by aggressive CTCs, including those with bone, lung, or brain-metastatic tropism. We find that the tumor-derived cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 act as CTC attractants whereas MMP1/collagenase-1 and the actin cytoskeleton component fascin-1 are mediators of CTC infiltration into mammary tumors. We show that self-seeding can accelerate tumor growth, angiogenesis, and stromal recruitment through seed-derived factors including the chemokine CXCL1. Tumor self-seeding could explain the relationships between anaplasia, tumor size, vascularity and prognosis, and local recurrence seeded by disseminated cells following ostensibly complete tumor excision."

Collectively this work identifies a family of antiviral restriction factors that mediate cellular innate immunity to at least three major human pathogens. Influenza epidemics exact a formidable toll on world health. Moreover, viral super-infections can produce antigenic shifting, resulting in more virulent pathogens (Monto, 2009Monto A.S. The risk of seasonal and pandemic influenza: prospects for control.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2009; 48: S20-S25Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). At present, the emergence of a novel influenza A H1N1 viral strain has created a pandemic, producing illness in over 200 countries and territories (World Health Organization Pandemic [H1N1] 2009—update 75). Additionally, the related avian influenza A viral strain, H5N1, represents a potentially catastrophic global health risk (Maines et al., 2008Maines T.R. Szretter K.J. Perrone L. Belser J.A. Bright R.A. Zeng H. Tumpey T.M. Katz J.M. Pathogenesis of emerging avian influenza viruses in mammals and the host innate immune response.Immunol. Rev. 2008; 225: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The influenza A viral genome encodes for 11 proteins and consists of 8 segments of negative single-stranded RNA (Lamb and Krug, 2001Lamb R.A. Krug R.M. Orthomyxoviridae: The viruses and their replication.Fourth Edition. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001Google Scholar). Each subgenomic segment is coated by viral nucleoprotein (NP) and bound to a single viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase holoenzyme (RdRp), composed of PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits. Infection begins with the binding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein to sialyated host cell-surface glycoproteins (Skehel and Wiley, 1995Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Influenza viruses and cell membranes.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: S13-S15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following endocytosis, viral particles are trafficked through both early and late endosomes, with the acidification of the latter compartment altering the conformation of HA, leading to host-viral membrane fusion, entry of the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) into the cytosol (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2003Sieczkarski S.B. Whittaker G.R. Differential requirements of Rab5 and Rab7 for endocytosis of influenza and other enveloped viruses.Traffic. 2003; 4: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and nuclear import. Once in the nucleus, the RdRp commandeers 5′ caps from host mRNAs to prime transcription of viral mRNA (vmRNA; Bouloy et al., 1978Bouloy M. Plotch S.J. Krug R.M. Globin mRNAs are primers for the transcription of influenza viral RNA in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 4886-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and creates positive sense complementary RNA (cRNA) from which it makes new viral genomes (vRNAs). The vRNAs are coated by NP and exported though the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by the viral factors M1 and NEP/NS2 (nuclear export protein) working in concert with the host nuclear export machinery. The viral envelope proteins HA, M2, and neuraminidase (NA) are translated on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficked to the cell surface where they, along with the soluble factors M1, RdRp, and eight distinct vRNPs, are packaged into budding virions. To defend against infection, the host mobilizes factors to confront the virus. Interferons (IFN) orchestrate a large component of this antiviral response (Takaoka and Yanai, 2006Takaoka A. Yanai H. Interferon signalling network in innate defence.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 907-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Over 2000 gene products are induced after IFN stimulation, including the antiviral effectors MxA, PKR, RIG-I, and 2′5′-OAS (Haller et al., 2009Haller O. Staeheli P. Kochs G. Protective role of interferon-induced Mx GTPases against influenza viruses.Rev. Sci. Tech. 2009; 28: 219-231PubMed Google Scholar, Nakhaei et al., 2009Nakhaei P. Genin P. Civas A. Hiscott J.

Interferon signalling network in innate defence.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 907-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, many viruses deploy anti-IFN countermeasures, which for influenza A virus are primarily enacted by the viral protein NS1 (Hale et al., 2008Hale B.G. Randall R.E. Ortin J. Jackson D. The multifunctional NS1 protein of influenza A viruses.J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 2359-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). To identify host factors that modify viral replication we undertook an siRNA screen. In this screen we identified over 120 host factors required for influenza A replication that identify many central functions and interactions required for the viral life cycle as well as potential antiviral drug targets. Our studies also revealed a family of antiviral factors, the IFITM proteins, that mediate interferon's innate immune role in combating not only all pathogenic influenza A virus strains examined but also West Nile virus and dengue virus. We used a single round infection screen of osteosarcoma cells (U2OS) to find host proteins that modify the life cycle of influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8). After 12 hr the cells were stained for surface expression of HA as an indirect surrogate marker for viral infection (Figure 1A). Although measuring viral protein levels is an indirect measurement of viral replication, in three previous viral screens where we measured HIV, West Nile virus, and HCV replication by immunofluorescence and by titering, the viral protein reduction strongly correlated with reduction in viral titers. Thus we feel that this indirect assay can provide an accurate measurement of viral impairment. This approach detects viral-host receptor binding, endocytosis and fusion of the virion, vRNP trafficking and nuclear import, the transcription, nuclear export, and translation of the viral HA mRNA, and the trafficking of HA to the surface. The screen was optimized using siRNAs against NP and the host factor NXF1, an mRNA exporter required for virus replication (Ge et al., 2003Ge Q. McManus M.T. Nguyen T. Shen C.H. Sharp P.A. Eisen H.N. Chen J. RNA interference of influenza virus production by directly targeting mRNA for degradation and indirectly inhibiting all viral RNA transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 2718-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, Hao et al., 2008Hao L. Sakurai A. Watanabe T. Sorensen E. Nidom C.A. Newton M.A. Ahlquist P. Kawaoka Y. Drosophila RNAi screen identifies host genes important for influenza virus replication.Nature. 2008; 454: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). siRNAs against either NP or NXF1 resulted in inhibition of infection (NXF1 10-fold, NP 4- to 6-fold, Figures 1A and 1B and Figure S1A available online). We screened the Dharmacon siRNA library in triplicate. siRNA pools were selected for further evaluation if the percentage of HA-positive cells was less than 55% of the plate mean, and cell numbers were not less than 40% of the plate mean. These criteria were fulfilled by 312 pools (1.7% of the total genes screened, Figure 1C). Pools that increased HA expression >200% of the plate mean were also selected for validation (22 pools, 0.1%). We next rescreened the four unique siRNAs from each pool separately. In this screen, 260 out of 334 total pools confirmed with at least one siRNA scoring and 133 confirmed with two or more siRNAs (40%), reducing the probability of off-target effects (Datasets S1A and S1B). We employed bioinformatics to identify networks and enriched gene sets within this gene set (Dataset S1C). Ninety-two gene ontology (GO) biological process terms, assigned to 109 genes, were significantly enriched (Dataset S2). Of these, 17 are nonredundant and assigned to less than 500 genes, suggesting that they are informative and specific. The most significant terms include RNA splicing (22 genes, p = 2e-12), proton transport (7 genes, p = 2e-5), and mRNA transport (4 genes, p = 9e-3, Figure S1B). Analysis of GO molecular functions identified enrichment for 60 statistically significant terms assigned to 152 genes. Twelve terms were nonredundant and assigned to less than 500 human genes. The most significant terms include RNA binding (15 genes, p = 0.014), ATPase activity (6 genes, p = 0.008), and NADH dehydrogenase activity (4 genes, p = 0.016). Multiple biological pathways and complexes were also detected, concordant with known elements of the viral life cycle (Figure 2). Influenza A viral infection depends on sialic acid (SA) residues on the host cell surface, and we found that depletion of the SA transporter, SLC35A1, decreased infection. Our screen confirmed the functional role of two small GTPases, RAB5A (surface internalization to early endosome trafficking) and RAB7L1 (late endosome trafficking), for viral infection (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2003Sieczkarski S.B. Whittaker G.R. Differential requirements of Rab5 and Rab7 for endocytosis of influenza and other enveloped viruses.Traffic. 2003; 4: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We also found that lowering RAB10 levels inhibited infection (Hao et al., 2008Hao L. Sakurai A. Watanabe T. Sorensen E. Nidom C.A. Newton M.A. Ahlquist P. Kawaoka Y. Drosophila RNAi screen identifies host genes important for influenza virus replication.Nature. 2008; 454: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). RAB10 regulates the movement of endosomes generated from endocytosis downstream of RAB5 (Glodowski et al., 2007Glodowski D.R. Chen C.C. Schaefer H. Grant B.D. Rongo C. RAB-10 regulates glutamate receptor recycling in a cholesterol-dependent endocytosis pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4387-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Loss of each of four subunits of the multimeric vacuolar-ATPase proton pump (e.g., ATP6AP1, ATP6V0B, ATP6V1G1, ATP6V0E2) impeded infection, consistent with the low pH needed for fusion. Once released from the endosome, the vRNPs are transported into the nucleus though the NPC (Boulo et al., 2007Boulo S. Akarsu H. Ruigrok R.W. Baudin F. Nuclear traffic of influenza virus proteins and ribonucleoprotein complexes.Virus Res. 2007; 124: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and multiple NPC factors were found in the screen. Several splicing complexes were needed for viral HA protein surface expression, including three components of the U2 small nuclear RNP (snRNP), SF3B1, 2, and 3, and the U2 snRNP-interacting proteins, PRPF8, PTBP1, and FUS (Figure 2; Datasets S1A and S1C). The U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, including SART1, was also required (Stevens et al., 2001Stevens S.W. Barta I. Ge H.Y. Moore R.E. Young M.K. Lee T.D. Abelson J. Biochemical and genetic analyses of the U5, U6, and U4/U6 x U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.RNA. 2001; 7: 1543-1553PubMed Google Scholar). Four out of four siRNAs targeting SART1 resulted in lower levels of HA (surface-expressed and total protein), NP, and M2 proteins (Figures 1D and 1G). The decreased levels of all thee viral proteins, products of both spliced (M2) and unspliced (HA, NP) messages, suggests a general block in viral protein production with loss of SART1, perhaps secondary to effects on host protein expression. The vesicular transport complex, coatomer 1 (COP1), scored with multiple components (p value = 1e-7). COPI directs both retrograde intra-Golgi and Golgi-to-ER transport (Cai et al., 2007Cai H. Reinisch K. Ferro-Novick S. Coats, tethers, Rabs, and SNAREs work together to mediate the intracellular destination of a transport vesicle.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Depletion of six of seven components of COPI (ARCN1, COPA, COPB1, COPB2, COPG, and COPZ1) inhibited HA surface expression, perhaps by interfering with secretion of the host cell receptor(s) and/or trafficking of HA protein to the cell surface. Although COPB1 siRNAs decreased NP and M2 protein levels, they had a greater effect on surface-expressed versus total HA levels, suggesting that less HA arriving at the cell surface was partly responsible for the phenotype (Figures 1E and 1H). CALCOCO2 (NDP52) was also required for infection (Figures 1F and 1I). CALCOCO2 localizes to the Golgi and interacts with the host proteins, TR6BP and Myosin VI, and may function in regulating secretion (Morriswood et al., 2007Morriswood B. Ryzhakov G. Puri C. Arden S.D. Roberts R. Dendrou C. Kendrick-Jones J. Buss F. T6BP and NDP52 are myosin VI binding partners with potential roles in cytokine signalling and cell adhesion.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2574-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the validation round, the depletion of four genes, interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), PUSL1, TPST1, and WDR33, resulted in increased viral infection with two or more siRNAs (Dataset S1B). We focused on IFITM3 because of its link to interferon (Friedman et al., 1984Friedman R.L. Manly S.P. McMahon M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of interferon-induced gene expression in human cells.Cell. 1984; 38: 745-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Eight out of eleven distinct siRNAs targeting IFITM3 increased infection, with the levels of knockdown correlating with the phenotype (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A; Dataset S1B). Increased influenza A virus infection was also observed in primary lung fibroblasts after IFITM3 depletion (Figure S3B) and in HeLa cells (Figures S3C and S3E), with newly budded virus from HeLa cells increased >5 fold in titering assays (Figure S3D). Lowering IFITM3 levels similarly increased infection by the influenza A H1N1 viral strain WS/33 (Figure 3I) but had no effect on HIV infection (Figure S3F). Stable expression of a C-terminal HA-tagged protein, IFITM3-HA6R, lacking the 3′-untranslated region targeted by siRNA IFITM3-6 rescued resistance to the virus (Figures 3D and 3E). Thus, IFITM3 is required for basal levels of cellular resistance to influenza A virus infection. The mRNAs for IFITM3, and the closely related and linked genes IFITM1 and 2 (70% and 91% amino acid identity, respectively, Figure S6), are inducible by both IFN types I (α) and II (γ) (Friedman et al., 1984Friedman R.L. Manly S.P. McMahon M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of interferon-induced gene expression in human cells.Cell. 1984; 38: 745-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, Lewin et al., 1991Lewin A.R. Reid L.E. McMahon M. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Molecular analysis of a human interferon-inducible gene family.Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which we confirmed by immonofluorescence (IF) and western blot (Figures 3C and 3F). In unstimulated cells, the majority of IFITM3 resides in the ER (based on colocalization with SA and N-acetylglucosamine-conjugated proteins stained by wheat germ agglutinin, WGA; Figure S3G). IFN exposure, in contrast, triggers the distribution of IFITM3 in a vesicular pattern throughout the cell (Figures 3C, S3H, S3I, and S5D). In view of these dynamic changes, we examined IFITM3′s functional role in the IFN response. Either IFN-α or -γ strongly decreased basal levels of influenza A virus infection in both U2OS and HeLa cells (Figures 3G, 3H, S4A, and S4B). The depletion of IFITM3 profoundly decreased the antiviral actions of either IFN-γ or -α (Figures 3G, 3H, S4A, and S4B), but the inhibition was restored with the stable expression of IFITM3-HA6R (Figure 3H). Thus we conclude that IFITM3 is required both for basal levels of resistance as well as for the heightened defenses elicited by IFN-γ and -α. We then tested if overexpression of IFITM3, or its paralogs, IFITM1 and 2, could alter viral infection. A549 lung epithelial cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing IFITM1, 2, or 3. Two days later, the transduced cells showed increased resistance to infection with influenza A viruses PR8 (H1[PR]) or H3N2 A/Udorn/72 (H3 [Udorn], Figures 4A and 4B). Profound restriction was also seen when IFITM3 was stably overexpressed in either A549, U2OS, or primary chicken fibroblast cells (ChEFs, Figures 4C–4F and S4C). In addition, the overexpression of IFITM3 in a canine cell line used for propagating influenza A viruses (Madin-Darby canine kidney [MDCK] cells) strongly inhibited the cytophathic effect of sequential rounds of viral infection (Figures 4G and 4H) and also blocked infection by two current seasonal vaccine strains, A/Brisbane/59/07 H1N1 and A/Uruguay/716/07 H3N2, and by A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2, a viral isolate from the Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 (Figure S4D). This restriction was not universal because IFITM proteins did not inhibit Moloney Leukemia virus (MLV, amphotropic envelope, Figure 4A). To address where in the life cycle the block was occurring, we used viral pseudoparticles. The pseudoparticles each contain an MLV genome encoding the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP); however, each strain is uniquely coated with the envelope proteins from one of the following viruses: influenza A virus (strains H1, H3, H5, H7), Machupo virus (MACH), or MLV (Figure 4I). Overexpression of each of the IFITM proteins blocked infection by all four influenza A enveloped pseudoviruses, with less restriction seen against VSV-G protein, and none against MLV (γ-retrovirus) or MACH (arenavirus) envelope proteins (Figures 4I, S4E, and S4F). To complement these gain-of-function results, we depleted IFITM3 in U2OS cells, then infected with pseudoparticles expressing either influenza A virus envelope (H1[PR]) or VSV-G (Figure 4J). Decreased IFITM3 levels increased infection of the influenza A H1 pseudoviruses, with VSV-G entry elevated to a lesser extent only with the most potent siRNA, IFITM3-6 (Figure 4J). Because the life cycles of the pseudoviruses differ only in the means of entry mediated by their respective viral envelopes, these data are consistent with the IFITM proteins blocking influenza A virus infection early in the viral life cycle, somewhere between and including viral-host receptor binding and entry of the vRNP into the cytosol. Influenza A virus infection begins with the viral envelope proteins interacting with sialylated glycoproteins on the host cell's surface (Lamb and Krug, 2001Lamb R.A. Krug R.M. Orthomyxoviridae: The viruses and their replication.Fourth Edition. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001Google Scholar). We found no reduction, and even a slight increase, in the levels of SA with IFITM proteins overexpression, pointing away from a reduction in SA underlying the actions of the IFITM proteins (Figure 4K). When the transduced cells were examined by flow cytometry, the N-terminal epitope tag was bound by antibody without membrane permeabilization, revealing that the N terminus is extracellular (Figure S5A). In addition, the C terminus could also be detected in IF studies using nonpermeabilized cells, demonstrating that it is also extracellular (Figure S5B, lower right panel). Human and murine IFITM proteins display a high degree of interspecies homology (Figure S6). Thus, to examine the evolutionary conservation of IFITM protein function, we derived murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from a mouse strain, IfitmDel, deleted for all of the Ifitm genes (Ifitm1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; Lange et al., 2008Lange U.C. Adams D.J. Lee C. Barton S. Schneider R. Bradley A. Surani M.A. Normal germ line establishment in mice carrying a deletion of the Ifitm/Fragilis gene family cluster.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4688-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In spite of the loss of these genes, the IfitmDel mice develop normally (Lange et al., 2008Lange U.C. Adams D.J. Lee C. Barton S. Schneider R. Bradley A. Surani M.A. Normal germ line establishment in mice carrying a deletion of the Ifitm/Fragilis gene family cluster.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4688-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Comparison of IfitmDel+/+, +/−, and −/− MEFs revealed a marked increase in PR8 infection in the −/− cells (Figure 5A). The differences in infection were more pronounced when the MEFs were cultured with IFN-α or -γ prior to viral infection (Figures 5A–5C). As in human cells, we observed a vesicular staining pattern for Ifitm3 (Figures 5D and 3C). Forced expression of Ifitm2 or 3 in the IfitmDel−/− cells restored resistance to influenza A H1N1 infection (Figures 5E and 5F). We conclude that the Ifitm protein family accounts for a significant proportion of the anti-influenza actions of types I and II IFNs in mice, and the majority of this function can be restored by the stable expression of Ifitm2 or 3. We next explored the specificity of IFITM-mediated restriction by testing a panel of viral-like particles (VLPs) and pseudotyped viruses, each expressing a unique viral envelope protein. The VLPs expressed the envelope proteins of one of three flaviviruses, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), or the Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OMSK). These VLPs can undergo a single round of infection and are produced by transiently expressing the respective envelope proteins together with the WNV structural genes in cells stably expressing subgenomic WNV replicons containing EGFP (Yoshii and Holbrook, 2009Yoshii K. Holbrook M.R. Sub-genomic replicon and virus-like particles of Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus.Arch. Virol. 2009; 154: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As observed with influenza A pseudoparticles, all three VLPs were blocked by each of the IFITM proteins, demonstrating that these restriction factors impede first round infection (Figure 6A). Again, the IFITM proteins were found to inhibit VSV-G-mediated infection to a lesser extent (Figure 6A). In contrast, pseudoparticles expressing the envelope proteins of three arenaviruses, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Lassa virus (LASV), and MACH, or the MLV retrovirus, were not affected by IFITM expression. We next tested the effects of IFITM protein levels on two pathogenic flaviviruses, WNV and DNV. The replication of the 2741 strain of WNV was dramatically decreased in either A549 or U2OS cells stably overexpressing IFITM3 (Figures 6B and 6C). Furthermore, siRNA depletion of IFITM3 protein also led to an increase in replication of both WNV (Figures 6D and 6E) and DNV serotype 2 (New Guinea C strain, Figures 6F and 6G). However, although IFITM3 did not inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV), a more distantly related member of the Flaviviridae family, it did block influenza A virus infection in the same HCV-permissive liver cell line (Huh 7.5.1, Figures S5D and S5E). We conclude that IFITM proteins restrict the replication of two additional human pathogens, DNV and WNV, and are likely to also limit YFV and OMSK infection based on the VLP data. Although considerable knowledge exists regarding the function of viral proteins, the role of host factors in modifying infection is less understood. Therefore, we executed a genetic screen and identified over 120 human proteins needed by influenza A virus. The screen enriched for multiple host cell pathways including endosomal acidification, vesicular trafficking, mitochondrial metabolism, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling/mRNA export nuclear transport, and RNA processing. Our findings both support and extend those of a previous screen for influenza A virus-dependency factors that used Drosophila cells (Hao et al., 2008Hao L. Sakurai A. Watanabe T. Sorensen E. Nidom C.A. Newton M.A. Ahlquist P. Kawaoka Y. Drosophila RNAi screen identifies host genes important for influenza virus replication.Nature. 2008; 454: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Among the factors identified in our primary screen are the human orthologs of 11 insect-cell host factors previously reported to be required for flu infection in fly cells (19.6% of the 56 identifiable human orthologs; Figure 2, Dataset S1D). Within this common set, we recovered our positive control, NXF1, as well as NUP98, EIF4A2, ARCN1, COPG, PGD, RAB5A, and RAB10. In addition to these exact candidate matches, there was strong overlap between the screens within several biologic pathways and macromolecular complexes and those of the Reactome's influenza A virus infection database (Figure 2). This synthesis demonstrates the collective functional insights that unbiased large-scale mammalian and fly RNAi studies can provide in combination and outlines many central functions and interactions required for the flu life cycle as well as new antiviral drug targets. We have also constructed an enrichment analysis for host factors identified in the screen (Dataset S2), including a summary comparison of enriched GO categories for three whole-genome screens for host-factor modifiers of viral infection (HIV, [Brass et al., 2008Brass A.L.

GO terms that were enriched for in one more of the screens are provided, with overlapping viral dependencies apparent for components involved in spliceosome activity, Golgi function, vesicular trafficking, and proton transport (Dataset S2). These represent a core set of functions we now know to be shared among a very diverse set of viruses. Our screen identified the IFITM proteins as viral restriction factors. IFITM proteins were originally described 25 years ago based on their expression after IFN treatment (Friedman et al., 1984Friedman R.L. Manly S.P. McMahon M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

The human IFITM1, 2, 3, and 5 genes lie adjacently on chromosome 11. IFITM1, 2, and 3 are nearly ubiquitously expressed whereas IFITM5 is expressed in osteoblasts. The IFITM proteins have been ascribed roles in immune cell signaling, cell adhesion, oncogenesis, germ cell homing and maturation, and bone mineralization (Evans et al., 1993Evans S.S. Collea R.P.

https://openalex.org/W2144963939,"p53 is a tumor suppressor protein whose function is frequently lost in cancers through missense mutations within the Tp53 gene. This results in the expression of point-mutated p53 proteins that have both lost wild-type tumor suppressor activity and show gain of functions that contribute to transformation and metastasis. Here, we show that mutant p53 expression can promote invasion, loss of directionality of migration, and metastatic behavior. These activities of p53 reflect enhanced integrin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking, which depends on Rab-coupling protein (RCP) and results in constitutive activation of EGFR/integrin signaling. We provide evidence that mutant p53 promotes cell invasion via the inhibition of TAp63, and simultaneous loss of p53 and TAp63 recapitulates the phenotype of mutant p53 in cells. These findings open the possibility that blocking alpha5/beta1-integrin and/or the EGF receptor will have therapeutic benefit in mutant p53-expressing cancers."

One complication in the quantitative studies of genetic circuits is that these circuits are always coupled to the physiological state of the cell, which, for example, affects the machinery of transcription and translation. As long as the state of the cell remains unchanged, this dependence does not affect the quantification of gene regulation. However, changes in gene expression often reflect changes in the environment, which also affect the state of the cell. In that case, the coupling of gene expression to the global state of the cell cannot be ignored. We show in this study that this coupling generates an unappreciated layer of physiologically important global effects on gene expression. We focus on gene expression in bacteria in balanced exponential growth, for which the effects of environment on the state of the cell are reflected first and foremost by the growth rate. The growth rate of bacteria can vary wildly, depending on the type or amount of nutrients available in the growth medium. For example, the doubling time of E. coli in exponential batch culture growth ranges easily between ∼20 min and several hours. Many parameters of the cells such as their macromolecular composition and the cell size are strongly dependent on the growth conditions (Maaløe, 1979Maaløe O.

Dependency on medium and temperature of cell size and chemical composition during balanced grown of Salmonella typhimurium.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1958; 19: 592-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For E. coli and Salmonella, in which this dependence has been quantitatively characterized, the results can be expressed as a dependence on growth rate rather than on the specific growth media themselves: growth experiments with many different media have shown that media that support the same growth rate produce cells with the same macromolecular composition (Maaløe, 1979Maaløe O.

Dependency on medium and temperature of cell size and chemical composition during balanced grown of Salmonella typhimurium.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1958; 19: 592-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many parameters of the cell have therefore been characterized quantitatively as functions of the growth rate for E. coli (Bremer and Dennis, 1996Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Modulation of chemical composition and other parameters of the cell by growth rate.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar). Many of these growth rate-dependent parameters, e.g., gene and plasmid copy numbers and the abundance of RNA polymerases and ribosomes (Bremer and Dennis, 1996Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Modulation of chemical composition and other parameters of the cell by growth rate.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar), are known to affect gene expression. Changes in gene expression, which are often accompanied by a change of the growth rate, thus result from a combination of gene regulation and intrinsic global effects due to growth rate. Any quantitative understanding of gene expression therefore requires an understanding of these global effects. Indeed, expression of a large number of proteins is known to exhibit different types of growth-rate dependences (Pedersen et al., 1978Pedersen S. Bloch P.L. Reeh S. Neidhardt F.C. Patterns of protein synthesis in E. coli: a catalog of the amount of 140 individual proteins at different growth rates.Cell. 1978; 14: 179-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Growth rate-dependent regulation is most notable for the transcription of ribosomal RNA (Haugen et al., 2008Haugen S.P. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Advances in bacterial promoter recognition and its control by factors that do not bind DNA.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but is also known for ribosomal proteins, where it relies largely on posttranscriptional regulation (Keener and Nomura, 1996Keener J. Nomura M. Regulation of ribosome synthesis.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1417-1431Google Scholar), as well as for several nonribosomal proteins, where it is based on transcriptional mechanisms that appear to be different from the control of ribosomal RNA (Chiaramello and Zyskind, 1989Chiaramello A.E. Zyskind J.W. Expression of Escherichia coli dnaA and mioC genes as a function of growth rate.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4272-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Husnain and Thomas, 2008Husnain S.I. Thomas M.S. The UP element is necessary but not sufficient for growth rate-dependent control of the Escherichia coli guaB promoter.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 2450-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In contrast to these instances of specific growth rate-dependent regulation, the global effects addressed here are expected to affect all genes. Their interplay with specific mechanisms of gene regulation can lead to rather complex behaviors, and it is possible that they play a role in some of the known examples for specific growth rate-dependent regulation. An obvious starting point to study global growth rate-dependent effects on gene expression is the growth-rate dependence of the expression of an unregulated (constitutively expressed) gene. Indeed, several studies have shown that the expression of a constitutively expressed gene is growth-rate dependent (Liang et al., 1999aLiang S. Bipatnath M. Xu Y. Chen S. Dennis P. Ehrenberg M. Bremer H. Activities of constitutive promoters in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Wanner et al., 1977Wanner B.L. Kodaira R. Neidhardt F.C. Physiological regulation of a decontrolled lac operon.J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 212-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Willumsen, 1975Willumsen, B.M. (1975). Expression of constitutive genes in E. coli as function of growth rate (M. Sc. Thesis, University of Copenhagen).Google Scholar). We will show that the observed dependence can be quantitatively explained by a simple model using the known growth-rate dependencies of the key cellular parameters without invoking any adjustable free parameters. We then expand our model to investigate the effect of growth rate on regulated genes and simple genetic circuits to address the following questions: How is the growth-rate dependence of gene expression affected by positive or negative regulation? How should a gene be regulated to exhibit a growth rate-independent protein concentration? Is the qualitative behavior of a circuit the same at different growth rates? Answers to these questions may also help in the design on synthetic genetic circuits in order to obtain robust performance over a wide range of growth conditions. Experimental results are presented to validate key predictions of the model using simple synthetic genetic circuits. Finally, we explore cases with global feedback mediated by growth rate-dependent effects: in these situations, there is not only an effect of growth rate on gene expression, but the expression level of a protein also has an effect on the growth rate. Circuits of this type can lead to growth bistability. We discuss possible roles these effects may play in metabolic control, antibiotic resistance, and tolerance (persistence). We start by considering the growth-rate dependence of unregulated (constitutive) gene expression, which has been reported experimentally for E. coli in several cases (Liang et al., 1999aLiang S. Bipatnath M. Xu Y. Chen S. Dennis P. Ehrenberg M. Bremer H. Activities of constitutive promoters in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Wanner et al., 1977Wanner B.L. Kodaira R. Neidhardt F.C. Physiological regulation of a decontrolled lac operon.J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 212-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Willumsen, 1975Willumsen, B.M. (1975). Expression of constitutive genes in E. coli as function of growth rate (M. Sc. Thesis, University of Copenhagen).Google Scholar). From a bottom-up perspective, it is not clear whether the concentration of a constitutively expressed protein should be expected to increase or decrease at faster growth. On the one hand, faster dilution of the protein by faster growth should reduce its concentration, but on the other hand, transcription rates are known to be increased at faster growth, as well (Liang et al., 1999aLiang S. Bipatnath M. Xu Y. Chen S. Dennis P. Ehrenberg M. Bremer H. Activities of constitutive promoters in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To predict the growth-rate dependence of a constitutively expressed protein, we used a simple model of gene expression and searched the literature for the growth-rate dependence of all relevant parameters (Figure 1 and Table S1 available online). In our model, the expression level of a protein depends on six parameters, the cellular copy number of the gene (g), the transcription rate per copy of the gene (αm), the mRNA degradation rate (βm), the translation rate per mRNA (αp), the protein degradation rate (βm), and the cell volume (V), all of which may have a dependence on the growth rate (μ). These parameters determine the numbers of mRNA and protein molecules per cell, M = gαm/βm and P = gαmαp/(βm βp), as well as the corresponding concentrations, m = M/V and p = P/V. The quantity of main interest is the resulting concentration of the protein, which is given byp=gαmαp/(βmβpV).(1) The growth-rate dependence of the transcription rate per gene has been characterized for several constitutive promoters (Liang et al., 1999aLiang S. Bipatnath M. Xu Y. Chen S. Dennis P. Ehrenberg M. Bremer H. Activities of constitutive promoters in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). They were found to exhibit the same dependence, increasing at slow growth and saturating at fast growth (Figure 1A). This growth-rate dependence is believed to reflect the availability of RNA polymerase in the cell (Klumpp and Hwa, 2008Klumpp S. Hwa T. Growth-rate-dependent partitioning of RNA polymerases in bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 20245-20250Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, Liang et al., 1999aLiang S. Bipatnath M. Xu Y. Chen S. Dennis P. Ehrenberg M. Bremer H. Activities of constitutive promoters in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The gene copy number per cell is determined by the dynamics of DNA replication and cell division and has been well characterized (Cooper and Helmstetter, 1968Cooper S. Helmstetter C.E. Chromosome replication and the division cycle of Escherichia coli B/r.J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). It is growth-rate dependent, because at different growth rates a gene is replicated at different time points in the cell division cycle. At fast growth the gene copy number is further increased due to overlapping rounds of DNA replication. The growth-rate dependence of the gene copy number is calculated using the Cooper-Helmstetter relation (see Table S1) and is plotted in Figure 1B for a position halfway between the origin and terminus of replication. The degradation rate of mRNA appears to be rather independent of growth rate, as indicated by studies of the stability of total cellular mRNA (Coffman et al., 1971Coffman R.L. Norris T.E. Koch A.L. Chain elongation rate of messenger and polypeptides in slowly growing Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, Pato and von Meyenburg, 1970Pato M.L. von Meyenburg K.

Ehrenberg M. Dennis P. Bremer H. Decay of rplN and lacZ mRNA in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, Nilsson et al., 1984Nilsson G. Belasco J.G. Cohen S.N. von Gabain A. Growth-rate dependent regulation of mRNA stability in Escherichia coli.Nature. 1984; 312: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a genome-wide study (Bernstein et al., 2002Bernstein J.A. Khodursky A.B. Lin P.H. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N. Global analysis of mRNA decay and abundance in Escherichia coli at single-gene resolution using two-color fluorescent DNA microarrays.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 9697-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) found that the lifetimes of most transcripts differed by less than 2-fold between growth in minimal and rich medium, with no obvious correlation between the two conditions. The independence of mRNA stability to growth rate may be attributed to the autoregulation of RNase E (Jain et al., 2002Jain C. Deana A. Belasco J.G. Consequences of RNase E scarcity in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (see the Supplemental Data). The growth-rate dependence of the translation rate αp has been determined for the lacZ transcript and was found to be approximately constant over a range of growth rates from 0.6 to three doublings per hour (Liang et al., 2000Liang S.T. Xu Y.C. Dennis P. Bremer H. mRNA composition and control of bacterial gene expression.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3037-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), as shown in Figure 1D. This finding is surprising, given that the cellular concentration of ribosomes increases strongly with increasing growth rate (Bremer and Dennis, 1996Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Modulation of chemical composition and other parameters of the cell by growth rate.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar), and is discussed further in the Supplemental Data. Here, we take the finding for lacZ as typical and assume the translation rate to be growth-rate independent. Finally, if our protein of interest is stable, it is not degraded, but rather diluted out by cell growth and division, so that βp is given by the growth rate μ through βp = μ ln2 (Figure 1E). To predict protein and mRNA concentrations, we also need the growth-rate dependence of the cell volume. As a measure of cell volume we use cell mass, which is easily measured by optical density and is commonly used to express measured concentrations. Several studies have shown that cellular mass and volume exhibit the same growth-rate dependence (Donachie and Robinson, 1987Donachie W.D. Robinson A.C. Cell division: Parameter values and the process.in: Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Magasanik B. Low K.B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.

Molecular Cytology of Escherichia coli. Academic Press, London1985: 259-318Google Scholar), increasing strongly with increasing growth rate as shown in Figure 1E (data from Bremer and Dennis, 1996Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Modulation of chemical composition and other parameters of the cell by growth rate.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar) (see also the detailed discussion in the Supplemental Data). An alternative normalization for concentrations is per total cellular protein rather than per cell mass. While the two are roughly equivalent, the total cellular protein concentration (per mass) increases slightly at slower growth, so that this normalization leads to a slightly weaker growth-rate dependence (see below). From the growth-rate dependence of the global parameters (Figure 1), we calculated by Equation 1 the predicted growth-rate dependence of the protein and mRNA expression levels for a constitutively expressed gene (Figures 2A–2D ). Our results predict that the number of transcripts of such a gene per cell is strongly increased at faster growth (Figure 2A), while the concentration of transcripts is rather independent of growth rate (Figure 2B). Likewise, the protein copy number per cell is increased at faster growth (Figure 2C), although less than the number of transcripts, and the protein concentration is decreased at faster growth (Figure 2D). The decrease of the protein concentration despite an increase of its molecule number per cell reflects the strongly increased cell volume at fast growth. In Figures 3A and 3B , we compare the calculated growth-rate dependence of the concentrations of constitutively expressed proteins with available experimental data. These data are derived by different labs from various E. coli strains, for various genes expressed constitutively because their regulation has been inactivated (by deletion of the regulators or mutations of the operator sites), and for a synthetic promoter-reporter system constructed for this study (green squares). Data in Figure 3A show concentrations obtained by normalization to cell mass, while data in Figure 3B are normalized to total protein. In general, our calculated growth-rate dependence (red) agrees very well with the data. Data normalized to total protein, however, show a significant spread for very slow growth. The origin of this spread is not clear. We also note that the experimental data for constitutively expressed protein per total protein are well approximated by a linear relation (black line in Figure 3B). According to this relation, the concentration of such a protein would become zero for a (hypothetical) growth rate of ∼3.5 doublings per hour, slightly higher than the highest growth rate that can be attained. The origin of this linear relation is discussed elsewhere (M. Scott, C.W. Gundersen, E. Mateescu, Z.Z., and T.H., unpublished data). The gene copy number per cell depends on the position on the chromosome (Bremer and Dennis, 1996Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Modulation of chemical composition and other parameters of the cell by growth rate.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella.

Biol. 1968; 31: 519-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Figure 3C indicates the range of growth-rate dependencies for different chromosomal positions. The two boundaries of the gray area indicate the strongest and the weakest growth-rate dependence for chromosomal genes, obtained for genes close to the origin and terminus of DNA replication, respectively. For genes on a plasmid, the gene copy number is given by the plasmid copy number and will in general be different from those for chromosomal genes. For plasmid pBR322, the copy number per cell is slightly increased at faster growth, but much less than for chromosomal genes (Lin-Chao and Bremer, 1986Lin-Chao S. Bremer H. Effect of the bacterial growth rate on replication control of plasmid pBR322 in Escherichia coli.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 203: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The copy number of plasmid R1 even decreases at faster growth (Engberg and Nordström, 1975Engberg B. Nordström K. Replication of R-factor R1 in Scherichia coli K-12 at different growth rates.J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 179-186PubMed Google Scholar) (see also Table S1). In both cases, the protein concentration for a plasmid-encoded constitutively expressed gene is predicted to follow a much stronger growth-rate dependence than that for chromosomal genes (Figure 3C). Regulated genes are directly affected by growth rate in the same way as constitutively expressed genes; in addition, they are affected by the growth-rate dependence of their regulator concentrations. For example, the expression of a protein E that is negatively regulated by a constitutively expressed repressor R (Figure 4A ) is affected by a reduced expression at faster growth because of the direct growth effects discussed above (Figure 3), and a weakened repression at faster growth because the growth-rate dependence of the repressor concentration itself. The balance of these two effects is analyzed by expanding the above model of growth-rate dependence to include basic features of gene regulation (Bintu et al., 2005Bintu L. Buchler N.E. Garcia H.G. Gerland U. Hwa T. Kondev J. Phillips R. Transcriptional regulation by the numbers: models.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) (see the Supplemental Data). The compounded effect is predicted to depend mainly on the cooperativity of repression, but also on the strength of repression (strengths of the promoter driving the repressor relative to the repression threshold). An example is illustrated in Figure 4A for strong repression, with a weak, inverse growth-rate dependence (red squares) for noncooperative repression (Hill coefficient n = 1), and a strong, positive growth-rate dependence (red triangles) for cooperative repression. Weaker repression results in weaker growth-rate dependence also in the cooperative case (see the Supplemental Data). For positive regulation by a constitutively expressed activator A (Figure 4B), the two effects of growth both tend to decrease the expression level of the target protein E, so that in this case, the target is predicted to always exhibit a stronger inverse growth-rate dependence (green) than a constitutive gene (black). The above predictions were tested with several synthetic genetic circuits (Table S2) expressing LacZ reporter in strains derived from E. coli MG1655. LacZ activity was assayed during exponential growth in a variety of media that provided a range of growth rates. In strain EQ38, a constitutively expressed repressor (TetR) controls LacZ expression through the synthetic TetR-dependent PLTet-O1 promoter (Lutz and Bujard, 1997Lutz R. Bujard H. Independent and tight regulation of transcriptional units in Escherichia coli via the LacR/O, the TetR/O and AraC/I1-I2 regulatory elements.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Its LacZ expression (red dots in Figure 4D) is seen to have a weaker growth-rate dependence than the cogenic strain (EQ37) not containing tetR (black). In strain EQ40, a constitutively expressed activator (dnXylR) controls LacZ expression through the Pu promoter derived from the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida (Pérez-Martín and de Lorenzo, 1996Pérez-Martín J. de Lorenzo V. In vitro activities of an N-terminal truncated form of XylR, a sigma 54-dependent transcriptional activator of Pseudomonas putida.J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A stronger growth-rate dependence (green) than for constitutive expression is seen for this system. The experimental results are in good semiquantitative agreement with the predictions (compare like color curves in Figure 4). Detailed quantitative comparisons require quantitative knowledge of the promoter characteristics (e.g., cooperativity and repression threshold) and will be pursued elsewhere. Although simple repression can result in rather weak growth-rate dependence (Figure 4C, red dots), significant growth-rate dependence of LacZ expression is seen for strain EQ38 (Figu"

These factors were then examined functionally through depletion analyses in primary lung cells. The resulting data point to potential roles for some unanticipated host and viral proteins in viral infection and the host response, including a network of RNA-binding proteins, components of WNT signaling, and viral polymerase subunits.

Here we show that Jarid2/Jumonji, a protein enriched in pluripotent cells and a founding member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain protein family, is a PRC2 subunit in ES cells. Genome-wide ChIP-seq analyses of Jarid2, Ezh2, and Suz12 binding reveal that Jarid2 and PRC2 occupy the same genomic regions. We further show that Jarid2 promotes PRC2 recruitment to the target genes while inhibiting PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity, suggesting that it acts as a ""molecular rheostat"" that finely calibrates PRC2 functions at developmental genes. Using Xenopus laevis as a model we demonstrate that Jarid2 knockdown impairs the induction of gastrulation genes in blastula embryos and results in failure of differentiation.

However, little is known about any potential pathophysiological interplay between these two PD-related genes. Here we show in transgenic mice that although overexpression of LRRK2 alone did not cause neurodegeneration, the presence of excess LRRK2 greatly accelerated the progression of neuropathological abnormalities developed in PD-related A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice. Moreover, we found that LRRK2 promoted the abnormal aggregation and somatic accumulation of α-synuclein in A53T mice, which likely resulted from the impairment of microtubule dynamics, Golgi organization, and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Conversely, genetic ablation of LRRK2 preserved the Golgi structure and suppressed the aggregation and somatic accumulation of α-synuclein, and thereby delayed the progression of neuropathology in A53T mice. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of LRRK2 enhances α-synuclein-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest inhibition of LRRK2 expression as a potential therapeutic option for ameliorating α-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration.

These findings demonstrate that overexpression of LRRK2 enhances α-synuclein-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest inhibition of LRRK2 expression as a potential therapeutic option for ameliorating α-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized pathologically by relatively selective loss of midbrain and brain stem catecholaminergic neurons and by deposition of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in cell bodies and nerves (Nussbaum and Polymeropoulos, 1997Nussbaum R.L. Polymeropoulos M.H. Genetics of Parkinson's disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1687-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Since mutations in both α-syn and Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause familial forms of PD that resemble sporadic PD pathologically (Hardy et al., 2006Hardy J. Cai H. Cookson M.R. Gwinn-Hardy K. Singleton A. Genetics of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism.Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), these genetic mutations provide valuable molecular tools to study the pathogenesis of PD. The etiology of PD remains elusive; however, it has been generally accepted that the formation of α-syn aggregates is a key step in the pathogenesis of PD (Trojanowski et al., 1998Trojanowski J.Q. Goedert M. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Fatal attractions: abnormal protein aggregation and neuron death in Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia.Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 832-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Mutations in the α-syn gene, including missense mutations (A53T and A30P) and gene duplication/triplication, lead to the development of early-onset familial PD (Hardy et al., 2006Hardy J. Cai H. Cookson M.R. Gwinn-Hardy K. Singleton A. Genetics of Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism.Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α-syn is a main component of abnormal intracellular deposits known as Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) found in PD brains (Spillantini et al., 1997Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies.Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5439) Google Scholar). While both wild-type (WT) and mutant α-syn form fibrillar aggregates, PD-related α-syn mutations greatly accelerate the formation of fibrils as compared with WT protein (Conway et al., 1998Conway K.A.

The pathogenic mechanism of PD-related LRRK2 mutants remains obscure. To study the function of LRRK2 and how mutant LRRK2 causes neuron degeneration in vivo, we have generated LRRK2 knockout (LRRK2−/−) and transgenic mice expressing human WT, G2019S, or kinase-domain-deletion (KD) LRRK2. Neither deletion nor overexpression of LRRK2 caused any overt gross neuropathological abnormalities in mutant mice. However, coexpression of WT, G2019S, or KD LRRK2 with the PD-related A53T α-syn caused synergistic toxicity to neurons that accelerated the progression of α-syn-mediated neuropathology. Conversely, inhibition of LRRK2 expression reduced the aggregation and somatic accumulation of α-syn, and delayed the progression of α-syn-mediated neuropathology. Our findings suggest that LRRK2 may regulate A53T α-synuclein-mediated neuropathology through modulating the intracellular trafficking and accumulation of α-syn. As described previously (Wang et al., 2008Wang L. Xie C. Greggio E. Parisiadou L. Shim H. Sun L. Chandran J. Lin X. Lai C. Yang W.J. et al.The chaperone activity of heat shock protein 90 is critical for maintaining the stability of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we have generated LRRK2 inducible transgenic mice in which the expression of C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human WT, G2019S, or KD mutant LRRK2 was under the transcriptional control of tetracycline operator (tetO) (Figure 1A). To make the KD expression construct, we deleted residues from 1887 to 2102 of LRRK2, resulting in a complete deletion of its kinase domain. In parallel with the generation of LRRK2 inducible transgenic mice, we also used the same strategy to generate new lines of human α-syn A53T inducible transgenic mice (tetO-A53T). Given that the expression pattern of LRRK2 (Galter et al., 2006Galter D. Westerlund M. Carmine A. Lindqvist E. Sydow O. Olson L. LRRK2 expression linked to dopamine-innervated areas.Ann. Neurol. 2006; 59: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) is similar to that of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-alpha (CaMKII) in the brain, we crossbred tetO-LRRK2 and tetO-A53T mice with a line of CaMKII promoter-controlled tetracycline transactivator (tTA) (CaMKII-tTA) mice (Mayford et al., 1996Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y.Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Control of memory formation through regulated expression of a CaMKII transgene.Science. 1996; 274: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) to achieve high-level expression of LRRK2 or α-syn in the forebrain regions. Accordingly, our previous in situ hybridization experiments showed that the expression of human LRRK2 was mainly detected at the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum in the brain of tetO-LRRK2 and CaMKII-tTA double transgenic mice (Wang et al., 2008Wang L. Xie C. Greggio E. Parisiadou L. Shim H. Sun L. Chandran J. Lin X. Lai C. Yang W.J. et al.The chaperone activity of heat shock protein 90 is critical for maintaining the stability of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For simplicity, we will later refer to the tetO-LRRK2 WT/CaMKII-tTA, tetO-G2019S/CaMKII-tTA, and tetO-KD/CaMKII-tTA double transgenic mice as LRRK2WT, G2019S, and KD transgenic mice, respectively. We refer to the E3 line as the G2019S transgenic mice and the C74 line as the LRRK2WT in later studies. Additionally, we designate line C77 as the LRRK2 WT low expression line (LRRK2WT-L) and line D10 as the KD mice. We generated five independent lines of LRRK2WT, three independent lines of G2019S, and three independent lines of KD transgenic mice. In both G2019S and LRRK2WT mice, the expression of LRRK2 protein was increased by about 8- to 16-fold compared with that in the endogenous one (Figures 1B and S1B, available online). In the brain homogenate of KD mice, a pair of LRRK2-positive bands was detected, the lower of which likely represents the exogenous human LRRK2 with truncated kinase domain (Figure 1B). The expression level of exogenous human LRRK2 between LRRK2WT-L and KD transgenic mice was comparable, and was about 8- to 16-fold less than that of LRRK2WT mice (Figure S1C). Therefore, the expression of LRRK2 was only modestly increased (<1-fold) in the brain of LRRK2WT-L and KD mice as compared with that of nontransgenic (nTg) controls (Figure 1B). Q-RT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of exogenous LRRK2 in the brain of LRRK2WT-L and KD mice. The transcription of exogenous LRRK2 mRNA in the brains of LRRK2WT-L and KD mice was about a 5- and 15-fold increase, respectively, over that in nTg controls (Figure S1D). The lower relative accumulation of exogenous LRRK2 protein in the KD mouse brain likely reflects the instability of this mutant protein. Under the same transcriptional activation of CaMKII promoter-controlled tTA, the expression pattern of human α-syn in the brain was the same as that of LRRK2 transgene (Figure 1C, upper panel). Administration of doxycycline (DOX) suppressed the expression of exogenous α-syn in this “tet-off” system (Figure 1C, middle panel). The expression level of human A53T α-syn protein was increased by about 30-fold as compared with that of endogenous protein (Figures 1D and S1B). Noticeably, under the CaMKII promoter only a small fraction (<5%) of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons expressed the transgene (Figures S1E–S1G). Therefore, we focus our studies on the cortex and striatum, where the exogenous α-syn and LRRK2 are widely expressed. All lines of LRRK2WT, G2019S, and KD transgenic mice were viable and developed normally. G2019S mice appeared to gain less body weight compared with nTg and tetO-G2019S single transgenic mice starting at 12 months of age (Figure S2A, p < 0.0001). However, no significant difference in body weight was found between G2019S and CaMKII-tTA mice (Figure S2A). The motor functions of G2019S mice were examined by Rotarod and Open-field tests. G2019S mice performed normally in the Rotarod test (Figure S2C). However, they displayed significantly increased ambulatory activities starting at 12 months of age (Figure 1E, p < 0.05). G2019S mice also showed a trend of increased rearing activities, but it did not reach statistical significance (Figure 1G). In addition, there were no apparent motor phenotypes detected in LRRK2WT mice up to 6 months of age (Figures S2F–S2H). By contrast, A53T transgenic mice weighed significantly less starting at 4 months of age (Figure S2B, p < 0.0005), began to display drastic increases in ambulatory activities at 2 months of age (Figure 1F, p < 0.0001), and displayed elevated rearing activities at 6 months of age (Figure 1H, p < 0.05). Together, the motor behavioral studies suggest that overexpression of G2019S LRRK2 and A53T α-syn in the forebrain regions may induce similar damages to the neural circuitry responsible for regulating motor activities. To determine if any neuropathological abnormalities developed in A53T and G2019S transgenic mice, we examined the brain sections of mutant and control animals for neurodegeneration and associated astrocytosis and microgliosis. The neurodegeneration was revealed by Jade C and cleaved-caspase 3 (c-caspase 3) staining. The presence of reactive astrocytes was examined by staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The morphology of microglia was visualized by staining for ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba1). Both Jade C and c-caspase 3 stainings were negative in the brain sections derived from 20-month-old G2019S transgenic mice (Figures 2Ad and 2Bd; Table 1). Consistently, stereological studies revealed no significant changes in neuron counts at either the frontal cortex or dorsal striatum between G2019S and age-matched nTg mice (Figures 2E–2G). In addition, no apparent increase in reactive astrocytosis or microglial activation was observed in the striatum and cortex of G2019S transgenic mice as compared with that of control nTg animals (Figure 2; Table 1, Table 2). Similarly, no obvious gross neuropathological phenotypes were found in 12-month-old LRRK2WT transgenic mice (Table 1; Figures S2I–S2L).Table 1Neuronal Degeneration in the Striatum and Cortex of A53T and LRRK2 Mutant Mice# of c-caspase 3+# of Jade C+AgeGenotypeStriatumCortexStriatumCortex1 monthnTg0000tTA0000A53T0000LRRK2WT-L0000LRRK2WT0000KD0000G2019S0000A53T/LRRK2WT-L1.4 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.23.4 ± 0.55.2 ± 0.5###A53T/LRRK2WT3.0 ± 0.78.0 ± 1.112.0 ± 0.9∗∗15.8 ± 1.1∗∗A53T/G2019S13.0 ± 1.5∗∗,∗∗∗17.3 ± 0.326.0 ± 1.2∗∗28.7 ± 1.9∗∗A53T/KD1.3 ± 0.33.0 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.38.0 ± 1.3##12 monthsnTg (DOX)0000A53T5.0 ± 0.66.3 ± 0.512.0 ± 0.613.3 ± 1.5A53T/LRRK2−/−0000A53T/DOX0000LRRK2WT000020 monthsnTg′0000A53T24.7 ± 4.132 ± 4.433.3 ± 4.140.3 ± 4.3G2019S0000LRRK2−/−0000The average numbers of c-caspase-3-positive and Jade C-positive cells in the striatum and cortex of each cohort of mice were counted by the event measurement tool of AxioVision (Zeiss).

Interestingly, more enlarged Iba1-positive cells were detected in LRRK2−/− mice as compared to nTg mice (###p < 0.05). nTg′ represents nTg mice from both transgenic and LRRK2−/− cohorts of mice. No apparent neuropathological abnormalities were detected in the striatum of 3-month-old A53T mice (Figures 2Aa–2Da), but neuropathology became obvious when A53T transgenic mice were examined at 12 and 20 months of age (Figure 2; Table 1, Table 2), and widespread neurodegeneration was evident in the brains of 20-month-old A53T transgenic mice (Figures 2Ac–2Bc and 2E). Massive neuronal loss in the frontal cortex (>80%) and dorsal striatum (>74%) of A53T mice was estimated by unbiased stereological approaches (Figures 2F and 2G). Therefore, A53T mice developed age-dependent, progressive neurodegeneration, whereas G2019S mice did not show any obvious gross neuropathological phenotypes. To test whether overexpression of LRRK2 affects A53T α-syn-mediated neurodegeneration, we generated A53T/LRRK2WT-L, A53T/LRRK2WT, A53T/G2019S, and A53T/KD double transgenic mice and examined the progression of neuropathological alterations (Figure 3). Compared to 1-month-old A53T single transgenic mice, the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes was significantly elevated in the striatum of age-matched A53T/LRRK2WT-L and A53T/LRRK2WT double transgenic mice (Figures 3A and 3E). In addition, more GFAP-positive astrocytes were found in the brain of A53T/LRRK2WT mice than A53T/LRRK2WT-L mice (Figures 3A and 3E), suggesting that the expression level of LRRK2 influences the progression of α-syn-mediated neuropathology. A similar increase of microglial activation was also observed in A53T/LRRK2WT-L and A53T/LRRK2WT double transgenic mice (Figures 3B; Table 2). In addition to gliosis, neurodegeneration was also accelerated in the striatum of A53T/LRRK2WT-L and A53T/LRRK2WT transgenic mice (Figure 3; Table 1). Costaining of c-caspase 3 with Ctip2, a specific marker for striatal medium-size spiny neurons (MSN) (Arlotta et al., 2008Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Jabaudon D. Yoshida Y. Macklis J.D.

The mechanisms controlling the activity and recruitment of PRC2 are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the founding member of the Jumonji family, JMJ (JUMONJI or JARID2), is associated with PRC2, colocalizes with PRC2 and H3K27me3 on chromatin, and modulates PRC2 function. In vitro JMJ inhibits PRC2 methyltransferase activity, consistent with increased H3K27me3 marks at PRC2 targets in Jmj−/− ESCs. Paradoxically, JMJ is required for efficient binding of PRC2, indicating that the interplay of PRC2 and JMJ fine-tunes deposition of the H3K27me3 mark. During differentiation, activation of genes marked by H3K27me3 and lineage commitments are delayed in Jmj−/− ESCs. Our results demonstrate that dynamic regulation of Polycomb complex activity orchestrated by JMJ balances self-renewal and differentiation, highlighting the involvement of chromatin dynamics in cell-fate transitions.

Our results demonstrate that dynamic regulation of Polycomb complex activity orchestrated by JMJ balances self-renewal and differentiation, highlighting the involvement of chromatin dynamics in cell-fate transitions. Eukaryotic gene transcription is influenced by chromatin structure, in large part established through modification of histone tails (Kouzarides, 2007Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7363) Google Scholar). Methylation of lysine residues in histones is dynamically regulated by the opposing activities of histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and demethylases (KDMs) (Cloos et al., 2008Cloos P.A. Christensen J. Agger K. Helin K. Erasing the methyl mark: histone demethylases at the center of cellular differentiation and disease.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1115-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Recently several KDMs with exquisite substrate specificity have been implicated in diverse processes, including embryonic patterning, stem cell self-renewal, differentiation, neuronal development, and spermatogenesis (Nottke et al., 2009Nottke A. Colaiacovo M.P. Shi Y. Developmental roles of the histone lysine demethylases.Development. 2009; 136: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mutations or deregulation of KDMs are often linked to human cancers and diseases (van Haaften et al., 2009van Haaften G. Dalgliesh G.L. Davies H. Chen L. Bignell G. Greenman C. Edkins S. Hardy C. O'Meara S. Teague J. et al.Somatic mutations of the histone H3K27 demethylase gene UTX in human cancer.Nat.

Cell. 2007; 25: 801-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The majority of KDMs are characterized by the presence of a JmjC domain, a conserved region first recognized in the founding member of the Jumonji family, JUMONJI (JMJ or JARID2). A catalytic triad (H, D/E, H), which is predicted to mediate cofactor Fe(II) binding, is highly conserved in JmjC-containing proteins and required for KDM activity (Klose and Zhang, 2007Klose R.J. Zhang Y. Regulation of histone methylation by demethylimination and demethylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). JMJ, however, has amino acid substitutions in this subregion and is predicted to be enzymatically inactive (Cloos et al., 2008Cloos P.A. Christensen J. Agger K. Helin K. Erasing the methyl mark: histone demethylases at the center of cellular differentiation and disease.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1115-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, JMJ is critical in embryonic development. Jmj−/− mouse embryos develop various defects in neuronal, cardiac, liver, and hematopoietic tissues with penetrance dependent on the genetic background (Jung et al., 2005Jung J. Mysliwiec M.R. Lee Y. Roles of JUMONJI in mouse embryonic development.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Takeuchi et al., 2006Takeuchi T. Watanabe Y. Takano-Shimizu T. Kondo S. Roles of jumonji and jumonji family genes in chromatin regulation and development.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 2449-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Developmental defects have been associated with increased numbers of progenitor cells and depletion of differentiating or mature cells, suggesting a role for JMJ in regulating proliferation and differentiation. Despite the activities of JMJ-related proteins in chromatin regulation and the multiple roles of JMJ in development, the function of JMJ is poorly understood. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are required for establishing and maintaining cellular memory. Four PcG proteins, including two EZH proteins (EZH1/EZH2), EED, and SUZ12, comprise the core of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a methyltransferase complex that acts specifically on histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) (Margueron et al., 2008Margueron R. Li G. Sarma K. Blais A. Zavadil J. Woodcock C.L. Dynlacht B.D. Reinberg D. Ezh1 and Ezh2 maintain repressive chromatin through different mechanisms.Mol.

Cell. 2008; 32: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), PRC2 is critically required for both maintenance and execution of pluripotency (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I.

Cell. 2008; 32: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). PRC2 and trimethylation on H3K27 (H3K27me3) occupy a set of genes controlling differentiation and prevent full expression of these genes until lineage commitment. Despite its central role in development, little is known regarding how the activity of PRC2 is regulated, PRC2 is targeted to distinct regions during cell fate transitions, or the pluripotent state is maintained to preserve plasticity, such that the influence of the H3K27me3 mark may be attenuated when gene expression is required. To address these issues, we characterized the PRC2 complex in mouse ESCs and identified closely associated proteins in a PRC2 interactome. Here we demonstrate that JMJ is a subunit of the PRC2 complex, colocalizes with PRC2 on chromatin, and regulates H3K27me3 modification by modulating PRC2 activity. Fine-tuned, dynamic regulation of H3K27me3 by JMJ and PRC2 balances the stem cell state and differentiation. To identify proteins associated with PRC2, we affinity-purified the complex using a previously described in vivo biotinylation strategy (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Rao S. Chu J. Shen X. Levasseur D.N. Theunissen T.W. Orkin S.H. A protein interaction network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 444: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from ESCs coexpressing bacterial biotin ligase (BirA) and subendogenous levels of biotin- and FLAG-tagged EED, EZH1, or EZH2 referred to as bfEED, bfEZH1, or bfEZH2 (Shen et al., 2008Shen X. Liu Y. Hsu Y.J. Fujiwara Y. Kim J. Mao X. Yuan G.C. Orkin S.H. EZH1 mediates methylation on histone H3 lysine 27 and complements EZH2 in maintaining stem cell identity and executing pluripotency.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) were subjected to streptavidin-mediated coimmunoprecipitation or tandem coimmunoprecipitation mediated by anti-FLAG antibody and streptavidin. Interacting proteins were then identified by mass spectrometry sequencing (Figure 1A; Tables S1–S4 available online). In addition to known PRC2 core components including EZH1/EZH2, EED, SUZ12, RBBP4, and AEBP2, we identified several interacting partners of PRC2 including JUMONJI (JMJ), metal response element-binding transcription factor 2 (MTF2), and serine/threonine kinase 38 (STK38). To confirm the putative interacting proteins and to expand the PRC2 interaction network, we then tagged MTF2 and JMJ with a biotin tag and FLAG epitope (herein referred to as bfMTF2 and bfJMJ) in ESCs. The reverse tagging analysis confirmed association of PRC2 with MTF2 and JMJ (Tables S5 and S6). We did not detect peptides representing the H3K9 methyltransferases G9a and GLP that were reported to interact with JMJ when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells (Shirato et al., 2009Shirato H. Ogawa S. Nakajima K. Inagawa M. Kojima M. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Takeuchi T. A jumonji (Jarid2) protein complex represses cyclin D1 expression by methylation of histone H3-K9.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on proteomic results, we constructed an “interactome” surrounding PRC2 (Figure 1B), which includes the core PRC2 components, MTF2, JMJ, STK38, RBBP7, and additional JMJ-interacting proteins that may indirectly or transiently associate with PRC2. Interestingly, bfJMJ pulled down few peptides representing MTF2, and bfMTF2 did not capture JMJ (Table S1). Thus, these two PRC2-associated proteins may not coexist in the same PRC2 complex. To validate the above interactions, we coexpressed V5-tagged MTF2, HA-tagged JMJ, bfEED, and bfEZH2 in 293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation of MTF2, JMJ, or EED/EZH2 pulled down the other three components (Figure 1C), suggesting their coexistence in one protein complex. To verify binary interactions, we coexpressed V5-tagged MTF2 or HA-tagged JMJ with one of bfEED, bfEZH,1 and bfEZH2 in 293T cells. Both MTF2 and JMJ bind to EED, EZH1, or EZH2 (Figures 1D and 1E). MTF2 (also called PCL2) is a member of the Polycomblike/PHF1 (PCL1) family proteins, which associate with PRC2 in fly and in mammal (Cao et al., 2008Cao R. Wang H. He J. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Because of the recognized importance of Jumonji family proteins in regulating chromatin structure, cellular function, and development (Cloos et al., 2008Cloos P.A. Christensen J. Agger K. Helin K. Erasing the methyl mark: histone demethylases at the center of cellular differentiation and disease.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1115-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, Nottke et al., 2009Nottke A. Colaiacovo M.P. Shi Y. Developmental roles of the histone lysine demethylases.Development. 2009; 136: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we focused on the interaction of JMJ with PRC2. Fractionation of nuclear extracts from CJ7 ESCs by gel filtration shows that JMJ comigrates with EZH2 with two peaks centered at 3908 kDa and 395 kDa (Figure 1F), indicating that JMJ is possibly associated with a fraction of PRC2 in ESCs. Streptavidin capture of bfEZH2 and bfEED in ESCs precipitates endogenous JMJ (Figure 1G). An anti-SUZ12 antibody mediates coimmunoprecipitation of JMJ but not RBP2, the H3K4 demethylase, in wild-type ESCs (Figures 1H and S1). Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation mediated by an anti-JMJ antibody captures endogenous EZH2, EED, and SUZ12 (Figures 1I and 1J). These results demonstrate that JMJ interacts with PRC2 in a physiological setting. In Ezh2−/− mutant ESCs, JMJ fails to coimmunoprecipitate with EED and captures significantly less SUZ12 compared to that in wild-type cells (Figure 1I). In addition, an EZH2 mutant lacking the catalytic SET domain (bfEZH2 dSET) (Shen et al., 2008Shen X. Liu Y. Hsu Y.J. Fujiwara Y. Kim J. Mao X. Yuan G.C. Orkin S.H. EZH1 mediates methylation on histone H3 lysine 27 and complements EZH2 in maintaining stem cell identity and executing pluripotency.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) coimmunoprecipitates with SUZ12 but not JMJ (Figure 1G). These results implicate EZH2 and its SET domain in mediating in vivo association of JMJ and PRC2. EED appears dispensable for this interaction as JMJ coimmunoprecipitates with EZH2 and SUZ12 in Eed−/− ESCs. Endogenous JMJ pulls down PRC2 not only in ESCs but also in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and F9 embryonic carcinoma cells (Figure 1J). Therefore, the interaction between JMJ and PRC2 is not unique to pluripotent ESCs. JMJ contains a conserved ARID/BRIGHT domain, which can bind DNA (Kim et al., 2003Kim T.G. Kraus J.C. Chen J. Lee Y. JUMONJI, a critical factor for cardiac development, functions as a transcriptional repressor.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42247-42255Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We sought to identify DNA targets of JMJ. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in ESCs using antibody to JMJ shows that endogenous JMJ is significantly enriched at promoters of PRC2 target genes (Figure 2A). To identify gene targets of JMJ in a global fashion, we performed ChIP-chip on Affymetrix promoter tiling arrays. Out of 644 target genes bound by JMJ (Figure 2B; Tables S7, S8, and S13), 632 (98%) genes overlap with genes marked by H3K27me3 (Shen et al., 2008Shen X. Liu Y. Hsu Y.J. Fujiwara Y. Kim J. Mao X. Yuan G.C. Orkin S.H. EZH1 mediates methylation on histone H3 lysine 27 and complements EZH2 in maintaining stem cell identity and executing pluripotency.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Moreover, 81%–98% of JMJ target genes overlap with targets of EZH2, SUZ12, and bfEED (Figure 2C; Tables S7A and S10–S13). The extent of overlap between JMJ and PRC2/H3K27me3 targets greatly exceeds the reported colocalization between RBP2 and H3K27me3, in which only 195 out of 606 RBP2 target genes overlap with H3K27me3 targets (Pasini et al., 2008Pasini D. Hansen K.H. Christensen J. Agger K. Cloos P.A. Helin K. Coordinated regulation of transcriptional repression by the RBP2 H3K4 demethylase and Polycomb-Repressive Complex 2.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Results with the conventional ChIP method are highly dependent on the quality of available antibodies to the target protein, whereas bioChIP obviates the need for antibodies and takes advantage of the strong interaction between biotin and streptavidin (Kim et al., 2008Kim J.

Cell. 2008; 32: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). To refine the genome-wide targets of JMJ, we analyzed ESCs expressing subendogenous level of bfJMJ (data not shown) and confirmed the enrichment of bfJMJ on PRC2 targets (Figure 2D). BioChIP-chip of bfJMJ on Affymetrix whole-genome tiling arrays revealed many more targets (3695 genes) than JMJ antibody-mediated ChIP-chip (Figure 2B and Table S9). As 97% of JMJ ChIP-chip targets overlap bioChIP-chip targets (Table S7), bioChIP-chip faithfully maps comprehensive coverage of chromatin binding of endogenous JMJ. Over 80% of H3K27me3, bfEZH1, or bfEZH2 targets overlap those of bfJMJ (Table S7), confirming genome-wide colocalization of JMJ with PRC2 and H3K27me3. JMJ occupies genomic regions in close proximity to transcription start sites (TSS) (Figure 2E). Similar to H3K27me3 target genes, JMJ target genes are enriched in development-related functions (Figure 2F). Thus, JMJ interacts with PRC2 at both protein and chromatin levels. To address functional implication of the interaction of JMJ with PRC2, we assayed JMJ-associated proteins for KMT activity. Indeed, proteins that coprecipitate with bfJMJ in ESCs demonstrate KMT activity toward core histones in a dose-dependent manner similar to the bfEZH2-containing complex captured by streptavidin (Figure 3A). In addition, the endogenous JMJ-containing complex precipitated by an anti-JMJ antibody shows KMT activity toward nucleosomes, which are the natural substrates in vivo (Figure 3B). To study substrate specificity, recombinant histones bearing methyl lysine analogs (MLAs) were used to examine desired methylation patterns on histone H3. These MLAs (indicated as Kc) behave similarly to their natural counterparts (Simon et al., 2007Simon M.D. Chu F. Racki L.R. de la Cruz C.C. Burlingame A.L. Panning B. Narlikar G.J. Shokat K.M. The site-specific installation of methyl-lysine analogs into recombinant histones.Cell. 2007; 128: 1003-1012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The bfEZH2-containing complex shows decreasing activity on the H3 substrates with increasing numbers of methyl groups on residue 27 (Figure 3C). This result is consistent with the report that monomethylation activity of PRC2 is dominant to its trimethylation activities in vitro (Sarma et al., 2008Sarma K. Margueron R. Ivanov A. Pirrotta V. Reinberg D. Ezh2 requires PHF1 to efficiently catalyze H3 lysine 27 trimethylation in vivo.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 2718-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A weak methylation signal observed on H3Kc27me3, which contains saturated methyl groups, may reflect nonspecific activity of PRC2 on lysine 9 in vitro. Although PRC2 specifically acts on H3K27 in vivo, recombinant human PRC2 exhibits weak KMT activity on H3K9 in vitro (Kuzmichev et al.,2002Kuzmichev A. Nishioka K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Histone methyltransferase activity associated with a human multiprotein complex containing the Enhancer of Zeste protein.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). The bfJMJ complex exhibits substrate specificity similar to that of the bfEZH2 complex with the highest and lowest activity toward unmethylated H3 and H3Kc27me3, respectively, supporting the physical existence of JMJ and PRC2 in one protein complex. Moreover, the endogenous JMJ-containing complex shows similar activity on unmethylated H3 and H3Kc9me3 substrates but significantly weaker activity on the H3Kc27me3 substrate (Figure 3D), implying that the JMJ-PRC2 complex specifically acts on H3K27 but not H3K9. Mammalian JMJ contains several conserved motifs including JmjN, ARID/BRIGHT, JmjC, and C5HC2 zinc finger domains (Figure S2). Mutation of the critical residues involved in cofactor binding in the JmjC domain predicts that JMJ is inactive as a demethylase, a function distinguishing many Jumonji family members (Cloos et al., 2008Cloos P.A. Christensen J. Agger K. Helin K. Erasing the methyl mark: histone demethylases at the center of cellular differentiation and disease.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1115-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Consistent with the prediction, we failed to detect KDM activity of JMJ regardless of the presence of EZH2 (Figure S3). Moreover, addition of JMJ had no obvious effect on known KDMs (Figure S3). To ask whether JMJ assembles as a stoichiometric component of PRC2, we reconstituted JMJ-PRC2 through baculoviral expression. Anti-HA coimmunoprecipitation targeted to EED captures JMJ, which is present at 1/4 the amount of EZH2. Therefore, JMJ is a substoichiometric component of PRC2 (Figure 4A). This result suggests that PRC2 may exist in two forms: JMJ-containing and JMJ-free PRC2 complexes. A chromatin fraction mainly comprised of oligonucleosomes from HeLa cells contains endogenous KMT activity (Figure 4B). Addition of increasing amounts of JMJ but not bovine serum albumin (BSA) markedly inhibits this activity. Close interaction between JMJ and PRC2 suggests that JMJ may directly regulate the KMT activity of PRC2. To test this possibility, we reconstituted KMT reactions with recombinant PRC2 and histone H3 MLAs with the defined methylation pattern at residues Kc27 and Kc9. Addition of JMJ did not affect PRC2-mediated monomethylation on H3 and H3Kc9me3 substrates (Figure 4C). JMJ dramatically downmodulates PRC2 activity on H3Kc27me1 and me2 substrates in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). BSA has no effect on PRC2, indicating the specificity of the assay. JMJ failed to inhibit PRC2 on chicken core histones (data not shown), presumably due to dominant monomethylation catalyzed by PRC2 in vitro, which may mask the inhibitory effect of JMJ on di- and trimethylation. The JMJ mutant (dJc) lacking the C-terminal JmjC and C5HC2 domains also inhibits di- and trimethylation activity of PRC2 (Figure 4D), suggesting that the JmjC and C5HC2 domains are dispensable for JMJ activity on PRC2. To test whether JMJ specifically inhibits PRC2 activity on more physiological substrates, we assembled recombinant histone octamers and nucleosomes containing H3Kc27me0, me1, or me2. Consistent with histone substrates, JMJ inhibited PRC2-mediated di- and trimethylation in a dose-dependent manner on MLA octamers and nucleosomes (Figures 4E and 4F). JMJ also inhibited monomethylation activity of PRC2 on H3Kc27me0 octamers and nucleosomes, indicating that JMJ-PRC2 may exhibit different enzymatic activities toward H3 histone, octamers, core histones (which contain octamers plus the linker histone H1), and nucleosomal substrates in vitro. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that JMJ inhibits di- and trimethylation activity of PRC2. To investigate how JMJ regulates PRC2 function in vivo, we isolated Jmj conditional knockout (fl/fl) ESCs. Deletion of exon 3 creates a frameshift and subsequent termination mutation (Figure S2A), resulting in a mutant peptide of 15 amino acids that contains none of the known functional motifs of JMJ (Mysliwiec et al., 2006Mysliwiec M.R. Chen J. Powers P.A. Bartley C.R. Schneider M.D. Lee Y. Generation of a conditional null allele of jumonji.Genesis. 2006; 44: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). By Cre recombinase-mediated excision of the fl alleles in vitro, we established Jmj−/− ESCs, in which JMJ expression is completely abolished and JMJ is no longer detected at PRC2 target loci by ChIP (Figures 5A–5C). Anti-SUZ12 coimmunoprecipitation in Jmj−/− cells fails to detect a protein band representing JMJ (Figure 1H), confirming the specificity of the interaction between JMJ and PRC2. Jmj−/− ESCs show normal expression of pluripotency markers (Table S14) and proliferate at a rate similar to wild-type ESCs under standard conditions (data not shown). Thus, JMJ is dispensable for ESC self-renewal and maintenance. As JMJ inhibits PRC2 trimethyltransferase activity in vitro, we investigated whether loss of JMJ affects H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Global levels of H3K27 methylation, as well as other histone marks, are not affected in Jmj−/− ESCs (Figure S4), consistent with a role of JMJ as a modifier of PRC2. However, moderate, but consistent, enhancement of H3K27me3 binding at individual PRC2 target loci is observed in Jmj−/− cells (Figure 5D). To study the effect of Jmj loss on gene expression of PRC2 and H3K27me3 targets, we performed microarray profiling of Jmj−/− and Jmjfl/fl ESCs (Table S14). By Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), we ranked genes from high to low based on the correlation between their expression levels in these two cell types (Figure 5E). Genes that are upregulated in Jmj−/− ESCs compared to Jmjfl/fl ESCs are ranked at the top of the list, whereas genes that are downregulated are ranked toward the bottom of the list. We previously identified a subset of H3K27me3 target genes referred to as “H3K27me3-(WT)-Day6 UP” genes that are repressed in undifferentiated ESCs but upregulated at day 6 of ESC differentiation (Shen et al., 2008Shen X. Liu Y. Hsu Y.J. Fujiwara Y. Kim J. Mao X. Yuan G.C. Orkin S.H. EZH1 mediates methylation on histone H3 lysine 27 and complements EZH2 in maintaining stem cell identity and executing pluripotency.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). We then asked where members of this H3K27me3 target gene set are distributed in the ranked dataset. We find that H3K27me3 target genes distribute toward the bottom of the rank list with a significant normalized enrichment score (NES) of −2.9 (Figure 5E), indicating reduced expression in Jmj−/− ESCs. Thus, accentuated repression of H3K27me3 genes is consistent with ChIP analysis, indicating that increased presence of H3K27me3 on chromatin may further repress PRC2 targets that normally exhibit low levels of transcription. The enrichment of JMJ at PRC2 targets is markedly reduced in Ezh2−/− and Eed−/− ESCs (Figure 5C), indicating a requirement of EZH2 and EED in targeting JMJ to chromatin. This result is consistent with the observation that JMJ lacks specific binding affinity to methylated histones, as revealed by histone peptide binding assays (Figure S5). On the other hand, enrichment of SUZ12, EZH2, and EED at PRC2 targets is significantly decreased in Jmj−/− ESCs (Figures 5F–5H), pointing to a positive role of JMJ in facilitating PRC2 binding to chromatin. Thus, JMJ modulates PRC2 function in opposing ways. As PRC2 and UTX/JMJD3 function as KMTs and KDMs, respectively, to control “on” and “off” switches of H3K27me3, JMJ functions as a modifier of PRC2 to fine-tune the level of H3K27me3 by promoting chromatin binding, while also inhibiting the KMT activity of PRC2 (Figure 5I). The core components of PRC2 including EZH2, EED, and SUZ12 appear to be more important in executing than in maintaining pluripotency (Pasini et al., 2007Pasini D. Bracken A.P. Hansen J.B. Capillo M.

To investigate the role of JMJ in regulating ESC pluripotency, we differentiated Jmj−/− and Jmjfl/fl ESCs by withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and performed microarray expression profiling. Global gene expression in Jmj−/− ESCs was compared to that in Jmjfl/fl ESCs by GSEA. H3K27me3 targets are distributed primarily toward the bottom of the ranked list in their enrichment profiles with the lowest NES of −3.0 at day 4 compared to −2.5 and −2.0 at days 6 and 8 of differentiation, respectively (Figure 6A). Consistent with GSEA, which provides a statistical comparison of a previously defined gene set between two cell types, heatmap analysis shows that the activation of H3K27me3 target genes in Jmj−/− ESCs is delayed and not activated to the same extent as in Jmjfl/fl cells during differentiation (Figure 6B). Upon LIF withdrawal pluripotent ESCs differentiate into three germ layers including neuroectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Mesoendoderm (ME) is a transient cell state prior to further differentiation into m"
https://openalex.org/W2016441660,"We identify the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein LRRTM2 as a key regulator of excitatory synapse development and function. LRRTM2 localizes to excitatory synapses in transfected hippocampal neurons, and shRNA-mediated knockdown of LRRTM2 leads to a decrease in excitatory synapses without affecting inhibitory synapses. LRRTM2 interacts with PSD-95 and regulates surface expression of AMPA receptors, and lentivirus-mediated knockdown of LRRTM2 in vivo decreases the strength of evoked excitatory synaptic currents. Structure-function studies indicate that LRRTM2 induces presynaptic differentiation via the extracellular LRR domain. We identify Neurexin1 as a receptor for LRRTM2 based on affinity chromatography. LRRTM2 binds to both Neurexin 1alpha and Neurexin 1beta, and shRNA-mediated knockdown of Neurexin1 abrogates LRRTM2-induced presynaptic differentiation. These observations indicate that an LRRTM2-Neurexin1 interaction plays a critical role in regulating excitatory synapse development."
https://openalex.org/W1992603916,"Recently, leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (LRRTMs) were found to be synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that, when expressed in nonneuronal cells, induce presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons. We now demonstrate that LRRTM2 induces only excitatory synapses, and that it also acts to induce synapses in transfected neurons similarly to neuroligin-1. Using affinity chromatography, we identified alpha- and beta-neurexins as LRRTM2 ligands, again rendering LRRTM2 similar to neuroligin-1. However, whereas neuroligins bind neurexins containing or lacking an insert in splice site #4, LRRTM2 only binds neurexins lacking an insert in splice site #4. Binding of neurexins to LRRTM2 can produce cell-adhesion junctions, consistent with a trans-interaction regulated by neurexin alternative splicing, and recombinant neurexin-1beta blocks LRRTM2's ability to promote presynaptic differentiation. Thus, our data suggest that two unrelated postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules, LRRTMs and neuroligins, unexpectedly bind to neurexins as the same presynaptic receptor, but that their binding is subject to distinct regulatory mechanisms."

Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms (Harper, 1996Harper P.S. New genes for old diseases: the molecular basis of myotonic dystrophy and Huntington's disease. The Lumleian Lecture 1995.J. R. Coll. Physicians Lond. 1996; 30: 221-231PubMed Google Scholar). HD is caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion near the N terminus of huntingtin (Htt), a very large 350 kDa protein (The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupA novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington's disease chromosomes.Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6506) Google Scholar). Huntingtin is thought to function as a scaffolding protein that mediates a variety of protein-protein interactions involved in vesicular trafficking, signaling, and transcription (MacDonald, 2003MacDonald M.E.

HD neuropathology is characterized by the selective loss of predominantly medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum and to a lesser extent the pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of the cortex (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998Vonsattel J.P. DiFiglia M. Huntington disease.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Another pathological hallmark of HD is the accumulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein aggregates containing mhtt N-terminal polyQ fragments in the cortex and striatum (DiFiglia et al., 1997DiFiglia M.

The NT17 domain can function as a cytoplasmic retention signal and deletions or certain point mutations in this domain result in nuclear accumulation of htt in cultured cells (Rockabrand et al., 2007Rockabrand E.

The NT17 domain can also be covalently modified by ubiquitylation and SUMOylation, which appear to have opposing effects on the toxicity of mhtt fragments in a transgenic Drosophila model (Steffan et al., 2004Steffan J.S. Agrawal N. Pallos J. Rockabrand E. Trotman L.C. Slepko N. Illes K. Lukacsovich T. Zhu Y.Z. Cattaneo E. et al.SUMO modification of Huntingtin and Huntington's disease pathology.Science. 2004; 304: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical analyses reveal that interaction of the NT17 domain with the adjacent polyQ domain can accelerate mhtt exon 1 peptide aggregation via a novel and complex pathway (Thakur et al., 2009Thakur A.K. Jayaraman M. Mishra R. Thakur M. Chellgren V.M. Byeon I.J. Anjum D.H. Kodali R. Creamer T.P.

Biol. 2009; 16: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This converging evidence suggests that the NT17 domain and its modifications may play important roles in the physical and biological properties of wild-type htt, and in the toxicity of fl-mhtt and its toxic fragments. In neurodegenerative diseases, phosphorylation of disease proteins such as tau (Ballatore et al., 2007Ballatore C. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), SCA1 (Emamian et al., 2003Emamian E.S.

Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. alpha-Synuclein is phosphorylated in synucleinopathy lesions.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) has been shown to play important roles in disease pathogenesis. Recent studies reveal that serines 13 and 16 (S13 and S16) in htt NT17 domain can be phosphorylated in cultured mammalian cells (Aiken et al., 2009Aiken C.T. Steffan J.S. Guerrero C.M. Khashwji H. Lukacsovich T. Simmons D. Purcell J.M. Menhaji K. Zhu Y.Z. Green K. et al.Phosphorylation of threonine-3: Implications for huntingtin aggregation and neurotoxicity.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29427-29436Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Thompson et al., 2009Thompson L.M. Aiken C.T. Kaltenbach L.S. Agrawal N. Illes K. Khoshnan A. Martinez-Vincente M. Arrasate M. O'Rourke J.G. Khashwji H. et al.IKK phosphorylates Huntingtin and targets it for degradation by the proteasome and lysosome.J. Cell Biol. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar). To address the importance of these modifications in disease pathogenesis elicited by fl-mhtt in a mammalian model of HD, we have introduced either phosphomimetic (SD) or phosphoresistant (SA) mutations into fl-mhtt. Dramatically, SD but not SA fl-mhtt can prevent progressive neuronal dysfunction, mhtt aggregation, and late-onset neurodegenerative pathology in vivo. Moreover, an in vitro aggregation assay reveals that the SD mutations significantly compromise the fibrillization of mhtt-exon 1 peptides, whereas SA mutations do not. Thus, we provide strong evidence that S13 and S16 in htt NT17 domain play a critical role in modulating polyQ-induced misfolding and/or aggregation in vitro and fl-mhtt-induced disease pathogenesis in vivo. To evaluate the pathogenic relevance of S13 and S16 phosphorylation in mammalian models of HD, we re-engineered the S13 and S16 residues of our previous BACHD construct (fl-mhtt-[97Q]; Gray et al., 2008Gray M. Shirasaki D.I. Cepeda C. André V.M. Wilburn B. Lu X.H. Tao J. Yamazaki I. Li S.H. Sun Y.E. et al.Full-length human mutant huntingtin with a stable polyglutamine repeat can elicit progressive and selective neuropathogenesis in BACHD mice.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6182-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) to aspartate (SD), a mutation commonly used to mimic serine phosphorylation. We also mutated the two serine residues to alanine (SA), which renders the mhtt NT17 domain incapable of being phosphorylated at these sites (Figure 1A). The structural integrity of the engineered SD and SA BACs were confirmed with pulse field gel electrophoresis (Figure S1A) and the purified DNA was microinjected into FvB/N one-cell embryos to generate transgenic founders (Figures S1B and S1C). Five founders for the BACHD-SD construct and two founders for the BACHD-SA mutant were obtained, and initial expression analyses of the F1 mice from these lines identified two lines with SD mutations (lines B and C) and one line with SA mutations expressing fl-mhtt protein at suitable levels (see below). The mutant htt exon 1 region was PCR amplified and sequenced to confirm the appropriate mutations at S13 and S16, and a polyQ repeat length of 97 (Figures S1D and S1E; Table 1). These mouse lines were expanded by breeding with FvB/NJ wild-type mice, the same inbred mouse background used in the previous phenotypic characterization of BACHD mice (Gray et al., 2008Gray M. Shirasaki D.I. Cepeda C. André V.M. Wilburn B. Lu X.H. Tao J. Yamazaki I. Li S.H.

The binding of these antibodies should be prevented following either SD or SA mutation in fl-mhtt, and only unmodified, phosphorylated htt will be recognized by phosphospecific antibodies. Consistent with this prediction, we were able to immunoprecipitate fl-mhtt from BACHD brains using S13- and S16-phosphospecific htt antibodies, but not the NT17-mutated fl-mhtt from SD and SA brains (Figure S2). Thus, we were able to show that the phosphorylated species of fl-mhtt can be detected in BACHD brains and confirm the molecular specificity of the S13 and S16 mutations in the context of fl-mhtt-[97Q] protein isolated from SD and SA brains. We next assessed the fl-mhtt-[97Q] protein levels in BACHD, BACHD-L, BACHD-SD, and BACHD-SA mice. BACHD-L mice express fl-mhtt-[97Q] at about one-third the level of the BACHD mice but still demonstrate evidence of disease pathogenesis (Gray et al., 2008Gray M. Shirasaki D.I. Cepeda C. André V.M. Wilburn B. Lu X.H. Tao J. Yamazaki I. Li S.H. Sun Y.E. et al.Full-length human mutant huntingtin with a stable polyglutamine repeat can elicit progressive and selective neuropathogenesis in BACHD mice.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6182-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar; Table 1). We performed quantitative western blot analysis to ensure that fl-mhtt-[97Q] protein levels in SD and SA mice were at or above the fl-mhtt-[97Q] level in BACHD-L mice and therefore would be expected to elicit at least some disease pathogenesis. We quantified the relative expression of fl-mhtt-[97Q] using two anti-polyQ monoclonal antibodies: 1C2 (Figure 1B) and 4H7H7 (Figure S3A). The mouse monoclonal 4H7H7 antibody can recognize mhtt N-terminal fragment (1–480 amino acid) with 68Q but not the same htt fragment with 17Q (Figure S3B). 4H7H7 can also recognize on western blots two other expanded polyQ proteins, mutant ataxin-1 and ataxin-3, but not their corresponding wild-type proteins with nonpathogenic polyQ repeats (Figures S3C and S3D). In our series of BACHD models, both 4H7H7 and 1C2 can specifically recognize human mhtt but not endogenous murine wild-type htt (Figures 1B and S3A). Since these different BACHD mouse lines all have the same length polyQ repeat, western blot quantification of fl-mhtt with the anti-polyQ antibody 1C2 can accurately determine the relative expression level of soluble, steady-state fl-mhtt (Figure 1C and Table 1). We determined the relative levels of fl-mhtt-[97Q] in brain extracts from BACHD and BACHD-L heterozygotes, SA heterozygotes, SD-B line homozygotes, and SD-C line homozygotes and heterozygotes [SD-C (het)] (n = 3 per genotype). Using one-way ANOVA with post hoc analysis, we determined that there are no significant differences in fl-mhtt expression levels between the SA, SD-B, and SD-C mice, whereas all of these lines express fl-mhtt-[97Q] protein at significantly higher levels than the BACHD-L line but at lower levels than the BACHD line, suggesting that the SA, SD-B, and SD-C mice express sufficient levels of fl-mhtt-[97Q] to elicit a disease phenotype. To assess whether the SD or SA mutations affect the subcellular distribution and/or the steady-state level of fl-mhtt, we performed a series of western blot analyses. First, subcellular fractionation of cytosolic, nuclear, microsomal, and mitochondrial fractions of the BACHD, SA, and SD-C mice at 2 months of age (n = 3 per genotype) was performed and followed by western analysis using the 1C2 antibody. At our level of detection in the mouse brain extracts, we do not observe any major shifts of the subcellular localization of fl-mhtt or its detectable fragments in SD or SA mutant mice compared to BACHD mice (Figure S4). Next, we sought to determine the steady-state levels of soluble fl-mhtt protein during the aging process to assess whether there is any notable shift in fl-mhtt protein levels or increase in the production of soluble mhtt fragments over time. In each of the three mutant HD mouse lines we have examined, the levels of soluble fl-mhtt are comparable between 2 and 12 months (Figure S5). Moreover, in SD and SA mice, we do not detect any aberrant increase of soluble mhtt polyQ fragments at 12 months, suggesting that age-dependent differences in the abundance of soluble full-length and fragmented mhtt cannot account for any phenotypic changes. In summary, our biochemical analyses demonstrate that SA, SD-B, and SD-C mice express fl-mhtt-[97Q] at levels well above the range expected to elicit disease pathogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, we cannot detect marked differences in S13 and S16 modified fl-mhtt and its polyQ fragments in their subcellular localization or their steady-state, soluble levels over time. We next asked whether S13 and S16 mutated fl-mhtt could still exhibit the essential functions of htt in vivo. We evaluated whether cis-modified htt can rescue the phenotypes of htt knockout mice, including embryonic lethality in the complete null mutant mice (Zeitlin et al., 1995Zeitlin S. Liu J.P. Chapman D.L. Papaioannou V.E. Efstratiadis A. Increased apoptosis and early embryonic lethality in mice nullizygous for the Huntington's disease gene homologue.Nat.

Genet. 1997; 17: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and late-onset cortical neuron degeneration in the forebrain-specific deletion of the htt gene (Dragatsis et al., 2000Dragatsis I. Levine M.S. Zeitlin S. Inactivation of Hdh in the brain and testis results in progressive neurodegeneration and sterility in mice.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that fl-mhtt-[97Q] in BACHD mice can rescue the embryonic lethality of htt knockout mice, confirming that fl-mhtt retains the essential developmental function of htt (Gray et al., 2008Gray M. Shirasaki D.I. Cepeda C. André V.M. Wilburn B. Lu X.H. Tao J. Yamazaki I. Li S.H. Sun Y.E. et al.Full-length human mutant huntingtin with a stable polyglutamine repeat can elicit progressive and selective neuropathogenesis in BACHD mice.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6182-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To assess whether fl-mhtt-[97Q] with SD or SA mutations retain the function of htt, we crossed SA, SD-B, and SD-C heterozygous alleles onto the htt knockout background and scored for the number of the rescued mice born (Gray et al., 2008Gray M. Shirasaki D.I. Cepeda C. André V.M. Wilburn B. Lu X.H. Tao J. Yamazaki I. Li S.H. Sun Y.E. et al.Full-length human mutant huntingtin with a stable polyglutamine repeat can elicit progressive and selective neuropathogenesis in BACHD mice.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6182-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In all three lines, the rescued mice were born in a Mendelian ratio (Figure 2A). Overall, we have obtained at least seven rescued mice per genotype, and these rescued mice express only fl-mhtt-[97Q] with S13 and S16 mutations, but not endogenous wild-type murine htt (Figures 2B and 2C). Since these rescued mice do not show obvious deterioration with age, we could assess whether S13 and S16 mutated fl-mhtt could also rescue the robust late-onset cortical neurodegeneration phenotype between 6 and 12 months of age in the forebrain-specific htt knockout mice (Dragatsis et al., 2000Dragatsis I. Levine M.S. Zeitlin S. Inactivation of Hdh in the brain and testis results in progressive neurodegeneration and sterility in mice.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We performed neuropathological evaluation of the brain sections from 12-month-old SD-B rescue mice and WT control littermates (n = 3 per genotype). As shown in Figures 2D–2G, we did not detect any evidence for neurodegeneration in the cortex of SD-B rescue mice (Figures 2F and 2G), including the piriform cortex near the external capsule where the conditional knockout of htt produced the most notable neurodegeneration (ibid). Together, these studies demonstrate that fl-mhtt with SD or SA mutations retains the essential developmental and neuroprotective function of murine htt. BACHD mice exhibit both motor deficits and enhanced psychiatric-like deficits (Gray et al., 2008Gray M. Shirasaki D.I. Cepeda C. André V.M. Wilburn B. Lu X.H. Tao J. Yamazaki I. Li S.H.

Dis. 2009; 35: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which can be used to address whether S13 and S16 site mutations affect the neuronal dysfunction elicited by fl-mhtt in vivo. To assess motor dysfunction, we applied a two-way mixed factorial design to repeatedly examine the rotarod performance in a cohort of SA, SD-B, and SD-C mice at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. Similar to BACHD and BACHD-L mice (Gray et al., 2008Gray M. Shirasaki D.I. Cepeda C. André V.M. Wilburn B. Lu X.H. Tao J. Yamazaki I. Li S.H. Sun Y.E. et al.Full-length human mutant huntingtin with a stable polyglutamine repeat can elicit progressive and selective neuropathogenesis in BACHD mice.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6182-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar; Table 1), we found that SA mice also exhibit significant rotarod deficits starting at 2 months of age (p < 0.0001, independent sample Student's t test), which progressively worsen at 6 and 12 months of age (p = 0.0001 for 6 month age, p < 0.0001 for 12 month age, Figure 3A).

However, the identity of mirror neurons remains unknown. Here, we investigated whether identified pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) in area F5 of two adult macaques exhibited “mirror-like” activity. About half of the 64 PTNs tested showed significant modulation of their activity while monkeys observed precision grip of an object carried out by an experimenter, with somewhat fewer showing modulation during precision grip without an object or grasping concealed from the monkey. Therefore, mirror-like activity can be transmitted directly to the spinal cord via PTNs. A novel finding is that many PTNs (17/64) showed complete suppression of discharge during action observation, while firing actively when the monkey grasped food rewards. We speculate that this suppression of PTN discharge might be involved in the inhibition of self-movement during action observation.

Mirror neurons were found to constitute a significant fraction (17%) of cells recorded in the rostral division of the ventral premotor cortex (area F5). Further investigations have demonstrated that mirror neurons can fire when a grasping action is performed just out of sight of the monkey (Umiltà et al., 2001Umiltà M.A. Kohler E. Gallese V.

Mirror neurons differentially encode the peripersonal and extrapersonal space of monkeys.Science. 2009; 324: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Some F5 mirror neurons are particularly responsive to orofacial movements related to eating and communication (Ferrari et al., 2003Ferrari P.F. Gallese V. Rizzolatti G. Fogassi L.

Hearing sounds, understanding actions: action representation in mirror neurons.Science. 2002; 297: 846-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Neurons with “mirror-like” activity are not confined to F5 but are also found in the inferior parietal lobule (Fogassi et al., 2005Fogassi L. Ferrari P.F. Gesierich B. Rozzi S. Chersi F. Rizzolatti G. Parietal lobe: from action organization to intention understanding.Science. 2005; 308: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar, Rozzi et al., 2008Rozzi S. Ferrari P.F.

Neural correlates of mental rehearsal in dorsal premotor cortex.Nature. 2004; 431: 993-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Tkach et al., 2007Tkach D. Reimer J. Hatsopoulos N.G. Congruent activity during action and action observation in motor cortex.J.

A number of noninvasive studies have demonstrated a similar mirror neuron system in the human brain (Grafton et al., 1996Grafton S.T. Arbib M.A. Fadiga L. Rizzolatti G.

Brain Res. 1996; 111: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), which has been implicated in a variety of cognitive functions, including understanding the nature and meaning of actions, a wider role in imitation, speech, and emotion (Fabbri-Destro and Rizzolatti, 2008Fabbri-Destro M. Rizzolatti G. Mirror neurons and mirror systems in monkeys and humans.Physiology (Bethesda). 2008; 23: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, Iacoboni, 2009Iacoboni M.

Mirror neurons and their clinical relevance.Nat. Clin. Pract. Neurol. 2009; 5: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, despite the diversity of exciting potential roles for such a system, we still know very little about the identity of the mirror neurons themselves. Because extracellular recording in monkey cortex is inherently biased toward large neurons, it is likely that all mirror neurons are pyramidal neurons rather than cortical interneurons. However, it is unknown whether mirror neurons are involved in processing of afferent inputs or represent outputs to other motor structures. Because PMv contributes to the corticospinal tract (Dum and Strick, 1991Dum R.P. Strick P.L. The origin of corticospinal projections from the premotor areas in the frontal lobe.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 667-689PubMed Google Scholar), it is critical to investigate whether pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) within area F5 show mirror-like activity. This study was carried out in two macaque monkeys trained to perform both a precision grip task (Baker et al., 1999Baker S.N. Philbin N. Spinks R. Pinches E.M. Wolpert D.M. MacManus D.G. Pauluis Q.

However, this paper reports only studies involving grasping actions and action observation by these monkeys and is entirely focused on fully analyzed recordings from 64 identified PTNs selected for recording on the basis of their antidromic activation from the pyramidal tract (PT). Most of the PTNs (53) were recorded in a monkey (M43) in which we also made simultaneous EMG recordings from nine arm, hand, and digit muscles; another 11 PTNs were recorded in the second monkey (M41). All PTNs were recorded in the rostral division (area F5; Matelli and Luppino, 1996Matelli M. Luppino G. Thalamic input to mesial and superior area 6 in the macaque monkey.J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 372: 59-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in the right hemisphere (Supplemental Data, Figure S1). Area F5 was characterized by brisk neuronal activity for grasp with either the contra- or ipsilateral hand and by the presence of contralateral digit movements evoked by ICMS at thresholds >15 μA at recording sites. Most PTNs (75%) were recorded 1–3 mm from electrode entry and were probably located on the convexity of the ventral precentral gyrus. The database contained only those PTNs that satisfied strict criteria for antidromic activation, including the collision test (see Experimental Procedures), and whose spikes could be reliably discriminated throughout a range of tests designed to evoke mirror-like activity (Experimental Procedures). The implanted electrodes used to identify these PTNs were confirmed to be located in the ipsilateral pyramidal tract (PT) by a number of electrophysiological and histological tests (Experimental Procedures, Figure 1). The main findings are illustrated by two F5 PTNs (Figure 2) with completely different patterns of activity. The first PTN, shown in Figures 2A–2J, showed bursts of activity when the monkey reached out and used its contralateral hand to grasp a small piece of food placed in front of it (see photo Figure 2A). Rasters of discharge for a block of grasp trials (Figure 2B) and averaged discharge (Figure 2C) were aligned to the cue for the monkey to begin its reach-to-grasp movement, which was accompanied by bursts of EMG activity in arm (deltoid), wrist (extensor carpi ulnaris, ECU), and digit (thenar) muscles (Figure 2D). The mirror-like activity of this PTN is shown in Figures 2F–2I. The experimenter, sitting directly in front of the monkey, started each trial with her right hand motionless on a touch-sensitive pad. After a short baseline period, she released her hand from the pad (magenta asterisks in Figure 2G) and approached a piece of food previously placed in an “action observation area” that was in the monkey's midline and just beyond its reach. The monkey sat calmly throughout this process and made no hand or arm movements, as evidenced by the complete absence of EMG activity in all recorded muscles during the period of action observation (−750 to +750 ms). Figure 2I shows all superimposed trials of EMG recordings from nine arm, wrist, and digit muscles; all recordings were essentially flat. As the experimenter's hand neared the food, the PTN steadily increased its firing rate, peaking after the experimenter's hand touched the food target, and grasped it in a precision grip. This moment (indicated by the black line at time 0) was detected by a sensor located within the observation area responding to a small magnet attached to the tip of the experimenter's finger (Experimental Procedures). Note the reproducible pattern of discharge in the raster plots for the block of action observation trials. Note also that during action observation, the PTN fired with maximum rates similar to those observed during the monkey's own grasping movement (Figure 2C). Antidromic stimulation and use of the collision test (Baker et al., 1999Baker S.N. Philbin N. Spinks R. Pinches E.M. Wolpert D.M. MacManus D.G. Pauluis Q. Lemon R.N. Multiple single unit recording in the cortex of monkeys using independently moveable microelectrodes.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 94: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) confirmed that the same PTN was recorded throughout the periods of active grasp (Figure 2E) and action observation (Figure 2J). A quite different pattern was found for other PTNs, an example of which is shown in Figures 2K–2T. In this case, although the PTN again showed increased bursts of activity as the monkey reached and grasped the food reward (Figures 2L and 2M), its background discharge was completely suppressed during action observation (Figures 2Q and 2R). Once again, this suppression of activity was highly reproducible from trial to trial (Figure 2Q). Another example of suppression-type PTNs is shown in Figure S5. Of the 64 PTNs analyzed, 31 (49%) showed statistically significant modulation in their discharge in the 1.5 s period centered around the sensor signal (Experimental Procedures). Of these PTNs, 14/64 (22%) were of the facilitation type (cf. Figures 2G and 2H) while 17/64 (27%) showed suppression (cf. Figures 2Q and 2R). Both types were recorded in both monkeys. For the 53 PTNs recorded in monkey M43, we analyzed EMG and excluded a total of 15 PTNs that were recorded in sessions where there was significant modulation of EMG activity during action observation (see Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Data). Of these remaining 48 PTNs, 11 (23%) were of the facilitation type, while 14 (29%) showed suppression. The population responses of both types of F5 mirror-like PTNs during action observation, aligned to the sensor signal, are presented in Figure 3A. Facilitation (red line) and suppression (blue) types showed changes in firing rate around the time that the experimenter began the movement (−1 s; magenta asterisks in Figures 2G and 2Q). The facilitation type showed the classical pattern of mirror-like activity with facilitation during both action observation (Figure 3A) and grasp (Figure 3B). The suppression type showed a strong and protracted suppression of discharge during action observation (Figure 3A), but, like the PTN in Figures 2L and 2M, were facilitated during active grasp (Figure 3B), with a similar time course to that of the facilitation type of mirror PTN. Indeed, 14/17 (83%) suppression-type PTNs, like most F5 neurons, showed significantly increased discharge when the monkey actively grasped the food with the contralateral hand. Of course, detection of a suppression response during action observation required the PTN to have some ongoing, background discharge activity, and it is known that PTNs generally have higher rates than other classes of cortical neuron (Baker et al., 2001Baker S.N. Spinks R. Jackson A. Lemon R.N. Synchronization in monkey motor cortex during a precision grip task. I. Task-dependent modulation in single-unit synchrony.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 869-885PubMed Google Scholar, Merchant et al., 2008Merchant H. Naselaris T. Georgopoulos A.P. Dynamic sculpting of directional tuning in the primate motor cortex during three-dimensional reaching.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9164-9172Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We found that the mean background firing rate for PTNs showing suppression (14.8 ± 6.0 sp/s) was significantly higher than that of PTNs showing facilitation (6.2 ± 6.1 sp/s; p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The average firing rate of F5 PTNs that did not exhibit any mirror-like activity (Figure 3A, green line) showed only a slight deviation from baseline throughout whole observation period. During active grasp (Figure 3B, green), they were activated to a somewhat less marked degree than mirror PTNs. Most F5 PTNs exhibited mirror-like modulation of discharge during observation of grasps carried out in different contexts by the experimenter (Experimental Procedures). In the example shown in Figures 4A–4C, the PTN's ongoing discharge was completely suppressed when the monkey observed the experimenter performing precision grip of food (Figure 4A), but also when this same precision grip was carried out without the food being present (Figure 4B). In other words, this PTN's discharge was also suppressed when an “intransitive” action, with no apparent goal, was carried out by the experimenter. Discharge suppression also occurred when the experimenter reached into a small food bowl; her grasp within the bowl was concealed from the monkey by the bowl's opaque sides (Figure 4C). 73% of PTNs that were modulated during observation of precision grip with an object were modulated during precision grip without an object, and 64% were modulated during concealed grasp. The pie charts in Figures 4D–4F show the proportion of PTNs with mirror-like properties that were detected in action observation sessions free of EMG contamination. Similar proportions of PTNs showed significant modulation during action observation of precision grip with an object (52%; Figure 4D) and concealed grasp (45%; Figure 4F), but were less common during precision grip without an object (29%; Figure 4E). In all three contexts, PTNs showing suppression of discharge were at least as common as those showing facilitation of their discharge. Suppression of discharge was also seen in some of these PTNs during other types of action, such as advancing of the experimenter's hand toward a reward and covering the reward with the outstretched hand, but not grasping it (Supplemental Data). Figure 5 shows that F5 PTNs (red bars) had relatively long antidromic latencies (median ADL 2.6 ms, indicated by red arrow) and clearly belonged to a slowly conducting population significantly slower than the fast-conducting M1 PTNs (open columns; median ADL 0.9 ms, indicated by black arrow) encountered in the M1 hand area of the same monkeys (Figure S1). Although the majority of M1 PTNs had ADLs close to 1 ms, we also recorded some slow M1 PTNs. The distribution of F5 PTNs was not as skewed as in M1 and was more symmetrical around the median. The subset of F5 PTNs that showed mirror-like activity is shown with blue bars. Their ADLs were not significantly different from the subset without mirror-like activity. We have demonstrated that within area F5 of ventral premotor cortex mirror-like activity is present in output neurons that project through the pyramidal tract and in all likelihood to the spinal cord (Humphrey and Corrie, 1978Humphrey D.R. Corrie W.S. Properties of pyramidal tract neuron system within a functionally defined subregion of primate motor cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1978; 41: 216-243PubMed Google Scholar, Lemon, 2008Lemon R.N. Descending pathways in motor control.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Thus, activity within the mirror-neuron system is communicated directly to other regions of the motor network, including its subcortical components, and will probably have functional consequences for these components. The F5 PTNs we recorded were found in the same region of area F5 as in the original report by Gallese et al., 1996Gallese V. Fadiga L. Fogassi L. Rizzolatti G. Action recognition in the premotor cortex.Brain. 1996; 119: 593-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar and were mostly located on the convexity of the gyrus, as predicted from retrograde labeling of corticospinal neurons (He et al., 1993He S.Q. Dum R.P. Strick P.L. Topographic organization of corticospinal projections from the frontal lobe: motor areas on the lateral surface of the hemisphere.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 952-980PubMed Google Scholar). A significant proportion of these PTNs were activated during observation of grasping actions in different contexts, including intransitive precision grip and grasp that was concealed from the monkey. We do not consider that the mirror-like activity in PTNs that were facilitated during action observation resulted from covert movement by the monkey. Our data show unequivocally that mirror-like activity can be evoked without any concomitant EMG activity (Figure 2). A novel finding is the description of F5 PTNs with a steady resting discharge that was completely suppressed during the mirror tests. To date, all published records of mirror neurons are characterized by a very low or absent background discharge that changes to a brisk increase in firing rate during both action observation and the monkey's own grasp (Caggiano et al., 2009Caggiano V.

J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1569-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). There have been no published examples of firing suppression in F5 (but see Supplementary Materials of Caggiano et al., 2009Caggiano V. Fogassi L. Rizzolatti G. Thier P. Casile A. Mirror neurons differentially encode the peripersonal and extrapersonal space of monkeys.Science. 2009; 324: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The suppression type of PTN was as prevalent in our sample of F5 PTNs as the facilitation type (56% versus 44%). Preliminary comparison with recordings of other neurons in the same monkeys and sessions demonstrates that suppression of activity may be significantly more common among PTNs in F5 compared with unidentified neurons in the same area. Interestingly, these suppression PTNs, unlike classical mirror neurons, provide an unambiguous signal as to whether the current state involves action observation (suppressed discharge) or active grasp (elevated discharge; see Figure 3). The two classes of facilitation and suppression mirror neurons may operate independently or be part of the same functional circuit. The presence of two different patterns of mirror-like activity in PTNs provides a possible explanation for contrasting changes in the excitability of the human motor system during action observation. Thus, facilitation mirror PTNs might explain the “motor resonance” phenomenon in which the excitability of hand motoneurons in an observer mirrors or resonates with that of the actor (Cattaneo et al., 2009Cattaneo L. Caruana F. Jezzini A. Rizzolatti G. Representation of goal and movements without overt motor behavior in the human motor cortex: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.J.

Modulation of cortical excitability during action observation: a transcranial magnetic stimulation study.Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2289-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated dynamic and specific mechanisms that may serve to prevent such resonance being elaborated into overt movements (Baldissera et al., 2001Baldissera F. Cavallari P. Craighero L. Fadiga L. Modulation of spinal excitability during observation of hand actions in humans.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 190-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that such changes could result from a disfacilitation of motoneurons caused by suppression of activity in PTNs during action observation. It should be stressed that although we suggest that these PTNs might be concerned with suppression of self-movement during action observation, we think of this as a suppression mechanism that might allow the withholding of a number of hand actions, rather than suppression of one particular act, for example the suppression of imitation. Indeed, many F5 PTNs were suppressed during observation of grasping actions in a variety of contexts (Figure 4). A role for macaque PTNs in imitation, or its suppression, seems unlikely, since it is known that adult macaque monkeys have a limited capacity for motor imitation (Ferrari et al., 2006Ferrari P.F. Visalberghi E. Paukner A. Fogassi L. Ruggiero A. Suomi S.J. Neonatal imitation in rhesus macaques.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e302Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, Visalberghi and Fragaszy, 2002Visalberghi E. Fragaszy D. “Do monkeys ape?” Ten years after.in: Dautenhahn K. Nehaniv C. Imitation in Animals and Artefacts. MIT Press, Cambridge2002Google Scholar). In macaques, F5 contributes a relatively small proportion of the total corticospinal output from the frontal lobe, around 4% (Dum and Strick, 1991Dum R.P. Strick P.L. The origin of corticospinal projections from the premotor areas in the frontal lobe.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 667-689PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the F5 PTNs we sampled had rather slowly conducting axons and are obviously different from the large, fast PTNs that characterize the M1 output (Figure 5). Only a minority of F5 PTNs terminate in the lower cervical motor nuclei innervating digit muscles (He et al., 1993He S.Q. Dum R.P. Strick P.L. Topographic organization of corticospinal projections from the frontal lobe: motor areas on the lateral surface of the hemisphere.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 952-980PubMed Google Scholar). In terms of facilitatory actions, it has not yet been shown that F5 makes any contribution to direct cortico-motoneuronal excitatory projection (Lemon, 2008Lemon R.N.

Motor effects elicited by ICMS, similar to those found at F5 recording sites in this study, may be largely mediated through cortico-cortical interactions with M1 (Schmidlin et al., 2008Schmidlin E.

https://openalex.org/W2064827935,"Persistent changes in synaptic strength are locally regulated by both protein degradation and synthesis; however, the coordination of these opposing limbs is poorly understood. Here, we found that the RISC protein MOV10 was present at synapses and was rapidly degraded by the proteasome in an NMDA-receptor-mediated activity-dependent manner. We designed a translational trap to capture those mRNAs whose spatiotemporal translation is regulated by MOV10. When MOV10 was suppressed, a set of mRNAs--including alpha-CaMKII, Limk1, and the depalmitoylating enzyme lysophospholipase1 (Lypla1)--selectively entered the polysome compartment. We also observed that Lypla1 mRNA is associated with the brain-enriched microRNA miR-138. Using a photoconvertible translation reporter, Kaede, we analyzed the activity-dependent protein synthesis driven by Lypla1 and alpha-CaMKII 3'UTRs. We established this protein synthesis to be MOV10 and proteasome dependent. These results suggest a unifying picture of a local translational regulatory mechanism during synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2046340161,"How do neuronal populations represent concurrent stimuli? We measured population responses in cat primary visual cortex (V1) using electrode arrays. Population responses to two superimposed gratings were weighted sums of the individual grating responses. The weights depended strongly on the relative contrasts of the gratings. When the contrasts were similar, the population performed an approximately equal summation. When the contrasts differed markedly, however, the population performed approximately a winner-take-all competition. Stimuli that were intermediate to these extremes elicited intermediate responses. This entire range of behaviors was explained by a single model of contrast normalization. Normalization captured both the spike responses and the local field potential responses; it even predicted visually evoked currents source-localized to V1 in human subjects. Normalization has profound effects on V1 population responses and is likely to shape the interpretation of these responses by higher cortical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2048516550,"In mammals, the first step in the perception of form and texture is the activation of trigeminal or dorsal root ganglion (DRG) mechanosensory neurons, which are classified as either rapidly (RA) or slowly adapting (SA) according to their rates of adaptation to sustained stimuli. The molecular identities and mechanisms of development of RA and SA mechanoreceptors are largely unknown. We found that the ""early Ret(+)"" DRG neurons are RA mechanoreceptors, which form Meissner corpuscles, Pacinian corpuscles, and longitudinal lanceolate endings. The central projections of these RA mechanoreceptors innervate layers III through V of the spinal cord and terminate within discrete subdomains of the dorsal column nuclei. Moreover, mice lacking Ret signaling components are devoid of Pacinian corpuscles and exhibit a dramatic disruption of RA mechanoreceptor projections to both the spinal cord and medulla. Thus, the early Ret(+) neurons are RA mechanoreceptors and Ret signaling is required for the assembly of neural circuits underlying touch perception."
https://openalex.org/W1974705591,"We measured the time course of sodium entry during action potentials of mouse central neurons at 37°C to examine how efficiently sodium entry is coupled to depolarization. In cortical pyramidal neurons, sodium entry was nearly completely confined to the rising phase of the spike: only ∼25% more sodium enters than the theoretical minimum necessary for spike depolarization. However, in fast-spiking GABAergic neurons (cerebellar Purkinje cells and cortical interneurons), twice as much sodium enters as the theoretical minimum. The extra entry occurs because sodium channel inactivation is incomplete during the falling phase of the spike. The efficiency of sodium entry in different cell types is primarily a function of action potential shape and not cell-type-specific differences in sodium channel kinetics. The narrow spikes of fast-spiking GABAergic neurons result in incomplete inactivation of sodium channels; this reduces metabolic efficiency but likely enhances the ability to fire spikes at high frequency.

The narrow spikes of fast-spiking GABAergic neurons result in incomplete inactivation of sodium channels; this reduces metabolic efficiency but likely enhances the ability to fire spikes at high frequency. Action potentials in mammalian neurons use the concentration gradients of sodium and potassium ions to encode and transmit information by a transient change in membrane voltage. In this process, the ionic gradients are partially dissipated and must be restored by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, requiring metabolic energy. For an action potential in which the rising phase is generated by sodium entry and the falling phase by potassium efflux, there would be perfect metabolic efficiency if sodium entry were confined to the rising phase and potassium efflux to the falling phase, each carrying the minimum charge needed to produce the voltage change during the action potential (CΔV, where C is the capacitance of the membrane and ΔV is the change in voltage during the spike). However, the extent to which this can be achieved depends on the gating kinetics of the underlying voltage-dependent channels. In practice, the time course of sodium channel inactivation is especially critical. In the classic analysis by Hodgkin and Huxley of the squid axon action potential, the predicted sodium entry is roughly four times the minimum needed for the change in voltage, primarily because sodium channels remain open to a significant extent during the falling phase of the action potential (Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952Hodgkin A.L.

Sodium and potassium conductance changes during a membrane action potential.J. Physiol. 1970; 211: 729-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Action potentials in mammalian central neurons are fundamentally similar to those in the squid axon in having a rising phase generated by sodium current and falling phase mediated by potassium current. However, many parameters likely to influence the kinetics of sodium entry and metabolic efficiency—including action potential shape, types and densities of sodium and potassium channels, channel kinetics, and temperature—are very different for mammalian neurons than the squid axon. A variety of data suggests that sodium entry may generally be more efficient in generating action potentials in mammalian neurons than in the squid axon. Direct measurements of sodium current kinetics during action potential waveforms in a variety of central neurons in rat and mouse brains show that there is generally far less sodium entry during the falling phase of the action potential than the rising phase (Raman and Bean, 1997Raman I.M.

However, an important limitation of these results is that all were obtained for action potentials and currents at room temperature. A recent examination of this issue for the action potentials in mossy fiber boutons of hippocampal granule neurons showed that even at 37°C, sodium entry is much more confined to the rising phase than in the squid axon, with only ∼30% “extra” sodium entry (Alle et al., 2009Alle H.

Neurosci. 2007; 8: 451-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar), it is unclear how general this result is likely to be. We set out to determine how efficiently sodium entry is used in the formation of action potentials in a variety of mammalian central neurons at physiological temperature. We find that the extent to which entry of sodium is limited to the rising phase—and thus the corresponding metabolic efficiency—varies considerably among cell types. Cortical pyramidal neurons operate with a high degree of ionic efficiency, but cerebellar Purkinje neurons and cortical basket cell interneurons have much less efficient action potentials. Comparing the different neuronal types, we find that the efficiency of the sodium entry is primarily a function of action potential shape and is largely independent of cell-type-specific differences in sodium channel kinetics. The lower metabolic efficiency of the action potential in fast-spiking neurons results from incomplete inactivation of sodium channels during the narrow action potential, which leads to unnecessary sodium influx but likely enhances the ability of the neurons to fire rapidly. To measure sodium entry during the action potential, we recorded the action potential in a neuron and then used it as the voltage command in voltage clamp, recording the elicited ionic current and using tetrodotoxin (TTX) to isolate the current entering through voltage-gated sodium channels. We used acutely dissociated neurons to enable accurate voltage clamp and ensure spatial uniformity of voltage. To achieve good voltage-clamp control of the large and fast sodium currents flowing at 37°C, we used a partially blocking concentration of TTX to reduce the size of the currents, thereby reducing errors arising from imperfectly compensated series resistance of the pipette tip. Because TTX blocks channels in an all-or-none manner (Hille, 1966Hille B. Common mode of action of three agents that decrease the transient change in sodium permeability in nerves.Nature. 1966; 210: 1220-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we could then scale the recorded current to that expected in the absence of TTX, using a scaling factor experimentally determined (in each cell) from the degree of block by TTX. Figure 1 shows this procedure. An action potential recorded from a cortical pyramidal neuron at 37°C (Figure 1A, top) was used as command waveform to elicit ionic current in the same cell (Figure 1A, bottom) either with sodium current present but reduced (in 90 nM TTX) or after complete block of sodium current (in 1 μM TTX). To determine the factor by which current was reduced by 90 nM TTX, the effect of TTX on current elicited by a step from −88 to +12 mV was measured in the same cell (Figure 1B). Then the action-potential-elicited sodium current expected in the absence of TTX (Figure 1C, red trace) was determined by scaling the sodium current recorded in partially blocking TTX (after subtraction of traces recorded with full TTX block) by 3.9, the factor by which 90 nM TTX reduced step-evoked current. This sodium current is compared with the total net ionic current flowing during the action potential, which can be calculated from the action potential waveform as –C × dV/dt, where C is the cell capacitance and dV/dt is the time derivative of the voltage (Hodgkin et al., 1952Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. Katz B. Measurement of current-voltage relations in the membrane of the giant axon of Loligo.J. Physiol. 1952; 116: 424-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar; Figure 1A, bottom, blue trace). The two currents are very similar in size during the rising phase of the action potential, which gives credence to the accuracy of the scaling procedure. The close temporal overlap in the rising phase also supports the accuracy of a correction for a time lag in the recorded membrane current relative to command voltage (see Experimental Procedures). In this cortical pyramidal neuron, there was very little sodium current flowing after the peak of the action potential. We quantified the sodium entry during the action potential (sodium current integrated over the entire action potential) relative to the minimal necessary sodium entry (CΔV, where C is cell capacitance and ΔV is the change in voltage during the action potential). In this cell, the “sodium entry ratio” calculated in this way was 1.04. Figure 1D shows collected results from eight cortical pyramidal neurons; the average sodium entry ratio was 1.24 ± 0.29 (mean ± standard deviation). The action potentials of these neurons reached a peak of +19 ± 8 mV and had an average width (measured at half-maximum amplitude) of 1.21 ± 0.29 ms, typical values for cortical pyramidal neurons (Connors et al., 1982Connors B.W.

Selective control of cortical axonal spikes by a slowly inactivating K+ current.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 11453-11458Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Also typical of cortical pyramidal neurons, the maximum dV/dt in the upstroke is large compared to that of the downstroke (ratio of 6.5 ± 1.3), similar to previous measurements in cortical pyramidal neurons in guinea pig (McCormick et al., 1985McCormick D.A.

Neurophysiol. 1985; 54: 782-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). The shape of action potentials differs among various types of neurons in the mammalian brain. In general, GABAergic neurons have narrower spikes than glutamatergic neurons and often have a “fast-spiking” phenotype, with a capability of firing steadily at high frequencies during prolonged stimulation (McCormick et al., 1985McCormick D.A.

Cerebellar Purkinje neurons are fast-spiking GABAergic neurons with narrow action potentials that can maintain steady firing rates of more than 200 Hz when stimulated (Llinás and Sugimori, 1980Llinás R. Sugimori M. Electrophysiological properties of in vitro Purkinje cell somata in mammalian cerebellar slices.J. Physiol. 1980; 305: 171-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Figure 2 shows an analysis of sodium entry during the action potential of a Purkinje neuron. In striking contrast to the cortical pyramidal neuron action potential, a substantial sodium influx was present during the falling phase of the Purkinje neuron action potential, as well as during the rising phase. In fact, more sodium entered during the falling phase of the action potential than during the rising phase. The sodium current during the upstroke reaches a maximum shortly before the peak of the action potential. At exactly the time of the peak, there is a dip in the sodium current reflecting the decreased driving force on sodium ions. This is followed by a second phase of sodium entry on the downstroke, presumably reflecting the increase in driving force during repolarization while at least some channels remain open. Largely because of the substantial “extra” sodium entry during the falling phase, the sodium entry ratio was 2.3. In collected results from seven Purkinje neurons, the sodium entry ratio was 2.00 ± 0.61, which was significantly different from cortical neurons (p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). The action potentials in these neurons had an average width of 0.23 ± 0.06 ms, peak of +13 ± 10 mV, and upstroke/downstroke ratio of 1.4 ± 0.4. To explore whether these differences in sodium entry are likely to be general among other types of fast-spiking versus non-fast-spiking neurons, we examined two other types of neurons. To examine another class of fast-spiking neurons, we isolated cortical interneurons from a transgenic mouse in which a subset of fast-spiking cortical GABAergic interneurons corresponding to parvalbumin-positive basket cells are labeled with enhanced GFP (Chattopadhyaya et al., 2004Chattopadhyaya B. Di Cristo G. Higashiyama H. Knott G.W. Kuhlman S.J. Welker E. Huang Z.J. Experience and activity-dependent maturation of perisomatic GABAergic innervation in primary visual cortex during a postnatal critical period.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9598-9611Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Figure 3A shows an example of a recording from a labeled GABAergic interneuron. As expected, the action potential was narrow (width of 0.30 ms). There was substantial entry of sodium during the falling phase, and the sodium entry ratio in this cell was 1.5. This was typical; in collected results (Figure 3B), the sodium entry ratio was 1.98 ± 0.55 (n = 5) for GABAergic interneurons, very similar to Purkinje neurons. These cells had an average spike width of 0.34 ± 0.08 ms, peak of +12 ± 7 mV, and upstroke/downstroke ratio of 1.6 ± 0.5, similar to previous measurements of fast-spiking cortical interneurons (McCormick et al., 1985McCormick D.A.

Neurophysiol. 1993; 70: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar). Figure 3C shows an analysis of sodium entry in a pyramidal neuron isolated from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. These neurons had action potential widths that varied from 0.41 to 1.4 ms (with a mean of 0.83 ± 0.33 ms) and had peaks of +18 ± 5 mV. For the cell in Figure 3C, the spike width was 1.4 ms and the sodium entry ratio was 1.3. In collected results (Figure 3D), the sodium entry ratio was 1.62 ± 0.67 for CA1 pyramidal neurons, less than either of the GABAergic cell types but more than cortical pyramidal neurons. Figure 4 shows the collected results for sodium entry ratio for individual neurons for all four cell types. Systematic differences among the cell types are apparent, with Purkinje neurons and cortical interneurons having the largest amount of extra sodium entry and cortical pyramidal neurons the smallest. Moreover, comparing all cells, there was an inverse correlation of the sodium entry ratio with the width of the action potential (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = −0.48, p = 0.012, n = 28). This correlation is consistent with the two fast-spiking cell types with narrow action potentials having the most extra sodium entry and cortical pyramidal neurons, with the widest action potentials, having the least. The sodium entry ratio gives a measure of how efficiently sodium entry is used for spike depolarization. We also used our data to calculate total sodium entry per action potential, which takes into account differences in action potential height. To do this calculation, we integrated sodium current during an action potential, converted it to moles of sodium ions, and normalized it to membrane area (measured from the cell capacitance, assuming 1 μF/cm2). The sodium influx per action potential was 0.82 ± 0.30 pmole/cm2 (n = 8) for cortical pyramidal neurons, 1.54 ± 0.54 pmole/cm2 (n = 7 for Purkinje neurons, 1.36 ± 0.27 pmole/cm2 (n = 5) for cortical interneurons, and 1.27 ± 0.65 pmole/cm2 (n = 8) for hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Thus, as expected from the sodium entry ratio, cortical pyramidal neurons had the least sodium entry and Purkinje neurons the most, with interneurons and CA1 pyramidal neurons intermediate. The sodium entry per spike in both Purkinje neurons and cortical interneurons was significantly greater than in cortical pyramidal neurons (p = 0.018 and p = 0.011, respectively, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). In the recordings for each individual cell, it was clear that the amount by which the sodium entry ratio exceeds unity is mainly dependent on the extent of sodium entry during the falling phase of the action potential. Therefore, a simple way of estimating sodium efficiency is to compare total sodium entry during the entire action potential to the sodium entry during the rising phase (up to the peak of action potential). In principle, this measurement would underestimate the sodium entry ratio if there is substantial potassium current flowing before the peak of the action potential, in which case sodium entry even during the rising phase would have to exceed CΔV by the amount of overlapping charge carried by potassium efflux. In fact, however, estimating efficiency as the ratio of total sodium entry to rising phase sodium entry gave nearly identical results as measuring it by total sodium entry/CΔV. For example, the ratio of total sodium entry/rising phase sodium entry is 1.12 for the cortical pyramidal neuron in Figure 1C versus 1.04 calculated as total sodium entry/CΔV; the analogous values by the two methods were 2.29 versus 2.31 for the Purkinje neuron in Figure 2A, 1.34 versus 1.57 for the cortical interneuron in Figure 3A, and 1.23 versus 1.29 for the CA1 pyramidal neuron in Figure 3C. The close correspondence of the two methods is expected if relatively little potassium current flows before the peak of the action potential. This appears to be case (for all the cell types) because the sodium current measured in voltage clamp superimposes well with total ionic current (–C × dV/dt) until just before the peak. Differences in sodium channel kinetics have been found among various types of central neurons. For example, using identical recording conditions, differences in sodium channel kinetics have been seen comparing hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons with fast-spiking hippocampal interneurons (Martina and Jonas, 1997Martina M. Jonas P. Functional differences in Na+ channel gating between fast-spiking interneurones and principal neurones of rat hippocampus.J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and Purkinje neurons with hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (Raman and Bean, 1997Raman I.M. Bean B.P. Resurgent sodium current and action potential formation in dissociated cerebellar Purkinje neurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4517-4526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, one explanation of the difference in action potential efficiency could be different sodium channel kinetics in the different cell types. Because the second method of estimating sodium efficiency is based simply on the timing of sodium entry during the action potential, it does not require using the cell's own action potential. We could therefore test whether the differences in efficiency among the different cell types are primarily due to differences in action potential shape or differences in sodium channel kinetics by measuring the time course of sodium entry in each cell type using prerecorded action potentials from all four cell types (Figure 5). We found that efficiency of sodium influx depends primarily on action potential shape and not cell-type-specific sodium channel kinetics. For example, using a Purkinje neuron action potential (Figure 5A, first column), all four cell types showed a large amount of sodium entry during the falling phase, while with an action potential from a cortical pyramidal neuron (Figure 5A, fourth column), sodium influx was nearly completely confined to the rising phase in all four cell types. Figure 5B summarizes collected data and illustrates that the sodium entry ratio depends on action potential shape, with little apparent influence of sodium channel differences among the cell types. The component of sodium entry occurring during the falling phase of the action potential in fast-spiking neurons must reflect channels that have not inactivated. The termination of this current could be due to either inactivation continuing as the falling phase progresses or to deactivation of channels that are still not inactivated. It is of interest to know whether inactivation becomes complete during the falling phase, since this will greatly influence the refractory period after the spike. To examine this, we performed an experiment to assay the time course of sodium channel availability during and after the action potential. The first part of the command consisted of an action potential waveform, which was followed by a test pulse to −8 mV to assay the degree of sodium channel availability. The test pulse was applied at various times during the falling phase of the action potential. The peak sodium current during each test pulse was compared to that elicited from a step to −8 mV from −88 mV, where availability was maximal. Figure 6A shows this protocol applied in a Purkinje neuron. It was clear from this experiment that sodium channel inactivation is never complete, even during the falling phase and immediately after the action potential. During the falling phase, the availability declined from about 0.32 early in the falling phase to a minimum of 0.17, reached when the action potential had repolarized to about –51 mV (Figure 6B). The lack of complete inactivation measured in this way is consistent with the substantial sodium current seen during the falling phase of Purkinje neuron action potentials. Interestingly, recovery from inactivation started near a voltage of −68 mV, even before the spike was over. The time course of sodium channel availability during the falling phase shows that the decay of sodium current during the falling phase of the spike is in part ongoing inactivation and in part deactivation. Figures 6C and 6D illustrate the same analysis for sodium channel inactivation during the action potential in a cortical pyramidal neuron. Here, inactivation becomes complete during the falling phase of the action potential, at a voltage of about −40 mV. Figure 7 shows collected results from this experimental protocol performed in all four cell types. In both Purkinje neurons and cortical interneurons, inactivation was never complete even when it was maximal immediately after the action potential; on average, the minimum availability was 0.15 ± 0.05 (n = 15) for Purkinje neurons and 0.07 ± 0.04 (n = 10) for cortical interneurons. In contrast, inactivation was essentially complete in cortical pyramidal neurons (minimum availability of 0.003 ± 0.007, n = 5) and in hippocampal CA1 neurons (0.02 ± 0.02, n = 7) by the end of the action potential. Thus, in the two fast-spiking cells but not the pyramidal neurons, there is a significant fraction of sodium channels available (noninactivated) immediately after the spike. In addition to inactivation being incomplete in fast-spiking neurons, recovery from inactivation after a spike was also faster in fast-spiking neurons than in pyramidal neurons. At least in part, this is likely to be because more negative voltages are reached more quickly after the peak. In Purkinje neurons and cortical interneurons, availability returns to >75% within 2.5 ms, while in both types of pyramidal neurons, availability is still below 75% after 5 ms. To test whether the differences in completeness of inactivation are a property of action potential shape or differences in sodium channel kinetics among the cell types, we did experiments using action potential waveforms from all four cell types applied to sodium currents in each cell type (Figure 7B). As for the sodium entry results in Figure 5, we found that the extent to which inactivation is complete after a spike depends primarily on action potential shape and much less on cell-specific sodium channel kinetics. There are small differences in channel kinetics among the cell types when tested with a given waveform; for example, the minimum availability following a Purkinje neuron spike waveform was greater for sodium currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons (0.26 ± 0.0.07, n = 8) than for sodium currents in Purkinje neurons (0.15 ± 0.05, n = 15). However, such cell-type-specific differences were much smaller than the differences among the waveforms tested on the same cell type. When tested with a Purkinje neuron waveform, sodium currents in all four cell types had substantial availability (mean values > 0.15) while with either a CA1 pyramidal neuron waveform or a cortical pyramidal neuron waveform, inactivation was essentially complete (mean availability < 0.02) for sodium currents in all four cell types. Our results show that the efficiency with which sodium entry is used for action potential formation varies considerably among different types of mouse central neurons, with sodium entry only ∼25% more than the theoretical minimum in cortical pyramidal neurons but ∼2-fold the minimum in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. In particular, the two types of fast-spiking GABAergic neurons we examined had substantially more “excess” sodium entry than cortical pyramidal neurons or most CA1 pyramidal neurons. The strong correlation of excess sodium entry with narrow action potentials suggests that the excess sodium entry associated with fast-spiking neurons is likely to be general, since there is a clear correlation between fast-spiking behavior and narrow action p"

The genetic disruption of ASIC2 recapitulates the pathological dysautonomia seen in heart failure and hypertension and defines a molecular defect that may be relevant to its development. The arterial baroreceptor reflex, which originates in arterial baroreceptors, is a key regulator of arterial blood pressure, blood volume, and the neurohumoral control of the circulation (Landgren, 1952Landgren S. On the excitation mechanism of the carotid baroceptors.Acta Physiol. Scand. 1952; 26: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Heymans and Neil, 1958Heymans C. Neil E. Reflexogenic Areas of the Cardiovascular System. Little, Brown & Co., Boston1958Google Scholar). The baroreceptors are sensory nerve endings in the aortic arch and carotid sinuses. Their somata are located in the nodose ganglia and petrosal ganglia, respectively. An increase in blood pressure stretches the baroreceptor nerve endings and triggers afferent signals that are transmitted centrally via the aortic depressor and carotid sinus nerves and modulate the autonomic efferent activity. Activation of these baroreceptor nerves decreases sympathetic nerve activity and increases parasympathetic nerve activity. Thus, the consequences of activation of baroreceptors are a reduction in heart rate, cardiac output, and vascular resistance that buffer the increase in blood pressure. Chronic impairment of the baroreflex results in sustained increases in sympathetic nerve activity with serious pathologic and morbid consequences in cardiovascular disease states, such as hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke (Mortara et al., 1997Mortara A.

We first determined that ASICs are expressed in mouse nodose ganglia using quantitative RT-PCR (Figures 1A and 1B). There was a predominance of ASIC2b transcript over ASIC1a, -1b, -2a, and -3. Immunofluorescence of ASIC2 protein (Figures 1C and 1D) was present in most nodose neurons and colocalized with ASIC1 and ASIC3 in some but not all neurons (Figure 1E). Since the sensing of arterial pressure is initiated at the baroreceptor nerve endings, it was important to see whether ASIC proteins are expressed in the aortic depressor nerve terminals in the aortic arch. Whole mounts of the aortic arch were used for confocal analysis. We found that ASIC1, -2, and -3 were present and colocalized with neurofilament-L antibody in the nerve fibers (Figure 1F) and/or their terminals (Figure 1G). The generation of ASIC2 null mice was reported previously (Price et al., 2000Price M.P. Lewin G.R. McIlwrath S.L. Cheng C. Xie J. Heppenstall P.A. Stucky C.L. Mannsfeldt A.G. Brennan T.J.

Physiol. 2004; 556: 691-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We found that ASIC2 deletion did not alter mRNA expression of ASIC1a, -1b, and -3. The results are in Figures S2A and S2B. Western blotting showed no change in ASIC1 and ASIC3 expression in ASIC2 null compared to WT mice (Figure S2C), and immunofluorescence of ASIC1 and ASIC3 was preserved in nodose ganglia and aortic depressor nerve endings, respectively, while ASIC2 was absent from the nerve endings (Figures S2D and S2E). To determine the functional importance of ASIC2 in the neural regulation of circulation, we assessed the autonomic cardiovascular control in conscious, freely moving mice. Using radiotelemetry (Butz and Davisson, 2001Butz G.M. Davisson R.L. Long-term telemetric measurement of cardiovascular parameters in awake mice: a physiological genomics tool.Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we recorded blood pressure, heart rate, and locomotor activity and found significant differences between mice with ASIC2 deletion and WT mice (Figures 2 and S3). First, ASIC2 null mice had sustained diurnal increases in blood pressure and heart rate (Figure 2). They were hypertensive with average levels of blood pressure and heart rate that were significantly higher over a 24 hour period compared to WT. The higher levels of blood pressure and heart rate were particularly pronounced during the active phase despite a lower level of activity in the null mice (Figure 2). Second, we contrasted the arterial baroreceptor reflex in the conscious, freely moving state. The baroreceptor reflex causes a decrease in heart rate when there is an increase in blood pressure and vice versa. Therefore, we scanned the telemetry data for spontaneous changes in blood pressure and measured the accompanying change in heart rate (Figure 3A). The apparent gain of the reflex is defined as the change in the interbeat interval divided by the change in the blood pressure (Bertinieri et al., 1988Bertinieri G. Di Rienzo M. Cavallazzi A. Ferrari A.U. Pedotti A. Mancia G. Evaluation of baroreceptor reflex by blood pressure monitoring in unanesthetized cats.Am. J.

Applicability of recent methods used to estimate spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity to resting mice.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 294: R142-R150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Figure 3B shows that the average baroreceptor reflex gain was 2.3 ms/mmHg for WT and 1.2 for ASIC2 null mice. Our results indicate that in addition to the reduced gain there is a reduced frequency of engagement of the baroreflex in ASIC2 null mice compared to WT (Figure 3C). Third, we tested for the presence of dysautonomia and sympathovagal imbalance in the conscious awake state. In response to methyl atropine, the increase in heart rate seen in WT mice was abrogated in the ASIC2 null mice, indicating a dramatic reduction in parasympathetic control (Figure 3D). In response to propranolol, the decrease in heart rate was over 2-fold greater in ASIC2 null mice compared to WT, indicating an exaggerated sympathetic control of heart rate (Figure 3E). Moreover, in ASIC2 null mice, the magnitude of the fall in BP in response to ganglionic blockade with intraperitoneal chlorisondamine was significantly greater than in WT mice (Figure 3F). This fall in blood pressure reflects largely the sympathetic contribution to total vascular resistance, confirming that ASIC2 deletion caused an exaggerated sympathetic control of blood pressure and significant dysautonomia. Thus, the results of the conscious studies in ASIC2 null mice indicate a significant impairment of the baroreflex with consequential increases in arterial blood pressure and heart rate and a sympathovagal imbalance with exaggerated sympathetic and suppressed parasympathetic control. Since ASICs are expressed in the CNS and in peripheral sensory nerves, we wondered whether the impaired baroreflex and the dysautonomia were associated with impaired baroreceptor sensory signaling and whether the central component of the baroreflex was impaired. The central component was examined in anesthetized mice with electrical stimulation of the isolated left aortic depressor nerve with impulses at 10 V, 2 ms duration and increasing frequencies of 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 Hz for a period of 20 s. Reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were seen during the stimulations in both groups, and their magnitude increased with the increases in frequency of stimulation (Figure 4). Responses were not different in ASIC2 null mice and WT (ANOVA: F ratio 0.28 and 0.08 for systolic arterial pressure and heart rate, respectively, with p values > 0.5). The results suggest that the impaired baroreflex and the autonomic dysfunction did not result from a defect in the central mediation of the reflex. To test whether baroreceptor sensitivity was impaired in ASIC2 null mice, we used three approaches. Baroreceptor activation was tested in vitro with measurements of mechanosensitivity of isolated nodose neurons and in vivo with measurements of aortic depressor nerve activity and of pressor responses to bilateral carotid occlusion. In several in vitro studies of mechanoelectrical transduction of isolated baroreceptor neurons, we reported the effects of graded deformation of the neurons (Cunningham et al., 1995Cunningham J.T.

Mechano- and chemosensitivity of rat nodose neurones—selective excitatory effects of prostacyclin.J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In vivo, the direct measurement of baroreceptor activity from the aortic depressor nerve during phenylephrine-induced hypertension provides a measure of baroreceptor sensitivity in anesthetized mice (Ma et al., 2002Ma X. Abboud F.M. Chapleau M.W. Analysis of afferent, central, and efferent components of the baroreceptor reflex in mice.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2002; 283: R1033-R1040PubMed Google Scholar). Also, in vivo, the magnitude of the reflex increase in blood pressure during bilateral carotid occlusion, which causes a precipitous fall of pressure in the carotid sinuses, reflects the sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors (Iturriaga et al., 1988Iturriaga R. Alcayaga J. Zapata P. Contribution of carotid body chemoreceptors and carotid sinus baroreceptors to the ventilatory and circulatory reflexes produced by common carotid occlusion.Acta Physiol. Pharmacol. Latinoam. 1988; 38: 27-48PubMed Google Scholar). In the in vitro studies, we first determined mechanosensitivity and ASIC2 expression in aortic baroreceptor neurons versus non baroreceptor nodose neurons. We anticipated that the aortic baroreceptor neurons might be more mechanosensitive since in vivo they continuously sense the changes in pressure with every pulse in contrast to other nodose neurons that innervate parenchymal organs. We identified aortic baroreceptor neurons in the nodose ganglia by labeling them retrogradely with the tracer DiI (1,1′-dioleyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbo-cyanine methanesulfonate) injected into the adventitia of the aortic arch as described previously (Drummond et al., 1998Drummond H.A.

The dispersed neurons in culture were mechanically stimulated with extracellular buffer ejected at 10 psi for 3 s from a micropipette using a pneumatic PicoPump (Figure 5B). The results indicated that the fluorescent aortic baroreceptor neurons were significantly more mechanosensitive, generating greater depolarizations than the nonlabeled neurons (Figure 5C). Using single-cell RT-PCR, we found that ASIC2 mRNA levels in DiI-labeled aortic baroreceptor neurons (n = 24) from WKY rats were 3-fold greater than those of nonlabeled neurons (n = 24) (Figures 5D and 5E). (A) Schematic of different sensory afferents to nodose ganglia showing injection of the tracer DiI into the aortic arch adventitia to label selectively aortic baroreceptor neurons in the nodose ganglia. (B) Dispersed nodose neurons in culture show one fluorescent DiI-labeled aortic baroreceptor neuron and several nonlabeled ones. (C) The mechanical stimulus initiated a rapid depolarization that triggered transient action potential discharge in a DiI-labeled mouse neuron. The sharp brief negative deflection at the end of the sustained depolarization represents the response to injection of a transient hyperpolarizing current given to measure changes in membrane conductance. The bar graph shows that labeled aortic baroreceptor neurons from 12 mice depolarized much more (n = 35, 7.45 ± 1.03 mV) than nonlabeled nodose neurons from 18 mice (n = 45, 2.42 ± 0.51 mV) (means ± SEM, ∗p < 0.05, unpaired t test). These depolarizations were from their resting membrane potentials. Membrane conductances measured in DiI-positive cells averaged 7.67 ± SEM ± 0.70 nS before mechanical stimulation and increased during stimulation to 9.06 ± 0.88 nS (p < 0.005, n = 19). Corresponding values in non-DiI cells were 13.26 ± 1.03 and 13.15 ± 1.07, respectively (p = 0.76, n = 20). From a holding membrane potential of –60 mV, achieved by current injections, the differences in mechanically induced depolarizations were greater with corresponding values of 8.72 ± 1.83 mV and 1.57 ± 0.57 mV, respectively. (D) Single-cell RT-PCR of ASIC2a mRNA reveals varying expression levels in 15 individual rat nodose neurons in culture. In different neuron populations studied, ASIC2a was expressed in 55%–80% of the cells. (E) Normalization using housekeeping gene GAPDH revealed that DiI-labeled rat aortic baroreceptor neurons had significantly higher ASIC2a mRNA levels compared to non-DiI neurons (mean ± SEM, ∗p < 0.05, unpaired t test). To further test the influence of ASIC2 expression on mechanosensitivity, we compared the mechanically induced depolarization of isolated nodose neurons from transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing ASIC2a to those from WT and from ASIC2 null mice. Figure 6 shows a significant degree of variability between individual neurons in each group, presumably because the different neurons of the nodose ganglia have sensory terminals in diverse visceral organs and thus variable degrees of mechanosensitivity. However, the percentage of neurons that depolarized more than 1.0 mV was 86% in Tg (n = 14), 63% in WT (n = 24), and 26% in null mice (n = 23). Corresponding depolarizations were significantly different between the three groups, averaging 11.24 ± 2.20 mV, 2.73 ± 0.67 mV, and 0.86 ± 0.53 mV, respectively (Figure 6). Furthermore, in most Tg neurons, the depolarizations were sustained for 10–20 s after the end of mechanical stimulation, with a prolonged time constant (τ = 7.52 ± 1.53 s, n = 12). The depolarizations in WT and KO neurons were rarely sustained more than 3–5 s (Figure 6). Responses to 3 s mechanical stimulations of nodose neurons from WT (n = 24), ASIC2 KO (n = 23), and ASIC2 transgenic (Tg) (n = 14) mice. The tracings above each graph are depolarizations of a mechanosensitive neuron selected from each group. The tracing from the Tg neuron is portrayed at different time scales to show the delayed recovery from depolarization. A holding membrane potential was set at −60 mV in all neurons to minimize differences in responses caused by variations in resting membrane potentials. The number of neurons that depolarized less than 1 mV or hyperpolarized with mechanical stimulation was significantly greater (chi-test p < 0.001) in the null mice (17 of 23) than in the WT (9 of 24). Only one neuron of 14 in the Tg group hyperpolarized. The difference between groups was highly significant by ANOVA (F value of 22.64 versus Fcrit of 3.15). The neurons from ASIC2 Tg mice had a significantly greater depolarization (11.24 ± 2.20 mV) than seen in WT (2.73 ± 0.67 mV) or in ASIC2 null mice (0.86 ± 0.53 mV) (p < 0.01 and <0.05, respectively: ANOVA, post hoc). Also the response in WT was significantly greater than in KO mice (Wilcoxon rank sum, p = 0.046; unpaired t test two-tailed p = 0.035; one-tailed p = 0.017). We then tested whether impaired mechanosensitivity of baroreceptors in ASIC2 null mice would be detected in vivo by measuring aortic depressor nerve activity (ADN) during a rise in arterial pressure. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, the baseline blood pressure and the aortic depressor nerve activity were similar in ASIC2 null and WT mice (Figure 7A). During the decrease in blood pressure with intravenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP), nerve activity was reduced to a low level in both WT and ASIC2 null mice. In response to the rapid initial increase in pressure with phenylephrine (PE), the activity, measured as spike frequency and integrated voltage, rose abruptly to a comparable peak level in both groups within 5 s. The nerve activity then declined and stabilized while arterial pressure reached a plateau within the subsequent 10–25 s. Although the increase in pressure tended to be higher in the ASIC2 null mice, the decline in ADN activity was steeper, reaching the plateau phase at a significantly lower level than in WT mice (Figure 7B). Thus, deletion of ASIC2 did not suppress the onset but did suppress the maintenance of nerve activity. Both the increase in frequency of action potentials per mmHg increase in arterial pressure from control as well as the increase in integrated voltage from control were more than halved in ASIC2 null mice (Figure 7C). (A) The tracings show phasic arterial pressure and aortic depressor nerve activity (ADNA) in a WT and an ASIC2 KO mouse. ADNA is shown as the magnitude of voltage of action potentials in μV (middle tracings) and as number of spikes generated per second (lower tracings) during changes in arterial pressure with sodium nitroprusside injections (SNP) and phenylephrine injections (PE). Although the peak level of nerve activity during the onset of the pressor response to PE was comparable in both groups, the activity was not maintained in ASIC2 KO and declined rapidly, reaching a significantly lower level than in WT. The WT record shows a transient reflex bradycardia apparent following the peak rise in pressure, after which both pressure and nerve activity stabilized. Comparisons were made of recordings of both BP and ADNA obtained in the control state before the injection of SNP and in the steady state during the period between 15 and 25 s following the maximum increase in ADNA with injection of PE. (B) The left graph represents data points obtained every 500 ms after the maximum increase in spike frequency with PE and expressed as a percentage of the peak frequency (% max). The right graph shows the corresponding mean arterial pressure (MAP) over the period of 25 s following PE injections. The values are means ± SEM obtained from ASIC2 KO mice (n = 6) and WT mice (n = 7). The ADN activity declined rapidly in KO mice to levels that were significantly lower than in WT (∗p < 0.001 by ANOVA; Newman-Keuls test). Conversely, MAP rose to statistically higher levels in KO mice initially (∗p < 0.001 by ANOVA; Newman-Keuls test) during the first 10 s and then plateaued to levels comparable to those in WT. (C) The bars represent increases in ADN activity in WT and ASIC2 KO from baseline control values (integrated over a 10 s period prior to SNP injection) to the values obtained during a 10 s period of sustained increase in pressure between 15 and 25 s after PE when MAP was not statistically different between the two genotypes. The left bars are the increases in spikes · sec−1 (means ± SEM) for every mmHg increase in pressure from control to the sustained plateau level. The right bars represent the differences in integrated voltage between baseline and plateau levels both expressed as percentage of maximum voltage. The responses in null mice were less than half those seen in WT mice (∗p < 0.05, unpaired t test). Finally, we tested whether the blunted baroreceptor activity of both the aortic and carotid baroreceptors in ASIC2 null mice results in a reduced baroreceptor reflex and may therefore account for the dysautonomia. Bilateral carotid occlusion causes a rapid drop in blood pressure restricted to the carotid circulation and the carotid sinuses and triggers a reflex rise in systemic blood pressure (Figure 8A). The magnitude of the reflex rise in pressure reflects the decrease in carotid baroreceptor nerve activity during the occlusion and the opposing (buffering) effect of the increased aortic baroreceptor activity that occurs during the rise in systemic arterial pressure. In contrasting the carotid occlusion reflex before and after aortic baroreceptor denervation, by sectioning both the right and left aortic depressor nerves (ADNs), we were able to define the magnitude of the buffering effect of the ADN activity on the pressor response. We found that before section of ADNs, the carotid occlusion pressor response was comparable in the KO and WT (Figure 8B). However, after section of ADNs, the reflex was significantly enhanced in WT mice and unchanged in the ASIC2 null mice (Figure 8B). This indicates that the ADN activity during the reflex rise in pressure with carotid occlusion was significantly higher in WT compared to KO mice, causing an effective buffering and suppression of the reflex that is removed with section of the ADNs. In contrast, the already blunted activation of ADNs during carotid occlusion in ASIC2 null mice prevented a significant augmentation of the pressor response to carotid occlusion after section of the ADNs. Also, the significantly attenuated pressor response in ASIC2 null mice versus WT after section of ADNs most likely reflects a suppressed baseline carotid barorec"
https://openalex.org/W1968623914,"Proteins of the dynamin superfamily mediate membrane fission, fusion, and restructuring events by polymerizing upon lipid bilayers and forcing regions of high curvature. In this work, we show the electron cryomicroscopy reconstruction of a bacterial dynamin-like protein (BDLP) helical filament decorating a lipid tube at approximately 11 A resolution. We fitted the BDLP crystal structure and produced a molecular model for the entire filament. The BDLP GTPase domain dimerizes and forms the tube surface, the GTPase effector domain (GED) mediates self-assembly, and the paddle region contacts the lipids and promotes curvature. Association of BDLP with GMPPNP and lipid induces radical, large-scale conformational changes affecting polymerization. Nucleotide hydrolysis seems therefore to be coupled to polymer disassembly and dissociation from lipid, rather than membrane restructuring. Observed structural similarities with rat dynamin 1 suggest that our results have broad implication for other dynamin family members."
https://openalex.org/W1981667710,"Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera, is autochthonous to various aquatic environments, but despite intensive efforts its ecology remains an enigma. Recently, it was suggested that copepods and chironomids, both considered as natural reservoirs of V. cholerae, are dispersed by migratory waterbirds, thus possibly distributing the bacteria between water bodies within and between continents. Although fish have been implicated in the scientific literature with cholera cases, as far as we know, no study actually surveyed the presence of the bacteria in the fish. Here we show for the first time that fish of various species and habitats contain V. cholerae in their digestive tract. Fish (n = 110) were randomly sampled from freshwater and marine habitats in Israel. Ten different fish species sampled from freshwater habitats (lake, rivers and fish ponds), and one marine species, were found to carry V. cholerae. The fish intestine of Sarotherodon galilaeus harboured ca. 5×103 V. cholerae cfu per 1 gr intestine content—high rates compared with known V. cholerae cfu numbers in the bacteria's natural reservoirs. Our results, combined with evidence from the literature, suggest that fish are reservoirs of V. cholerae. As fish carrying the bacteria swim from one location to another (some fish species move from rivers to lakes or sea and vice versa), they serve as vectors on a small scale. Nevertheless, fish are consumed by waterbirds, which disseminate the bacteria on a global scale. Moreover, V. cholerae isolates had the ability to degrade chitin, indicating a commensal relationship between V. cholerae and fish. Better understanding of V. cholerae ecology can help reduce the times that human beings come into contact with this pathogen and thus minimize the health risk this poses."

Human PARPs constitute a large family of 17 proteins encoded by different genes and displaying a conserved catalytic domain. In addition to a catalytic domain, PARP family members typically contain one or more additional motifs or domains, including zinc fingers, BRCT (BRCA1 Cterminus-like) motifs, ankyrin repeats, macrodomains and different types of protein/protein interaction sites (7.Hakmé A.

Cancer. 2008; 8: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Several PARP inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials for cancer treatment. However, it is unclear whether the efficiency of the PARP inhibitors is due to inhibition of PARP-1 alone or if they also inhibit other PARP family members. Therefore, to better understand the effects of PARP inhibition in cancer treatment, information on other PARP family members is needed. In particular, PARP-3 is highly related to PARP-1 and PARP-2, but there is little information on the biochemical properties of this enzyme. PARP-3 is a 60-kDa protein containing an N-terminal WGR (tryptophan-, glycine-, and arginine-rich) domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The crystal structure of the human PARP-3 catalytic domain was determined recently (Protein Data Bank code 3C4H) (12.Lehtiö L. Jemth A.S. Collins R. Loseva O. Johansson A. Markova N. Hammarström M. Flores A. Holmberg-Schiavone L. Weigelt J. Helleday T. Schüler H. Karlberg T. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 3108-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and was found to be highly similar to mammalian PARP-1 and PARP-2 catalytic domains (13.Ruf A. Mennissier de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Schulz G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 7481-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 14.Oliver A.W. Amé J.C. Roe S.M. Good V. de Murcia G. Pearl L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The WGR domain contains conserved tryptophan, glycine, and arginine residues, but the function of this domain remains unknown. It has been speculated that it could have a nucleic acid-binding function (15.Tao Z. Gao P. Hoffman D.W. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5804-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There are contradicting data about the nuclear localization of PARP-3. It was reported that PARP-3 localizes to the centrosome, particularly to the daughter centriole (16.Augustin A. Spenlehauer C. Dumond H. Ménissier-De Murcia J. Piel M. Schmit A.C. Apiou F. Vonesch J.L. Kock M. Bornens M. De Murcia G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but another group showed that the protein mostly associates with polycomb group bodies (17.Rouleau M. McDonald D. Gagné P. Ouellet M.E. Droit A. Hunter J.M. Dutertre S. Prigent C. Hendzel M.J. Poirier G.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of PARP-3 interferes with the G1/S cell cycle but does not influence centrosomal duplication (16.Augustin A. Spenlehauer C. Dumond H. Ménissier-De Murcia J. Piel M. Schmit A.C. Apiou F. Vonesch J.L. Kock M. Bornens M. De Murcia G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It was shown that PARP-3 interacts with PARP-1 and co-immunoprecipitates with the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, DNA ligases III and IV, Ku80, and Ku70, proteins involved in DNA repair (16.Augustin A. Spenlehauer C. Dumond H. Ménissier-De Murcia J. Piel M. Schmit A.C. Apiou F. Vonesch J.L. Kock M. Bornens M. De Murcia G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17.Rouleau M. McDonald D. Gagné P. Ouellet M.E. Droit A. Hunter J.M. Dutertre S. Prigent C. Hendzel M.J. Poirier G.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Later, it was shown that PARP-3 also binds to histones H3C and H2BE (18.Ewing R.M. Chu P. Elisma F. Li H. Taylor P. Climie S. McBroom-Cerajewski L. Robinson M.D. O'Connor L. Li M. Taylor R. Dharsee M. Ho Y. Heilbut A. Moore L. Zhang S. Ornatsky O. Bukhman Y.V. Ethier M. Sheng Y. Vasilescu J. Abu-Farha M.

Biol. 2007; 3: 1-17Crossref Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Whether PARP-3 has a function in the DNA damage response or not is still unknown. The aim of our study was to investigate the biochemical properties of PARP-3 to better understand its cellular functions. Despite the high degree of similarity to the catalytic domains of PARP-1 and PARP-2, PARP-3 possesses certain functional differences. We show that PARP-3 is an active enzyme with auto- and trans-ADP-ribosylation activity. PARP-3 is a mono-ADP-ribosylase in contrast to PARP-1 and PARP-2. We also show that PARP-3 can activate PARP-1 in the absence of DNA. Expression and purification of recombinant full-length PARP-3 and truncated PARP-3 (Lys178–His532; tPARP-3) were as described previously (12.Lehtiö L. Jemth A.S. Collins R. Loseva O. Johansson A. Markova N. Hammarström M. Flores A. Holmberg-Schiavone L. Weigelt J. Helleday T. Schüler H. Karlberg T. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 3108-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PARP-1 was purchased from Alexis Corp. The ability of PARP-3 to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of itself and histone H1 was assayed using 6-biotin-17-NAD (Bio-NAD+; Trevigen, Inc.). 0.8 μm PARP-3 or tPARP-3 was incubated at 22 °C in PARP reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 2 mm MgCl2) with 25 μm Bio-NAD+, 75 μm NAD+, and 2.4 μm histone H1 (New England Biolabs) in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml activated DNA (Sigma). The reaction was stopped by the addition of lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer (Invitrogen) and freezing on dry ice at the following time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. The samples were separated on NuPAGE Novex 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare). The blots were probed with anti-biotin antibody (Roche Diagnostics), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific), and protein bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Scientific). 250 nm purified PARP-3 was preincubated for 5 min at room temperature in PARP reaction buffer with varying concentrations of PARP-1 inhibitors: 3-aminobenzamide, 1,5-dihydroisoquinoline, 1,8-naphthalimide, 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide, DR2313(2-methyl-3,5,7,8-tetrahydrothiopyrano[4,3-d]pyrimidine-4-one), PJ34 (N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-(N,N-dimethylamino)acetamide), and KU0058948. The reaction was started by the addition of 25 μm Bio-NAD+. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by dilution in LDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed as described above. For comparison, the activity of 10 nm PARP-1 was assayed in the presence of varying concentrations of the same inhibitors and under the same reaction conditions. PARP-1 was preincubated with the inhibitors for 5 min, and reactions were started by the addition of Bio-NAD+ and activated DNA. IC50 values for the PARP inhibitors against PARP-3 and PARP-1 were estimated from the intensities of the ADP-ribose signal after quantification using Adobe Photoshop CS2. To confirm the reported interaction between PARP-3 and PARP-1 and to check how strong the interaction is, a binding experiment was performed. U2OS cells overexpressing Myc-PARP-1 were lysed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and spun in a microcentrifuge to clear the lysate. Anti-Myc antibody conjugated to agarose beads (sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the cellular extract and incubated overnight on a rotating unit at 4 °C. Beads were washed with lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and incubated with purified PARP-3 for 4 h. Beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl or 0.1% SDS, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in LDS sample buffer. After electrophoresis, samples were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with mouse anti-PARP-1 monoclonal antibody (sc-8007) and goat anti-PARP-3 polyclonal antibody (sc-30625) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Additional steps were performed as described above. To investigate if the interaction between PARP-3 and PARP-1 has any effect on the activity of these proteins, 500 nm PARP-3 or tPARP-3 was incubated in PARP reaction buffer with 25 μm Bio-NAD+ and 75 μm NAD+ in the absence or presence of 20 nm PARP-1 without the addition of activated DNA. After 2.5, 5, and 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the reactions were stopped by dilution in LDS sample buffer. In additional experiments prior to incubation with PARP-3, PARP-1 was inhibited with KU0058948 at 50 nm, a concentration that inhibits PARP-1 but not PARP-3 to any large extent. The samples were analyzed as described above. To analyze the effect of Ca2+ on the activity of PARP-1 in the presence of PARP-3, a time course experiment was conducted as described above in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. To check the dependence of PARP-1 activity on the amount of PARP-3 present, 20 nm PARP-1 was incubated with different concentrations of PARP-3 in PARP reaction buffer in the presence of 25 μm Bio-NAD+ and 75 μm NAD+ and in the absence of DNA for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by dilution in LDS sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed as described above. 250 nm purified PARP-3 was incubated with 12.5 μm Bio-NAD+ in PARP reaction buffer and with different concentrations of MIBG for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by dilution in LDS sample buffer. 125 nm purified PARP-3 was incubated with 12.5 μm Bio-NAD+ in PARP reaction buffer for 30 min at room temperature. HgCl2 was added to the reaction mixture to 1 mm and incubated for 1, 2, or 4 h. Control reactions were supplemented with 1 mm NaCl and incubated as described above. The reactions were stopped by dilution in LDS sample buffer. 1 μm or 100 nm purified PARP-3 or 10 nm purified PARP-1 was incubated with 25 μm Bio-NAD+ in PARP reaction buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Activated DNA (5 μg/ml) was added to the PARP-1 reactions. The reactions were thereafter mixed with neutral NH2OH to 1 m and incubated for 1, 2, or 4 h at room temperature. The control reactions were mixed with NaCl to 1 m and treated as described above. The reactions were stopped by dilution in LDS sample buffer. 10 μg of PARP-3 was incubated with 1 mm NAD+ in PARP reaction buffer. 1 μg of PARP-1 was incubated with 1 mm NAD+ and 5 μg/ml activated DNA. After 30 and 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, aliquots of the reaction products were taken for analysis by Western blotting with the antibody to PARP-3 (sc-30625) and the antibody to PARP-1 (sc-8007). The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20% (w/v). PARs were isolated from trichloroacetic acid precipitates by the method of Panzeter and Althaus (19.Panzeter P.L. Althaus F.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Polymers were loaded on a 20% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 100 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.3) and 2 mm EDTA. Following electrophoretic separation, the gel was stained using a Pierce color silver stain kit following the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA against PARP-1, PARP-2, or PARP-3 was designed in-house as described (9.Bryant H.E. Schultz N. Thomas H.D. Parker K.M. Flower D. Lopez E. Kyle S. Meuth M. Curtin N.J. Helleday T. Nature. 2005; 434: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (3568) Google Scholar). Scrambled siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon and Qiagen. For clonogenic survival assay, 1 × 104 SW480 cells grown overnight in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then cultured in normal growth medium for 48 h prior to trypsinization and replating in the presence or absence of increasing doses of camptothecin for 24 h. Depletion was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR as described previously (9.Bryant H.E. Schultz N. Thomas H.D. Parker K.M. Flower D. Lopez E. Kyle S. Meuth M. Curtin N.J. Helleday T. Nature. 2005; 434: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (3568) Google Scholar). We investigated the ADP-ribosylation activity of both truncated PARP-3 (amino acids 178–532, lacking the WGR domain) and full-length PARP-3 (amino acids 1–532) using Bio-NAD+ and histone H1 as a substrate. PARP-3 was able to ADP-ribosylate itself (auto-ADP-ribosylation) as well as histone H1 (trans-ADP-ribosylation), a previously unknown substrate of PARP-3 (Fig. 1A). We investigated if PARP-3 activity is increased by the addition of activated DNA, as is the case for PARP-1. We found that the addition of activated DNA did not influence PARP-3 activity (Fig. 1B). The ratio between the substrate specificities of PARP-3 for PARP-3 and histone H1 did not reveal any preference for either of the two substrates. However, in the presence of DNA, PARP-3 was the preferred substrate. This is likely to be an effect of DNA binding to histones and preventing them from interacting with the enzyme. tPARP-3 possesses both auto-ADP-ribosylase activity and trans-ADP-ribosylase activity using histone H1 as a substrate (supplemental Fig. S1), showing that the N-terminal part with the WGR domain is not crucial for the ADP-ribosylase activity. Further characterization was performed using full-length PARP-3. The inhibitory potency of a panel of PARP-1 inhibitors and binders was analyzed. We showed previously that at equimolar concentrations of inhibitor and the substrate Bio-NAD+, only the highly potent PARP-1-specific inhibitor KU0058948 shows PARP-3 inhibition (12.Lehtiö L. Jemth A.S. Collins R. Loseva O. Johansson A. Markova N. Hammarström M. Flores A. Holmberg-Schiavone L. Weigelt J. Helleday T. Schüler H. Karlberg T. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 3108-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To estimate the inhibitory potency of KU0058948 for PARP-3 compared with PARP-1, time course experiments in the presence of increasing concentrations of KU0058948 were performed (Fig. 2A). Initial rates were determined at each KU0058948 concentration, and the activity was plotted against inhibitor concentration (supplemental Fig. S2). 0.25 μm KU0058948 reduced the activity of 0.25 μm PARP-3 to 18%. The apparent Ki at 25 μm Bio-NAD+ was estimated to be ∼10 nm using the quadratic binding equation. The Km for Bio-NAD+ was determined to 130 μm, which means that the apparent Ki is close to the true Ki because most of the enzyme molecules are free to bind inhibitor molecules at the concentration of Bio-NAD+ used. Comparison of the inhibition of PARP-1 and PARP-3 with KU0058948 (Fig. 2, A and B) shows that the compound was a far less potent inhibitor of PARP-3 than of PARP-1. However, KU0058948 was the most potent PARP-3 inhibitor of those tested. Despite the strong structural similarity between the PARP-1 and PARP-3 catalytic domains (12.Lehtiö L. Jemth A.S. Collins R. Loseva O. Johansson A. Markova N. Hammarström M. Flores A. Holmberg-Schiavone L. Weigelt J. Helleday T. Schüler H. Karlberg T. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 3108-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), PARP-3 also displayed considerably lower sensitivity compared with PARP-1 to other known PARP-1 inhibitors (Fig. 2B). IC50 values are presented in supplemental Table 1. The biological role of PARP-3 is not known, but it may be linked with the role of PARP-1 in maintenance of genome stability, as an interaction between the proteins has been reported (16.Augustin A. Spenlehauer C. Dumond H. Ménissier-De Murcia J. Piel M. Schmit A.C. Apiou F. Vonesch J.L. Kock M. Bornens M. De Murcia G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17.Rouleau M. McDonald D. Gagné P. Ouellet M.E. Droit A. Hunter J.M. Dutertre S. Prigent C. Hendzel M.J. Poirier G.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here, we confirmed an interaction between full-length PARP-3 and PARP-1 in immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3A). The interaction was able to withstand 1 m NaCl or 0.1% SDS, suggesting that the interaction is strong. To test a possible role of this interaction, we analyzed the activity of PARP-3 in the presence of PARP-1 and in the absence of activated DNA. Interestingly, we found that PARP-3 activated PARP-1, probably by forming catalytically active heterodimers with PARP-1 possessing auto- and trans-poly(ADP-ribosylation) activity (Fig. 3B). Incubation of tPARP-3 with PARP-1 produced a weak PARP-1 auto-ADP-ribosylation signal but did not show any trans-ADP-ribosylation activity of PARP-1 (Fig. 3B). At the same time, the auto-ribosylation activity of tPARP-3 was not affected. These results suggest that the N-terminal part of PARP-3 containing the WGR domain is needed for activating PARP-1 and is probably involved in the formation of catalytically active heterodimers between PARP-1 and PARP-3. Also, the site(s) of auto-modification are not exclusively located in the N-terminal part of PARP-3 that is absent in tPARP-3 because tPARP-3 is ADP-ribosylated. The PAR chains formed by the PARP-3/PARP-1 heterodimer are catalyzed by PARP-1 because incubation of PARP-1 with KU0058948 (50 nm) abrogated the synthesis of poly-ADP-ribose, without affecting the PARP-3 activity (Fig. 3C). Incubation of PARP-1 with PARP-3 at different ratios revealed that PARP-1 auto-ADP-ribosylation is preferred compared with trans-ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 3D). The addition of Ca2+ to the reaction mixture produced only a minor increase in the PARP-1 activation by PARP-3 (supplemental Fig. S3). The covalent attachment of ADP-ribose units from NAD+ to various substrates can occur on different amino acids, including arginine, asparagine, serine, cysteine, and glutamic acid (2.Hassa P.O. Haenni S.S. Elser M. Hottiger M.O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 789-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). To identify the amino acid residues of PARP-3 that are modified, we investigated the chemical stability of the modification. The inhibitor of arginine-specific mono(ADP-ribose) transferases, MIBG (20.Loesberg C. van Rooij H. Smets L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1037: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), had no effect on the enzymatic activity of PARP-3 (Fig. 4A), indicating that arginine residues most probably are not modified in PARP-3. The chemical bonds between ADP-ribose and various amino acids have different sensitivities to acidic, alkaline, or other types of treatment. Auto-modified PARP-3 was insensitive to HgCl2, which cleaved the linkage between cysteine and ADP-ribose (Fig. 4B). Ester bonds between ADP-ribose and acidic amino acids can be hydrolyzed by hydroxylamine (2.Hassa P.O. Haenni S.S. Elser M. Hottiger M.O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 789-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 21.Kleine H. Poreba E. Lesniewicz K. Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Litchfield D.W. Shilton B.H. Lüscher B. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Auto-modified PARP-3 and PARP-1 were sensitive to hydroxylamine treatment (Fig. 4C), indicating that ADP-ribosylation occurs on glutamic and/or aspartic acid residues at least under the conditions used in our experiments. PARP-3 is structurally very similar to the catalytic domains of PARP-1 and PARP-2, which are both poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that also PARP-3 would be a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Here, we compared the ADP-ribosylase activity of PARP-1 and PARP-3. To determine whether the multiple ADP-ribose modifications were linked together as a polymer or monomers attached at one or multiple sites, the ADP-ribose moieties were cleaved from the proteins and resolved by electrophoresis using a sequencing gel format (Fig. 5B). The gel demonstrated that PARP-3 could not synthesize long polymers as PARP-1. Analysis of PARP-3 auto-ADP-ribosylation by Western blotting showed only one band at the size of PARP-3, suggesting that PARP-3 is a mono-ADP-ribosylase (Fig. 5A). To test a possible role of PARP-3 in the DNA damage response, we determined the sensitivity of PARP-1 and PARP-3 siRNA-depleted human SW480 cells to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), which kills PARP-1-defective or PARP-1-inhibited cells by increasing the persistence of SSBs (22.Smith L.M. Willmore E. Austin C.A. Curtin N.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 8449-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The CPT analog irinotecan (CPT-11) is currently used in combination therapies and is presently in clinical trials. We found that PARP-1 and not PARP-3 siRNA depletion sensitized cells to CPT (Fig. 6), suggesting that PARP-3 is not involved in the SSB response and that unwelcomed inhibition of PARP-3 by PARP-1 inhibitors is not likely to influence the PARP-1 inhibitor and irinotecan combination treatment used in patients. In this study, we characterized the biochemical properties of human PARP-3. PARP-3 was described recently as a non-active protein compared with PARP-1 and PARP-2 (23.Altmeyer M. Messner S. Hassa P.O. Fey M. Hottiger M.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This conclusion was made because neither polymer formation nor auto-modification of PARP-3 was observed after a 10-s reaction. Along with two previous reports from independent laboratories (16.Augustin A. Spenlehauer C. Dumond H. Ménissier-De Murcia J. Piel M. Schmit A.C. Apiou F. Vonesch J.L. Kock M. Bornens M. De Murcia G. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17.Rouleau M. McDonald D. Gagné P. Ouellet M.E. Droit A. Hunter J.M. Dutertre S. Prigent C. Hendzel M.J. Poirier G.G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we have shown that PARP-3 is an active enzyme. In the presence of biotinylated NAD+, the protein was found to be able to ADP-ribosylate itself as well as histone H1, a previously unknown substrate for PARP-3. However, despite the strong structural similarity between the catalytic domains of PARP-1 and PARP-3, these proteins possess certain functional differences. For example, PARP-3 was considerably less sensitive to known PARP-1 inhibitors (Fig. 2), consistent with what has been reported previously (10.Farmer H. McCabe N. Lord C.J. Tutt A.N. Johnson D.A. Richardson T.B. Santarosa M. Dillon K.J. Hickson I. Knights C. Martin N.M. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C. Ashworth A. Nature. 2005; 434: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar, 24.Jones P. Altamura S. Boueres J. Ferrigno F. Fonsi M. Giomini C. Lamartina S. Monteagudo E. Ontoria J.M. Orsale M.V. Palumbi M.C. Pesci S. Roscilli G. Scarpelli R. Schultz-Fademrecht C. Toniatti C. Rowley M. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 7170-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The assessment of PARP-3 activity in the presence of various PARP-1 inhibitors showed that KU0058948 was the most active PARP-3 inhibitor; however, it inhibited PARP-1 much more potently than PARP-3. Therefore, the use of PARP-1 inhibitors in the clinic is unlikely to give any side effects by inhibiting PARP-3. PARP-3 is not activated upon binding to DNA and is a mono-ADP-ribosylase in contrast to PARP-1 and PARP-2. PARP-3 has auto-ADP-ribosylation activity but, in contrast to PARP-1, did not show the size shift on polyacrylamide gels as a result of PARP-bound PAR (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5A). Moreover, when ADP-ribose moieties were cleaved from the proteins after the auto-ADP-ribosylation reaction and resolved by electrophoresis, it was demonstrated that PARP-3 could not synthesize long polymers as PARP-1 (Fig. 5B). It has been suggested that the presence or absence of a catalytic glutamate defines the enzymatic activity of PARPs as a polymerase or a mono-transferase (21.Kleine H. Poreba E. Lesniewicz K. Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Litchfield D.W. Shilton B.H. Lüscher B. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, PARP-3 has a glutamate (Glu514) in the catalytic domain (12.Lehtiö L. Jemth A.S. Collins R. Loseva O. Johansson A. Markova N. Hammarström M. Flores A. Holmberg-Schiavone L. Weigelt J. Helleday T. Schüler H. Karlberg T. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 3108-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) but still lacks polymerase activity, showing that the active-site glutamate is not the sole feature that determines mono- versus poly-ADP-ribosylase activity. The covalent attachment of ADP-ribose units to various protein substrates can occur on different amino acids, including arginine, serine, cysteine, asparagine, and glutamic acid (2.Hassa P.O.

Early experiments showed that the glutamic acid residues in histone H1 (Glu3, Glu16, and Glu115) and histone H2B (Glu3) and the carboxyl group of the C-terminal lysine residue in histone H1 (Lys219) are the sites of ADP-ribosylation (25.Ogata N. Ueda K. Kagamiyama H. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7616-7620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Ogata N. Ueda K. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7610-7615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the chemical stability of the ADP-ribose-PARP linkage against different treatments can also give information about which amino acid residues are the sites of modification. We showed that auto-modified PARP-3, like PARP-1, was sensitive to hydroxylamine treatment at pH 7, indicating that ADP-ribosylation under the reaction conditions used in our assays occurred on glutamic and/or aspartic acid residues. Mutational analysis in the work of Altmeyer et al. (23.Altmeyer M. Messner S. Hassa P.O. Fey M. Hottiger M.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) led to the identification of three lysine residues in the PARP-1 auto-modification domain (Lys498, Lys521, and Lys524) as the sites of ADP-ribosylation. Recently, the first successful identification of the ADP-ribosylation sites in PARP-1 was done by mass spectrometry (27.Tao Z. Gao P. Liu H.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 14258-14260Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this study, the glutamic and aspartic acid residues in the PARP-1 auto-modification domain (Glu488, Glu491, and Asp387) were identified as the acceptor amino acid residues. It should be mentioned that both studies showed that auto-modification of PARP-1 was not limited to the auto-modification domain but could occur beyond this region. Whether PARP-3 has any function in the DNA damage response is still unknown. We have shown that PARP-3 siRNA-depleted cells are not sensitive to camptothecin and that they repair DNA SSBs as efficiently as wild-type cells, suggesting that the interaction between PARP-1 and PARP-3 is unrelated to DNA SSB repair. However, we found that in the absence of activated DNA, PARP-3 can activate PARP-1. It was shown previously that an alternative 55-kDa short product of the PARP-1 gene consisting of the catalytic domain can synthesize PAR independently of DNA strand breaks (28.Sallmann F.R. Vodenicharov M.D. Wang Z.Q. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15504-15511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The 40-kDa C-terminal catalytic domain of avian PARP-1 also possesses auto-poly(ADP-ribosylation) activity independent of DNA (29.Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It can also form catalytically competent heterodimers with full-length PARP-1. PARP-1 and PARP-2 have been shown to heterodimerize and heteromodify each other but in the presence of activated DNA (30.Schreiber V. Amé J.C. Dollé P. Schultz I. Rinaldi B. Fraulob V. Ménissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23028-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The interaction between PARP-1 and PARP-2 or PARP-3 has led to speculations that the two structurally similar PARPs may regulate PARP-1 activity under different circumstances. PARP-2 was shown recently to be critical for PARP-1-mediated activation of homologous recombination at stalled replication forks (6.Bryant H.E. Petermann E. Schultz N. Jemth A.S. Loseva O. Issaeva N. Johansson F. Fernandez S. McGlynn P. Helleday T. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2601-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The protein levels of PARP-3 appear to be very low in all mammalian tissues (31.Rouleau M. El-Alfy M. Lévesque M.H. Poirier G.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2009; 57: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, its expression is restricted to a subset of cell types like the neuroglial cells in the brain and spinal cord and epithelial cells forming the ducts of the prostate, salivary glands, liver, and pancreas. This expression pattern indicates that the expression of PARP-3 is tightly regulated. Thus, there is a possibility that the expression and localization of PARP-3 are ways to control PARP-1 activity in cells and cell signaling through PARP-1-mediated formation of PAR chains via PARP-1/PARP-3 interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2017912240,"One of the most important conservation issues in ecology is the imperiled state of grassland ecosystems worldwide due to land conversion, desertification, and the loss of native populations and species. The Janos region of northwestern Mexico maintains one of the largest remaining black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colony complexes in North America and supports a high diversity of threatened and endangered species. Yet, cattle grazing, agriculture, and drought have greatly impacted the region. We evaluated the impact of human activities on the Janos grasslands, comparing changes in the vertebrate community over the last two decades. Our results reveal profound, rapid changes in the Janos grassland community, demonstrating large declines in vertebrate abundance across all taxonomic groups. We also found that the 55,000 ha prairie dog colony complex has declined by 73% since 1988. The prairie dog complex has become increasingly fragmented, and their densities have shown a precipitous decline over the years, from an average density of 25 per ha in 1988 to 2 per ha in 2004. We demonstrated that prairie dogs strongly suppressed woody plant encroachment as well as created open grassland habitat by clearing woody vegetation, and found rapid invasion of shrubland once the prairie dogs disappeared from the grasslands. Comparison of grasslands and shrublands showed markedly different species compositions, with species richness being greatest when both habitats were considered together. Our data demonstrate the rapid decline of a grassland ecosystem, and documents the dramatic loss in biodiversity over a very short time period concomitant with anthropogenic grassland degradation and the decline of a keystone species."
https://openalex.org/W2156285140,"Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the first known post-translational small protein modifier in prokaryotes, and targets several proteins for degradation by a bacterial proteasome in a manner akin to ubiquitin (Ub) mediated proteolysis in eukaryotes. To determine the extent of pupylation in Mtb, we used tandem affinity purification to identify its ""pupylome"". Mass spectrometry identified 55 out of 604 purified proteins with confirmed pupylation sites. Forty-four proteins, including those with and without identified pupylation sites, were tested as substrates of proteolysis in Mtb. Under steady state conditions, the majority of the test proteins did not accumulate in degradation mutants, suggesting not all targets of pupylation are necessarily substrates of the proteasome under steady state conditions. Four proteins implicated in Mtb pathogenesis, Icl (isocitrate lyase), Ino1 (inositol-1-phosphate synthase), MtrA (Mtbresponse regulator A) and PhoP (phosphate response regulator P), showed altered levels in degradation defective Mtb. Icl, Ino1 and MtrA accumulated in Mtb degradation mutants, suggesting these proteins are targeted to the proteasome. Unexpectedly, PhoP was present in wild type Mtb but undetectable in the degradation mutants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that pupylation regulates numerous proteins in Mtb and may not always lead to degradation."

We analyzed changes in miRNA expression in human placental trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia, which may result from hypoperfusion and placental injury. Using an miRNA microarray screen, confirmed by Northern blot analysis, we defined a set of seven miRNAs (miR-93, miR-205, miR-224, miR-335, miR-424, miR-451, and miR-491) that are differentially regulated in primary trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia. We combined in silico prediction of miRNA targets with gene expression profiling data to identify a series of potential targets for the miRNAs, which were further analyzed using luciferase reporter assays. Among experimentally confirmed targets, we found that the transcriptional coactivator MED1, which plays an important role in placental development, is a target for miR-205. Using gain- and loss-of-function assays, we confirmed that miR-205 interacts with a specific target in the 3′-UTR sequence of MED1 and silences MED1 expression in human trophoblasts exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that miR-205 plays a role in trophoblast injury.—Mouillet, J.-F., Chu, T., Nelson, D.

The protein and transcript level of EpCAM rapidly diminished as soon as hESC had differentiated. This silencing was closely and exclusively associated with the radical transformation of histone modification at the EpCAM promoter. Moreover, we demonstrated that the dynamic pattern of lysine 27 trimethylation of histone 3 was conferred by the interplay of SUZ12 and JMJD3, both of which were involved in maintaining hESC pluripotency.

They retain the unlimited proliferation and developmental pluripotency from their progenitors and are able to self-renew and give rise to differentiated progeny of all three germ layers (1.Thomson J.A.

Therefore, hESCs have potential clinical applications and can be used to explore our knowledge of basic developmental biology. The identification of selectively expressed cell surface molecules is essential for the purification and characterization of pluripotent hESCs, playing an important role in helping us understand the mechanisms involved in stem cell differentiation and self-renewal.We recently established a very specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), OC98-1, against the cell surface protein EpCAM and found that EpCAM was highly expressed in undifferentiated hESCs. EpCAM (also known as 17-1A, GA733-2, KSA, ESA, and EGP-40) is a homophilic, calcium-independent cell adhesion molecule of 39–42 kDa (2.Litvinov S.V. Velders M.P. Bakker H.A. Fleuren G.J. Warnaar S.O.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) expressed by most epithelial tissues and is abundantly and homogeneously expressed in human carcinomas. EpCAM is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the TACSTD1 gene. The EpCAM protein consists of a total of 314 amino acids, containing an extracellular domain (EpEX) with a nidogen-like domain as well as thyroglobulin- and epidermal growth factor-like repeats (265 amino acids), a single transmembrane part, and a short intracellular domain (EpICD) of 26 amino acids. It is not structurally related to any of the major families of the adhesion molecules (cadherins, selectins, integrins, or cell adhesion molecules of the Ig superfamily) (4.Balzar M. Winter M.J. de Boer C.J. Litvinov S.V. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The level of EpCAM expression has been correlated with dedifferentiation and malignant proliferation of epithelial cells (5.Litvinov S.V. van Driel W. van Rhijn C.M. Bakker H.A. van Krieken H.

For the past few years, more has been learned about the influence of DNA methylation and histone modifications on regulating gene expression and genome function. Several studies have discussed the DNA methylation status of EpCAM promoter in lung, colon, prostate, liver, bladder, ovary, and breast cancer cells and tissues (18.Tai K.Y. Shiah S.G. Shieh Y.S.

Post-translational modifications of histone tails, including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation, have been validated as dynamic regulators of gene expression. In order to gain insight into the epigenetic transitions responsible for EpCAM expression in hESC, we studied the 5′-flanking region of EpCAM promoter by evaluating CpG status using methylation-specific PCR (MSP), bisulfite sequencing, and histone modification by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).The polycomb group (PcG) proteins are important chromatin modifiers that play a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of the development, differentiation, and maintenance of cell fates (22.Schuettengruber B. Chourrout D. Vervoort M. Leblanc B. Cavalli G. Cell. 2007; 128: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Dynamic repression of developmental pathways by PcG may be required for maintaining ES cell pluripotency and plasticity during embryonic development (23.Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. Bell G.W. Otte A.P. Vidal M. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Nature. 2006; 441: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mediates transcriptional repression by catalyzing the trimethylation of Lys27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) (24.Schwartz Y.B. Pirrotta V. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Suppressor of Zeste 12 homolog (SUZ12), one of the PRC2 components, is essential for histone methyltransferase PRC2 activity on H3K27me3 methylation (25.Swigut T. Wysocka J. Cell. 2007; 131: 29-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26.Cao R. Zhang Y. Mol.

The recent identification of JmjC domain-containing histone lysine demethylase JMJD3 suggests that there may be positive and negative regulators simultaneously controlling chromatin structure dynamics through histone methylation mark alterations. JMJD3 specifically removes methyl marks of H3K27me3 in mammalian cells to antagonize PcG gene silencing and permit gene transcription. JMJD3 is highly expressed in ES cells and is responsible for the rapid decrease of the H3K27me3 mark during specific stages of embryogenesis and stem cell differentiation (23.Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. Bell G.W. Otte A.P. Vidal M. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R.

These findings suggest that EpCAM may be regulated by both SUZ12 and JMJD3 during hESC differentiation.Understanding the downstream targets of EpCAM would help define the molecular function of this gene. However, such studies have been hindered by the obscure signaling mode of EpCAM until the very recent discovery of regulated intramembrane proteolysis and nuclear translocation of its intracellular domain EpICD. Released EpICD associates with FHL2, β-catenin, and Lef-1 and participates in gene regulation in the nucleus (6.Maetzel D. Denzel S. Mack B. Canis M. Went P. Benk M. Kieu C. Papior P. Baeuerle P.A. Munz M. Gires O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). One of the EpCAM downstream targets, c-MYC, has been found to be regulated by EpCAM in both normal and cancer cells (29.Münz M. Kieu C. Mack B. Schmitt B. Zeidler R. Gires O. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5748-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). c-MYC is a member of the four reprogramming factors involved in the induced pluripotent stem cell formation (30.Park I.H.

Science. 2009; 324: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Understanding the regulation of EpCAM on c-MYC and even other reprogramming genes like OCT-4, NANOG, SOX2, and KLF4 in hESC may add to our understanding of how EpCAM contributes the long term maintenance of the ES cell phenotype.This study is a comprehensive analysis of EpCAM expression in undifferentiated hESCs using immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blotting, and flow cytometry. Loss of EpCAM expression in differentiated hESCs through epigenetic silencing is elucidated by ChIP. Because several reprogramming genes are under the regulation of EpCAM, we propose that EpCAM maintains hESC “stemness” through sustaining these reprogramming genes.DISCUSSIONThe recent successful use of somatic cells that can be directly reprogrammed into pluripotency and self-renewal stem cells (31.Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14630) Google Scholar, 32.Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18453) Google Scholar) has opened a new means of investigating basic biology, developmental biology, and regenerative medicine. Ectopic transduction of terminally differentiated fibroblasts with the original four reprogramming transcription factors OCT-4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC results in induced pluripotent stem cell formation morphologically and genetically (31.Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14630) Google Scholar, 32.Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18453) Google Scholar). These four factors play a pivotal role in ES cell self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency. However, until this study, it was unknown what was mutually regulating these four genes. This study found that EpICD could directly bind to the promoters of these four genes (Fig. 7) and sustain the expression of these genes in undifferentiated hESCs (Fig. 7). EpCAM expression in undifferentiated hESCs occurred through epigenetic regulation (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Based on these findings, we propose that the maintenance of pluripotency by these four genes is controlled by the expression of EpCAM, which collaborates with these four factors to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency in ES cells.The expression of EpCAM has been used to recognize hepatic stem cells in fetal, postnatal, and adult humans (9.Schmelzer E.

Our study found EpCAM to be exclusively expressed in hESCs (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) and its expression to be correlated with the expression of OCT-4 (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2), a known stem cell marker. This finding suggests that the cell surface expression property of EpCAM can be used to purify and enrich hESCs effectively, and it can be used as a surrogate for OCT-4 or potentially other hESC markers to simplify and improve the isolation and purity of hESCs. Our data can be compared with a recent publication showing EpCAM expression in undifferentiated hESCs (17.Ng V.Y. Ang S.N. Chan J.X. Choo A.B. Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similar to that report, we show that EpCAM expression was restricted to undifferentiated hESCs, and its silencing was associated with cell differentiation. This property of EpCAM can make it useable as a surface marker for hESCs.Rigorous hESC isolation is a complicated process requiring various combinations of multiple cell surface markers. Nevertheless, many of the stem cell markers used nowadays cannot be used specifically on hESCs. For example, peanut agglutinin is only applicable as a cell surface marker in murine hematopoietic stem cells and human neural stem cells (56.Rietze R.L. Valcanis H. Brooker G.F. Thomas T. Voss A.K. Bartlett P.F. Nature. 2001; 412: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), and CD29 expression only can be used as a stem cell marker in murine skin or liver (10.Dan Y.Y. Riehle K.J. Lazaro C. Teoh N. Haque J. Campbell J.S. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9912-9917Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 57.Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). CD133 (prominin-1) has recently emerged as a major somatic stem cell or progenitor marker (58.Huttner H.B. Janich P. Köhrmann M. Jászai J. Siebzehnrubl F. Blümcke I. Suttorp M. Gahr M. Kuhnt D. Nimsky C. Krex D. Schackert G. Löwenbrück K. Reichmann H. Jüttler E. Hacke W. Schellinger P.D. Schwab S. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. Marzesco A.M. Corbeil D. Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 698-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a need to expand the current repertoire of hESC markers to enable hESC studies. Recognition by hESC-selective cell surface molecules is required in order to specifically isolate pure hESCs. Particularly, the combination of viable markers has made it possible to separate multiple hESC populations at each distinct differentiation stage and yielded important insights into stem cell differentiation. Because EpCAM is not expressed by differentiated cells, this molecule is probably exerted at the stem or multipotent progenitor cell stage.The results of studies over the past few years have suggested that epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in these fundamental processes of self-renewal, maintenance of pluripotency, and lineage specification (23.Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. Bell G.W. Otte A.P. Vidal M. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Jaenisch R.

For example, pluripotency-associated genes, such as OCT-4 and NANOG, are stably silenced upon cell differentiation through epigenetic mechanisms (60.Feldman N. Gerson A. Fang J. Li E. Zhang Y. Shinkai Y. Cedar H. Bergman Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Non-transcribed genes in ESCs are repressed by the PcG in mice and humans with the promoters of these genes enriched with repressive histone H3K27 trimethylation. Our investigation on the epigenetic regulations of EpCAM expression during differentiation indicated that the expression of EpCAM was not regulated by DNA methylation (Fig. 4), which would lead to permanent silencing of the gene. Instead, we found that during differentiation, there is a drastic reduction in histone active markers, such as H3K4 trimethylation and H3K9 acetylation, and clear enhancement of repressive markers H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation at the promoter of EpCAM (Fig. 5). In addition, EpCAM was not controlled by bivalent chromatin modifications (61.Azuara V. Perry P. Sauer S. Spivakov M. J⊘rgensen H.F. John R.M. Gouti M. Casanova M. Warnes G. Merkenschlager M.

Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3201) Google Scholar). Our findings reflect the fact that EpCAM is virtually reintroduced in mature tissues (64.Trzpis M. McLaughlin P.M. de Leij L.M. Harmsen M.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 386-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), especially in epithelia cells. Therefore, our results suggest that, to facilitate the dynamic expression pattern of EpCAM during development, the chromatin state of its promoter is elaborately modulated by histone-modifying enzymes, such as SUZ12 and JMJD3, but not DNA methylation (Fig. 6) in response to hESC differentiation, which sustains the plasticity of EpCAM expression. SUZ12 has been found to be a key component of polycomb complex, PRC2 (26.Cao R. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 57-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 27.Pasini D. Bracken A.P. Jensen M.R. Lazzerini Denchi E. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4061-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), and essential for the activity of H3K27 methyltransferase. Conversely, JMJD3, a newly identified histone demethylase for H3K27 methylation, is able to remove the methylation mark from H3 lysine 27 and control cell differentiation (65.De Santa F. Totaro M.G. Prosperini E. Notarbartolo S. Testa G. Natoli G. Cell. 2007; 130: 1083-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). We found SUZ12 and JMJD3 to be dynamically associated with EpCAM promoter (Fig. 6). The methylation patterns of H3 Lys27 also changed accordingly (Fig. 5). ChIP combination resulted from the enzyme bindings and the changes of the corresponding histone mark, suggesting that EpCAM is part of a polycomb-mediated differentiation program in human ES cells.Our study found that EpCAM played an intricate role in the regulation of the ES cell state. This may be achieved by modulating the expression of the EpCAM downstream target gene c-MYC, which, as other studies have reported, is involved in governing cell proliferation and dedifferentiation (29.Münz M. Kieu C. Mack B. Schmitt B. Zeidler R. Gires O. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5748-5758Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 50.Cartwright P. McLean C. Sheppard A. Rivett D. Jones K. Dalton S. Development. 2005; 132: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Both c-MYC and EpCAM are controlled by the Wnt signaling cascade (51.He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H.

The canonical Wnt signaling pathway has emerged as a critical regulator of ES and hematopoietic lineage stem cells in other studies (69.Reya T. Duncan A.W. Ailles L. Domen J. Scherer D.C. Willert K.

https://openalex.org/W2135020535,"The imprinted gene PEG3 confers parenting and sexual behaviors, alters growth and development, and regulates apoptosis. However, a molecular mechanism that can account for the diverse functions of Peg3/Pw1 is not known. To elucidate Peg3-regulated pathways, we performed a functional screen in zebrafish. Enforced overexpression of PEG3 mRNA during zebrafish embryogenesis decreased beta-catenin protein expression and inhibited Wnt-dependent tail development. Peg3/Pw1 also inhibited Wnt signaling in human cells by binding to beta-catenin and promoting its degradation via a p53/Siah1-dependent, GSK3beta-independent proteasomal pathway. The inhibition of the Wnt pathway by Peg3/Pw1 suggested a role in tumor suppression. Hypermethylation of the PEG3 promoter in primary human gliomas led to a loss of imprinting and decreased PEG3 mRNA expression that correlated with tumor grade. The decrease in Peg3/Pw1 protein expression increased beta-catenin, promoted proliferation, and inhibited p53-dependent apoptosis in human CD133(+) glioma stem cells. Thus, mammalian imprinting utilizes Peg3/Pw1 to co-opt the Wnt pathway, thereby regulating development and glioma growth."
https://openalex.org/W2020408466,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a crucial anatomic location in the brain. Its dysfunction complicates many neurodegenerative diseases, from acute conditions, such as sepsis, to chronic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Several studies suggest an altered BBB in lupus, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the current study, we observed a definite loss of BBB integrity in MRL/MpJ-Tnfrsf6lpr (MRL/lpr) lupus mice by IgG infiltration into brain parenchyma. In line with this result, we examined the role of complement activation, a key event in this setting, in maintenance of BBB integrity. Complement activation generates C5a, a molecule with multiple functions. Because the expression of the C5a receptor (C5aR) is significantly increased in brain endothelial cells treated with lupus serum, the study focused on the role of C5a signaling through its G-protein-coupled receptor C5aR in brain endothelial cells, in a lupus setting. Reactive oxygen species production increased significantly in endothelial cells, in both primary cells and the bEnd3 cell line treated with lupus serum from MRL/lpr mice, compared with those treated with control serum from MRL+/+ mice. In addition, increased permeability monitored by changes in transendothelial electrical resistance, cytoskeletal remodeling caused by actin fiber rearrangement, and increased iNOS mRNA expression were observed in bEnd3 cells. These disruptive effects were alleviated by pretreating cells with a C5a receptor antagonist (C5aRant) or a C5a antibody. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the vasculature in MRL/lpr brain was maintained by C5aR inhibition. These results demonstrate the regulation of BBB integrity by the complement system in a neuroinflammatory setting. For the first time, a novel role of C5a in the maintenance of BBB integrity is identified and the potential of C5a/C5aR blockade highlighted as a promising therapeutic strategy in SLE and other neurodegenerative diseases.—Jacob, A., Hack, B., Chiang, E., Garcia, J.

https://openalex.org/W2145771801,"Low-threshold mechanoreceptor neurons (LTMs) of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are essential for touch sensation. They form highly specialized terminations in the skin and display stereotyped projections in the spinal cord. Functionally defined LTMs depend on neurotrophin signaling for their postnatal survival and functioning, but how these neurons arise during development is unknown. Here, we show that specific types of LTMs can be identified shortly after DRG genesis by unique expression of the MafA transcription factor, the Ret receptor and coreceptor GFRalpha2, and find that their specification is Ngn2 dependent. In mice lacking Ret, these LTMs display early differentiation defects, as revealed by reduced MafA expression, and at later stages their central and peripheral projections are compromised. Moreover, in MafA mutants, a discrete subset of LTMs display altered expression of neurotrophic factor receptors. Our results provide evidence that genetic interactions involving Ret and MafA progressively promote the differentiation and diversification of LTMs."
https://openalex.org/W2135932405,"E. coli DNA Pol II and eukaryotic Rev3 are B-family polymerases that can extend primers past a damaged or mismatched site when the high-fidelity replicative polymerases in the same family are ineffective. We report here the biochemical and structural properties of DNA Pol II that facilitate this translesion synthesis. DNA Pol II can extend primers past lesions either directly or by template skipping, in which small protein cavities outside of the active site accommodate looped-out template nucleotides 1 or 2 bp upstream. Because of multiple looping-out alternatives, mutation spectra of bypass synthesis are complicated. Moreover, translesion synthesis is enhanced by altered partitioning of DNA substrate between the polymerase active site and the proofreading exonuclease site. Compared to the replicative B family polymerases, DNA Pol II has subtle amino acid changes remote from the active site that allow it to replicate normal DNA with high efficiency yet conduct translesion synthesis when needed."

We tested the hypothesis that digoxin reduces HIF-1 levels in ischemic tissue in vivo and suppresses neovascularization. Well-established murine models of ocular neovascularization were used to test our hypothesis. In mice with ischemic retinopathy, intraocular or intraperitoneal injection of digoxin markedly reduced retinal levels of HIF-1α protein and mRNAs encoding multiple hypoxia-regulated proangiogenic proteins and their receptors. Daily intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg starting at postnatal day (P) 12 or a single intravitreous injection of 100 ng of digoxin at P12 reduced retinal neovascularization by >70% at P17. Digoxin also reduced the number of CXCR4+ cells and F4/80+ macrophages in ischemic retina and significantly reduced choroidal neovascularization at Bruch's membrane rupture sites. Digoxin suppresses retinal and choroidal neovascularization by reducing HIF-1α levels, which blocks several proangiogenic pathways. Since digoxin suppresses multiple pathways in addition to VEGF signaling, it may provide advantages over specific VEGF antagonists for treatment of patients with retinal and choroidal diseases complicated by neovascularization and/or excessive vascular permeability. It may also be useful for treatment of neovascular diseases in other tissues.—Yoshida, T., Zhang, H., Iwase, T., Shen, J., Semenza, G. L., Campochiaro, P. A.

Although it is generally assumed that all these NGR compounds bind CD13 on tumor neovasculature, the role of different molecular scaffolds on peptide binding properties remains to be clarified. Recent studies showed that the Asn residue of NGR can rapidly deamidate and generate Asp and isoAsp residues (33.Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E. Bachi A. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36466-36476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This spontaneous reaction occurs by nucleophilic attack of the backbone NH center on the Asn side chain leading to formation of a succinimide intermediate (34.Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of succinimide leads, in turn, to formation of mixtures of isoDGR and DGR, with changes in charge and peptide bond length (33.Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E.

The transition of NGR to isoDGR/DGR is associated with loss of CD13 binding and gain of αvβ3-integrin binding activity (33.Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E. Bachi A. Corti A. J.

Biochemical studies, NMR structure analysis and αvβ3 docking experiments showed that isoDGR, but not NGR and DGR, can fit into the RGD-binding pocket of this integrin, recapitulating not only the canonical RGD/αvβ3 contacts but also establishing additional polar interactions (33.Curnis F.

Because of increased expression of αvβ3 integrin in tumor neovasculature, isoDGR has been exploited for ligand-directed delivery of TNF to tumors (36.Curnis F. Sacchi A. Gasparri A. Longhi R. Bachi A. Doglioni C. Bordignon C. Traversari C. Rizzardi G.P. Corti A. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7073-7082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that peptides containing this motif may represent a new class of ligands for the tumor vasculature. The role of flanking residues and molecular constraints on NGR deamidation reaction and on isoDGR integrin binding specificity is unknown. Remarkably, NGR deamidation can take place not only in peptides and peptide-drug conjugates, but also in fibronectin, an extracellular matrix protein that contains four NGR sites with different flanking residues (including two GNGRG sites) with important physiological implications (33.Curnis F.

Studies aimed at investigating the role of different molecular scaffolds on NGR/isoDGR biological properties and stability are, therefore, of great physiological and pharmacological interest. In this work, we have investigated the role of NGR/isoDGR flanking residues and molecular constraints on the biochemical and functional properties of these tumor vasculature-targeting motives. We show that the molecular scaffold critically affects the transition of NGR to isoDGR as well as the generation of other non-functional derivatives. Furthermore, we show that the NGR/isoDGR flanking residues are critical for their receptor binding affinity/specificity and biological activity in vitro and in vivo. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Clonetics, Lonza, Switzerland) were cultured according to the recommended protocols.

Similar peptides with acetyl groups linked to the α-amino group were also prepared (ac-isoDGR-2G and ac-isoDGR-2C). All peptides were dissolved in water and stored in aliquots at −20 °C. The molecular mass of each peptide was checked by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. NGR-Qdot, ARA-Qdot, and isoDGR-Qdot conjugates (consisting of ac-NGR-2C-TNF1–11, ac-ARA-2C-TNF1–11 and ac-isoDGR-2C-TNF1–11 chemically coupled to amine-modified quantum dots) were prepared as described (36.Curnis F.

Peptide stability and forced degradation studies were performed by incubating peptides in various buffers and temperature conditions. The product were then analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) and MALDI-TOF MS. RP-HPLC was performed using a C18 column (PepMap C18, 250 × 4.6 mm, PerSeptive Biosystem, Framingham, MA) connected with a guard column (Wakosil C18RS 10 × 4.0 mm, SGE Analytical Science, Italy). Mobile phase A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; mobile phase B, 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; 0% B for 10 min, linear gradient 0–27.5% B in 55 min, 100% B for 10 min, 0% of B for 15 min (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min). Peptide elution was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 214 nm and 280 nm (HPLC, LC-126 nm, Beckman Coulter). 1-μl aliquots of samples (200 μg/ml), diluted 1:100 v/v with water, were analyzed by MS analysis using a MALDI-TOF Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) (dried droplet technique and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix). Spectra were accumulated over a mass range of 750–2000 Da with a mean resolution of about 15,000. Spectra were externally calibrated using matrix signals and trypsin autolysis peaks then processed via Data Explorer software version 4.0.0.0 (Applied Biosystems). Binding assays of NGR-Qdot and isoDGR-Qdot were carried out as follows: HUVEC cells were grown in chamber slides (5 × 104 cell/well, plated 48 h before the experiment). After washing with 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm manganese chloride, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.1% sodium azide (called “Binding Buffer”), NGR-Qdot and isoDGR-Qdot (1:100, in Binding Buffer) were added to the cells and left to incubate for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with Binding Buffer, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 3% sucrose in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 150 mm (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature. DNA was counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen), and cells were then analyzed using an Olympus BX61 microscope (excitation filter, E460SPUVv2; emission filter, D605/20m, Chroma Technology Corp, Rockingham, VT). Competitive binding of NGR-Qdot and isoDGR-Qdot with NGR-2G, isoDGR-2G, isoDGR-2C or SGR-2C were performed as described above. Competitive binding assays of linear and cyclic isoDGR-peptides to αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, αvβ8, and α5β1 integrins were performed as follows: the ac-isoDGR/STV-HRP complex was diluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm manganese chloride, and 3% BSA, and mixed with various amounts of isoDGR-2G or isoDGR-2C peptides (acetylated and non-acetylated). The mixtures were then added to microtiter plates coated with integrins and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, each well was incubated with 70 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic solution (Sigma) for 20 min, at room temperature. The chromogenic reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1 n sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 450 nm was then measured using a microtiterplate reader. Cell adhesion assays were carried out using 96-well polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates as described (33.Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E. Bachi A. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36466-36476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with isoDGR-TNF (5 μg/ml in PBS, overnight at 4 °C). After washing with PBS the plates were incubated for 1 h with in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 3% BSA and seeded with EA.hy926 cells mixed with various amounts of isoDGR-2G and isoDGR-2C peptides. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing the plate with DMEM. Adherent cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose, in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution (Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland) for 10 min and washed with 0.9% sodium chloride. Cell adhesion was then quantified by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm, using a microtiter plate reader. Studies on animal models were approved by the Ethical Committee of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, and performed according to the prescribed guidelines. BALB/c (Charles River Laboratories, Calco, Italy), weighing 16–18 g were challenged with subcutaneous injection in the left flank of 106 WEHI-164 cells. Mice were then treated with ac-isoDGR-2G and ac-isoDGR-2C peptide (5 mg/kg in 100 μl of 0.9% sodium chloride, intraperitoneal, at day 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12). Tumor growth was monitored daily by measuring tumor volumes with calipers, as described (39.Gasparri A. Moro M. Curnis F. Sacchi A. Pagano S. Veglia F. Casorati G. Siccardi A.G. Dellabona P. Corti A.

Tumor size is shown as percentage increase of tumor volume after treatment (mean ± S.E.) of three independent experiments (5–6 mice/group in each experiment). Previous studies have provided evidence to suggest that NGR and isoDGR can bind CD13 and αvβ3, respectively, on endothelial cells (2.Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Kain R. Lahdenranta J. Sakamoto M.

We have coupled cyclic peptides containing the NGR, isoDGR and ARA motives to Qdot-fluorescent nanoparticles and studied their binding to HUVEC, a primary endothelial cell line that express both CD13 and αvβ3 integrin. Fluorescence microscopy experiments showed that NGR-Qdot, isoDGR-Qdot, but not the ARA-Qdot (negative control) can bind to HUVECs (Fig. 1A). The binding of NGR-Qdot was completely inhibited by an excess of CNGRCGVRY peptide (NGR-2C), but not by CisoDGRCGVRY (isoDGR-2C), while isoDGR-Qdot staining was completely inhibited by isoDGR-2C, but not by NGR-2C (Fig. 1B). These results are in line with the concept that NGR and isoDGR can bind different receptors on the surface of endothelial cells. We have also performed immunofluorescence co-staining experiments of NGR-Qdot and isoDGR-Qdot with anti-CD13 mAb WM15 and anti-αvβ3 mAb LM609, respectively. The results show that there is good overlapping between antibody and peptide-Qdot staining (supplemental Fig. S1). Of note, some areas stained by the anti-αvβ3 antibody were not stained by isoDGR-Qdot, suggesting that αvβ3 exists in active and inactive conformations. We then analyzed the capability of linear GNGRGGVRY (NGR-2G) and cyclic NGR-2C to compete the binding of NGR-Qdot to HUVECs. We found that NGR-2C inhibits the binding of NGR-Qdot about 3-fold more efficiently than NGR-2G (Fig. 1C). No inhibition of NGR-Qdot was observed with SGR-2C, a control peptide. These results suggest that linear and cyclic peptides bind endothelial cells with different affinity. Next we investigated the role of molecular scaffold on NGR peptide stability. To this aim we compared the stability of CNGRCGVRSSSRTPSDKY (NGR-2C-TNF1–11) with that of linear GNGRGGVRSSSRTPSDKY (NGR-2G-TNF1–11), i.e. two peptides currently used for targeted delivery of TNF and liposomes to tumors (5.Curnis F.

Ribatti D. Longhi R. Allen T.M. Corti A. Ponzoni M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7400-7409PubMed Google Scholar). These peptides were analyzed by RP-HPLC before and after incubation in PBS (pH 7.3), HEPES (pH 7.4), or water, at 37 °C or 4 °C. The half-lives of NGR-2C-TNF1–11 and NGR-2G-TNF1–11 (at 37 °C) were 6–8 h and 3–4 h, respectively, in PBS, and 2 days and 3.5 days, respectively, in HEPES buffer (Fig. 2, A and C). Of note, no major changes were observed with both peptides after incubation in water at 37 °C or 4 °C for more than 1 week. Both peptides were stable for more than 3 years when stored in water at −20 °C or in a lyophilized formulation at 4 °C (data not shown). The stability of NGR-2C and NGR-2G in serum was also evaluated. The half-life of NGR-2C at 37 °C was 5 h (Fig. 2, B and C), whereas that of NGR-2G was about 3 h (not shown). These results indicate that peptide stability strongly depends on buffer composition and temperature as well as on the presence or absence of molecular constraints. However, it is remarkable that both linear and cyclic peptides are very stable in water. The Asn residue of CNGRC can deamidate via succinimide formation and loss of ammonia (−17 Da), followed by rapid hydrolysis and formation of Asp and isoAsp, with an overall gain of 1 Da (33.Curnis F. Longhi R. Crippa L. Cattaneo A. Dondossola E. Bachi A. Corti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36466-36476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is also known that peptides containing Asn in the second position may undergo additional intramolecular reactions involving the N-terminal α-amino group, loss of ammonia (−17 Da), and formation of six/seven-membered rings (40.Dehart M.P. Anderson B.D. J. Pharm. Sci. 2007; 96: 2667-2685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41.Lura R. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7671-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To characterize the structural changes occurring in linear and cyclic peptides after degradation, we monitored peptide degradation by MALDI-TOF MS. Storage of cyclic NGR-2C-TNF1–11 at 37 °C for 8 days in PBS generated a large amount of a product characterized by a gain of 1 Da (+1 Da product), likely corresponding to a DGR/isoDGR mixture. Conversely, storage of linear NGR-2G-TNF1–11 under the same conditions generated a product characterized by loss of 17 Da (−17 Da product) and only small amounts of the +1 Da product (supplemental Table S1). We observed similar degradation patterns also with shorter peptides (NGR-2C and NGR-2G) after incubation for 1 day or 8 days (Fig. 2D, upper panel and supplemental Table S1). To assess whether the −17 Da degradation product described above was related to the succinimide intermediate of Asn deamidation and/or to other reaction involving the N-terminal α-amino group (leading to the formation of six/seven-membered ring compounds), we performed forced degradation studies of linear and cyclic peptides with acetylated α-amino group. Acetylation of NGR-2G markedly decreased the formation of the −17 Da product both in PBS and in HEPES (Fig. 2D, lower panels and supplemental Table S2), pointing out the crucial role of α-amino group in peptide degradation. Because succinimide formation does not involve the α-amino group, these results provide support for the hypothesis that the −17 Da product corresponds to six/seven-membered ring compounds. Consistently, blockade of the α-amino group in the linear peptide apparently enhanced Asn deamidation, as suggested by the increased production of the +1 Da product following incubation in PBS for 8 days (Fig. 2D, lower panel). Of note, the −17 Da degradation product was apparently stable even after incubation for 8 days at 37 °C (supplemental Table S1). In conclusion, the results of peptide degradation studies suggest that linear NGR mainly generates a −17 Da degradation product, likely corresponding to six/seven membered ring compounds, whereas cyclic NGR mainly generates a +1 Da product, likely corresponding to isoDGR/DGR. Thus, the NGR molecular scaffold markedly affects the peptide degradation pattern. We have previously shown that isoDGR can efficiently bind to αvβ3 integrin (36.Curnis F. Sacchi A. Gasparri A. Longhi R. Bachi A. Doglioni C. Bordignon C. Traversari C. Rizzardi G.P. Corti A. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7073-7082Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional properties of the degradation products of linear and cyclic NGR peptides, we then analyzed the capability of NGR-2C-and NGR-2G-forced degradation products to compete the binding of an isoDGR peptide in a competitive αvβ3 integrin binding assay (33.Curnis F.

Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in awake, fixating monkeys, we obtained complete quantitative measurements of the spatiotemporal dynamics of V1 responses over the entire region activated by small, briefly presented stimuli. The responses exhibit several complex properties: they begin to rise approximately simultaneously over the entire active region, but reach their peak more rapidly at the center. However, at stimulus offset the responses fall simultaneously and at the same rate at all locations. Although response onset depends on stimulus contrast, both the peak spatial profile and the offset dynamics are independent of contrast. We show that these results are consistent with a simple population gain-control model that generalizes earlier single-neuron contrast gain-control models. This model provides valuable insight and is likely to be applicable to other brain areas.

Neurol. 1974; 158: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, Grinvald et al., 1994Grinvald A. Lieke E.E. Frostig R.D. Hildesheim R. Cortical point-spread function and long-range lateral interactions revealed by real-time optical imaging of macaque monkey primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2545-2568PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that even small stimuli are encoded by a large population of neurons in V1. Furthermore, electrophysiological studies in behaving primates suggest that perception is mediated by a population of neurons rather than by single neurons (Parker and Newsome, 1998Parker A.J. Newsome W.T. Sense and the single neuron: probing the physiology of perception.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 227-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, Purushothaman and Bradley, 2005Purushothaman G. Bradley D.C. Neural population code for fine perceptual decisions in area MT.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, to understand the encoding and decoding of visual stimuli in the cortex, it is important to characterize the properties of V1 population responses. One approach is to estimate population responses from single neuron responses. Single unit recordings in V1 have revealed a number of fundamental properties that ought to contribute to the population responses. First, single neurons have receptive fields with a substantial spatial extent that increases rapidly as a function of retinal eccentricity (Hubel and Wiesel, 1974Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N. Uniformity of monkey striate cortex: a parallel relationship between field size, scatter, and magnification factor.J. Comp.

The visual field representation in striate cortex of the macaque monkey: asymmetries, anisotropies, and individual variability.Vision Res. 1984; 24: 429-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Second, the response amplitude of single neurons increases nonlinearly with contrast, typically reaching response saturation at low to modest contrasts (Albrecht and Hamilton, 1982Albrecht D.G. Hamilton D.B. Striate cortex of monkey and cat: contrast response function.J. Neurophysiol. 1982; 48: 217-237PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the tuning of single neurons is typically invariant with contrast, even in the saturated response range (Albrecht and Hamilton, 1982Albrecht D.G. Hamilton D.B. Striate cortex of monkey and cat: contrast response function.J. Neurophysiol. 1982; 48: 217-237PubMed Google Scholar, Albrecht and Geisler, 1991Albrecht D.G. Geisler W.S.

Neurosci. 1992; 9: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Fourth, the latency of the response of single neurons decreases as a function of stimulus contrast (Dean and Tolhurst, 1986Dean A.F. Tolhurst D.J. Factors influencing the temporal phase of response to bar and grating stimuli for simple cells in the cat striate cortex.Exp. Brain Res. 1986; 62: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Carandini and Heeger, 1994Carandini M. Heeger D.J.

Visual cortex neurons in monkey and cat: effect of contrast on the spatial and temporal phase transfer functions.Vis. Neurosci. 1995; 12: 1191-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although these properties are common in V1 neurons, there is a vast heterogeneity among the neurons, and thus it is unclear how these properties are combined and manifested at the population level. In addition, single-unit and multiple-unit studies in V1 have focused mainly on responses at or near the center of activity produced by the stimulus. Responses at locations more peripheral to the center of activity are largely unknown. Here we provide a complete quantitative description of the real-time spatiotemporal dynamics of V1 population responses to a small, briefly presented (200 ms), localized stationary visual stimulus. Most measurements of response properties in V1 have been performed using drifting stimuli with relatively long durations (several seconds) to approximate a steady-state condition. However, natural saccadic inspection of a visual scene typically produces transient stimulation: 200–300 ms fixations separated by rapid eye movements. In addition, although it is common to analyze cortical responses by their peak responses and latencies (phases) for drifting stimuli, the falling edges of the responses can potentially provide useful information for briefly presented stimuli (Bair et al., 2002Bair W. Cavanaugh J.R. Smith M.A. Movshon J.A. The timing of response onset and offset in macaque visual neurons.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3189-3205PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to fully understand the properties of the population responses under natural conditions, it is important to measure the complete time courses of responses to briefly presented stimuli. We used voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI; Grinvald and Hildesheim, 2004Grinvald A. Hildesheim R. VSDI: a new era in functional imaging of cortical dynamics.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 874-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) in alert, fixating monkeys, to measure population responses in the superficial layers of macaque V1 over an area of approximately 1 cm2. The imaged area covered the entire region activated by the small local stimulus. We found several unexpected properties that are not obvious from single unit responses. First, the spatial profile of the peak response is independent of stimulus contrast. Second, responses start to rise at all locations approximately at the same time, but rise at a faster rate at the center of activity than at peripheral locations. Third, both the latency and steepness of the rising edge of the response depend on stimulus contrast. Finally, after stimulus offset, the responses at all locations fall simultaneously and at the same rate, regardless of stimulus contrast. These complex properties illustrate the importance of quantitative characterization of population responses in both space and time. Next, we considered whether there is a general mechanism that can account for these rich dynamics. To do this, we explored several well-known families of computational models. We find that the observed response properties are inconsistent with simple models having a fixed linear operation followed by a nonlinearity that operates within the individual neuron (e.g., a spike threshold or a refractory effect), and with models that use slow lateral connections to explain the difference in the response dynamics at different cortical locations. To account for the observed properties in both time and space, we propose a simple feedforward population gain-control (PGC) model that generalizes earlier normalization models for single V1 neurons (Albrecht and Geisler, 1991Albrecht D.G. Geisler W.S. Motion selectivity and the contrast-response function of simple cells in the visual cortex.Vis. Neurosci. 1991; 7: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, Heeger, 1991Heeger D.J. Nonlinear model of neural responses in cat visual cortex.in: Landy M.S. Movshon J.A. Computational Models of Visual Processing. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 119-133Google Scholar, Heeger, 1992Heeger D.J. Normalization of cell responses in cat striate cortex.Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 9: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, Carandini and Heeger, 1994Carandini M. Heeger D.J.

Linearity and normalization in simple cells of the macaque primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8621-8644PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the temporal dynamics and the gain of the local responses are controlled by population activity in the network rather than by the nonlinear properties of individual neurons or synapses. We simulated the early visual pathway from the retina to V1 by a two-stage PGC model. The model's dynamics closely resemble those in the data. Responses in the retina and LGN also show evidence of nonlinear contrast gain-control (Shapley and Victor, 1978Shapley R.M. Victor J.D. The effect of contrast on the transfer properties of cat retinal ganglion cells.J. Physiol. 1978; 285: 275-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, Sclar et al., 1990Sclar G. Maunsell J.H. Lennie P. Coding of image contrast in central visual pathways of the macaque monkey.Vision Res. 1990; 30: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, Kaplan and Benardete, 2001Kaplan E. Benardete E. The dynamics of primate retinal ganglion cells.Prog. Brain Res. 2001; 134: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and thus it is an open question whether a significant part of the nonlinearity in V1 responses is inherited from its input. To address this important question, we used the PGC model to predict how the relative contributions of nonlinearities within layers 2-3 in V1 versus its inputs affect the relationship between stimulus size and V1 response amplitude. The results from a VSDI experiment varying stimulus size were consistent with a PGC model in which most of the nonlinear processing occurs in the first stage, suggesting that the nonlinearities observed in the VSDI responses may be mostly implemented prior to the superficial layers in V1. In summary, our results illustrate the value of quantitative analysis and computational modeling in testing hypotheses regarding the biophysical and anatomical factors underlying neural population activity. We characterized the spatiotemporal properties of the V1 population responses to small, briefly presented, stimuli that are relevant in natural vision, and found that the response dynamics are complex and unexpected from the results in single unit recordings. Importantly, we show that a simple PGC model can qualitatively account for the complex dynamics, suggesting that gain-control is likely to be a general mechanism contributing to neural dynamics in the brain. We used VSDI to measure V1 population responses to a briefly presented stationary Gabor stimulus while a monkey was performing a fixation task. The goal was to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the population responses over the entire area activated by a small Gabor stimulus. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the fine-scale columnar signals, which are modulated by the orientation of the stimulus, were not measured in the current study and will be addressed in future studies. The peak responses were taken by averaging the responses over a fixed 100 ms window (160 to 260 ms after stimulus onset; shaded region in Figure 2A). The spatial distribution of the peak responses at two contrasts are shown in Figures 1A and 1B. The distributions are well fitted by two-dimensional Gaussians (Figure 1C). The Gaussians are elongated because of the anisotropic mapping of visual space in V1 (Van Essen et al., 1984Van Essen D.C. Newsome W.T. Maunsell J.H.

Rapid and precise retinotopic mapping of the visual cortex obtained by voltage-sensitive dye imaging in the behaving monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 1002-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Importantly, as shown in our previous studies (Chen et al., 2006Chen Y. Geisler W.S. Seidemann E. Optimal decoding of correlated neural population responses in the primate visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1412-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2008Chen Y.

Neurophysiol. 2008; 99: 1366-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the widths of the Gaussian fits are not significantly different across different contrasts for both the major axis (σ=2.1mm) and minor axis (σ=1.8mm) (one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA], p > 0.1; Figures 1D and 1E). The widths of the spatial distributions are hence largely contrast invariant. We have previously shown that this spread is not significantly affected by the small variability in the monkey's eye position (Chen et al., 2006Chen Y. Geisler W.S. Seidemann E. Optimal decoding of correlated neural population responses in the primate visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1412-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The width of the stimulus (σ = 0.167°) maps to only ∼0.5 mm on the cortex through the cortical magnification factor alone (3 mm/deg; obtained in the same animal from retinotopy measurements in another experiment [C.R. Palmer, Y. Chen., and E. Seidemann, 2008, Soc. Neurosci., abstract]). The ∼2 mm wide spatial profile is mainly due to the size and scatter of V1 receptive fields (Hubel and Wiesel, 1974Hubel D.H.

Point images in the visual system: new interest in an old idea.Trends Neurosci. 1986; 9: 354-358Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, some of this widening could reflect significant lateral spread of activity through horizontal connections in V1 (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1979Gilbert C.D. Wiesel T.N.

Bullier J. Lund J.S. Circuits for local and global signal integration in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8633-8646PubMed Google Scholar). One goal of the modeling component of the current study was to examine the possible contribution of these distinct mechanisms to response spread in V1. Figure 1F shows the average peak response over a circular region of 0.5 mm radius at the center of the response profile (central region outlined in Figure 1C) as a function of stimulus contrast. Similar to single units, the responses follow a sigmoidal function on a log contrast axis; the solid curve is a Naka-Rushton function fitted to the data (r2 = 0.98). To analyze the response properties at different locations in V1, the imaging pixels were divided into small bins according to their distances from the center of activity. The image was first divided into 0.5 mm wide concentric annular regions, centered at the peak of the spatial response, with the central region being a disc of 0.5 mm radius. The pixels in the central region had an average distance of 0.25 mm from the center, and the average distance increased by 0.5 mm in each annulus. Due to the anisotropic response profile, we considered only the pixels within a 1 mm wide strip along the major axis of the fitted Gaussian profile. Within this strip the relationship between distance and amplitude was nearly constant. The temporal responses of the pixels within each annulus that were also inside of the strip were averaged to produce a single time course for the corresponding distance. Figure 1C shows the bins up to an average distance of 2.75 mm; responses at greater distances were not analyzed because they were weak and noisy, especially at lower contrasts. Figure 2A shows the average time courses of the responses at the center bin for different stimulus contrasts. To quantitatively characterize these time courses, they were first divided into two parts. The first part, defined as the rising edge, was the response in the first 210 ms after stimulus onset. The rest of the time course was defined as the falling edge. Each individual edge from each trial was smoothed by a five-frame moving average, normalized, and then fitted separately with a logistic function 1/(1+exp(−λ(t−t50))) (e.g., Figure 2B). The parameter λ describes the slope of the response, and t50 is the time that the response reaches half of its peak. For example, a λ of 0.05 means that the response takes about 44 ms after t50 to reach 90% of the peak. The same fitting procedure was applied independently at the different locations shown in Figure 1C for each stimulus contrast. We also define the rising edge latency as the time after stimulus onset (t10) for the fitted response to reach 10% of its peak amplitude. Similarly, the latency of a falling edge is the time to decrease by 10% from the peak after stimulus offset. The duration of the rising and falling edges is at least 50 ms (five frames; see Figure 2A), hence there are enough samples for fitting the logistic functions, which provide a good description of the response dynamics. Figure 2C shows the latencies of the rising and falling edges in the center bin as a function of contrast. As observed in single neuron studies (Dean and Tolhurst, 1986Dean A.F. Tolhurst D.J. Factors influencing the temporal phase of response to bar and grating stimuli for simple cells in the cat striate cortex.Exp. Brain Res. 1986; 62: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Carandini and Heeger, 1994Carandini M. Heeger D.J.

Visual cortex neurons in monkey and cat: effect of contrast on the spatial and temporal phase transfer functions.Vis. Neurosci. 1995; 12: 1191-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and Figure 2B, the latency of the rising edge decreases as stimulus contrast increases (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.01). On the other hand, there is no significant difference in the falling edge latencies for different contrasts (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.15). Asymmetric properties between rising and falling edges are also observed in their slopes (Figure 2D). The slope of the rising edge increases as contrast increases (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.01), while the slope of the falling edge remains approximately constant (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.15). In other words, the rising edge is accelerated in both latency and slope as contrast increases, while the falling edge is largely independent of contrast. The space-time color plots in Figure 2E summarize in a compact form all the temporal responses as a function of stimulus contrast and position. The normalized fitted responses for each contrast are shown as separate subplots; within each subplot the time course of the response at each of the six location bins from Figure 1C is indicated by a horizontal row, progressing from the center location at the top to the most peripheral location at the bottom. For example, the upper horizontal row in the plot for 100% contrast corresponds to the dark blue curve in Figure 2B. Several qualitative observations can be made from these maps (they will be quantified later). For each contrast, (1) the response latencies at different locations are approximately equal, as can be seen by the vertically aligned transitions from blue to cyan in each map, and (2) the response rises at a slower rate as distance from the center increases, as can be seen by the increase in the tilt of the transition between the colors as the normalized amplitude increases. In addition, for each location, as contrast increases (3) response latency decreases, and (4) the response rises at a faster rate. Finally, (5) after stimulus offset, the falling edges are similar for all locations and contrasts. All these key properties were also observed in additional experiments in a second animal. We next examine these properties quantitatively. The above observations can be quantitatively evaluated using the logistic fits obtained from individual trials. Figure 3 plots, for each stimulus contrast, the rising edge latency (t10) as a function of distance from the center bin. For each contrast, there was no significant difference in the latencies at different locations (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.1 for all contrasts). However, as observed at the center bin, latency of the rising edge decreased as stimulus contrast increased at all locations (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.01 for all locations). These results confirm observations (1) and (3). Figure 3B plots the same latency data in Figure 3A, but as a function of the peak response. For the same response amplitude, the latency can be different at different stimulus contrasts (e.g., see latencies at a ΔF/F= 0.065%). This important result demonstrates that the dynamics of the response at a given location in V1 do not depend solely on the local response amplitude, but rather depend on the response amplitudes over a larger region. We will revisit this key property when we discuss possible models of V1 activity. The rate at which the response rises (λ) depends on both stimulus contrast and on location (Figure 3C). For a particular contrast, the slopes decrease significantly as distance from the center increases (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.01 for all contrasts), confirming observation (2). In addition, at a fixed location, the slope of the rising edge increases with contrast (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.01 for all locations), supporting observation (4). Furthermore, the slope also increases with peak response with a correlation coefficient of 0.94 (Figure 3D). Due to the decreasing slope as a function of distance from the center, the time to half of the peak response (t50) increased at locations peripheral to the center of activity. If t50 was employed as a measure of latency, a traveling wave of activity would appear to be originating from the center (Figures 3E and 3F), as observed previously in anesthetized animals (Grinvald et al., 1994Grinvald A. Lieke E.E. Frostig R.D. Hildesheim R. Cortical point-spread function and long-range lateral interactions revealed by real-time optical imaging of macaque monkey primary visual cortex.J.

The average difference of the time to half peak between the locations 0.25 mm and 2.75 mm away from the center was 6.2 ms. This difference corresponds to a propagation speed of 0.4 mm/ms (for t50), which is at the higher end of the speed of propagation through lateral connections (0.1–0.4 mm/ms; Hirsch and Gilbert, 1991Hirsch J.A.

Cortex. 2000; 10: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As we shall see later, such differences in time to half of the peak can be explained by a feedforward PGC model. The dynamics of the falling edges of the responses differed markedly from those of the rising edges. As shown in Figure 4, both the latency and slope were independent of contrast and location (two-way ANOVA, p > 0.15 across contrasts and locations for both latency and slope). The responses at all locations therefore fell approximately simultaneously and at the same rate, regardless of the stimulus contrast and response amplitude, supporting observation (5). The latency was slightly longer (t10 = 65 ms) and the slope shallower (λ = 0.026) than those of the rising edges. Such asymmetry in the temporal properties of the falling and rising edge can also be explained by the PGC model. Although the falling edge latency is longer than the rising edge for all contrasts, the reverse relationship has been observed in the firing rates of single units (Bair et al., 2002Bair W. Cavanaugh J.R. Smith M.A. Movshon J.A. The timing of response onset and offset in macaque visual neurons.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3189-3205PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancy is consistent with the fact that the VSDI measures membrane potentials (Grinvald and Hildesheim, 2004Grinvald A. Hildesheim R. VSDI: a new era in functional imaging of cortical dynamics.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 874-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Because of spike threshold, the onset of spiking activity will lag behind the rise in the VSDI response. On the other hand, for the falling edge the drop in spiking activity will coincide with the drop in the VSDI response (as long as membrane potential is above threshold). Thus, for spikes it is quite possible for the onset latency to be greater th"
https://openalex.org/W1987205813,"The main endogenous source of glutamine is de novo synthesis in striated muscle via the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS). The mice in which GS is selectively but completely eliminated from striated muscle with the Cre-loxP strategy (GS-KO/M mice) are, nevertheless, healthy and fertile. Compared with controls, the circulating concentration and net production of glutamine across the hindquarter were not different in fed GS-KO/M mice. Only a approximately 3-fold higher escape of ammonia revealed the absence of GS in muscle. However, after 20 h of fasting, GS-KO/M mice were not able to mount the approximately 4-fold increase in glutamine production across the hindquarter that was observed in control mice. Instead, muscle ammonia production was approximately 5-fold higher than in control mice. The fasting-induced metabolic changes were transient and had returned to fed levels at 36 h of fasting. Glucose consumption and lactate and ketone-body production were similar in GS-KO/M and control mice. Challenging GS-KO/M and control mice with intravenous ammonia in stepwise increments revealed that normal muscle can detoxify approximately 2.5 micromol ammonia/g muscle.h in a muscle GS-dependent manner, with simultaneous accumulation of urea, whereas GS-KO/M mice responded with accumulation of glutamine and other amino acids but not urea. These findings demonstrate that GS in muscle is dispensable in fed mice but plays a key role in mounting the adaptive response to fasting by transiently facilitating the production of glutamine. Furthermore, muscle GS contributes to ammonia detoxification and urea synthesis. These functions are apparently not vital as long as other organs function normally."
https://openalex.org/W2069780662,"The neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB is critical to diverse biological processes. We investigated the interplay of Src family kinases (SFKs) and TrkB to better understand mechanisms of TrkB signaling in physiological and pathological conditions. We compared and contrasted the role of SFKs in TrkB signaling following activation of TrkB by two mechanisms, its transactivation by zinc, and its activation by its prototypic neurotrophin ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Using biochemical, pharmacological, and chemical genetic studies of cultured rodent neurons, we found that zinc promotes preferential phosphorylation of Tyr-705/Tyr-706 of TrkB by a SFK-dependent but TrkB kinase-independent mechanism, a signaling event critical for transactivation of TrkB by zinc. By contrast, SFK activity is not essential for BDNF-mediated activation of TrkB, yet SFK activity is increased as a consequence of TrkB activation by BDNF. Moreover, BDNF-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-705/Tyr-706 of TrkB was inhibited by SFK inhibitors, implicating a regulatory role of SFKs in TrkB activation by BDNF. In sum, SFKs are activated by TrkB and, in turn, SFKs can promote TrkB activation. We propose models depicting the mutual regulation of SFKs and TrkB following activation of TrkB by zinc and BDNF."
https://openalex.org/W2032316709,"Understanding the residue covariations between multiple positions in protein families is very crucial and can be helpful for designing protein engineering experiments. These simultaneous changes or residue coevolution allow protein to maintain its overall structural-functional integrity while enabling it to acquire specific functional modifications. Despite the significant efforts in the field there is still controversy in terms of the preferable locations of coevolved residues on different regions of protein molecules, the strength of coevolutionary signal and role of coevolution in functional diversification.In this paper we study the scale and nature of residue coevolution in maintaining the overall functionality and structural integrity of proteins. We employed a large scale study to investigate the structural and functional aspects of coevolved residues. We found that the networks representing the coevolutionary residue connections within our dataset are in general of 'small-world' type as they have clustering coefficient values higher than random networks and also show smaller mean shortest path lengths similar and/or lower than random and regular networks. We also found that altogether 11% of functionally important sites are coevolved with any other sites. Active sites are found more frequently to coevolve with any other sites (15%) compared to protein (11%) and ligand (9%) binding sites. Metal binding and active sites are also found to be more frequently coevolved with other metal binding and active sites, respectively. Analysis of the coupling between coevolutionary processes and the spatial distribution of coevolved sites reveals that a high fraction of coevolved sites are located close to each other. Moreover, approximately 80% of charge compensatory substitutions within coevolved sites are found at very close spatial proximity (<or= 5A), pointing to the possible preservation of salt bridges in evolution.Our findings show that a noticeable fraction of functionally important sites undergo coevolution and also point towards compensatory substitutions as a probable coevolutionary mechanism within spatially proximal coevolved functional sites."
https://openalex.org/W2066601649,"NO synthesis is a prerequisite for proper insulin sensitivity in insulin-targeted tissues; however, the molecular basis for this process remains unclear. Using a gain-of-function model of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS)-transfected COS-7 cells, we have shown a critical role of NO in insulin responsiveness, as evidenced by an NO-dependent increase of tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the insulin receptor and its downstream effectors insulin receptor substrate-1 and PKB/AKT. We hypothesized that NO-induced inactivation of endogenous protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) would enhance insulin receptor-mediated signaling. To test this hypothesis, we devised a new method of the PTP labeling using a cysteine sulfhydryl-reacted probe. Under the acidic conditions employed in this study, the probe recognized the reduced and active forms but not the S-nitrosylated and inactive forms of endogenous PTPs. Our data suggest that phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, and PTP1B, but not TC-PTP, are likely S-nitrosylated at the active site cysteine residue concomitantly with a burst of NO production in signaling response to insulin stimulation. These results were further confirmed by phosphatase activity assays. We investigated further the role of NO as a regulator of insulin signaling by RNA interference that ablates endogenous eNOS expression in endothelial MS-1 cells.

IntroductionThe liver, muscle, and fat of obese people or people with type 2 diabetes are less responsive to insulin stimulation (1.Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar). This insulin resistance leads to abnormal hepatic glucose production and impaired glucose uptake in peripheral tissues (1.Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar). Attempting to uncover the underlying mechanism through which this process occurs, many studies have focused on the complex signaling networks activated by the insulin receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase responsible for insulin action. Although the molecular basis is not fully understood, the data accumulated over the last decade have suggested that the inhibition of insulin receptor-mediated signaling contributes to the development of insulin resistance (2.Tang S. Le-Tien H. Goldstein B.J. Shin P. Lai R. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3.Cheng A. Dubé N. Gu F. Tremblay M.L. Eur. J.

It has been shown that dephosphorylation of insulin receptor and its substrates by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseIRSinsulin receptor substrateeNOSendothelial nitric-oxide synthasesiRNAsmall interfering RNADTTdithiothreitolWTwild typeBSAbovine serum albuminROSreactive oxygen speciesc-PTIO2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazole-1-oxyl-3-oxide. attenuates insulin action, leading to insulin resistance in otherwise insulin-responsive cells (3.Cheng A. Dubé N. Gu F. Tremblay M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1050-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 4.Asante-Appiah E. Kennedy B.P. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E663-E670Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In principle, any cell signaling that could inactivate PTPs of the insulin receptor and its substrates should be able to enhance insulin responsiveness in tissues targeted by insulin.Several PTPs identified as insulin receptor phosphatases are expressed in tissues responsive to insulin (3.Cheng A. Dubé N. Gu F. Tremblay M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1050-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For PTPs that are insulin receptor phosphatases to respond properly to physiological conditions, they might need to be inactivated by insulin stimulation (5.Meng T.C. Buckley D.A. Galic S. Tiganis T. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37716-37725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, in metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, the intrinsic driving force responsible for the inactivation of those PTPs may be impaired, resulting in the suppression of insulin receptor-mediated signaling. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control insulin-induced inhibition of endogenous PTPs targeting insulin receptor and its substrates would make possible the development of new therapeutic strategies for obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we explored the possible role of intracellular NO in this process.Over the past decade great progress has been made in understanding the important role that intrinsic NO plays in the maintenance of insulin responsiveness. Early observations showed that pharmacologic blockage of nitric-oxide synthase activity caused peripheral insulin resistance in rats (6.Baron A.D. Zhu J.S. Marshall S. Irsula O. Brechtel G. Keech C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E709-E715PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Roy D. Perreault M. Marette A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E692-E699PubMed Google Scholar). Later, a series of studies demonstrated that NO donors could mimic the activity of insulin by stimulating glucose transport and metabolism in isolated rat muscle (8.Balon T.W. Nadler J.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 82: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 9.Young M.E. Radda G.K. Leighton B. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10.Higaki Y. Hirshman M.F. Fujii N. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Recent studies have reported that by disrupting the gene encoding endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), mice became resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and they displayed hypertension and hyperlipidemia, two characteristics commonly associated with insulin resistance (11.Shankar R.R. Wu Y. Shen H.Q. Zhu J.S. Baron A.D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 12.Duplain H. Burcelin R. Sartori C. Cook S. Egli M. Lepori M. Vollenweider P.

Paralleling these sophisticated genetic analyses, biochemical studies have also uncovered mechanisms underlying the phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascade found in insulin-stimulated activation of eNOS in insulin-responsive cells (14.Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 15.Zeng G. Nystrom F.H. Ravichandran L.V. Cong L.N. Kirby M. Mostowski H. Quon M.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30392-30398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Moreover, eNOS has been found not only in endothelia but also in muscle (17.Kapur S. Bédard S. Marcotte B. Côté C.H. Marette A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and adipose tissues (18.Engeli S. Janke J. Gorzelniak K. Böhnke J. Ghose N. Lindschau C. Luft F.C. Sharma A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1640-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Presumably because of the function of endogenous eNOS, NO production is increased in human preadipocytes in response to insulin stimulation (18.Engeli S. Janke J. Gorzelniak K. Böhnke J. Ghose N.

Although these studies shed light on the close link between the regulatory role of NO and the insulin responsiveness, little is known about what NO specifically targets in the signaling context response to insulin.We (19.Chen Y.Y.

Chem. 2007; 282: 13977-13983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have found PTPs to be easily inactivated by NO-induced S-nitrosylation of the active site Cys residue. Their susceptibility to S-nitrosylation makes the inhibition of phosphatase activity reversible (20.Chen Y.Y. Chu H.M. Pan K.T. Teng C.H. Wang D.L. Wang A.H. Khoo K.H. Meng T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35265-35272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This inactivation of phosphatase activity occurs not only when purified PTP is exposed to NO in vitro (19.Chen Y.Y. Huang Y.F. Khoo K.H. Meng T.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24878-24882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but also when endogenous PTP responds to increased levels of cellular NO in vivo (23.Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24.Yu C.X. Li S. Whorton A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25.Barrett D.M.

Thus, it has been proposed that S-nitrosylation may function as a general means of inactivating PTPs in signaling pathways associated with NO production (20.Chen Y.Y. Chu H.M. Pan K.T. Teng C.H. Wang D.L. Wang A.H. Khoo K.H. Meng T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35265-35272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23.Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch Biochem.

Based on available knowledge, it is likely that some insulin receptor PTPs may undergo S-nitrosylation and inactivation when insulin-induced signaling occurs with the simultaneous activation of eNOS. Should this hypothesized process be proven, then our understanding of the mechanisms underlying insulin responsiveness would be greatly advanced.In this study, we investigated whether endogenous PTPs, specifically those identified as insulin receptor phosphatases, are targeted and inactivated by the NO produced in response to insulin-activated eNOS. Rather than relying on indirect pharmacologic blockage of nitric-oxide synthase, we used a gain-of-function model, in which ectopic eNOS was expressed in cells lacking endogenous eNOS, and a loss-of-function model, in which endogenous eNOS was ablated in cells via RNA interference, to examine the effect of insulin-induced NO production on PTP activity and insulin responsiveness. During the course of this study, we developed a new method of visualizing NO-mediated modification of endogenous PTPs in response to insulin stimulation.DISCUSSIONPrevious findings have suggested that eNOS-mediated NO synthesis is a prerequisite for the maintenance of proper insulin sensitivity and carbohydrate metabolism in insulin-targeted tissues (11.Shankar R.R. Wu Y. Shen H.Q. Zhu J.S. Baron A.D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 12.Duplain H. Burcelin R. Sartori C. Cook S. Egli M. Lepori M. Vollenweider P. Pedrazzini T. Nicod P. Thorens B. Scherrer U. Circulation. 2001; 104: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 13.Cook S. Hugli O. Egli M. Ménard B. Thalmann S. Sartori C. Perrin C. Nicod P. Thorens B. Vollenweider P. Scherrer U. Burcelin R. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular basis for the NO action that facilitates the insulin responsiveness remains an elusive unknown. In this study, we showed that insulin-induced NO targets endogenous PTPs, suppressing phosphatase activity in eNOS-expressed cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that as soon as the insulin receptor is activated, newly synthesized NO acts as a second messenger, rapidly inactivating the PTPs responsible for tyrosine dephosphorylation of insulin receptors. The inactivation of insulin receptor phosphatases occurs concomitantly with the enhanced activity of insulin receptor and downstream effectors IRS-1 and PKB/AKT. Importantly, the enhanced activity of insulin receptor was found to be dependent upon NO production and PTP inactivation, because the administration of NO scavenger and PTP inhibitor ablated the NO effect on insulin the signaling pathway. Moreover, using endothelial cells as a physiological model, we also showed that NO produced by endogenous eNOS is essential for promoting the activation of insulin receptor, IRS-1, and PKB/AKT in signaling cascade response to insulin stimulation. Thus, we have provided insight into the role of NO in the regulation of insulin sensitivity.In addition to its role in regulating glucose metabolism in liver, muscle, and fat, insulin also acts as a vasodilator by activation of eNOS and subsequent NO production in endothelia (12.Duplain H. Burcelin R. Sartori C. Cook S. Egli M. Lepori M. Vollenweider P. Pedrazzini T. Nicod P. Thorens B. Scherrer U. Circulation. 2001; 104: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a signaling cascade initiated from the insulin receptor, IRS-1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PKB/AKT, and eNOS is responsible for insulin-stimulated NO production (16.Montagnani M. Chen H. Barr V.A. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30392-30398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in this study we further demonstrate that eNOS-dependent production of NO in endothelia has a positive regulatory role that promotes insulin receptor-directed signal transduction, presumably because of NO-mediated S-nitrosylation and inactivation of insulin receptor phosphatases. As a consequence, NO plays an essential role in inactivation of the PTPs, which provide the inhibitory constraint upon the system, thus facilitating insulin action in endothelia for a high level of NO production. We propose that such a regulatory mechanism is the key to boosting the vasodilator function of endothelia soon after stimulation by insulin.Our observation that selective chemical labeling of Cys residues with low pKa by the PEO probe suggests that the active site Cys of endogenous PTPs is the primary target of NO (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). We have shown previously that NO-mediated S-nitrosylation creates only the reversible modification but not highly oxidized and irreversible modification of the active site Cys in PTPs (20.Chen Y.Y. Chu H.M. Pan K.T. Teng C.H. Wang D.L. Wang A.H. Khoo K.H. Meng T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35265-35272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The reversible S-NO form remains at the active site Cys even under severe nitrosative stress (20.Chen Y.Y. Chu H.M. Pan K.T. Teng C.H. Wang D.L. Wang A.H. Khoo K.H. Meng T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35265-35272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because insulin receptor-induced signal transduction is transient, strictly reversible Cys modification may be critical for the regulation of enzymatic activity of insulin receptor phosphatases. After the initial inhibition of PTP activity that leads to enhanced insulin receptor activity, cellular reductants may convert the S-nitrosylated Cys residue back to a reduced form, thus reactivating PTPs for tyrosine dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and terminating the signaling response to insulin stimulation.In this study, the key to visualizing several PTPs undergoing NO-mediated inactivation in insulin-induced signaling was the PEO probe. Although the biotin switch method is known to be a useful platform for detecting S-nitrosylated proteins in various biological systems (21.Forrester M.T. Foster M.W. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13977-13983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 35.Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), including animal tissues (36.Hao G. Derakhshan B. Shi L. Campagne F. Gross S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and cultured mammalian cells (37.Kuncewicz T. Sheta E.A. Goldknopf I.L. Kone B.C. Mol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), this method could not be used in our study because none of the endogenous PTPs with antibodies available could be identified in insulin-stimulated eNOS transfectants following the typical procedure of the biotin switch method. To date, only one member of the PTP family has been found by the biotin switch method to be a S-nitrosylated protein, although in that study the cells were exposed to an extremely high level of NO donor (37.Kuncewicz T. Sheta E.A. Goldknopf I.L. Kone B.C. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 156-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Under severe nitrosative stress, the biotin switch method may have been sensitive enough to differentiate S-nitrosylated PTPs from the reduced PTPs in cell lysates. However, based on our own experience during the course of this study, it would be unlikely that the biotin switch method could be used directly to visualize S-nitrosylated PTPs in signaling response to a physiological stimulus, which in this study was insulin. For this task, the PEO probe labeling proved to be useful.Previous literature has suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) (5.Meng T.C. Buckley D.A. Galic S. Tiganis T. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37716-37725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 39.Mahadev K. Zilbering A. Zhu L. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol.

Moreover, according to in vivo studies, ROS have been found capable of oxidizing and inactivating PTPs, which function as insulin receptor phosphatases (40.Meng T.C. Fukada T. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 41.Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be difficult to define specifically the effect of ROS or NO on the regulation of insulin signaling through Cys modification of endogenous PTPs. To clarify the role of NO, COS-7 cells ectopically expressing eNOS were employed in this study. Although COS-7 cells have not been used typically as a model for investigation of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, their lack of endogenous eNOS (26.Iwakiri Y. Satoh A. Chatterjee S. Toomre D.K. Chalouni C.M. Fulton D. Groszmann R.J. Shah V.H. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Comparing control cells with eNOS-transfected cells, we showed unambiguously that NO induces the inactivation of SHP-1, SHP-2, and PTP1B, concomitant with the enhanced phosphorylation of insulin receptor in signaling response to insulin stimulation. In contrast, TC-PTP, which also functions as an insulin receptor phosphatase (5.Meng T.C. Buckley D.A. Galic S. Tiganis T. Tonks N.K. J. Biol.

TC-PTP may be oxidized and inactivated through a ROS-mediated mechanism in cells treated with insulin (5.Meng T.C. Buckley D.A. Galic S. Tiganis T. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37716-37725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Our findings combined with others suggest that NO and ROS may regulate specific fractions of endogenous PTPs in response to insulin stimulation. NO- and ROS-mediated inhibition of phosphatase activity may synergistically contribute to insulin sensitivity. Therefore, more research is needed to elucidate the fine-tuning process involved in the downstream signaling that is responsible for glucose uptake and metabolism controlled by NO or ROS. IntroductionThe liver, muscle, and fat of obese people or people with type 2 diabetes are less responsive to insulin stimulation (1.Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R.

It has been shown that dephosphorylation of insulin receptor and its substrates by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseIRSinsulin receptor substrateeNOSendothelial nitric-oxide synthasesiRNAsmall interfering RNADTTdithiothreitolWTwild typeBSAbovine serum albuminROSreactive oxygen speciesc-PTIO2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazole-1-oxyl-3-oxide. attenuates insulin action, leading to insulin resistance in otherwise insulin-responsive cells (3.Cheng A.

In principle, any cell signaling that could inactivate PTPs of the insulin receptor and its substrates should be able to enhance insulin responsiveness in tissues targeted by insulin.Several PTPs identified as insulin receptor phosphatases are expressed in tissues responsive to insulin (3.Cheng A. Dubé N. Gu F. Tremblay M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1050-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For PTPs that are insulin receptor phosphatases to respond properly to physiological conditions, they might need to be inactivated by insulin stimulation (5.Meng T.C. Buckley D.A. Galic S. Tiganis T. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37716-37725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, in metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, the intrinsic driving force responsible for the inactivation of those PTPs may be impaired, resulting in the suppression of insulin receptor-mediated signaling. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control insulin-induced inhibition of endogenous PTPs targeting insulin receptor and its substrates would make possible the development of new therapeutic strategies for obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we explored the possible role of intracellular NO in this process.Over the past decade great progress has been made in understanding the important role that intrinsic NO plays in the maintenance of insulin responsiveness. Early observations showed that pharmacologic blockage of nitric-oxide synthase activity caused peripheral insulin resistance in rats (6.Baron A.D. Zhu J.S. Marshall S. Irsula O. Brechtel G. Keech C.

Later, a series of studies demonstrated that NO donors could mimic the activity of insulin by stimulating glucose transport and metabolism in isolated rat muscle (8.Balon T.W. Nadler J.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 82: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 9.Young M.E. Radda G.K. Leighton B. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10.Higaki Y.

Recent studies have reported that by disrupting the gene encoding endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), mice became resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and they displayed hypertension and hyperlipidemia, two characteristics commonly associated with insulin resistance (11.Shankar R.R.

Paralleling these sophisticated genetic analyses, biochemical studies have also uncovered mechanisms underlying the phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascade found in insulin-stimulated activation of eNOS in insulin-responsive cells (14.Zeng G.

Marcotte B. Côté C.H. Marette A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1691-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and adipose tissues (18.Engeli S. Janke J. Gorzelniak K. Böhnke J. Ghose N. Lindschau C.

Presumably because of the function of endogenous eNOS, NO production is increased in human preadipocytes in response to insulin stimulation (18.Engeli S. Janke J. Gorzelniak K. Böhnke J. Ghose N.

Their susceptibility to S-nitrosylation makes the inhibition of phosphatase activity reversible (20.Chen Y.Y. Chu H.M. Pan K.T. Teng C.H. Wang D.L. Wang A.H. Khoo K.H. Meng T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35265-35272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This inactivation of phosphatase activity occurs not only when purified PTP is exposed to NO in vitro (19.Chen Y.Y. Huang Y.F. Khoo K.H. Meng T.C.

Thus, it has been proposed that S-nitrosylation may function as a general means of inactivating PTPs in signaling pathways associated with NO production (20.Chen Y.Y. Chu H.M. Pan K.T. Teng C.H.

Based on available knowledge, it is likely that some insulin receptor PTPs may undergo S-nitrosylation and inactivation when insulin-induced signaling occurs with the simultaneous activation of eNOS. Should this hypothesized process be proven, then our understanding of the mechanisms underlying insulin responsiveness would be greatly advanced.In this study, we investigated whether endogenous PTPs, specifically those identified as insulin receptor phosphatases, are targeted and inactivated by the NO produced in response to insulin-activated eNOS. Rather than relying on indirect pharmacologic blockage of nitric-oxide synthase, we used a gain-of-function model, in which ectopic eNOS was expressed in cells lacking endogenous eNOS, and a loss-of-function model, in which endogenous eNOS was ablated in cells via RNA interference, to examine the effect of insulin-induced NO production on PTP activity and insulin responsiveness. During the course of this study, we developed a new method of visualizing NO-mediated modification of endogenous PTPs in response to insulin stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1967814569,"The G protein-coupled receptor P2Y(2) nucleotide receptor (P2Y(2)R) has been shown to be up-regulated in a variety of tissues in response to stress or injury. Recent studies have suggested that P2Y(2)Rs may play a role in immune responses, wound healing, and tissue regeneration via their ability to activate multiple signaling pathways, including activation of growth factor receptors. Here, we demonstrate that in human salivary gland (HSG) cells, activation of the P2Y(2)R by its agonist induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 via two distinct mechanisms, a rapid, protein kinase C-dependent pathway and a slower and prolonged, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent pathway. The EGFR-dependent stimulation of UTP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HSG cells is inhibited by the adamalysin inhibitor tumor necrosis factor-alpha protease inhibitor or by small interfering RNA that selectively silences ADAM10 and ADAM17 expression, suggesting that ADAM metalloproteases are required for P2Y(2)R-mediated activation of the EGFR. G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to promote proteolytic release of EGFR ligands; however, neutralizing antibodies to known ligands of the EGFR did not inhibit UTP-induced EGFR phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that UTP causes association of the EGFR with another member of the EGF receptor family, ErbB3. Furthermore, stimulation of HSG cells with UTP induced phosphorylation of ErbB3, and silencing of ErbB3 expression inhibited UTP-induced phosphorylation of both ErbB3 and EGFR. UTP-induced phosphorylation of ErbB3 and EGFR was also inhibited by silencing the expression of the ErbB3 ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1). These results suggest that P2Y(2)R activation in salivary gland cells promotes the formation of EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimers and metalloprotease-dependent neuregulin 1 release, resulting in the activation of both EGFR and ErbB3."

https://openalex.org/W2147863793,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that occurs almost exclusively on CpG dinucleotides. MECP2 is a member of a family of proteins that preferentially bind to methylated CpGs. We analyzed the contribution of MECP2 to the physiology of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Partial silencing of MECP2 in human MSCs induced a significant reduction of S-phase cells, along with an increase in G1 cells. These changes were accompanied by a reduction of apoptosis, the triggering of senescence, a decrease in telomerase activity, and the down-regulation of genes involved in maintaining stem cell properties. Senescence appeared to rely on impairment of DNA damage repair and seemed to occur through RB- and P53-related pathways. The effects of MECP2 silencing could be related to the modification of the DNA methylation status. Our results indicate that the silencing of MECP2 induces an increase in methylated cytosines in the genome. Nevertheless, MECP2 partial silencing did not change the methylation of promoters, whose expression is affected by MECP2 down-regulation.—Squillaro, T., Alessio, N., Cipollaro, M., Renieri, A., Giordano, A., Galderisi, U.

Interleukin (IL)-8 is a potent chemoattractant and is also involved in angiogenesis. The molecular mechanism whereby PARs induce epithelial IL-8 expression is not known. In HT-29 colonic epithelial cells, PAR(1) or PAR(2) agonists stimulated the expression of IL-8 through a NF-kappaB-dependent pathway without inducing IkappaB degradation and disassociation of IkappaB from NF-kappaB. Further studies revealed that PAR activation induced the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-276 in the nucleus, which increased the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 to p50. Inhibition of ERK activation completely blocked PAR-induced IL-8 expression, phosphorylation of p65 and HAT activity. We also demonstrated that RSK p90 was the downstream kinase that mediated ERK-induced nuclear p65 phosphorylation. In conclusion, activation of either PAR(1) or PAR(2) stimulated the transcriptional up-regulation of IL-8 in HT-29 colonic epithelial cells through a pathway that involved ERK/RSK p90, NF-kappaB phosphorylation, and HAT activity. These studies provide evidence of a new role for serine proteinases and PARs in the regulation of gene expression in colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2090385306,"Trial by trial variability during motor learning is a feature encoded by the basal ganglia of both humans and songbirds, and is important for reinforcement of optimal motor patterns, including those that produce speech and birdsong. Given the many parallels between these behaviors, songbirds provide a useful model to investigate neural mechanisms underlying vocal learning. In juvenile and adult male zebra finches, endogenous levels of FoxP2, a molecule critical for language, decrease two hours after morning song onset within area X, part of the basal ganglia-forebrain pathway dedicated to song. In juveniles, experimental 'knockdown' of area X FoxP2 results in abnormally variable song in adulthood. These findings motivated our hypothesis that low FoxP2 levels increase vocal variability, enabling vocal motor exploration in normal birds.After two hours in either singing or non-singing conditions (previously shown to produce differential area X FoxP2 levels), phonological and sequential features of the subsequent songs were compared across conditions in the same bird. In line with our prediction, analysis of songs sung by 75 day (75d) birds revealed that syllable structure was more variable and sequence stereotypy was reduced following two hours of continuous practice compared to these features following two hours of non-singing. Similar trends in song were observed in these birds at 65d, despite higher overall within-condition variability at this age.Together with previous work, these findings point to the importance of behaviorally-driven acute periods during song learning that allow for both refinement and reinforcement of motor patterns. Future work is aimed at testing the observation that not only does vocal practice influence expression of molecular networks, but that these networks then influence subsequent variability in these skills."
https://openalex.org/W2165844675,"Expansion of a polymorphic polyglutamine segment is the common denominator of neurodegenerative polyglutamine diseases. The expanded proteins typically accumulate in large intranuclear inclusions and induce neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms that determine the subcellular site and rate of inclusion formation are largely unknown. We found that the conserved putative nuclear localization sequence Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg, which is retained in a highly aggregation-prone fragment of ataxin-3, did not affect the site and degree of inclusion formation in a cell culture model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Addition of synthetic nuclear export or import signals led to the expected localization of ataxin-3 and determined the subcellular site of aggregate formation. Triggering a cellular stress response by heat shock transcription factor DeltaHSF1 coexpression abrogated aggregation in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. These findings indicate that native aggregation-prone fragments derived from expanded ataxin-3 may eventually escape the cytoplasmic quality control, resulting in aggregation in the nuclear compartment."

High doses of ionizing gamma radiation and exposure to a combination of DNA-damaging chemicals do not decrease Mcm10 protein levels, demonstrating that Mcm10 down-regulation is triggered only by UV-specific damage. The decrease of Mcm10 protein levels is not caused by transcriptional inhibition or cleavage by apoptotic enzymes, but results from degradation by the 26 S proteasome.

Therefore, our study reveals a mechanism by which mammalian cells effectively inhibit the replication machinery during stress to prevent it from drifting toward a catastrophic path of genomic instability. Proliferating eukaryotic cells tightly regulate DNA replication so that it occurs only once per cell cycle and on experiencing DNA damage, this process is rapidly inhibited by the regulation of key proteins to avoid aberrant replication. DNA replication begins by binding of a six-subunit origin recognition complex to the origin of replication followed by recruitment of several additional initiation factors, including CDC6, Cdt1, and MCM, in the M and G1 phase of the cell cycle. An increase in cyclin-dependent kinase activity at the G1-S transition promotes the unwinding of DNA and the recruitment of the DNA synthesis factors, CDC45, GINS complex, RPA, and the DNA polymerase α-primase. Mcm10 is a conserved DNA replication protein with homologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to Homo sapiens (1.Solomon N.A. Wright M.B. Chang S. Buckley A.M. Dumas L.B. Gaber R.F.

In Xenopus and humans, the chromatin-bound Mcm2–7 helicase complex is essential for the loading of Mcm10, but in budding yeast, it is reported that Mcm10 is recruited to the chromosome before the Mcm2–7 helicase (3.Homesley L.

Therefore, it is expected that cells must tightly regulate the activity of Mcm10, and this is apparent from the natural control of Mcm10 activity; this protein undergoes inhibitory phosphorylation at the end of the S phase, where its activity needs to be curtailed, leading to its dissociation from chromatin at G2 phase and eventually degradation in mitosis (2.Izumi M.

The essential requirement of Mcm10 at multiple stages of DNA replication raises the possibility that the cell may regulate its Mcm10 activity in stressed environments to block DNA replication and cell cycle progression. Stress resulting from different DNA-damaging agents, such as UV and gamma radiation or mutagenic chemicals, manifests itself in a particular manner, which could incite a similar or specific cellular response. In response to UV irradiation, cells induce a dose-dependent regulation of transcription, and the genes that are repressed within 12–24 h include DNA polymerase-α, primase, Fen1, RFC, cyclin B1, cyclin A, Cdk7, and Cdc6 (12.Gentile M.

In this attempt, we have proven that Mcm10, an essential replication factor, is down-regulated following UV stress. In the present study, we demonstrate that upon UV exposure, Mcm10 protein levels decrease, whereas gamma radiation and DNA-damaging chemicals have no effect on Mcm10 stability. The degradation of Mcm10 is mediated by the 26 S proteasome and is independent of the cell cycle phase. Because Mcm10 is essential for the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication, this study provides a possible mechanism by which UV radiation induces the arrest of DNA replication by inhibiting a key molecule of the DNA replication machinery. Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or MEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Specific chemicals and antibodies used in this study are mentioned under supplemental information. U2OS cells were synchronized in late G1 phase by incubation with 0.5 mm mimosine for 24 h, released into drug-free medium, and UV-irradiated at 4-h intervals using the UV cross-linker CL-1000 from UVP. Cells were harvested 2 h after irradiation for protein and DNA analysis.

Full-length Mcm10 was subcloned into EcoRV and NotI sites of pCDNA3, which carries a sequence encoding the hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminal of the insert. Mcm10 cDNA was amplified by PCR, digested with NotI and HindIII and subcloned into pCTAP (which allows for tandem affinity purification with a C-terminal streptavidin-binding peptide and a calmodulin-binding peptide tag). Similarly, Mcm10 cDNA was cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of pMX-puro-HA and BamHI and EcoRI sites of pMX-puro-3NLS-GST-HA vector, respectively. The sequences of cloning primers have been provided under supplemental information. Cells of almost equal confluency were lysed in proportionate volumes of Laemmli buffer for immunoblotting. To demonstrate equal protein loading in each lane, immunoblotting was performed and a nonspecific protein band was displayed. For expression of Mcm10, 293T cells were transfected with pCTAP-MCM10 and harvested 48 h later. 293T cells were transfected with pMX-puro-MCM10 along with helper plasmids (that express the viral VSV-G envelope protein as well as the Gag and Pol proteins) to generate viral particles. To obtain stable U2OS cell lines expressing Mcm10, U2OS cells were infected with the viral particles and selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin. To determine the levels of Mcm10 fragments, lysates of the stable cell lines were immunoblotted with an HA antibody, and equal protein loading was demonstrated in all lanes by immunoblotting with a control antibody. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Tween-20, and then stained with a specific primary antibody followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody. Finally, the cells were observed under the microscope after mounting with vector shield mounting reagent with DAPI. HeLa cells were exposed to 40 J/m2 UV and harvested every 4 h to assay Mcm10 levels. For BrdUrd immunofluorescence, cells were incubated with 100 μm BrdUrd over the same time period followed by fixing with 4% formaldehyde, treatment with 2 m HCl, and neutralization with 0.1 m sodium borate buffer (pH 8.5). The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with a FITC-conjugated BrdUrd antibody. To determine the effect of UV irradiation on the replication machinery, we surveyed the levels of known replication factors post-UV exposure. The human osteosarcoma cell line, U2OS, was exposed to 50 J/m2 UV radiation, and in an immunoblot with the Mcm10 antibody, we observed that the intensity of a 110-kDa band decreased within 1 h (Fig. 1A). Mcm10 is an intensely studied protein, and therefore, we wanted to confirm that: (a) the 110-kDa band is indeed Mcm10 and not a cross-reactive band, and (b) the decrease in the band intensity is due to complete degradation and not proteolysis of a particular segment, leaving the rest of the protein unaltered. To address these points, we raised several antibodies that recognize different parts of Mcm10. HA-tagged full-length (1–875 amino acids), N-terminal (30–430 amino acids), and C-terminal (510–875 amino acids) Mcm10 were cloned into the pCTAP vector. The specific Mcm10 fragments were expressed in 293T cells and detected with an HA antibody (Fig. 1B, left panel). Ab (FL) is a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the full-length protein. As seen in Fig. 1B (right panel), this antibody recognized the C-terminal, N-terminal, and full-length proteins. Ab (N) is a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the full-length protein, but showed weak immunoreactivity against the C-terminal protein (Fig. 1B, middle-left panel). Ab (C) is a C-terminal commercial antibody from Calbiochem raised against a peptide that corresponds to exon 14 (amino acids 584–659) of Mcm10 (Fig. 1B, middle-right panel). A lower molecular mass band below the 30–430 amino acids fragment in lane 2 was recognized by all of the antibodies that have immunoreactivity toward the N-terminal of Mcm10 (anti-HA, Ab (N), Ab (FL)), but not by Ab (C). Thus, this band seems to be a degradation product that arose from the expression of the 30–430 amino acids fragment of Mcm10. Therefore, we obtained antibodies that recognized either the N-terminal, C-terminal, or full-length Mcm10 proteins. When we immunoblotted the non-irradiated and UV-irradiated lysates, there was a decrease in Mcm10 signal with all three of these antibodies (Fig. 1C). This result completely ruled out the possibility that the disappearance of the Mcm10 band was due to partial proteolysis. Also, we did not observe the appearance of any other low molecular mass bands, which would indicate truncation of Mcm10. We performed RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) depletion against two segments of Mcm10; siRNA-1 targeted nucleotides 1062–1082 of the Mcm10 coding sequence, while siRNA-2 targeted nucleotides 3225–3245 of the 3′-UTR of Mcm10. Both siRNAi-1 and siRNA-2 caused a decrease in the same 110-kDa band, establishing that UV radiation triggered the down-regulation of Mcm10 (Fig. 1C). We then performed indirect immunofluorescence with the N-terminal Mcm10 antibody, Ab (N), and observed that in an asynchronous population, around 40–50% of cells retained the Mcm10 protein (Fig. 1D). To confirm that the FITC signal was from the Mcm10 protein, RNAi against MCM10 was performed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1E). There was no signal with prebleed or after Mcm10 siRNA, authenticating the Mcm10 signal. Following UV irradiation, low level of Mcm10 was observed, verifying its degradation (Fig. 1D). Immunofluorescence was also carried out with a different Mcm10 antibody, Ab (FL), which confirmed the down-regulation of Mcm10 post-UV irradiation (Fig. 1F). To exclude any artifact of visualization or nonspecific effects, we examined the localization of cyclin A under similar conditions, which did not show any change in its level upon UV treatment (supplemental Fig. S1B). UV radiation triggers major transcriptional reprogramming, affecting many genes. To ascertain whether UV irradiation affects other replication factors, we evaluated the levels of key replication proteins including replicative helicases, Mcm2, Mcm3, Mcm4, Mcm5, Mcm6, and Mcm7 and replication initiators, Orc2, Orc3, Orc4, and Orc5 (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1A). We observed that the levels of these key replication proteins remained unchanged, and that the decrease of Mcm10 was uniquely regulated, as has been reported for Cdt1 (13.Higa L.A. Mihaylov I.S. Banks D.P. Zheng J. Zhang H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The Mcm10 decrease around 1–2 h post-UV exposure seems to be temporally separated from the instantaneous Cdt1 down-regulation, thereby displaying the redundancy of the cellular surveillance mechanisms for maintaining genomic stability (Fig. 2A). Although 40 J/m2 was sufficient to cause Mcm10 down-regulation, we used a higher UV dose in all future experiments to firmly establish the involvement of the factors mediating this pathway (Fig. 2B). Jeanette Cook and co-workers (14.Hall J.R. Kow E. Nevis K.R. Lu C.K. Luce K.S. Zhong Q. Cook J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3340-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have reported that after 3 h of exposure to 30 J/m2 UV radiation, Cdc6 is down-regulated by a different ubiquitin ligase, and therefore, it seems that the cell utilizes Mcm10 as an independent node for the inhibition of the replication machinery. Yoshida and Inoue (17.Yoshida K. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6250-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have reported that the repressing transcription factor E2F4 is recruited to the TOPBP1 and MCM10 promoter after a few hours (4–24 h) of UV exposure. The authors suggested that this would lead to a decrease in Mcm10 mRNA levels, although no data demonstrating changes in the Mcm10 mRNA has been shown. To ascertain whether the decrease in the Mcm10 protein that we observed post-UV exposure is due to transcriptional inhibition, we exposed U2OS cells to UV irradiation and evaluated the Mcm10 mRNA levels after 2 h by reverse transcriptase-PCR. We found that there was no significant change in Mcm10 mRNA levels (Fig. 2C, left panel, third panel from top). On the other hand, Mcm10 mRNA levels were reduced after siRNA depletion, indicating that our PCR amplification was not at a saturating level (Fig. 2C, right panel, third panel from top). Therefore, the observed UV-mediated decrease of the Mcm10 protein is not due to transcriptional inhibition and, instead, is likely due to proteolysis. It has been previously reported that Mcm10 protein expression is not mainly regulated at the transcriptional level, but depends on degradation (10.Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48526-48531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our initial work was largely performed with the osteosarcoma cell line, U2OS, and we wanted to ascertain that the Mcm10 decrease was a regulatory event adopted by cells from varying sources. Therefore, we compared the following cell lines: human embryonic kidney cells, 293T; prostate cancer cell line, PC3; breast cancer cell line, MDA231; human colon cancer cell line, HCT116 and cervical cancer cell line, HeLa. Upon exposure to UV, Mcm10 decreased in all the cell lines tested, although the rate of degradation varied between cell lines (Fig. 2D). We also tested the regulation of Mcm10 in a primary human fetal lung fibroblast cell line, MRC-5, and observed that Mcm10 levels decreased after UV shock. Therefore, Mcm10 down-regulation was not limited to cells from a particular lineage. We wanted to test whether Mcm10 is down-regulated after exposure to other agents of DNA damage such as ionizing gamma radiation and DNA-damaging chemicals. Interestingly, in U2OS and HeLa cells, until 4 and 8 h (respectively) after exposure to high doses of gamma radiation (50 Gy), we did not observe any change in Mcm10 levels (Fig. 3, A and B). With this treatment, phosphorylation at serine 345 of Chk1, a standard marker for DNA damage, was observed (Fig. 3, A and B, bottom panel). We then exposed U2OS and HeLa cells to high doses of DNA-damaging chemicals, which included a combination of the following drugs: 25 milliunits/ml bleomycin, 10 μm cisplatin, 10 μm doxorubicin, and 100 μm cyclophosphamide. The cells were harvested 8 h later. To our surprise, exposure of U2OS and HeLa cells to this massive dose of genotoxic chemicals did not decrease Mcm10 protein levels (Fig. 3C, i and ii). Therefore, the down-regulation of Mcm10 is conducted by a pathway that is specifically induced by UV-mediated DNA damage. Exposure to genotoxic chemicals for 8 h led to DNA damage and activation of apoptotic machinery, as evidenced by cleavage of PARP and caspase 9 (Fig. 3C, ii). However, under this condition of activated apoptosis, Mcm10 levels did not decrease, establishing that the apoptotic machinery does not target Mcm10. Further, we determined the kinetics of the activation of apoptosis, as evaluated by the appearance of cleaved caspases 7 and 9 and the decrease of Mcm10 after UV exposure (supplemental Fig. S2A). We observed that there was a significant decrease in Mcm10 levels within 2–3 h of UV-irradiation of HeLa cells, but the activation of caspase 7 and 9 occurred only after 6 h, demonstrating that the apoptotic pathway is activated after the Mcm10 decrease and, therefore, cannot be the cause of its down-regulation (supplemental Fig. S2A). We exposed U2OS cells to UV radiation in the presence of Ac-DEVD-CHO and Z-LEHD-FMK, inhibitors of the key DNA damage-activated apoptotic enzymes, caspase 3 and caspase 9, respectively (Fig. 3, D and E). Although we observed a clear inhibition of caspase 9, the decrease of Mcm10 was unaffected, thereby verifying that Mcm10 down-regulation is not mediated by the apoptotic pathway. The above results conclusively establish that the down-regulation of Mcm10 post-UV exposure is not caused by the apoptotic machinery. Because the apoptotic machinery was ruled out as a down-regulator of Mcm10 after UV exposure, we ascertained the involvement of other proteolytic pathways. We used other inhibitors to confirm the involvement of the proteasome; MG132 is an inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, AcLLnL inhibits the proteasome and calpains, while ALLM inhibits calpains but not the proteasome. HeLa and U2OS cells were incubated in the presence of 50 μm MG-132, 25 μm AcLLnL, or 25 μm ALLM for 4 h followed by 200 J/m2 and 100 J/m2 UV exposure and were harvested after 4 h and 2 h, respectively. We observed that MG132 and AcLLnL treatment blocked the Mcm10 decrease, but that ALLM had no effect (Fig. 4, A, B, and C). These observations confirmed the role of proteasome-mediated proteolysis in the down-regulation of Mcm10 after UV treatment. It has been previously reported that MG132 stabilized Mcm10, whereas ALLM had no effect on Mcm10 levels (10.Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48526-48531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We observed that endogenous Mcm10 protein levels were low in UV-irradiated cells until 4–12 h after UV irradiation and begin to recover after 12–16 h, followed by a reinitiation of DNA replication around 16–24 h (Fig. 4D). We hypothesized that if Mcm10 is one of the limiting factors for replication, its overexpression during this period may enhance the recovery of DNA replication. On the basis of BrdUrd incorporation, we measured the rate of DNA replication during 16–24 h of UV irradiation in Mcm10-overexpressing cells and non-Mcm10-overexpressing cells (Fig. 4E). The average and standard deviations of four independent experiments are shown in Fig. 4F. All cells within randomly selected microscope fields were analyzed for Mcm10 overexpression and BrdUrd incorporation, a few examples of which have been displayed in supplemental Fig. S4. Following UV irradiation, BrdUrd incorporation was observed to be higher in Mcm10-overexpressing cells than in non-Mcm10-overexpressing cells. BrdUrd incorporation without UV irradiation was carried out similarly, and we observed that Mcm10 overexpression did not significantly alter the rate of DNA replication (Fig. 4F). Therefore, we conclude that Mcm10 is a limiting factor whose activity regulates DNA replication following stress. The rate of DNA replication varied in different experiments, as is depicted by the standard deviation, but we consistently observed complementation of DNA replication on exogenous Mcm10 expression after UV irradiation (Fig. 4F). We observed that the levels of the p180 subunit of polymerase-α were not decreased after Mcm10 RNAi or UV irradiation, and therefore, the effect of Mcm10 degradation on replication elongation occurred independently of the regulation of p180 stability (Fig. 5A). Stability of And1 was also not altered following UV irradiation (Fig. 5C). To test the requirement of Mcm10 in the elongation step, we depleted Mcm10 by RNAi and then blocked the cells at the G1/S transition by treatment with hydroxyurea for 20 h (Fig. 5D). Mcm10-depleted cells were released from the G1/S block in the presence of BrdUrd. On the basis of BrdUrd incorporation, we measured the rate of DNA replication from 0–2 h and 4–6 h after release from hydroxyurea (Fig. 5, D and E). The absence of Mcm10 during S phase led to a decrease in the incorporation of BrdUrd from 53 to 25% during 0–2 h after release from hydroxyurea. Similarly, incorporation of BrdUrd decreased from 55% to 12% during 4–6 h after release from hydroxyurea, signifying that Mcm10 is required for progression through S phase. It has been proven that Mcm10 is essential for the replication initiation step because it recruits several replication factors (4.Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18.Park J.H. Bang S.W. Jeon Y. Kang S. Hwang D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, UV-triggered degradation of Mcm10 blocks not only replication initiation, but also S phase progression. We generated stable U2OS cells expressing HA-tagged Mcm10 (utilizing the pMX-retroviral vector that is based on the moloney murine leukemia virus) to determine the segments of Mcm10 that are required for UV degradation. Full-length Mcm10 can be broadly divided into N-terminal (NTD), inner (ID), linker (LNK), and C-terminal (CTD) domains (Fig. 6A). A coiled-coil motif is present within the N terminus of Mcm10, which is required for homodimerization. The inner and C-terminal domains, which contain zinc finger (ZF) and winged helix (WH) motifs, bind to single- and double-stranded DNA and the p180 subunit of DNA polymerase-α (19.Robertson P.D. Warren E.M. Zhang H. Friedman D.B. Lary J.W. Cole J.L. Tutter A.V. Walter J.C. Fanning E. Eichman B.F. J. Biol.

Williams G.H. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We observed that exogenous Mcm10 was degraded upon 50 J/m2 UV radiation (Fig. 6B). Exogenous Mcm10 is expressed from the viral LTR promoter, and therefore, along with previous observations where we did not observe any changes in Mcm10 mRNA until 2 h after UV irradiation, this conclusively ruled out any specific contribution of the endogenous promoter in Mcm10 down-regulation (Fig. 2C). We observed that the NTD+ID fragment was not proteolyzed following UV stress, but because this fragment was cytosolic, its mislocalization could be a possible reason for its lack of degradation (Fig. 6C). Therefore, we expressed the NTD+ID fragment in fusion with a nuclear localization signal, which guided the protein to the nucleus, but this fragment was still not degraded post-UV irradiation. Therefore, the degradation signal does not lie within the N-terminal domain, which is required for dimerization. Thus, it is clear that dimerization of Mcm10 is not essential for UV-induced modification and subsequent degradation. We observed that the LNK+CTD fragment, which contains the ZF and WH motifs, was rapidly degraded following UV irradiation (Fig. 6D). We fragmented these domains into many smaller subdomains and observed that the ZF, but not the WH, motif was degraded by UV irradiation, indicating that the degradation signal lies within the ZF motif. However, the CTD domain lacking the ZF motif was also degraded, indicating that the ZF motif is sufficient, but not essential, for UV-triggered degradation (Fig. 6D). We also observed that the 178-amino acid LNK domain was degraded following UV irradiation. Therefore, we conclude that the degradation signal lies within the C-terminal half of Mcm10. To determine if the UV-triggered pathway targets only chromatin-bound or nuclear soluble proteins, we fractionated UV-irradiated cells using the protocol of Mendez and Stillman (16.Méndez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in isotonic buffer to isolate the nuclear fraction (P1) from the cytosolic fraction (S1). Nuclei were then lysed in hypotonic buffer to separate the nucleoplasmic proteins (S3) from the chromatin and nuclear matrix proteins (P3). Although Mcm10 was largely present in the chromatin and nuclear matrix fraction, UV irradiation caused a Mcm10 decrease in all fractions (Fig. 7A). Therefore, the UV-triggered pathway not only targets the Mcm10 bound to chromatin, but also targets soluble protein present in nucleoplasm. Mcm10 is naturally proteolyzed in M phase, and we wanted to clearly distinguish UV-triggered degradation from cell cycle-regulated degradation (10.Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48526-48531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11.Izumi M. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32569-32577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were blocked with nocodazole, and cells arrested in M phase were collected by mitotic-shake off. The obtained mitotic cells were then re-plated in drug-free medium and harvested at regular intervals until 16 h. Flow cytometry measurements and levels of cyclin A demonstrate a block in M phase and subsequent progression through the cell cycle (Fig. 7, B and C). Mcm10 was absent in nocodazole-released cells, demonstrating the natural proteolysis of Mcm10 in M phase. Mcm10 levels began to increase after release and peaked around 12 h, displaying the natural cycling of Mcm10 levels (Fig. 7B). To evaluate the effect of UV radiation on the Mcm10 protein during different phases of the cell cycle, HeLa cells were UV-irradiated before harvesting at different time intervals. At 12–16 h after nocodazole release, cell cycle-regulated degradation was absent, but UV irradiation led to a Mcm10 decrease (Fig. 7B, compare lanes 4, 5, with 9, 10). This result demonstrates the UV-induced degradation under the conditions where cell cycle-regulated degradation is not observed and clearly distinguishes the two pathways of Mcm10 degradation. Similarly, we synchronized cells in late G1 phase with mimosine and released them in drug-free medium to collect cells at different phases. We observed that Mcm10 degradation occurred throughout the cell cycle (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). Because Mcm10 is naturally proteolyzed during M phase, we wanted to identify the domains of Mcm10 that are essential for cell cycle-regulated degradation. Stable U2OS cell lines expressing different fragments of Mcm10 were blocked with nocodazole, which arrested the cells in M phase. The obtained mitotic cells were released from the block and harvested at regular intervals to collect cells in different phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 8, A and B). The flow cytometry profile of propidium iodide-stained DNA for all stable cell lines expressing different fragments of exogenous Mcm10 demonstrates a block in M phase and subsequent progression through the cell cycle (Fig. 8A). As expected, endogenous Mcm10 levels were low in M phase and peaked around 12 h after nocodazole release (Fig. 8B, i). Full-length Mcm10 expressed from the retroviral vector showed a degradation pattern similar to that of the endogenous protein, validating our assay for evaluating the cell cycle-regulated degradation of Mcm10 (Fig. 8B, ii). The NTD+ID domain was resistant to cell cycle-regulated degradation, but the LNK and CTD domains were proteolyzed in M phase (Fig. 8B, iii–vi). The 61-amino acid ZF motif was sufficient for M phase proteolysis of Mcm10 (Fig. 8B, vii). However, the CTD domain lacking the ZF motif was also degraded in M phase, signifying that though ZF motif is sufficient, it is not essential for M phase proteolysis of Mcm10 (Fig. 8B, viii). From the above data, we conclude that the C-terminal half of Mcm10 is required for cell cycle and UV-triggered degradation of Mcm10. Over the past few years, regulatory mechanisms that transduce to the replication machinery after cellular stress have been identified. The replication initiator, Cdt1, is degraded within a few minutes following UV and gamma irradiation of cells (13.Higa L.A. Mihaylov I.S. Banks D.P. Zheng J. Zhang H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A relatively slower rate of proteolysis was observed for the p12 subunit of polymerase-δ and the replication initiator, Cdc6 (14.Hall J.R. Kow E. Nevis K.R. Lu C.K. Luce K.S. Zhong Q. Cook J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3340-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15.Zhang S. Zhou Y. Trusa S. Meng X. Lee E.Y. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15330-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We screened a large number of known replication factors, but could not identify any other protein that is down-regulated (Fig. 2A and supplemental S1A). Inhibition of Mcm10, which naturally dissociates from chromatin at the end of S phase and is, therefore, probably involved in maintaining replication licensing, would be a fitting choice for inactivation of the replication machinery. Targeting Mcm10 inhibits replication initiation and we have demonstrated that if Mcm10 is depleted by RNA interference, it leads to a decrease in the progression through S phase. Therefore, the degradation of Mcm10 following UV irradiation would block S phase progression (Fig. 5D). An increase in BrdUrd incorporation in Mcm10-overexpressing cells signifies that Mcm10 enhances recovery of replication following UV irradiation. Therefore, apart from serving to stall replication, it also seems that a low Mcm10 level is one of the limiting factors preventing reinitiation of DNA replication. The kinetics of Mcm10 degradation raises the possibility of the involvement of the apoptotic machinery. The following evidence rules out the role of apoptosis in Mcm10 regulation. First, MG132 and AcLLnL (proteasome inhibitors), but not ALLM (inhibitor of calpains), stabilized Mcm10 following UV exposure. Second, inhibition of caspase 9 did not stabilize Mcm10. Most importantly, when we induced apoptosis by exposing cells to high levels of damaging chemicals, Mcm10 levels did not decrease. In this communication, we demonstrate that Mcm10 down-regulation post-UV exposure is blocked by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. The identification of E3 ubiquitin ligase is being addressed separately. 4M. Kaur and S. Saxena, manuscript in preparation. Mcm10 was proteolyzed after UV irradiation, but not after exposure to gamma radiation or DNA strand-damaging chemicals. Genotoxic agents lead to different forms of damage. Gamma radiation causes mostly double strand breaks, while UV exposure leads to the formation of cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers and 6–4 photoproducts. The machinery that senses these forms of damage is different, although there is considerable functional overlap. It is, therefore, logical to draw the conclusion that Mcm10 down-regulation, at the least, invokes some unique UV damage-specific sensors. We determined the kinetics of Mcm10 degradation in different cell lines and noted that Mcm10 was degraded faster in U2OS cells (almost 80% degradation in 2 h), which are positive for the p53 and retinoblastoma proteins (Fig. 2D). However, the p53 and retinoblastoma protein-deficient HeLa cells also degrade Mcm10, although at a slower rate (less than 50% degradation in 2 h). The fine dissection of this pathway requires comparison between cell lines deficient in key checkpoint proteins as the knockdown of checkpoint proteins achieved by RNAi is frequently not sufficient to establish their roles. Active replication was not essential for Mcm10 down-regulation after UV, as cells blocked in G1 and those in G2 phase also showed a decrease in Mcm10. Therefore, this pathway is not only resilient to changes in CDK activity but is also not dependent on collision or recognition of DNA lesions by active replication forks. Apart from being unaffected by DNA replication, the UV-triggered degradation of Mcm10 occurs during the phases of the cell cycle where it is presumed to be inert and inactive. Why would this mechanism target Mcm10 even after exit from S phase? It is possible that Mcm10 may have an unknown role in G2 phase or that this mechanism serves to prevent any aberrant replication that ensues after DNA damage. High levels of Mcm10 have been reported in neuroblastomas, where the MYC oncogene is believed to regulate Mcm10 expression (21.Koppen A. Ait-Aissa R. Koster J. van Sluis P.G. Ora I. Caron H.N. Volckmann R. Versteeg R. Valentijn L.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 2007; 43: 2413-2422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because we are claiming that Mcm10 down-regulation is a pathway that the cell utilizes to inhibit replication under stress, then the obvious question is how the cell inhibits replication under other stresses, such as gamma radiation where Mcm10 levels remain unaffected. Apparently different targets are down-regulated. Cdt1 is known to be degraded after UV and gamma irradiation. Elucidation of specific and common targets of stress-induced pathways would help us better understand the regulation of the cell to maintain genomic stability. However, this study emphasizes that during stress, the cell inhibits the activity of replication initiator, Mcm10, to preclude DNA replication.

https://openalex.org/W1996231835,"Yeast Suv3p is a member of the DEXH/D box family of RNA helicases and is a critical component of the mitochondrial degradosome, which also includes a 3' --> 5' exonuclease, Dss1p. Defects in the degradosome result in accumulation of aberrant transcripts, unprocessed transcripts, and excised group I introns. In addition, defects in SUV3 result in decreased splicing of the aI5beta and bI3 group I introns. Whereas a role for Suv3p in RNA degradation is well established, the function of Suv3p in splicing of group I introns has remained elusive. It has been particularly challenging to determine if Suv3p effects group I intron splicing through RNA degradation as part of the degradosome, or has a direct role in splicing as a chaperone, because nearly all perturbations of SUV3 or DSS1 result in loss of the mitochondrial genome. Here we utilized the suv3-1 allele, which is defective in RNA metabolism and yet maintains a stable mitochondrial genome, to investigate the role of Suv3p in splicing of the aI5beta group I intron. We provide genetic evidence that Mrs1p is a limiting cofactor for aI5beta splicing, and this evidence also suggests that Suv3p activity is required to recycle the excised aI5beta ribonucleoprotein. We also show that Suv3p acts indirectly as a component of the degradosome to promote aI5beta splicing. We present a model whereby defects in Suv3p result in accumulation of stable, excised group I intron ribonucleoproteins, which result in sequestration of Mrs1p, and a concomitant reduction in splicing of aI5beta."
https://openalex.org/W2069771677,"Many human epithelial cancers are characterized by abnormal activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is often caused by its excessive expression in tumor cells. The abundance of EGFR is modulated, in part, by its ubiquitination, which targets it for degradation. The components responsible for adding ubiquitin to EGFR are well characterized, but this is a reversible process, and the mechanisms that modulate the removal of ubiquitin from the EGFR are not well known. We found that de-ubiquitination of EGFR was regulated by diacylglycerol kinase delta (DGKdelta), a lipid kinase that terminates diacylglycerol signaling. In DGKdelta-deficient cells, ubiquitination of EGFR was enhanced, which attenuated the steady-state levels of EGFR and promoted its ligand-induced degradation. These effects were not caused by changes in the ubiquitinating apparatus, but instead were due to reduced expression of the de-ubiquitinase, ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8). Depletion of protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), a target of diacylglycerol, rescued the levels of USP8 and normalized EGFR degradation in DGKdelta-deficient cells. Moreover, the effects of PKCalpha were caused by its inhibition of Akt, which stabilizes USP8. Our data indicate a novel mechanism where DGKdelta and PKCalpha modulate the levels of ubiquitinated EGFR through Akt and USP8."

In this issue of Neuron, Lin et al. report that LRRK2 modulates age-related neurodegeneration caused by overexpression of α-synuclein in the forebrain of transgenic mice. Overexpression of LRRK2 accelerates the progression of α-synuclein-mediated neuropathological changes, whereas deletion of LRRK2 alleviates these alterations. The results reveal an interesting interaction between α-synuclein and LRRK2, two gene products linked to dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting ∼5 million people worldwide. PD is characterized clinically by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The neuropathological hallmarks of PD are progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and the presence of intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs), though neuronal loss is also seen in other neuronal groups, such as noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. The clinical manifestations of PD are caused by degeneration of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which results in dopamine depletion in the striatum, as shown by effective dopamine replacement therapy during early phases of the disease. The mechanisms underlying nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration, however, remain unresolved (Shen and Cookson, 2004Shen J. Cookson M.R. Neuron. 2004; 43: 301-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). During the last decade, mutations in at least five distinct genes (α-synuclein, parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, and LRRK2) have been linked to familial PD, permitting studies of the pathogenic mechanisms using genetic approaches. A dominantly inherited missense mutation (A53T) in α-synuclein was the first to be linked to early-onset familial PD. Subsequently, additional missense and gene multiplication mutations were identified (Singleton, 2005Singleton A.B. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 416-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and α-synuclein was shown to be a major constituent of LBs (Spillantini et al., 1998Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of α-synuclein in PD pathogenesis. α-Synuclein is expressed at high levels in the brain and is associated with presynaptic vesicles. While the normal function of α-synuclein is poorly understood, several lines of transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type or mutant α-synuclein have been reported to develop neuronal degeneration (Chandra et al., 2005Chandra S.

However, none of them exhibits significant degeneration of DA neurons in the SNpc due to the predominant overexpression of α-synuclein in non-DA neurons in these transgenic mice. More recently, several missense mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been linked to autosomal dominantly inherited PD (Singleton, 2005Singleton A.B. Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 416-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which are collectively the most common genetic cause of late-onset PD. While α-synuclein is a small protein of 140 amino acid residues with few functional domains, LRRK2 is a large 2527 amino acid protein consisting of several functional domains, including a leucine-rich repeat domain, a Ras-like small GTPase domain, and a kinase domain with sequence homology to MAP kinase kinase kinases. The pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 are present in various functional domains of the protein, and all affect highly conserved amino acid residues. Most LRRK2 mutations cause clinically typical PD, but the neuropathological features vary, ranging from pure nigral degeneration without LBs to nigral degeneration with brainstem or widespread LBs, or neurofibrillary tangles. Extensive in vitro studies have shown increased kinase activity associated with some pathogenic mutations, such as the G2019S mutation (Cookson et al., 2007Cookson M.R. Dauer W. Dawson T. Fon E.A. Guo M. Shen J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 11865-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In vivo studies using transgenic mice overexpressing the R1441G mutant form of LRRK2 or knockin mice expressing the R1441C mutant at endogenous levels revealed deficits in dopamine release and/or dopamine D2 receptor-mediated function but absence of neurodegeneration (Li et al., 2009Li Y. Liu W. Oo T.F. Wang L. Tang Y. Jackson-Lewis V. Zhou C. Geghman K. Bogdanov M. Przedborski S. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, Tong et al., 2009Tong Y. Pisani A. Martella G. Karouani M. Yamaguchi H. Pothos E.N. Shen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 14622-14627Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying these DA functional defects is less clear. How do mutations in five genes with seemingly divergent functions cause PD? While no common molecular pathways have emerged from studies of these five gene products, genetic analysis of recessive PD-linked gene products, Parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1, in mice and Drosophila has highlighted an interaction between Parkin and PINK1 and pointed to mitochondrial and dopaminergic dysfunction as possible converging mechanisms in PD. Thus, an intriguing question arises: do α-synuclein and LRRK2, the dominant PD-linked gene products, act together in processes relevant to PD pathogenesis? In this issue of Neuron, an elegant genetic study by Lin et al., 2009Lin X. Parisiadou L. Gu X.-L. Wang L. Shim H. Sun L. Xie C. Long C.-X. Yang W.-J. Ding J. et al.Neuron. 2009; 64 (this issue): 807-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar identifies an important functional interplay between α-synuclein and LRRK2 in the development of neurodegeneration and other neuropathological features caused by α-synuclein overexpression. Using the tetracycline-controlled transactivator system, the authors generated a series of inducible transgenic mice overexpressing the human A53T mutant form of α-synuclein or various forms of human LRRK2, including wild-type, G2019S, or kinase domain-deletion mutant in the adult forebrain. They found that 30-fold overproduction of A53T α-synuclein in the adult forebrain results in locomotor defects in the open field as early as 2 months of age and age-related neurodegeneration, including increased apoptosis and gliosis as well as progressive loss of cortical and striatal neurons. 16-fold overproduction of wild-type or G2019S mutant LRRK2, however, does not cause neurodegeneration up to 20 months of age. Intriguingly, co-overexpression of either wild-type or G2019S LRRK2 with A53T α-synuclein dramatically accelerated neurodegeneration in double-transgenic mice. At 1 month of age, when no neuropathology was detected in any of the single-transgenic brains, increased apoptosis and gliosis as well as loss of neurons were evident in the double-transgenic striatum. Furthermore, the effect of LRRK2 overexpression on neurodegenerative features in A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice is more dependent on the level of LRRK2 overexpression than the presence of the G2019S mutation. Surprisingly, LRRK2 lacking the kinase domain also accelerated A53T α-synuclein-mediated neuropathology to a similar extent as wild-type LRRK2 when expressed at similar levels, suggesting that the kinase domain of LRRK2 is not essential in the interplay of α-synuclein and LRRK2. Lin et al. further verified that this interplay is specific between α-synuclein and LRRK2 by showing that co-overexpression of A53T α-synuclein with a control protein, the green fluorescent protein (GFP), did not accelerate the progression of A53T α-synuclein-mediated neuropathology, and that co-overexpression of G2019S LRRK2 with a mutant version of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) did not accelerate APP-mediated astrocytosis and microgliosis. LRRK2 overexpression also promoted abnormal somatic accumulation of α-synuclein in striatal neurons of A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice. While α-synuclein is normally localized in axonal terminals, overexpression of A53T α-synuclein results in its accumulation in cell bodies in an age-dependent manner. Overexpression of LRRK2 in A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice caused earlier and more widespread somatic accumulation of α-synuclein. LRRK2 overexpression also accelerated α-synuclein aggregation, which can be detected as high-molecular-weight species in brain extracts from older A53T α-synuclein or younger A53T α-synuclein/G2019S LRRK2 transgenic mice. To explore further how LRRK2 overexpression promotes α-synuclein-based neuropathology, including neurodegeneration and abnormal α-synuclein accumulation and/or aggregation, Lin et al. examined ER/Golgi trafficking, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and mitochondria. Earlier studies have shown that overexpression of α-synuclein resulted in blocked ER/Golgi vesicular trafficking in yeast and Golgi fragmentation in cultured cells (Cooper et al., 2006Cooper A.A. Gitler A.D. Cashikar A. Haynes C.M. Hill K.J. Bhullar B. Liu K. Xu K. Strathearn K.E. Liu F. et al.Science. 2006; 313: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, Gosavi et al., 2002Gosavi N. Lee H.J. Lee J.S. Patel S. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48984-48992Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). While the ER structure appeared normal, immunohistochemical analysis with specific markers showed that the Golgi complex was disrupted in striatal neurons of young A53T α-synuclein/LRRK2 transgenic mice. Both cis- and medial/trans-Golgi networks were drastically altered in various single-transgenic mice, with the exception of A53T α-synuclein mice, in which the cis-Golgi system appeared normal, and were further disrupted in double transgenic mice. Additional investigation revealed a perturbed dynamics of microtubule assembly with a shift from free tubulin to polymerized tubulin in LRRK2 but not A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice. This perturbation of the microtubule network was thought to underlie the disrupted structure of the Golgi apparatus. However, it is somewhat puzzling why overexpression of LRRK2 alone was sufficient to cause disruption of the microtubule network and Golgi apparatus but insufficient to cause neurodegeneration, whereas A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice exhibited much subtler microtubule and Golgi phenotypes but striking neuronal degeneration. Co-overexpression of A53T α-synuclein and G2019S LRRK2 also appeared to have caused increases in ubiquitin-positive aggregates and abnormal mitochondria. The last piece of data provided perhaps the most important supporting evidence for the major conclusions of the paper, showing that genetic deletion of LRRK2 ameliorated neurodegeneration, gliosis, α-synuclein aggregation, and the Golgi phenotypes in A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice. Given the very high levels of the transgene expression (∼30-fold for A53T α-synuclein, and ∼16-fold for wild-type and G2019S LRRK2) and the lack of significant differences between wild-type and G2019S LRRK2 on their modulation of α-synuclein-mediated neuropathological changes, a valid concern was that the observed phenotypes could be simply due to overproduction of the proteins expressed from the transgenes. Inclusion of transgenic mice overexpressing GFP or APP as controls dispelled some of the concerns, though understandably these control mice were not analyzed as exhaustively. The fact that inactivation of LRRK2 rescues the loss of striatal neurons in A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice provides key support for a regulatory role of LRRK2 in α-synuclein-mediated neuropathology under overexpression conditions. The findings in Lin et al. highlight an important interplay between two dominant PD gene products of α-synuclein and LRRK2. However, many questions remain. How does LRRK2 regulate the dynamics of the microtubule network? Are tubulins or microtubule-binding proteins physiological substrates of LRRK2's kinase activity? It will be important to determine by electron microscopy the ultrastructure of the Golgi apparatus and the subcellular localization of α-synuclein in the various single and double A53T α-synuclein and LRRK2 mutant mice described in the current report. Such analysis may help to explain why LRRK2 transgenic mice exhibit severe Golgi defects but no neurodegeneration, whereas A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice conversely show subtle Golgi phenotypes but striking neurodegeneration. In addition, it would be interesting to evaluate whether the ER/Golgi trafficking and microtubule network are disrupted in the recently reported LRRK2 transgenic and knockin mice, which could contribute to the dopamine release defect in these mice (Li et al., 2009Li Y. Liu W. Oo T.F. Wang L. Tang Y. Jackson-Lewis V. Zhou C. Geghman K. Bogdanov M. Przedborski S. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, Tong et al., 2009Tong Y. Pisani A. Martella G. Karouani M. Yamaguchi H. Pothos E.N. Shen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 14622-14627Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether the microtubule network and the Golgi apparatus are affected in the absence of LRRK2. Lastly, it is important to establish whether the interplay between LRRK2 and α-synuclein is limited to overexpression conditions, and whether LRRK2 can interact with endogenous α-synuclein under physiological conditions. As the authors rightly point out, while A53T α-synuclein/LRRK2 transgenic mice provide very useful models to study the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and the genetic interaction between α-synuclein and LRRK2, the occurrence of neurodegeneration in cortical and striatal neurons of the forebrain in these transgenic mice limits their relevance to PD pathogenesis. Thus, the generation of inducible transgenic mice targeting α-synuclein overexpression to DA neurons of the SNpc would enable investigation of the key mechanisms by which α-synuclein aggregation may lead to dysfunction and degeneration of DA neurons. In addition, inducible DA neuron-specific α-synuclein transgenic mice could then be crossed with LRRK2 mutant mice carrying either pathogenic missense or null mutations to study how LRRK2 interacts with α-synuclein in the regulation of DA neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Such innovative mouse models would provide a valuable platform for further mechanistic studies aimed at uncovering the molecular basis of DA neurodegeneration and developing improved therapeutic strategies. Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 Regulates the Progression of Neuropathology Induced by Parkinson's-Disease-Related Mutant α-synucleinLin et al.NeuronDecember 24, 2009In BriefMutations in α-synuclein and Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are linked to autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, little is known about any potential pathophysiological interplay between these two PD-related genes. Here we show in transgenic mice that although overexpression of LRRK2 alone did not cause neurodegeneration, the presence of excess LRRK2 greatly accelerated the progression of neuropathological abnormalities developed in PD-related A53T α-synuclein transgenic mice.

https://openalex.org/W2015060033,"8-Chloroadenosine (8-Cl-Ado) is a ribosyl nucleoside analog currently in phase I testing for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). 8-Cl-Ado activity is dependent on adenosine kinase and requires intracellular accumulation of 8-Cl-Ado as mono-, di-, and tri-phosphates. In the current study with four mantle cell lymphoma cell lines, we report a new major metabolic pathway for 8-Cl-Ado intracellular metabolism, the formation of succinyl-8-chloro-adenosine (S-8-Cl-Ado) and its monophosphate (S-8-Cl-AMP). 8-Cl-AMP levels were highly associated with S-8-Cl-AMP levels and reached a steady-state prior to the secondary metabolites, 8-Cl-ATP and S-8-Cl-Ado. Consistent with fumarate as a required substrate for formation of succinyl-8-Cl-adenylate metabolites, the S-8-Cl-adenylate concentrations in multiple cell lines were associated with fumarate loss. The distribution of metabolites was also altered using the energy metabolism modifiers, metformin and oligomycin. The rates of succinyl-8-Cl-adenylate metabolism were enhanced by increasing the intracellular fumarate concentrations after metformin co-treatment. In addition, the S-8-Cl-AMP concentrations were increased after acute inhibition of ATP synthase by oligomycin. We conclude that 8-Cl-Ado metabolism not only affects intracellular purine metabolism; 8-Cl-Ado conversion to succinyl analogs ties its metabolism to the citric acid cycle by reduction of the fumarate pool."

Geng Y. et al.Cell. 2009; (this issue)Google Scholar now report that some members of the Mrgpr class of G protein-coupled receptors mediate the itch caused by the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Sensations such as touch, temperature, itch, and pain are mediated by primary somatosensory neurons that detect thermal, mechanical, and chemical cues and relay this information to the central nervous system (Figure 1). Itch, or pruritus, is defined as the unpleasant sensation that elicits scratching behavior. In this sense, itch is quite distinct from pain, the application of which causes the hasty withdrawal of the affected body part. Nevertheless, pain and itch stimuli can sometimes interact; for instance, a pain sensation can inhibit an itch sensation. It even has been suggested that itch is a form of low-intensity pain. However, accumulating evidence favors the now prevailing view that pain and itch are reported by distinct primary sensory neurons and separate sensory pathways, albeit with overlapping regulatory mechanisms (Ikoma et al., 2006Ikoma A. Steinhoff M. Ständer S. Yosipovitch G. Schmelz M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, Paus et al., 2006Paus R. Schmelz M. Bíró T. Steinhoff M. J. Clin.

Science. 2009; 325: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) So how is itch sensed? In this issue of Cell, a team of scientists led by Xinzhong Dong (Liu et al., 2009Liu Q. Tang Z. Surdenikova L. Kim S. Patel K.N. Kim A. Ru F. Guan Y. Weng H.-J. Geng Y. et al.Cell. 2009; (this issue)Google Scholar) provides evidence that some members of the Mrgpr family of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors can mediate itch sensation. It is well established that some primary sensory neurons express members of a group of closely related receptors belonging to the Mrgpr family. There are ∼24 potentially functional Mrgpr genes in mice but, strikingly, only eight in humans (Dong et al., 2001Dong X. Han S. Zylka M.J. Simon M.I. Anderson D.J. Cell. 2001; 106: 619-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Mrgpr expression is highly restricted to primary sensory neurons, hinting at a somatosensory role. However, their function has remained enigmatic. The new study by Liu et al., 2009Liu Q. Tang Z. Surdenikova L. Kim S. Patel K.N. Kim A. Ru F. Guan Y. Weng H.-J. Geng Y. et al.Cell. 2009; (this issue)Google Scholar indicates that some of these receptors are involved in an itch sensation that is independent of that mediated by the best known itch inducer, histamine. Histamine is the inflammatory mediator released by mast cells in response to a variety of external stimuli. Mosquito bites, for example, result in itching because mast cells are activated and release histamine, which then acts as a potent excitatory agent for itch neurons. Histamine acts via G protein-coupled histamine receptors present on sensory neurons (Ikoma et al., 2006Ikoma A. Steinhoff M. Ständer S. Yosipovitch G. Schmelz M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, Paus et al., 2006Paus R. Schmelz M. Bíró T. Steinhoff M. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1174-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Some pruritic conditions, however, appear to be independent of histamine signaling. A well known example is the itch generated as a side effect of the antimalarial drug chloroquine; pruritus due to chloroquine can be so severe that patients sometimes stop treatment (Mnyika and Kihamia, 1991Mnyika K.S. Kihamia C.M. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1991; 94: 27-31PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, antihistamine drugs are ineffective in countering chloroquine-induced itch, indicating that an unknown mechanism is at play (Abila et al., 1994Abila B. Ezeamuzie I.C. Igbigbi P.S. Ambakederemo A.W. Asomugha L. Afr. J. Med. Med. Sci. 1994; 23: 139-142PubMed Google Scholar). This is where the study by Liu et al., 2009Liu Q. Tang Z. Surdenikova L. Kim S. Patel K.N. Kim A. Ru F. Guan Y. Weng H.-J. Geng Y. et al.Cell. 2009; (this issue)Google Scholar comes in. The authors generated a mouse strain lacking a cluster of 12 Mrgpr genes (as well as ∼18 Mrgpr pseudogenes) in their quest to identify the sensory function of these receptors. Deleting all of these genes at once was a smart move as there could be considerable functional overlap between the proteins encoded by these closely related genes. Strikingly, whereas mice lacking the Mrgpr gene cluster appear normal in their sensitivity to acute pain and histamine-induced itch, they show a dramatic (though not complete) reduction in scratching behavior after chloroquine exposure. Thus Mrgprs appear to be required for chloroquine-induced itch. But are they the actual receptors that sense chloroquine? The authors show that chloroquine excites a small subset of isolated sensory neurons, indicating that the drug interacts directly with sensory neurons (Figure 1). They further show that chloroquine-induced excitation is completely lost in mice lacking the Mrgpr cluster. The authors subsequently identify MrgprA3 as the major chloroquine receptor. Ectopic expression of MrgprA3 in heterologous cells induces chloroquine sensitivity. The authors go on to show that MrgprA3 is necessary and sufficient for chloroquine-induced neuronal activation. How do these findings translate to the human situation? Liu et al., 2009Liu Q. Tang Z. Surdenikova L. Kim S. Patel K.N. Kim A. Ru F. Guan Y. Weng H.-J. Geng Y. et al.Cell. 2009; (this issue)Google Scholar take the first step by identifying a human Mrgpr receptor, MrgprX1, that also responds to chloroquine. MrgprX1 is significantly less sensitive to chloroquine than its murine counterpart. In fact, activation of this receptor required concentrations that exceed the chloroquine concentrations observed in plasma of patients undergoing chloroquine treatment. However, chloroquine accumulates at much higher levels in the skin where the MrgprX1 receptor is located. Furthermore, there is considerable individual variability in chloroquine-induced itch that suggests a predisposing genetic factor. Notably, chloroquine-induced itch is very common among black Africans but less common among other races. Strikingly, Mrgpr genes are highly polymorphic, which suggests the intriguing possibility that variability in MrgprX1 underlies the variability in chloroquine itch. Clearly, whether MrgprX1 is responsible for chloroquine induced itch in the clinical setting requires further testing. The new findings raise interesting questions. What are the roles of MrgprA3 and MrgprX1 beyond chloroquine-induced itch? Do they play a role in detecting other itch-inducing stimuli? Diverse disorders such as atopic dermatitis, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, lymphoma, and hyperthyroidism can result in chronic itch, a significant clinical problem (Ikoma et al., 2006Ikoma A. Steinhoff M. Ständer S. Yosipovitch G. Schmelz M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Does upregulation of endogenous molecules that signal via Mrgprs play a role? Mrgprs have the greatest sequence similarity to peptide hormone receptors, and Mrgprs are activated by neuropeptides. However, whether such peptides play a role in itch is currently not clear. Future research will undoubtedly address these questions, and provide insight on the therapeutic potential of Mrgpr modulators. This new study also begs the question whether any other Mrgprs (in addition to MrgprA3 and MrgprX1) are involved in itch sensation. Liu et al. already report that MrgprC11 may be. This receptor is coexpressed with MrgprA3, and its activation causes scratching behavior in mice. As for the other Mrgprs, most are expressed in nonoverlapping subpopulations of sensory neurons. MrgprD, for instance, appears to influence the excitability of a subset of nociceptive neurons that function in mechanosensation but not itch sensation (Cavanaugh et al., 2009Cavanaugh D.J. Lee H.

Furthermore, MrgprB4 is expressed in sensory neurons that may detect gentle touch (Liu et al., 2007Liu Q. Vrontou S. Rice F.L. Zylka M.J. Dong X. Anderson D.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 946-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, Mrgprs play important but apparently distinct roles in somatosensation. Still, the endogenous modulators of Mrgprs under physiological and pathophysiological conditions are largely unknown. Elucidating relevant endogenous or exogenous ligands for this class of receptors will be an important future direction. The molecular pathways downstream of Mrgprs also remain to be unraveled. Sensory Neuron-Specific GPCR Mrgprs Are Itch Receptors Mediating Chloroquine-Induced PruritusLiu et al.CellDecember 10, 2009In BriefThe cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating histamine-independent itch in primary sensory neurons are largely unknown. Itch induced by chloroquine (CQ) is a common side effect of this widely used antimalarial drug. Here, we show that Mrgprs, a family of G protein-coupled receptors expressed exclusively in peripheral sensory neurons, function as itch receptors. Mice lacking a cluster of Mrgpr genes display significant deficits in itch induced by CQ but not histamine. CQ directly excites sensory neurons in an Mrgpr-dependent manner.

To investigate the contribution of different domains to the function of Oct25, we have performed gain of function analyses. Deletions of the N- or C-terminal regions and of the Hox domain (except its nuclear localization signal) result in mutants being indistinguishable from the wild type protein in the suppression of genes promoting germ layer formation. Deletion of the complete POU domain generates a mutant that has no effect on embryogenesis. However, disruption of the alpha-helical structures in the POU domain, even by a single amino acid mutation, causes reversal of protein function. Overexpression of such mutants leads to dorsalization of embryos and formation of secondary axial structures. The underlying mechanism is an enhanced transcription of genes coding for antagonists of the ligands for ventralizing bone morphogenetic protein and Wnt pathways. Corresponding deletion mutants of Xenopus Oct60, Oct91, or mouse Oct4 also exhibit such a dominant-negative effect. Therefore, our results reveal that the integrity of the POU domain is crucial for the function of POU-V transcription factors in the regulation of genes that promote germ layer formation."

In an exciting study in the December 4th issue of Science, Bonifazi and colleagues demonstrated the existence and importance of exceedingly rare but unusually richly connected cells in the developing hippocampus. Manipulating the activity of single GABAergic hub cells modulated network activity patterns, demonstrating their importance for coordinating synchronous activity. Much to the chagrin of our latte-drinking, sushi-eating, Volvo-driving liberal friends all over, networks in the real world are decidedly not egalitarian but rather aristocratic in nature. Indeed, the disproportionate influence of rare superconnected hubs is well-known in technological, biological, and social networks, including aviation grids (such as LAX and JFK), biochemical reaction pathways (such as pyruvate and ATP), and the proverbial old boys’ networks. For neuroscience in particular, hub-like connectors are considered to be of great potential significance because networks with such aristocratic flavor have been predicted by theoretical studies to represent a clever compromise between fast computation, economy of wiring, and robustness against random deletions (Buzsáki et al., 2004Buzsáki G. Geisler C. Henze D.A. Wang X.J. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 186-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, Bullmore and Sporns, 2009Bullmore E. Sporns O. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (6310) Google Scholar). However, while we have thoroughly defined neuronal networks lacking superconnected neurons (such as that of C. elegans), hard evidence is elusive for neuronal networks that display a large disparity in connectivity due to the presence of hub-like cells (Yu et al., 2008Yu S. Huang D. Singer W. Nikolic D. Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 2891-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, Song et al., 2005Song S. Sjöström P.J. Reigl M. Nelson S. Chklovskii D.B. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e68Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). It is the latter gap in our knowledge that the work of Bonifazi and colleagues from Rosa Cossart's lab has now filled by demonstrating, using a combination of cutting-edge network imaging techniques and single-cell electrophysiology (Crépel et al., 2007Crépel V. Aronov D. Jorquera I. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. Neuron. 2007; 54: 105-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), that the developing mammalian hippocampus contains GABAergic neurons with unusually high functional connectivity whose activation can have profound impacts on network dynamics (Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I. Cattani A. Bianconi G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Searching for hub cells in the neuronal hay would have been surely doomed to failure because their rarity guarantees their absence from most small samples. However, the innovative method used by the authors allows a sample size sufficiently large to contain at least some rare hub cells. Additionally, the CA3 region in the developing hippocampus offers a number of advantages on which the authors capitalized in their search for hubs. First, the early postnatal hippocampus conveniently displays robust, spontaneous, synchronized network activity in the form of giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) (Ben-Ari, 2001Ben-Ari Y. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 353-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and, second, the CA3 region has a network structure dominated by local connections that remain intact in brain slices (Bonifazi et al., 2009Bonifazi P. Goldin M. Picardo M.A. Jorquera I. Cattani A. Bianconi G. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. Science. 2009; 326: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Therefore, a seemingly straightforward general strategy for finding hub cells is to monitor the rhythmic spontaneous GDP activity in a large neuronal assembly in the developing CA3 and identify neurons that appear to play key functional roles in synchronization by focusing on those rare single cells that consistently fire just before GDPs occur in the rest of the population. This strategy is akin to finding the conductor in an orchestra by monitoring every participating musician's movements and finding the person whose movements predictably precede everybody else's. However, there is an extra requirement that makes the task suddenly much more daunting. Namely, in addition to showing that the conductor always begins to move slightly before all others, it is critical to demonstrate the conductor's commanding authority by showing that the orchestra blindly follows the conductor's commands even when the conductor changes the musical script suddenly from Bach to The Beatles. This unequivocal demonstration of the causal influence of hub cells on network-wide activity dynamics requires identification of the rare leader cells using analysis of temporal correlations, followed by manipulation of the activity of those putative hub cells to show their effect on the network. Because post hoc analysis precludes such a feat, Bonifazi and colleagues analyzed the functional connectivity lightning fast, while the activity was still ongoing. They employed multibeam two-photon microscopy, which allows relatively high spatial and temporal resolution by splitting a laser into multiple beams that scan different points in the sample almost simultaneously (Nielsen et al., 2001Nielsen T. Fricke M. Hellweg D. Andresen P. J. Microsc. 2001; 201: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, Crépel et al., 2007Crépel V. Aronov D. Jorquera I. Represa A. Ben-Ari Y. Cossart R. Neuron. 2007; 54: 105-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). With this powerful tool, the authors recorded the intracellular calcium signals that occur during GDPs in hundreds of CA3 neurons. If activity in neuron A consistently preceded activity in neuron B, a functional connection from A to B was assumed, and a network-wide functional connectivity map was constructed by performing such pair-wise analysis for all recorded cells. To test whether functional connectivity faithfully represented effective connectivity, the authors stimulated neurons with varying degrees of connectivity and observed whether a calcium response occurred in other neurons, finding that the two types of connectivity maps overlapped by 53% for hub cells. The functional connectivity analysis revealed the existence of very rare cells that possessed a disproportionate number of connections. Remarkably, the distribution of such output links was best fitted with a so-called power-law function, characteristic of a scale-free network as described in Figure 1 (Barabási and Albert, 1999Barabási A.-L. Albert R. Science. 1999; 286: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (23621) Google Scholar). The authors' ingenious approach of analyzing the activity of a large number of neurons and constructing such functional connectivity maps while still “online” enabled them to target these richly connected neurons for recording using single-cell electrophysiology techniques. By manipulating the firing of such neurons of interest, the authors could directly study single-cell/network interactions and assess the functional effect of “conductor cells” using a number of metrics. One such metric was the expected versus observed frequency of occurrence of GDPs after delivery of suprathreshold depolarizations to the putative single hub cells. Astonishingly enough, changes in hub cell firing caused predictable alterations in GDP dynamics, establishing the functional influence of these heavily connected but rare neurons. So who are these Herbert von Karajans of the developing hippocampus? The authors used genetically modified mice expressing the green fluorescence protein (GFP) specifically in GABAergic neurons to determine whether the hub cells were GABAergic. All of the hub neurons were indeed GABAergic cells, and subsequent morphological reconstructions revealed that many of these cells had extensive, long-range axonal arborizations. Furthermore, the hub cells not only appeared to possess a high number of outgoing connections, they also received more spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs and showed a more hyperpolarized action potential threshold, all consistent with predicted requirements for efficient hub-like behavior. This elegant study poses a number of additional questions that must be addressed in future experiments. In particular, the effect on GDPs varied among hub neurons; while stimulation of several hubs resulted in an increase in GDP frequency, other hub neurons effected a decrease in GDP frequency, and the reason for the difference remains to be elucidated. Second, it is interesting that the architecture of such aristocratic, hub-containing networks characterized by power-law connectivity distribution can be most easily constructed using a simple preferential attachment rule, where newly added nodes form connections preferentially with nodes that are already well-connected. While it is not yet known whether GABAergic hub cells are formed in the developing hippocampus according to such unseemly “rich-get-richer” schemes, the wide axonal arborization and the low action potential threshold are certainly consistent with the advanced maturation stage that would be expected of an established hub neuron. Third, it will be important to establish whether hub cells exist in the adult networks as well, and whether only GABAergic neurons can serve as hub cells. Indeed, long-range GABAergic neurons certainly exist in the adult hippocampus, connecting distant parts of the hippocampus and related structures such as the septum (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), but it cannot be excluded that non-GABAergic cells may also serve as hubs in certain neuronal circuits. Finally, it will be of critical importance to determine if, as predicted by computational simulations, the number of hub cells increases in neurological diseases including epilepsy, and whether it is specifically the adult-generated, newly born cells that give rise to the added hub cells in pathological conditions (Morgan and Soltesz, 2008Morgan R.J. Soltesz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 6179-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, be forewarned, members of the neuronal bourgeoisie, we are coming for you!"
