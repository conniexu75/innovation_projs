https://openalex.org/W2143241514,"Nuclear receptors regulate gene expression by direct activation of target genes and inhibition of AP-1. Here we report that, unexpectedly, activation by nuclear receptors requires the actions of CREB-binding protein (CBP) and that inhibition of AP-1 activity is the apparent result of competition for limiting amounts of CBP/p300 in cells. Utilizing distinct domains, CBP directly interacts with the ligand-binding domain of multiple nuclear receptors and with the p160 nuclear receptor coactivators, which upon cloning have proven to be variants of the SRC-1 protein. Because CBP represents a common factor, required in addition to distinct coactivators for function of nuclear receptors, CREB, and AP-1, we suggest that CBP/p300 serves as an integrator of multiple signal transduction pathways within the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2066784771,"The P2Z receptor is responsible for adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent lysis of macrophages through the formation of membrane pores permeable to large molecules. Other ATP-gated channels, the P2X receptors, are permeable only to small cations. Here, an ATP receptor, the P2X7 receptor, was cloned from rat brain and exhibited both these properties. This protein is homologous to other P2X receptors but has a unique carboxyl-terminal domain that was required for the lytic actions of ATP. Thus, the P2X7 (or P2Z) receptor is a bifunctional molecule that could function in both fast synaptic transmission and the ATP-mediated lysis of antigen-presenting cells."

https://openalex.org/W2021554803,"During development of the Drosophila wing, the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene is expressed in a stripe of cells along the anteroposterior compartment boundary and gives rise to a secreted protein that exerts a long-range organizing influence on both compartments. Using clones of cells that express DPP, or in which DPP receptor activity has been constitutively activated or abolished, we show that DPP acts directly and at long range on responding cells, rather than by proxy through the short-range induction of other signaling molecules. Further, we show that two genes, optomotor-blind and spalt are transcriptionally activated at different distances from DPP-secreting cells and provide evidence that these genes respond to different threshold concentrations of DPP protein. We propose that DPP acts as a gradient morphogen during wing development."

https://openalex.org/W2051316659,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins can be conditionally activated in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interferon (IFN)-gamma. STAT activation was correlated with cell growth inhibition in response to EGF and IFN-gamma. Activated STAT proteins specifically recognized the conserved STAT-responsive elements in the promoter of the gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1 and regulated the induction of p21 messenger RNA. IFN-gamma did not inhibit the growth of U3A cells, which are deficient in STAT1, but did inhibit the growth of U3A cells into which STAT1 alpha was reintroduced. Thus, STAT1 protein is essential for cell growth suppression in response to IFN-gamma. The STAT signaling pathway appears to negatively regulate the cell cycle by inducing CDK inhibitors in response to cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2137281565,"How growth factors influence the fate of multipotent progenitor cells is not well understood. Most hematopoietic growth factors act selectively as survival factors, rather than instructively as lineage determination signals. In the neural crest, neuregulin instructively promotes gliogenesis, but how alternative fates are determined is unclear. We demonstrate that bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) induces the basic–helix-loop-helix protein MASH1 and neurogenesis in neural crest stem cells. In vivo, MASH1+ cells are located near sites of BMP2 mRNA expression. Some smooth muscle differentiation is also observed in BMP2. A related factor, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), exclusively promotes smooth muscle differentiation. Like neuregulin, BMP2 and TGFβ1 act instructively rather than selectively. The neural crest and hematopoietic systems may therefore utilize growth factors in different ways to generate cellular diversity."

https://openalex.org/W2045308252,"Interdigital cell death leads to regression of soft tissue between embryonic digits in many vertebrates. Although the signals that regulate interdigital apoptosis are not known, BMPs--signaling molecules of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily--are expressed interdigitally. A dominant negative type I BMP receptor (dnBMPR-IB) was used here to block BMP signaling. Expression of dnBMPR in chicken embryonic hind limbs greatly reduced interdigital apoptosis and resulted in webbed feet. In addition, scales were transformed into feathers. The similarity of the webbing to webbed duck feet led to studies that indicate that BMPs are not expressed in the duck interdigit. These results indicate BMP signaling actively mediates cell death in the embryonic limb."
https://openalex.org/W1988373211,"A mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) was generated by the introduction of an Arg 403 --> Gln mutation into the alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene. Homozygous alpha MHC 403/403 mice died 7 days after birth, and sedentary heterozygous alpha MHC 403/+ mice survived for 1 year. Cardiac histopathology and dysfunction in the alpha MHC 403/+ mice resembled human FHC. Cardiac dysfunction preceded histopathologic changes, and myocyte disarray, hypertrophy, and fibrosis increased with age. Young male alpha MHC 403/+ mice showed more evidence of disease than did their female counterparts. Preliminary results suggested that exercise capacity may have been compromised in the alpha MHC 403/+ mice. This mouse model may help to define the natural history of FHC."

https://openalex.org/W1979918788,"Production of nerve growth factor (NGF) was assessed in cultures of human T and B lymphocytes and macrophages. NGF was constitutively produced by B cells only, which also expressed surface p140trk-A and p75NGFR molecules and hence efficiently bound and internalized the cytokine. Neutralization of endogenous NGF caused disappearance of Bcl-2 protein and apoptotic death of resting lymphocytes bearing surface IgG or IgA, a population comprising memory cells, while surface IgM/IgD “virgin” B lymphocytes were not affected. In vivo administration of neutralizing anti-NGF antibodies caused strong reduction in the titer of specific IgG in mice immunized with tetanus toxoid, nitrophenol, or arsonate and reduced numbers of surface IgG or IgA B lymphocytes. Thus, NGF is an autocrine survival factor for memory B lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1965028987,"Using a novel strategy that enables the isolation of previously unknown genes encoding selectable recessive phenotypes, we identified a gene (tsg101) whose homozygous functional disruption produces cell transformation. Antisense RNA from a transactivated promoter introduced randomly into transcribed genes throughout the genome of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts was used to knock out alleles of chromosomal genes adjacent to promoter inserts, generating clones that grew in 0.5% agar and formed metastatic tumors in nude mice. Removal of the transactivator restored normal growth. The protein encoded by tsg101 cDNA encodes a coiled–coil domain that interacts with stathmin, a cytosolic phosphoprotein implicated previously in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of tsg101 antisense transcripts in naive 3T3 cells resulted in cell transformation and increased stathmin-specific mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1971361148,"The strand of telomeric DNA that runs 5′–3′ toward a chromosome end is typically G rich. Telomerase-generated G tails are expected at one end of individual DNA molecules. Saccharomyces telomeres acquire TG1–3 tails late in S phase. Moreover, the telomeres of linear plasmids can interact when the TG1–3 tails are present. Molecules that mimic the structures predicted for telomere replication intermediates were generated in vitro. These in vitro generated molecules formed telomere–telomere interactions similar to those on molecules isolated from yeast, but only if both ends that interacted had a TG1–3 tail. Moreover, TG1–3 tails were generated in vivo in cells lacking telomerase. These data suggest a new step in telomere maintenance, cell cycle–regulated degradation of the C1–3A strand, which can generate a potential substrate for telomerase and telomere-binding proteins at every telomere."
https://openalex.org/W2040512937,"Deficiencies in mismatch repair have been linked to a common cancer predisposition syndrome in humans, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), and a subset of sporadic cancers. Here, several mismatch repair-deficient tumor cell lines and HNPCC-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines were found to be deficient in an additional DNA repair process termed transcription-coupled repair (TCR). The TCR defect was corrected in a mutant cell line whose mismatch repair deficiency had been corrected by chromosome transfer. Thus, the connection between excision repair and mismatch repair previously described in Escherichia coli extends to humans. These results imply that deficiencies in TCR and exposure to carcinogens present in the environment may contribute to the etiology of tumors associated with genetic defects in mismatch repair."

https://openalex.org/W2075114528,"Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a transcriptionally regulated enzyme that synthesizes nitric oxide from L-arginine that has a key role in the pathophysiology of systemic inflammation and sepsis. Transgenic animals with a null mutation for the iNOS gene are resistant to hypotension and death caused by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The regulation of peripheral iNOS has been well studied in sepsis, but little is known about iNOS regulation in the brain during systemic inflammation or sepsis. We know that at baseline there is no detectable iNOS gene expression in the brain, but a detailed neuroanatomical study reveals that early in the course of systemic inflammation there is a profound induction of iNOS messenger RNA in vascular, glial and neuronal structures of the rat brain, accompanied by the production of nitric oxide (NO) metabolites in brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We propose that the spillover of nitrite into the CSF has the potential to be a diagnostic marker for systemic inflammation and sepsis. Pharmacological interventions aimed at regulating iNOS function in the brain might represent a new treatment strategy in sepsis. Brain iNOS may be relevant to the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of systemic inflammation and sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2066056753,"The mercurial insensitive water channel (MIWC, AQP-4) is a water-selective transporter expressed at the basolateral plasma membrane of principal cells in kidney collecting duct, airway epithelium, and gastric parietal cells, as well as in astrocytes and skeletal muscle plasmalemma. Because these sites correspond to membranes where orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs) have been observed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, we tested the hypothesis that MIWC forms OAPs. Chinese hamster ovary cells were stably transfected with the coding sequence of rat MIWC under a cytomegalovirus promoter. Immunostaining of clonal cell populations showed MIWC expression at the plasma membrane. A single band at 31 kDa was detected on immunoblot. Cell fractionation by sucrose gradient centrifugation indicated strong MIWC expression in plasma membrane fractions with lesser expression in Golgi. Functional analysis by stopped-flow light scattering showed high mercurial insensitive water permeability in plasma membrane vesicles. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy showed distinct OAPs on the plasma membrane P-face of MIWC-expressing cells with morphology indistinguishable from that in basolateral membrane of kidney collecting duct; the E-face showed corresponding linear grooves (spacing, ≃8 nm) in transfected cells and collecting duct. OAPs were not observed in control (empty vector-transfected) cells or CHIP28 (AQP1)-transfected cells in which disorganized intramembrane particle aggregates were found. These results provide direct evidence that a molecular water channel can spontaneously assemble in regular arrays.

Many years prior to the molecular identification of water channels, characteristic patterns of intramembrane particles (IMPs) observed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy were proposed to represent a morphological signature of water-transporting units. In amphibian skin, regular square arrays of IMPs, called orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs), were found on the plasma membrane of water-permeable epithelial cells after stimulation by vasopressin or isoproterenol(4.Brown D. Grosso A. DeSousa R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: C334-C342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In toad bladder, vasopressin-induced IMP aggregates with a similar morphology are induced by vasopressin(5.Chevalier J. Bourguet J. Hugon J.S.

However, the basolateral plasma membrane of the same collecting duct cell type contains large numbers of OAPs that appear similar to the vasopressin-induced OAPs in amphibian skin(9.Brown D. Semin.

The identity and function of the OAPs in other tissues have remained enigmatic since their first discovery in astrocytes over two decades ago(17.Rash J.E. Staehelin L.E. Ellisman N.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 86: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We recently proposed, based on tissue distribution studies and homology to MIP, that the mercurial insensitive water channel (MIWC) may be the OAP protein(24.Frigeri A. Gropper M. Umenishi F. Kawashima M. Brown D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MIWC was cloned from rat lung(25.Hasegawa H. Ma T. Skach W. Matthay M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5497-5500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subsequently an isoform with an extended NH2 terminus was cloned from rat brain (AQP-4, (26.Jung J.S. Bhat R.V.

MIWC is unique among the five cloned mammalian water channels in that its water transport function is not inhibited by mercurials because of the absence of a cysteine residue near its putative aqueous pore(27.Shi L.-B. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rat MIWC is a non-glycosylated, 301-amino acid protein that spans the membrane six times with cytosolic NH2 and COOH termini(28.Shi L.B. Skach W.R. Ma T. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization showed rat MIWC protein expression at the basolateral plasma membrane of kidney collecting duct, astrocytes in brain and spinal cord, and epithelial cells in stomach, trachea, bronchi, intestine, ciliary body, and various exocrine glands(22.Van Hoek A.N.

A human homolog of MIWC is found as a single copy gene at chromosome locus 18q22 and encodes distinct protein isoforms utilizing distinct transcripts generated by alternative splicing(30.Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22907-22913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The immunolocalization data, taken together with functional studies in kidney (31.Strange K. Spring K.R. J. Membr.

Invest. 1996; 97: 664-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggested a potential role for MIWC in the urinary concentrating mechanism, cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption, airway hydration, and glandular secretions. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that MIWC is able to form orthogonal arrays in a heterologous transfected cell model. CHO cells were stably transfected with rat MIWC utilizing procedures applied previously to generate cells that expressed functional and correctly targeted water channels CHIP28 (AQP-1) and AQP-2(33.Ma T.

The transfected cells expressed MIWC as a functional 31-kDa protein at the cell plasma membrane. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy showed prominent OAPs in MIWC-expressing cells that were morphologically indistinguishable from OAPs present in the basolateral membrane of kidney collecting duct. The 903-base pair coding sequence of rat MIWC was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using rat lung MIWC cDNA as template and primers (sense, 5′-GCTGATCATGGTGGCTTTCAAAGGC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTCTAGATACAGAAGATAATACCTC-3′) with engineered BclI (5′) and XbaI (3′) restriction sites. The BclI and XbaI fragment was ligated into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at BamHI and XbaI restriction sites and propagated in Escherichia coli. The construct was confirmed by sequence analysis. CHO-K1 (wild type) cells (UCSF Cell Culture Facility) were grown in Ham's nutrient mix supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105/60-mm diameter dish 12 h before transfection. Cells were washed with Opti-MEM1 media (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then incubated for 12 h at 37°C with 2 ml of medium containing 20 μg of Lipofectin™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10 μg of recombinant plasmid (or empty plasmid without insert). Cells were then washed and incubated for 24 h in 4 ml of Ham's nutrient mix containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were trypsinized and plated on 100-mm diameter dishes, and Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.) was added (500 μg/ml) for selection. At 10-14 days, G418-resistant cell clones were isolated and transferred to separate culture dishes for expansion and analysis. Fractionation was performed by a modification of reported methods(33.Ma T. Frigeri A. Tsai S.T. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol.

Cells from ten 25-cm diameter plastic dishes were grown to confluence (1-3 × 108 cells/dish), released by agitation in PBS containing 8 mM EGTA, and washed twice (100 × g, 10 min) at 4°C in homogenizing buffer (HB, 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The pellet was resuspended in HB containing antipain (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), and benzamidine (15 μg/ml) and homogenized by 20 strokes of a glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C and adjusted to 1.4 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). A discontinuous sucrose gradient (2 M sucrose (1 ml), 1.6 M (2 ml), 1.4 M (4 ml, containing homogenate), 1.2 M (4 ml), 0.8 M (1 ml)) was centrifuged for 2.5 h at 25,000 rpm in an SW 27 rotor, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Enzyme activities for α-glucosidase and alkaline phosphodiesterase I were determined as reported previously(33.Ma T. Frigeri A. Tsai S.T. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22756-22764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Osmotic water permeability (Pf) was measured by stopped-flow light scattering (36.Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in vesicle fractions suspended at ≃0.5 mg of protein/ml in 50 mM mannitol, 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Vesicles were subjected to a 100 mM inwardly directed sucrose gradient, and the time course of scattered light intensity at 530 nm was measured. Cells (homogenized in 200 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 4 μg/ml antipain) or membrane fractions were heated to 70°C for 10 min in SDS loading buffer, resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, a 1:1000 dilution of control or immune serum (rabbit polyclonal antiserum prepared as described in (29.Frigeri A. Gropper M. Turck C.W. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4328-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar)) was added for 2 h. The membrane was washed in PBS, incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1000, Life Technologies, Inc.), and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (16 μg/ml) and nitroblue tetrazolium (0.33 μg/ml). Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The polyclonal anti-MIWC antibody (or preimmune serum control) was incubated in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature and then washed four times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with the secondary rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500 dilution, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h and washed four times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Slides were viewed in a Leitz-Technical Instruments epifluorescence confocal microscope with cooled CCD camera detector. Confocal images were obtained with a × 60 objective (Nikon, oil immersion, numerical aperture 1.4). Cells grown on plastic 6-well plates were fixed for 2 h in 2% glutaraldehyde, rinsed, and stored in PBS. Monolayers were cryoprotected in 30% glycerol for at least 1 h before scraping. A small aliquot of the cell suspension was placed on a copper specimen holder and frozen by immersion in Freon 22 cooled with liquid nitrogen. Specimens were fractured and coated with platinum-carbon in a Cressington freeze-fracture device as described previously(37.Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Sabolic I. Valenti G. Ausiello D.A. Van Hoek A.N. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Replicas were cleaned in sodium hypochlorite bleach and chloroform/methanol (2:1) before being examined and photographed in a Philips CM10 electron microscope. Clonal cell populations of stably transfected cells expressing MIWC had identical growth characteristics and morphology to control cells transfected with empty vector and selected identically. Cell clones were first analyzed for MIWC expression, membrane localization, and function. Immunofluorescence with a rabbit polyclonal anti-MIWC antibody showed MIWC distribution in a membrane pattern with staining often observed in a perinuclear location probably corresponding to Golgi (Fig. 1A). Staining of control (vector-transfected) cells with immune serum was minimal (Fig. 1B), as was staining of MIWC-transfected cells with preimmune serum (not shown). High magnification confocal microscopy (Fig. 1C) indicated a plasma membrane distribution for MIWC. Subcellular fractionation was carried out to confirm the tissue distribution of immunoreactive MIWC and to isolate vesicles suitable for functional analysis. Fractionation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation yielded fractions enriched in endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi membranes, and plasma membranes. The identification of fractions was carried out by marker enzyme assays as described previously(33.Ma T. Frigeri A. Tsai S.T. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22756-22764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis in Fig. 2A (left) showed prominent expression of MIWC in the cell homogenate and the plasma membrane fraction; there was in some blots a weak band detectable in the Golgi fraction. MIWC was seen as a single band on immunoblot without glycosylation, similar to immunoblot findings in native cell membranes(24.Frigeri A. Gropper M. Umenishi F. Kawashima M. Brown D. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2993-3002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No distinct bands were detected in immunoblots of membranes from control cells probed with immune serum (Fig. 2A, right) or membranes from MIWC-expressing cells probed with preimmune serum (not shown). Functional analysis of water permeability was conducted on the isolated membrane fractions. Fig. 2B shows stopped-flow light scattering measurements of osmotic water permeability in which vesicle suspensions were subjected to a 100 mM inwardly directed gradient of sucrose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The gradient caused vesicle shrinkage, which produced a change in scattered light intensity. The time course of light scattering was similar in endoplasmic reticulum from the control and MIWC-expressing cells. Shrinkage was slightly faster in Golgi vesicles but much faster in plasma membrane vesicles from MIWC-expressing cells than from control cells. Calculated osmotic water permeability (Pf) for the plasma membrane vesicles was 0.018 cm/s at 10°C. There was no effect of 0.3 mM HgCl2 on Pf (not shown), a concentration of HgCl2 that strongly inhibited water permeability mediated by CHIP28(36.Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped-flow light scattering studies performed with urea and glycerol as solute (100 mM inwardly directed gradients) showed that MIWC is selective for passage of water. These results are consistent with functional measurements in Xenopus oocytes expressing MIWC(25.Hasegawa H. Ma T. Skach W. Matthay M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5497-5500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freeze-fracture electron microscopy of cells transfected with MIWC cDNA revealed aggregates of intramembrane particles scattered on the plasma membrane P-face. In each membrane fragment from ≃11 separate cells examined from two different cultures, the particles comprising these aggregates were arranged into orthogonal arrays (Fig. 3a) that closely resemble the OAPs seen in other cell types, including the basolateral plasma membrane of collecting duct principal cells (Fig. 3b). In addition to large OAPs, the cell membrane in Fig. 3a also contained many large IMPs that appeared more numerous than those present in control cells. These large IMPs could represent MIWC proteins that are not assembled into characteristic OAPs. On the plasma membrane E-face of MIWC-expressing cells, corresponding linear arrays of grooves were frequently observed (Fig. 3c). The precise appearance of the E-face grooves depended on the direction of platinum shadowing relative to the groove array. In this case, the imprint appeared as a series of linear grooves (arrows), each formed by a series of small closely apposed depressions in the membrane leaflet. These arrays of grooves were similar to those seen on the basolateral membrane E-face of collecting duct principal cells (Fig. 3d). In some areas, parallel arrays of grooves are seen (arrows) that were indistinguishable from the arrays of grooves in the MIWC-transfected CHO cells. These organized arrays were never seen on control (vector-transfected) cells (Fig. 3e) nor were they found in cells transfected with CHIP28 (Fig. 3f). Many large IMPs, previously shown to correspond to CHIP28 tetramers(37.Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Sabolic I. Valenti G. Ausiello D.A. Van Hoek A.N. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 38.Van Hoek A.N. Wiener M.C. Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Townsend R.R. Lipniunas P.H. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2212-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), are present on the plasma membrane. While they are sometimes concentrated into dense clusters of IMPs, no organized geometric arrangement of the IMPs was seen. OAPs were also never seen in freeze-fracture micrographs of LLC-PK1 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as well as CHO cells transfected with the AQP-2 protein (not shown). In Fig. 3, c and d, the center-to-center spacing of the E-face grooves was ≃8 nm, as was the center-to-center spacing of the indentations along the wall of each groove. On the P-face (Fig. 3, a and b), each large square IMP was ≃16 × 16 nm in size and in many cases appeared to be composed of four subunits (center-to-center spacing, ≃8 nm) when examined at higher magnification. Thus, the grooves probably correspond to impressions produced by the four subunits of the larger IMP. Based on previous analysis of CHIP28 IMP size(37.Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. Sabolic I. Valenti G. Ausiello D.A. Van Hoek A.N. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), each 8-nm “subunit” might consist of a MIWC tetramer.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1083-1094PubMed Google Scholar), the results here indicate that MIWC and MIP spontaneously assemble into OAPs in a heterologous expression system and/or in proteoliposomes, whereas CHIP28 and AQP-2 generally do not. Highly purified CHIP28 does assembly into two-dimensional crystalline arrays when reconstituted into liposomes at very high protein-to-lipid ratios under conditions of slow detergent removal(40.Mitra A.K. Yaeger M. Van Hoek A.N. Wiener M.C. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12735-12740Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 41.Walz T. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Engel A. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1383-1386Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar); however, the CHIP28 orientation is very different from that in real membranes in that adjacent CHIP28 molecules in the crystal are oriented in opposite directions. The physical interactions that drive the formation of OAPs are not known. Because of the close proximity between adjacent protein units, protein-protein interactions may provide the driving force for OAP formation such as interhelix dipole-dipole coupling and attraction between polar residues. We carried out hydropathy(22.Van Hoek A.N. Wiener M. Bicknese S. Miercke L. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11847-11856Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), helical wheel (42.Verkman, A. S. (1993) R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TXGoogle Scholar), and helix dipole (43.Bjornholm B. Jorgensen F.S. Schwartz T.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2954-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) calculations for MIWC and MIP (proteins that form OAPs) and CHIP28 and AQP-2 (proteins that do not). The sequences for each putative helical domain were aligned, hydropathy values were compared before and with arbitrary helix rotation, and dipole moments were computed. However, no significant difference was found that distinguished MIWC and MIP from their homologs. The driving force for OAP assembly may involve protein and/or lipid interactions that were not considered, or the free energy for individual helix-helix interactions may be too small to detect computationally. Is there functional significance to the assembly of water channel proteins in OAPs? Biophysical analysis has indicated that the single channel water permeability of CHIP28 is low (<10-13 cm3/s; (36.Van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) so that water channel density must be very high (>1000 channels•μm2) to increase water permeability significantly above channel-independent water permeability through lipids(1.Verkman A.S. Van Hoek A.N. Ma T. Frigeri A. Skach W.R. Mitra A. Tamarappoo B.K. Farinas J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C12-C30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For CHIP28, each monomer functions as an independent water channel(44.Shi L.-B. Skach W. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10417-10422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), giving no advantage to specific supermolecular assemblies. In contrast, MIWC was found recently to display subunit-subunit interactions, whereby an adjacent mutant subunit affected the function of wild-type MIWC(27.Shi L.-B. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Such interactions, which might occur in adjacent units in OAPs, might enhance MIWC water permeability. Theoretically, it is possible that parallel movement of water through closely spaced channels might augment net osmosis by a bulk flow mechanism(46.Zeuthen T. Stein W.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 137: 179-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); experimental verification of this hypothesis will be needed utilizing membrane systems having different MIWC assemblies. Another potential advantage for regular OAPs is to maximize water channel surface density while minimizing protein-protein contact. Our data suggest that OAPs in plasma membranes of many different cell types are composed of the water-selective transporting protein MIWC. Interestingly, modification of the membrane content and/or the morphological appearance of these OAPs has been reported for various physiological stimuli and pathological states, including stimulation of acid secretion by pentagastrin in parietal cells(47.Bordi C. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Anat. Rec. 1986; 215: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), brain ischemia (48.Neuhaus J. Schmid E.M. Wolburg H. Neurosci.

https://openalex.org/W2060807877,"During the cotranslational integration of a nascent protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the transmembrane (TM) sequence moves out of an aqueous pore formed by Sec61α, TRAM, and other proteins and into the nonpolar lipid bilayer. Photocross-linking reveals that this movement involves the sequential passage of the TM domain through three different proteinaceous environments: one adjacent to Sec61α and TRAM and two adjacent to TRAM that place different restrictions on TM domain movement. In addition, the TM sequence is not allowed to diffuse into the bilayer from the final TRAM-proximal site until translation terminates. Cotranslational integration is therefore linked to translation and occurs via an ordered multistep pathway at an endoplasmic reticulum site that is multilayered both structurally and functionally."

This association occurred specifically at the imprinted 15q11-q13 regions only during the late S phase of the cell cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2093330988,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three G1 cyclins (Clns) are important for Start, the event committing cells to division. Sic1, an inhibitor of C1b-Cdc28 kinases, became phosphorylated at Start, and this phosphorylation depended on the activity of Clns. Sic1 was subsequently lost, which depended on the activity of Clns and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34. Inactivation of Sic1 was the only nonredundant essential function of Clns, because a sic1 deletion rescued the inviability of the cln1 cln2 cln3 triple mutant. In sic1 mutants, DNA replication became uncoupled from budding. Thus, Sic1 may be a substrate of Cln-Cdc28 complexes, and phosphorylation and proteolysis of Sic1 may regulate commitment to replication at Start."
https://openalex.org/W2085010213,"Mammalian 15-lipoxygenases have been suggested to be involved in cell differentiation and atherogenesis because of their capability of oxygenating polyenoic fatty acids esterified to biomembranes and lipoproteins. We investigated the interaction of the lipid-peroxidizing 15-lipoxygenase and the hydroperoxy lipid-reducing phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase during their reaction with biomembranes and lipoproteins and obtained the following results. 1) Lipoxygenase treatment of submitochondrial membranes led to the formation of hydroperoxyphosphatidylethanolamine and hydroperoxyphosphatidylcholine as indicated by high performance liquid chromatography with chemiluminescence detection. In 15-lipoxygenase-treated low density lipoprotein cholesteryl hydroperoxylinoleate was the major oxygenation product. 2) Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase was capable of reducing the hydroperoxy lipids formed by the 15-lipoxygenase to their corresponding alcohols. 3) Preincubation of low density lipoprotein and submitochondrial membranes with the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase completely prevented the lipoxygenase reaction. However, addition of exogenous hydroperoxy lipids restored the oxygenase activity. 4) Short-term incubations of the complex substrates with the 15-lipoxygenase led to a specific pattern of oxidation products which was rendered more unspecific at long-term incubation or at high substrate concentrations. If the phosholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase was present during the reaction, the specific product pattern was preserved. These data indicate that the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase is capable of reducing hydroperoxy ester lipids formed by a 15-lipoxygenase, and that it may down-regulate the 15-lipoxygenase pathways in mammalian cells. The specificity of 15-lipoxygenase-derived hydroperoxy lipids depends on their immediate reduction to the corresponding alcohols preventing postcatalytic isomerization."

Here we report that transfection of G-kinase into G-kinase-deficient cells causes activation of the human c-fos promoter in a strictly cGMP-dependent manner. The effect of G-kinase appeared to be mediated by several sequence elements, most notably the serum response element (SRE), the AP-1 binding site (FAP), and the cAMP response element (CRE). The magnitude of G-kinase transactivation of the fos promoter was similar to that of A-kinase, but there were significant differences between G-kinase and A-kinase activation of single enhancer elements and of a chimeric Gal4-CREB transcription factor.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that treating cells with cGMP analogs or increasing the intracellular cGMP concentration induces c-fos mRNA expression; in some instances co-induction with Ca2+ ionophores or antioxidants was required(7.Peunova N.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unlike cAMP which acts predominantly through A-kinase activation, cGMP has several intracelluar target proteins: G-kinase, cGMP-gated ion channels, and cGMP-stimulated or cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterases(9.Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To test whether c-fos induction by cGMP analogs was mediated by G-kinase, we used G-kinase-deficient baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct under control of the human fos promoter (pFOS-CAT,(10.Sassone-Corsi P. Sisson J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar)). We found that reporter gene expression from this construct was stimulated by cGMP analogs only in BHK cells co-transfected with a G-kinase expression vector, but not in cells co-transfected with empty vector. Transactivation of the fos promoter in the presence of G-kinase was characterized further and found to be independent of A-kinase or Ca2+.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmidsThe G-kinase expression vector encoding human G-kinase type Iβ has been described(11.Meinecke M.

Six hours after the addition of DNA, cells were placed in low serum-containing media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin); at 24 h, drugs were added and cells were harvested 8 h later. The transfection efficiency was 67-80% as determined by histochemical staining for β-galactosidase of cells transfected with pRSV-βGal(4.Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R.

Cells were disrupted by several 10-s pulses of sonication, centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 s, and assays were performed at 4°C immediately thereafter to minimize 8-Br-cGMP dissociation from G-kinase(19.Jiang H.

To correct for the activity of A-kinase and other protein kinases, G-kinase activity in G-kinase-transfected cells was measured in the presence of PKI, and Kemptide phosphorylation in mock-transfected cells was subtracted from that in the G-kinase-transfected cells.

To test whether c-fos mRNA induction by cGMP analogs was mediated by G-kinase, we co-transfected the reporter plasmid pFOS-CAT (10.Sassone-Corsi P. Sisson J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) with a G-kinase expression vector (11.Meinecke M. Geiger J. Butt E. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Chakraborty T. Walter U. Jarchau T. Lohmann S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar) into BHK cells which contain extremely low endogenous G-kinase activity. In G-kinase-transfected cells, the enzyme was easily detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1), and total cellular G-kinase activity was 0.83 ± 0.09 nmol/min/mg of protein compared to 0.02 ± 0.01 nmol/min/mg of protein in cells transfected with control expression vector (“empty” pRC/CMV). From Western blots using bovine lung G-kinase as a standard and by comparing enzyme activity in transfected BHK cells to that of the purified bovine lung enzyme(18.Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we estimate the intracellular concentration of G-kinase in the entire transfected BHK cell population to be 3-6 pmol/mg of protein; taking into consideration that the transfection efficiency was 67-80%, the concentration of G-kinase in successfully transfected cells is in the range of physiological G-kinase concentrations found in smooth muscle cells, neuronal cells, and platelets (1-9 pmol/mg of protein)(9.Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).CAT expression from the pFOS-CAT reporter was induced by 8-Br-cGMP only in G-kinase-transfected cells and was strictly dependent on the amount of G-kinase vector transfected (Fig. 2A) and the 8-Br-cGMP concentration in the culture medium (Fig. 2B). Thus, activation of the fos promoter by 8-Br-cGMP required transfected G-kinase and was not due to cross-activation of A-kinase. Maximal induction of pFOS-CAT was ~5-fold at 1 mM 8-Br-cGMP, a concentration consistent with that reported to be required for various physiological responses in whole cells(4.Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20.Mecham R.P. Levy B.D. Morris S.L. Madaras J.G. Wrenn D.S. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 2623-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When 8-chlorophenylthio-cGMP was used to replace 8-Br-cGMP, maximal pFOS-CAT expression in G-kinase-transfected cells occurred at 0.25 mM (data not shown). In comparison, activation of endogenous A-kinase by 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP maximally induced pFOS-CAT expression 7-fold (Fig. 2B). For both G-kinase and A-kinase there was an excellent correlation between pFOS-CAT activity (Fig. 2B) and the amount of in vivo kinase activity (inset, Fig. 2B). These data are further evidence that 8-Br-cGMP induced pFOS-CAT expression by activating G-kinase and show that the amount of G-kinase activity in the G-kinase-transfected cells was comparable with the amount of endogenous A-kinase activity (taking into consideration that the transfection efficiency was 67-80%). CAT expression from the promoterless parent plasmid of pFOS-CAT(10.Sassone-Corsi P. Sisson J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and from several other promoter constructs containing the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat, the chicken β-actin promoter, and the SV40 early promoter (4.Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) was not influenced by G-kinase in the absence or presence of 8-Br-cGMP, indicating that the effect of G-kinase required sequence elements present in the fos promoter.Figure 2:Activation of pFOS-CAT by transfected G-kinase or endogenous A-kinase. A, activity of pFOS-CAT was measured in BHK cells co-transfected with 50 ng of pFOS-CAT, 50 ng of pRSV-Luc, and increasing amounts of G-kinase expression vector; the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding control expression vector (pRC/CMV). Cells were either left untreated (◊) or were treated with 0.5 mM 8-Br-cGMP (♦) for 8 h prior to determining CAT and luciferase activity. Luciferase activity from pRSV-Luc served to control for transfection efficiency and varied by <25% among samples. Relative CAT activity represents the CAT/luciferase activity ratio of each sample normalized to that of untreated cells transfected with control vector. Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. B, activity of pFOS-CAT was measured in BHK cells co-transfected with 50 ng of pFOS-CAT, 50 ng of pRSV-Luc, and either 500 ng of control vector (•, ▲) or 500 ng of G-kinase expression vector (■). Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of 8-Br-cGMP (•, ■) or 8-Br-cAMP (▲) as described above. The data are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Inset, the amount of in vivo G-kinase and A-kinase activity was measured in G-kinase-transfected BHK cells treated with 8-Br-cGMP (■) and in mock-transfected cells treated with 8-Br-cAMP (▲), respectively, as described under Methods. To minimize 8-Br-cGMP dissociation from G-kinase, protein kinase activities were measured at 4°C immediately after cell extraction(19.Jiang H. Colbran J.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The pFOS-CAT reporter construct contains approximately 700 base pairs of the human fos gene 5′-flanking region including several known enhancer elements: a sis-inducible element, a serum-inducible element (SRE), an AP-1 binding site (FAP, which resembles the phorbol ester response element, TRE), and a cAMP-response element (CRE) (Fig. 3)(2.Janknecht R.

Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). fos promoter induction by A-kinase is mediated by the SRE, FAP, and CRE, with each element functioning independently without synergism(12.Fisch T.M. Prywes R. Simon C. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22.Sassone-Corsi P. Visvader J. Ferland L. Mellon P.L. Verma I.M. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). A series of promoter deletions and mutations generally gave a similar pattern for both G-kinase- and A-kinase-mediated transactivation (Fig. 3); deletions of the fos promoter up to −72 nucleotides from the transcription start were inducible, but deletion of the CRE (pFC53) abolished inducibility by both kinases. However, the constructs pFC87 and pTF5/53 showed much greater induction by A-kinase than G-kinase suggesting that the two kinases do not regulate the fos promoter via identical mechanisms. The high inducibility of pTF5/53 by cAMP (which has been noted before(12.Fisch T.M. Prywes R. Simon C. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)) may be mediated by the C/EBP-related transcription factor NFIL-6(23.Metz R. Ziff E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).Figure 3:Identification of fos promoter sequences which mediate the effect of G-kinase. A schematic diagram of pFOS-CAT is shown containing 700 base pairs of the human c-fos 5′-flanking region; regions corresponding to the sis-inducible element, SRE, FAP, CRE, direct repeats (D.R.), and TATA box are shown relative to the transcription start site (arrow)(12.Fisch T.M. Prywes R. Simon C. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 198-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Deletion constructs extending from variable 5′ sites are indicated. A linker scanning mutation in pFC60LS (in the CRE) is indicated by XXX. The dotted lines indicate internal deletions. Transfections were performed as described under Methods with 50 ng of pRSV-Luc, 50 ng of the indicated CAT reporter plasmid, and either 400 ng of G-kinase expression vector or the same amount of control vector. Stimulation of endogenous A-kinase by 8-Br-cAMP (cAMP) or of transfected G-kinase by 8-Br-cGMP (cGMP/GK) was calculated as the difference in CAT expression in the presence and absence of 1 mM cyclic nucleotide. Results are the mean of at least three independent experiments which differed by <15% of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To study G-kinase transactivation of specific enhancer elements, we used synthetic promoter constructs containing multimerized TRE, CRE, or SRE consensus sequences in the context of an enhancerless thymidine kinase promoter(13.Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Nanxin L. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 14.Schönthal A. Sugarman J. Brown J.H. Hanley M.R. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7096-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Reporter gene expression from all three constructs was stimulated 4-5-fold by 8-Br-cGMP/G-kinase, similar to the 5-fold induction of pFOS-CAT (Fig. 4). In contrast, 8-Br-cAMP activation of endogenous A-kinase induced CAT expression from pTRE-CAT <2-fold and from pCRE-CAT >24-fold but from pFOS-CAT and pSRE-CAT about 5-7-fold. These results are further evidence that transcription factors binding to TRE and CRE sequences are regulated differently by the two kinases and suggest that the contribution of single enhancer elements to the transactivation of the fos promoter by G-kinase and A-kinase may differ. Moreover, responsiveness of TRE- and CRE-containing promoters to G-kinase and A-kinase may be cell type-specific and depend on the presence of certain transcription factors(4.Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Effect of transfected G-kinase and endogenous A-kinase on the activity of minimal promoter constructs containing multimerized TRE, CRE, and SRE enhancer elements. BHK cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of pRSV-Luc, 50 ng of the indicated CAT reporter plasmid, and either 400 ng of control vector or G-kinase expression vector; cells were left untreated(-) or treated with 1 mM 8-Br-cGMP (cGMP) or 8-Br-cAMP (cAMP) for 8 h as indicated. The parent plasmid pBL-CAT-5 (open bars) contains an enhancerless thymidine kinase promoter; CAT expression from this plasmid was very low and not influenced by G-kinase or A-kinase. pTRE-CAT (narrow diagonal bars) contains 10 copies of the SV40 enhancer AP-1 binding site (13.Aronheim A.

Ferland L. Mellon P.L. Verma I.M. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1529-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and its transactivation potential is modulated by phosphorylation, especially phosphorylation of Ser133 by A-kinase or Cam-kinase IV(2.Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3.Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A.

Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To determine if G-kinase modulates the transactivation potential of CREB, we used a Gal4-CREB fusion construct containing the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and lacking the CREB COOH-terminal leucine zipper dimerization motif (Gal4-CREBΔzip(15.Hagiwara M.

Montminy M. Verma I.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)). This construct was co-transfected with either G-kinase or control vector and the reporter plasmid pGAL4-Luc, which contains Gal4 DNA binding sites(3.Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Treatment of G-kinase-transfected cells with 8-Br-cGMP increased transactivation of pGAL4-Luc by Gal4-CREBΔzip 3.5-fold (Fig. 5A). 8-Br-cGMP had no effect on CREB transactivation in cells transfected with control vector indicating no significant cross-activation of A-kinase by 8-Br-cGMP. However, A-kinase activation by 8-Br-cAMP caused a 16-fold increase in CREB-mediated transactivation. A Ser133→ Ala mutation in CREB (Gal4-CREBΔzip-M1) (15.Hagiwara M. Alberts A. Brindle P.

Cell. 1992; 70: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) rendered CREB unresponsive to either G-kinase or A-kinase activation (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that G-kinase modulation of CREB activity requires Ser133 and are consistent with the finding that G-kinase phosphorylates a synthetic peptide derived from the sequence surrounding Ser133 of CREB with a 4-fold lower Vmax than that of A-kinase(25.Colbran J.L. Roach P.J. Fiol C.J. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M. Corbin J.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At present, we do not know whether G-kinase directly phosphorylates CREB in vivo; the enzyme could also modulate the activity of proteins which cooperate with CREB, e.g. CBP(26.Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bächinger H.P. Brennen R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). We did not observe any effect of G-kinase on the transactivation potential of Gal4-Fos, Gal4-c-Jun, or Gal4-JunB fusion constructs (27.Deng T. Karin M.

A, BHK cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of the reporter plasmid pGAL4-Luc(3.Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), 100 ng of pRSV-βGal (β-galactosidase expression vector serving as internal control), 3 ng of either pGal4-CREBΔzip (a chimeric transcription factor containing the CREB transactivation domain fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, filled bars) or pGal4-CREBΔzip-M1 (pGal4-CREBΔzip with a Ser133→ Ala mutation in CREB, diagonal bars), and 400 ng of either G-kinase or control vector. Cells were treated with 1 mM 8-Br-cGMP (cGMP) or 8-Br-cAMP (cAMP) for 8 h as indicated. CAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity expressed from pRSV-βGal; the ratio of CAT/β-galactosidase activity in the absence of Gal4-CREB constructs was assigned a value of 1. B, cells were co-transfected with pFOS-CAT and G-kinase or control vector as described in Fig. 4 except that 200 ng of either pRSV-PKIwt (encoding for wild type PKI(16.Day R.N. Walder J.A.

A and B, results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To exclude that G-kinase activation of CRE-containing promoters required endogenous A-kinase activity, we co-transfected an expression vector encoding either the specific A-kinase inhibitor peptide PKI (PKIwt ), or a noninhibitory mutant of PKI (PKImut (16.Day R.N. Walder J.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 431-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), together with pFOS-CAT and either G-kinase or control vector. Co-transfection of PKIwt inhibited cAMP-induced reporter gene expression by >70%, but had no significant effect on G-kinase-mediated transactivation (Fig. 5B).Since 8-Br-cGMP has been reported to amplify Ca2+ induction of the fos promoter in PC12 cells(7.Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1993; 364: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the Ca2+ ionophores A23187 and ionomycin (7.Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1993; 364: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) on pFOS-CAT activity in BHK cells transfected with G-kinase or control vector. There was no significant effect of the ionophores (0.1-3 μM) on pFOS-CAT expression in the presence or absence of 8-Br-cGMP (data not shown), suggesting that BHK cells may be lacking the Cam-kinase isozyme required for Ca2+ induction of the fos promoter(3.Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar).G-kinase is important in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, platelet function, neuronal long-term potentiation, and hematopoietic cell differentiation(9.Butt E.

Some of these functions involve lowering of cytosolic Ca2+, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol breakdown, and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins(9.Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M.

This report demonstrates that G-kinase can regulate gene expression and that the transcription factor CREB and the c-fos gene are important common nuclear targets for the cGMP-, cAMP- and Ca2+-activated signal transduction pathways. Additional transcription factors which may mediate transactivation of the fos promoter by G-kinase include other members of the CREB/ATF or Fos/Jun families; these proteins can form a large number of different complexes, including heterodimers between proteins from both families which bind to TRE- and CRE-like consensus sequences(1.Angel P.

Nuclear localization of G-kinase has not been established, but nuclear staining by a G-kinase-specific antibody has been observed in immunofluorescence studies of human macrophages(32.Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Wyatt T.A. Reed W. Lincoln T.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and G-kinase contains an amino acid motif (residues 404-410 of G-kinase Iβ) which closely resembles the nuclear localization signal of human interleukin 1α(33.Maier J.A.M. Statuto M. Ragnotti G. Mol. Cell.

Neurochem. 1994; 62: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that treating cells with cGMP analogs or increasing the intracellular cGMP concentration induces c-fos mRNA expression; in some instances co-induction with Ca2+ ionophores or antioxidants was required(7.Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1993; 364: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8.Ueberall F. Werner-Felmayer G. Schubert C. Grunicke H.H. Wachter H. Fuchs D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unlike cAMP which acts predominantly through A-kinase activation, cGMP has several intracelluar target proteins: G-kinase, cGMP-gated ion channels, and cGMP-stimulated or cGMP-inhibited phosphodiesterases(9.Butt E. Geiger J. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To test whether c-fos induction by cGMP analogs was mediated by G-kinase, we used G-kinase-deficient baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct under control of the human fos promoter (pFOS-CAT,(10.Sassone-Corsi P. Sisson J.C. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar)). We found that reporter gene expression from this construct was stimulated by cGMP analogs only in BHK cells co-transfected with a G-kinase expression vector, but not in cells co-transfected with empty vector. Transactivation of the fos promoter in the presence of G-kinase was characterized further and found to be independent of A-kinase or Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1967757221,"Mutations resulting in premature termination codons reduce the corresponding mRNA levels. We describe a cell-free system in which depletion of the mutant immunoglobulin kappa mRNA pool correlates with inefficient splicing and not with RNA decay. Splicing deficiency does not depend on the sequence surrounding the in-frame nonsense codon and can be partially corrected by mutating the methionine initiation codon. Despite the apparent link between translation and low mutant mRNA levels, inefficient splicing is not dependent on protein synthesis. Abnormal splicing of mutant immunoglobulin RNA is observed with B-cell but not with HeLa or T-cell extracts. A nonsense mutant beta-globin RNA is normally spliced by B-cell extract. We propose that the phenomenon exhibits tissue and gene specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1988418276,"PorB of the pathogenic Neisseria species belongs to the large family of pore-forming proteins (porins) produced by gram-negative bacteria. PorB is exceptional in that it is capable of translocating vectorially into membranes of infected target cells and functions in the infection process. Here we report on an unexpected similarity between Neisserial PorB and mitochondrial porins. Both porin classes interact with purine nucleoside triphosphates, which down-regulate pore size and cause a shift in voltage dependence and ion selectivity. Patch-clamp analyses indicate that PorB channel activity is tightly regulated in intact epithelial cells. In light of recent findings on the pivotal role of PorB in virulence and the prevention of phagosome lysosome fusion, these data provide important mechanistic clues on the intracellular pathogen accommodation reminiscent of mitochondrial endosymbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1994918408,"The initial steps in the biogenesis of membrane proteins parallel that of secretory proteins. The translocation of membrane proteins, however, must be interrupted prior to the complete traversal of the membrane. This is followed by their folding and integrating into the lipid bilayer. We have previously shown that as each latent transmembrane segment (TMS) in a polytopic membrane protein emerges from the ribosome, it sequentially translocates across the membrane. Here we demonstrate that these translocated TMSs can be extracted from the membrane with urea. This suggests that nascent TMSs do not integrate into the bilayer as they achieve a transmembrane topography. The integration is delayed until after the protein is synthesized and released from the ribosome. Prior to insertion into the bilayer, these TMSs appear to be stabilized by salt-sensitive electrostatic bonds within an aqueous-accessible compartment."

J., Kelly, M. B., Taddeo, F. J., Rubin, E., and Stubbs, C. D.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 17160-17165). In the present study, direct evidence is provided showing that phorbol esters and diacylglycerols bind simultaneously to PKCα. Using a novel binding assay employing the fluorescent phorbol ester, sapintoxin-D (SAPD), evidence for two sites of high and low affinity was obtained. Thus, both binding and activation dose-response curves for SAPD were double sigmoidal, which was also observed for dose-dependent activation by the commonly used phorbol ester, 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). TPA removed high affinity SAPD binding and also competed for the low affinity site. By contrast with TPA, low affinity binding of SAPD was inhibited by sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol (DAG), while binding to the high affinity site was markedly enhanced. Again contrasting with both TPA and DAG, the potent PKC activator, bryostatin-I (B-I), inhibited SAPD binding to its high affinity site, while low affinity binding was unaffected. Based on these findings, a model for PKC activation is proposed in which binding of one activator to the low affinity site allosterically promotes binding of a second activator to the high affinity site, resulting in an enhanced level of activity. Overall, the results provide direct evidence that PKCα contains two distinct binding sites, with affinities that differ for each activator in the order: DAG > phorbol ester > B-I and B-I > phorbol ester > DAG, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2018218643,"The chemical steps of bacteriophage Mu DNA transposition take place within a higher order nucleoprotein structure. We describe a novel intermediate that precedes the previously characterized transpososomes and directly demonstrates the interaction of a distant enhancer element with recombination regions. The transpositional enhancer interacts with the Mu left and right ends to form a three-site synaptic (LER) complex. Under normal reaction conditions, the LER complex is rapidly converted into the more stable Mu transpososomes. However, mutation of the Mu terminal nucleotides results in accumulation of the LER and a failure to form the type 0 transpososome. During the transition from LER to type 0, the Mu DNA termini and the active site of the transposase engage in a catalytically competent conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2062557694,"The hepatitis delta virus large antigen (lHDAg) is a virally encoded protein that contains a prenylation signal sequence at its carboxyl terminus consisting of the tetrapeptide Cys-Arg-Pro-Gln. Although the presence of the Gln as the COOH-terminal residue generally specifies addition of the 15-carbon farnesyl isoprenoid, earlier reports had suggested that the protein is modified by the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl. The prenylation of lHDAg was examined in vitro using a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase and the COOH-terminal 117 amino acids of lHDAg (GST-lHDAg). When recombinant GST-lHDAg was incubated with bovine brain cytosol in the presence of either farnesyl diphosphate or geranylgeranyl diphosphate, GST-lHDAg was preferentially farnesylated. Geranylgeranylation of the fusion protein was also observed, although at a rate considerably less than that of farnesylation. Using purified recombinant protein prenyltransferases, GST-lHDAg was found to be an excellent substrate (apparent Km = 0.8 μM) for protein farnesyltransferase (FTase), while modification by protein geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) was not detected. FTase was also able to catalyze geranylgeranylation of GST-lHDAg at a very low rate, suggesting that the low level of geranylgeranylation of GST-lHDAg observed in cytosolic preparations was mediated by FTase. Consistent with our observations on the in vitro prenylation of the GST-lHDAg fusion protein, isoprenoid analysis of authentic lHDAg expressed in COS cells demonstrated that the protein was farnesylated.

Hepatology. 1983; 3: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 2.Lai M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). HDV consists of the HDV RNA genome and two HDV-encoded proteins, designated as the small (sHDAg) and large (lHDAg) HDV antigens, encapsulated in an envelope composed of hepatitis B surface antigens(2.Lai M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). sHDAg and lHDAg contain identical deduced amino acid sequences for their first 195 amino acids, with lHDAg containing an additional 19-amino acid COOH-terminal tail(2.Lai M.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Despite their sequence identity, sHDAg and lHDAg have very different functions. Whereas sHDAg is essential for HDV replication(3.Kuo M.Y.P. Sharmeen L. Dinter-Gottlieb G. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lHDAg is a dominant inhibitor of HDV replication (4.Chao M. Hsieh S.Y. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5066-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is required for assembly of the HDV particle(5.Chang F.L. Chen P.J. Tu S.J. Wang C.J. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As lHDAg can package into pseudo-viral particles with hepatitis B surface antigens in the absence of both HDV RNA and sHDAg(6.Ryu W.S. Bayer M. Taylor J. J.

Interestingly, lHDAg is modified by an isoprenoid lipid on a cysteine located near its COOH terminus(8.Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and this modification is necessary for lHDAg to facilitate HDV assembly(8.Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9.Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The prenylation motif contained in lHDAg is the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide Cys-Arg-Pro-Gln (CRPQ)(8.Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This sequence is similar to the conventional prenylation motif which consists of the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide CAAX, where the cysteine residue is the prenylation site, “A” are generally aliphatic residues, and X can be one of several amino acids. Two distinct protein prenyltransferases modify proteins which contain a CAAX motif; farnesyltransferase (FTase), which modifies proteins with the 15-carbon farnesyl isoprenoid, and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I), which modifies proteins with the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group(10.Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal amino acid (i.e., X) in general determines which of the two isoprenoid lipids modify a CAAX motif. If X is Met, Ser, or Gln, the sequence is a substrate for FTase(12.Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J. Biol.

A third protein prenyltransferase, GGTase II, recognizes a different class of COOH-terminal motifs present in GTP-binding proteins of the Rab family(15.Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1992; 70: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Following the prenylation of the CAAX motif, two additional processing events occur: proteolytic cleavage of the -AAX tripeptide and carboxymethylation of the new COOH-terminal prenylcysteine(10.Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 11.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). As prenylation of lHDAg is required for HDV assembly, inhibition of the enzyme responsible for its prenylation is a potential treatment of HDV infection. Due to the presence of Gln at its COOH terminus, lHDAg would be predicted to be a FTase substrate(11.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 12.Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14603-14610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, two reports have appeared indicating that lHDAg is modified with the geranylgeranyl isoprenoid(8.Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9.Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not clear which protein prenyltransferase is responsible for the prenylation of lHDAg. In this report, we have examined both the nature of the isoprenoid group attached to lHDAg and the identity of the enzyme responsible for its prenylation. Our results indicate that the predominant modification of lHDAg is in fact farnesylation, and the protein is exclusively a substrate for FTase. Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), [1-3H]FPP (15 Ci/mmol), [1-3H]GGPP (15 Ci/mmol), and [5-3H]mevalonolactone (35 Ci/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and subjecting the homogenate to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Recombinant human Ha-Ras and Ha-Ras-CVLL were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (13.Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat FTase and rat GGTase I were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described(18.Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J.

The GST-lHDAg fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified essentially as described by Lee et al.(9.Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A 500-ml flask of LB medium was inoculated with 1 ml of an overnight culture of JM109 cells that had been transformed with the vector pGEX-2T-lHDAg. After incubation for 4 h at 37°C, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mM, and the cells were grown for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min, resuspended in lysis buffer (PBS containing 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 10% streptomycin sulfate and protease inhibitor mix), and lysed by three passes through a French press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was transferred to a column, and the column was washed with 20 volumes of PBS containing 850 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, and 1% Triton X-100. GST-lHDAg was then eluted from the column with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, containing 5 mM glutathione, and concentrated to 40 mg/ml using an Amicon Centricon-30. GST-lHDAg (20 μg), Ha-Ras (2 μg), or Ha-Ras-CVLL (2 μg) were utilized in prenylation reactions that contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 μM ZnCl, 2 mM DTT, and either 2 μM [3H]FPP (8 Ci/mmol) or 2 μM [3H]GGPP (8 Ci/mmol) (19.Chen W.-J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Zhang F.L. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23465-23470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were initiated by the addition of either bovine brain cytosol (500 μg protein) or purified recombinant FTase (75 ng) or GGTase I (75 ng), incubated for 1 h at 37°C, and stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 65°C for 5 min. Samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and the gels were prepared for fluorography by rinsing in water and soaking for 45 min in 1 M salicylic acid. Prenylated proteins were visualized by exposing the gels to Fuji RX film. For kinetic determinations, the concentrations of prenylation-competent GST-lHDAg, Ha-Ras, and Ha-Ras-CVLL were determined by driving the prenylation reactions to completion in the presence of excess FTase or GGTase I and the respective prenyldiphosphate, and determining the amount of protein prenylated by the filter binding assay described below. Final concentrations of substrates ranging from 0.1 to 20 μM were utilized in kinetic assays. Assay conditions were identical to those described above, with the exception that the specific activities of [3H]FPP and [3H]GGPP were 3 Ci/mmol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 75 ng of FTase or GGTase I and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 4% SDS, proteins precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid, and prenylated proteins separated from free isoprenoid by filtration through nitrocellulose filters as described (21.Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The amount of prenylated protein retained on the filters was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 8% calf serum and 2% fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected using a DEAE/dextran-chloroquine method(22.Lopatta M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). DMEM containing 0.25 mg/ml DEAE/dextran, 5 μg/ml pMEV, and 5 μg/ml pSV-lHDAg was added to COS-7 cells (3 × 106 cells/100-mm dish). Following an incubation at 37°C for 1 h, 7 ml of supplemented DMEM containing 52 μg/ml chloroquine was added to the cells. After 6 h, the medium was aspirated from the cells, the cells were washed with DMEM, and fresh supplemented DMEM was added. At 41 h post-transfection, lovastatin was added to the medium to a final concentration of 15 μM. Following a 1-h incubation at 37°C, the medium was aspirated and supplemented DMEM containing 20 μM lovastatin and 50 μCi/ml [5-3H]mevalonate was added. After an 11-h incubation at 37°C, the medium was removed from the cells and the cells were washed with PBS and harvested by scraping. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitor mix, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and lysed by passing several times through a 27-gauge needle. Cellular proteins were solubilized from the lysed cell extracts by addition of Triton X-100 and NaCl to final concentrations of 1% and 250 mM, respectively. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, passed through a 27-gauge syringe several times, and insoluble material precipitated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. SDS was added to the solubilized protein to a final concentration of 0.5% and the sample was heated at 65°C for 5 min to denature proteins. The sample was then adjusted to 0.25% SDS, 125 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium cholate. lHDAg was immunoprecipitated by incubation of the final extract obtained with rabbit anti-lHDAg (17.Wang J.-G. Cullen J. Lemon S.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for 15 min, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose 4B for 15 min. The protein A-Sepharose 4B beads were pelleted by centrifugation and were washed extensively with 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.7, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the beads either by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (for SDS-PAGE) or by two washes with 0.2 M acetic acid (for isoprenoid analysis). Immunoprecipitation of lHDAg was monitored by fluorography of SDS-PAGE gels. Isoprenoid analysis was conducted essentially as described by Farnsworth et al.(23.Farnsworth C.C. Casey P.J. Howald W.N. Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Methods (San Diego). 1990; 1: 231-240Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Solubilized COS cell proteins or immunoprecipitated lHDAg were precipitated in 15% trichloroacetic acid and the resulting protein pellets washed extensively in acetone at −20°C. Precipitated proteins were subjected to trypsin digestion, and isoprenoids cleaved from the tryptic peptides by treatment with methyl iodide in 2% formic acid. Following cleavage, methyl iodide was removed under mild vacuum and the solution neutralized by addition of sodium carbonate. Isoprenoids were extracted into a solution of chloroform:methanol (9:1), and the extracted isoprenoids dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% phosphoric acid. Farnesol and geranylgeraniol (15 nmol of each) were added to the samples as standards, and isoprenoids resolved by HPLC using a 50-100% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% phosphoric acid. Fractions containing 3H-labeled isoprenoids were identified by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. It has been reported that lHDAg is modified by the geranylgeranyl isoprenoid(8.Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9.Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In order to identify the protein prenyltransferase responsible for the modification of lHDAg, we first examined whether a fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase and the COOH-terminal 117 amino acids of lHDAg (GST-lHDAg) (9.Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was a substrate for these enzymes present in bovine brain cytosol. Surprisingly, our initial experiments indicated that GST-lHDAg was exclusively farnesylated, with no evident modification with the geranylgeranyl isoprenoid (Fig. 1, panel A, lanes 4 and 8). Prolonged exposure of the gel did, however, reveal that a low level of geranylgeranylation of GST-lHDAg did occur (Fig. 1, panel B, lane 8); the level of geranylgeranylation of GST-lHDAg was approximately 1% of the level of farnesylation. Two recombinant Ras proteins, Ha-Ras (containing the COOH terminus -CVLS, and thus a substrate for FTase) and Ha-Ras-CVLL (containing the COOH terminus -CVLL, and thus a substrate for GGTase I) were used as control substrates for the two enzymes and clearly demonstrated the presence of each enzyme in bovine brain cytosol (Fig. 1, panel A). These results suggested that lHDAg is a substrate for FTase. To further assess the ability of GST-lHDAg to serve as a substrate for FTase, we examined the ability of recombinant FTase and GGTase I to prenylate GST-lHDAg. FTase efficiently transferred the farnesyl group from FPP to GST-lHDAg, and the enzyme also supported a low level of geranylgeranylation, again approximately 1% of the level of farnesylation (Fig. 2, panel A, lanes 4 and 8). GGTase I was unable to modify GST-lHDAg using either FPP or GGPP as substrates (Fig. 2, panel B, lanes 4 and 8). These results were confirmed by a more detailed kinetic analysis of the interaction of GST-lHDAg with the two enzymes (Fig. 3). The fusion protein was found to be an excellent substrate for FTase with an apparent Km of 0.8 μM, which compares favorably to that measured for Ha-Ras (Fig. 3, panel A). GGTase I, however, did not utilize GST-lHDAg as a substrate over the range concentrations tested (Fig. 3, panel B).Figure 3:Kinetics of protein prenyltransferase modification of GST-lHDAg. Saturation curves for modification of GST-lHDAg, Ha-Ras, and Ha-Ras-CVLL by both FTase and GGTase I were determined. Assays were conducted with either FTase and FPP (panel A) or GGTase I and GGPP (panel B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reactions were stopped by addition of 2% SDS and prenylated proteins produced determined by filter binding assays. Data shown represent the mean of duplicate determinations from a single experiment, which is representative of several such experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our in vitro studies indicated that lHDAg should be farnesylated in cells. In order to examine this directly, isoprenoid analysis was performed on lHDAg expressed in COS cells. COS cells transfected with a vector expressing lHDAg were incubated with [3H]mevalonate, a precursor for both FPP and GGPP, resulting in the metabolic labeling of prenylated proteins(24.Schmidt R.A. Schneider C.J. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10175-10180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to increase the labeling of prenylated proteins in the COS cells, the cells were co-transfected with a second plasmid coding for a mevalonate transport protein (MEV) and also treated with lovastatin. Expression of MEV serves to increase the uptake of exogenous mevalonate (16.Kim C.M. Goldstein J.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23113-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while lovastatin treatment inhibits the de novo synthesis of mevalonate by the cell(25.Endo A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1569-1582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Isoprenoid-labeled proteins were observed in solubilized COS cell extracts prepared from cells expressing either MEV alone or both MEV and lHDAg (Fig. 4, panel A, lanes 1 and 2); in the latter condition an additional labeled protein of 27 kDa, the predicted size of lHDAg, could be faintly observed. This 27-kDa protein was readily immunoprecipitated from solubilized COS cell extracts using an anti-lHDAg antibody, confirming its identity as the viral antigen (Fig. 4, panel A, lane 4). The isoprenoid modifying lHDAg was cleaved from the protein by methyliodide cleavage, and the liberated lipid identified by HPLC. Isoprenoid analysis was performed both on the total pool of prenylated proteins present in solubilized extracts from COS cells, and on immunoprecipitated lHDAg. For the total pool of prenylated proteins, approximately 20% of the protein-associated isoprenoid was farnesyl and 80% was geranylgeranyl (Fig. 4, panel B), a ratio consistent with previous studies(26.Rilling H.C. Bruenger E. Leining L.M. Buss J.E. Epstein W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Isoprenoid analysis of the immunoprecipitated lHDAg, however, revealed that the protein was exclusively modified by the farnesyl isoprenoid (Fig. 4, panel C); the amount of geranylgeranyl lipid in immunoprecipitated lHDAg was essentially identical to that observed when COS cells not expressing lHDAg were subjected to the same procedure (Fig. 4, compare panels C and D). These results are completely consistent with the in vitro data that indicated that lHDAg was a FTase substrate, and we conclude that lHDAg is farnesylated in cells by FTase. We also predict that the geranylgeranylation of lHDAg observed by others in vitro(9.Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was mediated by FTase. Mutational analysis of lHDAg has revealed that while the prenylation motif at the COOH terminus of the protein is not necessary for lHDAg to bind sHDAg or the RNA genome, it is essential for lHDAg to interact with hepatitis B surface antigen in vitro(27.Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7659-7662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation or deletion of the prenylation motif also results in lHDAg that is unable to form pseudo-viral particles with hepatitis B surface antigens in transfected cells(8.Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 9.Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S.

Virol. 1994; 68: 646-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), providing strong evidence that prenylation of lHDAg is required for HDV particle formation. Although prenylation of lHDAg is necessary for interaction of the protein with hepatitis B surface antigen and for the formation of pseudo-viral particles, it is not sufficient in this regard in that a 15-amino acid cassette immediately upstream of the CAAX motif is also required(9.Lee C.-Z. Chen P.-J. Lai M.M.C. Chen D.-S. Virology. 1994; 199: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27.Hwang S.B. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7659-7662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Chang M.F. Chen C.J. Chang S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 646-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Lazinski D.W. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding parallels those from studies of Ras proteins, in which it was determined that the proteins require either a polybasic domain or palmitoylated cysteine residues immediately upstream of a farnesylation motif for efficient association with membranes(30.Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 31.Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thus, both in lHDAg and Ras proteins, a second “signal” is required for a function that is also dependent upon prenylation. The requirement of the prenylation motif for HDV particle assembly, coupled with our finding that lHDAg is exclusively a substrate for FTase, indicates that inhibitors of FTase should prevent viral particle formation. A number of laboratories have developed potent FTase inhibitors for use in the treatment of cancers that contain oncogenic Ras proteins(32.James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Rawson T.E. Somers T.C.

Here we show that Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with Grb2 in v-Abl-transformed cells, whereas Shc in NIH3T3 cells is phosphorylated solely on serine and is not Grb2-associated. In addition, Shc coprecipitates with P120 v-Abl and P70 v-Abl, which lacks the carboxyl terminus. Surprisingly, a kinase-defective mutant of P120 also binds Shc, demonstrating that Shc/v-Abl association is a phosphotyrosine-independent interaction.

Consistent with these data, a v-Abl mutant encoding only the Gag and SH2 regions was able to bind Shc in vivo.

Subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the YVNV motif in Shc by the receptors or their associated kinases creates a binding site for the Grb2 SH2 domain.

However, association with Grb2 and evidence of stimulation of signals downstream of Ras have not been reported in that system. Because v-Abl lacks the Grb-2 binding site found in Bcr-Abl, we investigated the possibility that Shc protein associates with v-Abl and Grb-2 in v-Abl-transformed cells. These experiments demonstrate that Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated in Ab-MLV-transformed fibroblasts and binds to Grb2. This interaction involves an unusual non-phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction that occurs between the v-Abl SH2 domain and the Shc amino terminus. The ability of Shc to bind Grb2 and the v-Abl SH2 simultaneously suggests a model for Shc-mediated Ras activation in Ab-MLV transformation similar to that of receptor tyrosine kinases. NIH3T3 fibroblasts and v-Abl-transformed NIH3T3 cell lines were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented to contain 10% Cosmic Calf serum (HyClone), 2 mML-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The NIH3T3 cell lines ANN-1, transformed with Ab-MLV-P120 strain(31.Scher C.D. Siegler R. Nature. 1975; 253: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and 70wt, transformed with Ab-MLV-P70(32.Engelman A. Rosenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8021-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), were described previously. Virus was obtained either by transfection of NIH3T3 cells using the calcium phosphate technique (33.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.51-15.61Google Scholar) followed by superinfection with Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) (34.Murtagh K. Skladany G. Hoag J. Rosenberg N. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 599-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by transfection of 293T cells as described previously(35.Muller A.J. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In some cases, NIH3T3 cells were infected and grown in 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to select for cells expressing the neomycin resistance marker within the virus. The P120 v-Abl kinase domain mutant (P120k-) was created by site-directed mutagenesis in M13 phage using the modified method of Zoller and Smith described in (33.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.51-15.61Google Scholar). A mismatched primer replacing a G with an A at position 2070 within the kinase domain sequence of the Ab-MLV-P120 genome (36.Van Bevern C. Coffin J.M. Hughes S. Weiss R. Teich N. Varmus H. Coffin J.M. RNA Tumor Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985: 850-860Google Scholar) resulted in a substitution of Asn for Asp at residue 484 of the P120 protein. The presence of the mutation was verified by dideoxy method sequencing with the Sequenase kit (Promega), and sequence containing the mutation was cloned into pANL2, a vector based on pABLSVneo(37.Kelliher M. A Murine Model for Human CML. Tufts University, Boston, MA1991Google Scholar). This vector is composed of the Ab-MLV P120 genome with a neomycin resistance gene controlled by an SV40 promoter cloned into the BamHI site at position 4355. These sequences are flanked by two complete long terminal repeats. The GagSH2 v-abl mutant was constructed by amplifying bases 621-1685 of the Ab-MLV P120 genome by PCR from pUC120 (32.Engelman A. Rosenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8021-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 5′ primer included an EcoRI site and the 5′ end of the Gag-coding region. The 3′ primer included the 3′ end of the SH2 coding sequence, a termination codon, and an EcoRI site. The PCR product was cloned into the pSRα vector (35.Muller A.J. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) at the EcoRI site, and the amplified sequence was verified by dideoxy method sequencing. The monoclonal antibodies, H548, directed against p12 Gag determinants present in v-Abl ((38); a gift of B. Chesebro, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, MT), 24-21, directed against an epitope in the v-Abl carboxyl terminus(39.Schiff-Maker L. Burns M.C. Konopka J.B. Clark S. Witte O.N. Rosenberg N. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 19-84, directed against a v-Abl SH1 domain epitope(39.Schiff-Maker L. Burns M.C. Konopka J.B. Clark S. Witte O.N. Rosenberg N. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used to detect v-Abl proteins. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biochemical Institute. Anti-Shc monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies as well as anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-GST monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Isotype-matched monoclonal control antibody, UPC10, and RGG were generous gifts of H. Wortis (Tufts University, Boston, MA). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Promega. Anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was obtained from Amersham. The GST fusion proteins were all constructed in the pGEX-3X vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and PCR primers for the inserts contained either a BamHI or an EcoRI linker. For the GST-ablSH2SH1 construct, PCR was performed to amplify bases 1329-2441 of v-abl P120 using pUC120. To create the GST-Abl SH1 and GST-Abl SH2 constructs, the v-abl sequences, bases 1686-2441 and bases 1329-1685, respectively, were amplified from pUC120. The GST-Src SH2 was constructed by amplifying bases coding for residues 146-251 of v-Src from pGX-4(40.Hevezi P. Alin K. Goff S.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2413-2423PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-Arg SH2 construct was a gift of G. Kruh (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA), and the GST-Shc construct was a kind gift of B. Schaffhausen (Tufts University, Boston, MA). The Shc SH2 region (bases 1214-1504 of the shc cDNA(16.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar)), the collagen homology (CH) region of Shc (bases 777-1213), and the region coding for the amino terminus (NT) of Shc (bases 82-776) were amplified from the GST-Shc construct by PCR. The NT1 and NT2 coding regions (bases 82-340 and bases 82-586, respectively) were also amplified by PCR using the GST-Shc construct. Each PCR product was digested with BamHI and/or EcoRI and ligated into the appropriate site of pGEX-3X. The sequence of all PCR products was confirmed by dideoxy method sequencing. To prepare GST fusion proteins, log phase Escherichia coli JM109 cells containing the pGEX-3X constructs were grown for 3 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The cells were pelleted and lysed in ice cold RIPA buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim)) with 10 μg/ml lysozyme. After 25 min on ice, the samples were sonicated (10 × 1 s) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) were added to the bacterial lysates, and the samples were incubated for 1.5 h on a rotating wheel at 4°C. The beads were centrifuged and washed with RIPA buffer. To obtain purified protein cleaved from the GST moiety, the fusion proteins bound to GST beads were washed and resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2 followed by incubation with 1 unit of Factor Xa (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer and left on ice for 25 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA method kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were done by incubating equivalent amounts of total cell protein with 1 μg of purified antibody or serum on ice for 1 h. Protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) were added, and the lysates were placed on a rotating wheel at 4°C for 1.5 h. The beads were washed with IP wash buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For precipitation with GST fusion proteins, GST fusion protein/glutathione beads as described above were added to equivalent amounts of total cell protein and incubated at 4°C on a rotating wheel for 1.5 h. The beads were washed twice with IP wash buffer and once with RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by heating the beads at 95°C in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. The samples were then fractionated through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to the supplied protocol. The membrane was then blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 for at least 1 h. Western blotting was either done according to the Western-Light kit protocol (Tropix), utilizing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies with a CSPD substrate (Tropix) or with the ECL detection system using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were then exposed to Kodak XAR 5 film. Blots were stripped by incubating in a solution containing 0.2 M glycine and 1% Tween 20 (pH 2.2) for 2.5 h at 80°C. After stripping, blots were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and reblocked prior to probing. Cells were phosphate-starved in phosphate-free DMEM (Flow Laboratories) supplemented with L-glutamine and 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (HyClone) for 1 h. The cells were then incubated overnight in phosphate-free DMEM with L-glutamine, 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and 0.5 mCi/ml 32P-labeled carrier-free orthophosphate (DuPont NEN). The cells were harvested, washed, and lysed in 1 × PLB buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm and transferred to fresh tubes. Antibody was added to the lysates, which were incubated on ice for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and the samples were placed on a rotating wheel at 4°C for 1.5 h. The samples were washed four times in 1 × PLB, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and eluted from the beads by heating at 95°C for 5 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described above. Autoradiography was used to locate the Shc bands on the membrane which were subsequently excised and used for one-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis as described previously(41.Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled amino acids were visualized on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To determine whether Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated in Ab-MLV-transformed cells, lysates from ANN-1 cells, a P120 v-Abl-transformed NIH3T3 cell line, and uninfected NIH3T3 cells were precipitated with anti-Shc antibody and analyzed on a Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1B). Shc protein recovered from ANN-1 cell lysates was highly phosphorylated while that recovered from NIH3T3 cells was not tyrosine-phosphorylated. The electrophoretic mobility of Shc differs between NIH3T3 and ANN-1 cell lysates (Fig. 1A). Other higher molecular weight phosphoproteins were also observed coprecipitating with Shc from ANN-1 cells (Fig. 1B). Shc from NIH3T3 cells migrates as three distinct bands, but Shc from ANN-1 cells migrates as several subspecies. A similar broadening of Shc bands has been observed after the addition of PKC activators(42.Habib T. Herrera R. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25243-25246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis of immunoprecipitated Shc from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled cells (Fig. 2, A and B) showed the presence of phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine in ANN-1-derived Shc and only phosphoserine in Shc from NIH3T3 cells. In addition, an increase in the total amount of phosphoserine was also observed in Shc from ANN-1 cells. To determine if the tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc was able to bind Grb2, the lower portion of the blot shown in Fig. 1A was probed with anti-Grb2 antibody (Fig. 1C). Shc from ANN-1 cells binds Grb2, in contrast to Shc precipitated from NIH3T3 cells which does not. Therefore, the presence of v-Abl causes the association of Shc and Grb2, most likely through the phosphorylation of Tyr-317 of Shc. This pattern is consistent with Shc-mediated Ras activation as seen with other tyrosine kinases(16.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F.

Western blots of immunoprecipitated P120 v-Abl probed with anti-Shc antibody showed that Shc binds to P120 (Fig. 3B). Conversely, when immunoprecipitations of Shc from ANN-1 cells were probed on a Western blot with anti-Abl antibody, P120 was recovered from the immune complexes (Fig. 3D). Immunodepletion experiments revealed that approximately 5% of the total Shc or v-Abl in the cell are complexed together (data not shown). This is consistent with the amount of Shc associated with a membrane-bound receptor complex during physiologic activation in at least one system(43.Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Rood P.M.L. Verhoeven A.J. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2818-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine if the carboxyl terminus of v-Abl is required for association with Shc, lysate from cells transformed with the Ab-MLV P70, which encodes a v-Abl protein containing the Gag, SH2, and SH1 domains(32.Engelman A. Rosenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8021-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was immunoprecipitated with anti-Abl antibodies and probed with anti-Shc antibody (Fig. 3B). P70, like P120, was found to bind Shc. Immunoprecipitation of Shc also coprecipitated P70 (Fig. 3D). Shc in P70 v-Abl-transformed cells is also tyrosine-phosphorylated (data not shown) and coprecipitates with Grb2 (Fig. 3E). Therefore, the presence of the v-Abl carboxyl terminus is not essential for interaction with Shc or Shc phosphorylation. Most interactions of Shc with tyrosine kinases have shown that binding of Shc requires a tyrosine-phosphorylated motif(14.Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K.H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24.Batzer A.G.

To assess the contribution of v-Abl kinase activity to v-Abl/Shc association, NIH3T3 cells expressing the mutant Ab-MLV-P120k-, which encodes a kinase-defective P120 v-Abl, were utilized. P120k- contains an Asp to Asn amino acid change in the kinase domain rendering it kinase-defective. Cells expressing this protein do not contain increased levels of phosphotyrosine (Fig. 4, A and C) and immunoprecipitated P120k- has no detectable kinase activity in vitro (data not shown). P120k- was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing the mutant virus and analyzed on Western blots for Shc coprecipitation (Fig. 4, B and D). Immunoprecipitation of P120k- showed that Shc still bound to v-Abl. Therefore, Shc binding is independent of v-Abl kinase activity. To identify the domains by which v-Abl associates with Shc, GST fusions of the Abl SH1 and SH2 domains were made and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads to precipitate cell lysates for Western analysis (Fig. 5A). Shc was precipitated from both NIH3T3 and ANN-1 cell lysates by GST-Abl SH2 and by a GST fusion consisting of both the Abl SH2 and SH1 domains. Shc did not precipitate with the GST-Abl SH1 fusion protein. Therefore, the Abl SH2 domain alone is sufficient for Shc binding. Furthermore, the ability of the Abl SH2 domain to bind Shc from NIH3T3 cell lysates shows that neither v-Abl kinase activity nor Shc tyrosine phosphorylation is required for this interaction. The amounts of Shc recovered with the GST-Abl SH2SH1 fusion are somewhat lower than might be expected based on the results obtained with the GST-Abl SH2. Because the GST-Abl SH2SH1 protein is not kinase-active in vitro (data not shown), this difference is not mediated by phosphorylation of Shc by the fusion protein. However, the presence of SH1 sequences may alter the interaction between Abl SH2 and Shc in some fashion. Although the amount of Shc binding to the GST-Abl SH2 differs between NIH3T3 and ANN-1 cell lysates (Fig. 5A), this difference is less prominent in additional experiments (data not shown). GST fusion precipitation experiments also showed that a GST-Arg (Abl-related gene) SH2 domain binds Shc as well (Fig. 5E). The Arg SH2 domain differs from Abl by only 10 residues. However, consistent with previously published results(44.Marengere L.E.M. Songyang Z. Gish S.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Stern M.J. Cantley L.C. Pawson T. Nature. 1994; 369: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), a GST-Src SH2 fusion did not bind Shc under our conditions (Fig. 5E). This suggests that the in vitro binding of Shc in our system is not a general property of SH2 domains. A mutant Ab-MLV was made to test whether the Abl SH2 domain is sufficient for interaction in vivo. The GagSH2 virus, which consists of the Ab-MLV Gag-coding region and the Abl SH2-coding region followed by a stop codon, was expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Immunoprecipitates of the GagS"

By using methods based on inhibition of yeast adenylyl cyclase or RasGAP activity and by in vitro binding assays, we have shown that the segment of B-Raf corresponding to amino acid 1-326 binds directly to H-Ras with a dissociation constant (Kd) comparable to that of Raf-1 and that the binding is not significantly affected by the post-translational modifications. However, when the activity of B-Raf to stimulate MAP kinase was measured by using a cell-free system derived from rat brain cytosol, we observed that the unmodified form of H-Ras possesses an almost negligible activity to activate B-Raf in vitro compared to the fully modified form.

Consequently, NO blunted the inhibition by extracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP, 10-1000 μM) of sodium-phosphate cotransport, a pathway which involves degradation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) by 5′-NU. SNP-induced inhibition of 5′-NU was not mediated by cyclic GMP, since it was not mimicked by atrial natriuretic peptide, and was reproduced by isosorbide dinitrate and sodium nitrate, two NO donors.

This technique has been used to investigate the copper- and O2-dependent biosynthesis of the TPQ cofactor in phenylethylamine oxidase (PEAO) and histamine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis. Incubation of the holoenzyme in H218O causes frequency shifts at 1684(−26) cm in PEAO and at 1679(−28) cm in histamine oxidase, allowing this feature to be assigned to the C=O stretch of a single carbonyl group at the C-5 position. When apoprotein is reacted with Cu(II) and O2 in the presence of H218O, the resultant holoproteins show increased shifts of −3 to −6 cm in a number of other vibrational modes, particularly at 411 and 1397 cm. Because these small shifts persist when the H218O-regenerated protein is back-exchanged into H2O, they can be assigned to oxygen isotope substitution at the C-2 postion. No isotope shifts are observed when apoprotein is regenerated with Cu(II) in the presence of 18O2. Thus, it is concluded that the C-2 oxygen atom of TPQ originates from H2O rather than O2. The isotope dependence of the 1397-cm mode allows it to be assigned to the C-O moiety at the C-2 position, with its low frequency being indicative of only partial double bond character. Similar frequency shifts due to 18O at C-2 are observed in the resonance Raman spectra of H218O-regenerated PEAO after derivatization of the C-5 carbonyl with either p-nitrophenylhydrazine (−5 cm at 480 cm) or methylamine (−5 cm at 1301 cm). Taken together, these results indicate that the TPQ cofactor in the native enzyme has substantial electron delocalization between the C-2 and C-4 oxygens and that only the C-5 oxygen has predominantly C=O character."

There is much evidence that several subsites, in addition to the main catalytic site, are involved in the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. This work analyzes the pattern of oligonucleotide formation by ribonuclease A using poly(C) as substrate. The poly(C) cleavage shows that the enzyme does not act in a random fashion but rather prefers the binding and cleavage of the longer substrate molecules and that the phosphodiester bond broken should be 6-7 residues apart from the end of the chain to be preferentially cleaved by ribonuclease A. The results demonstrate the model of the cleavage of an RNA chain based on the cooperative binding between the multisubsite binding structure of ribonuclease A and the phosphates of the polynucleotide (Parés, X., Nogués, M. V., de Llorens, R., and Cuchillo, C. M.(1991) in Essays in Biochemistry (Tipton, K. F., ed) Vol. 26, pp. 89-103, Portland Press Ltd., London). The contribution to the enzymatic process of the non-catalytic phosphate-binding subsite (p2) adjacent to the catalytic center has been analyzed in p2 chemically modified ribonuclease A or by means of site-directed mutagenesis. In both cases deletion of p2 abolishes the endonuclease activity of ribonuclease A, which is substituted by an exonuclease activity. All these results support the role of the multisubsite structure of the enzyme in the endonuclease activity and in the catalytic mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W1964958456,"The strand cleavage and strand transfer reactions of Mu DNA transposition require structural/catalytic contributions from separate polypeptide domains of individual transposase (MuA) monomers within the functional MuA tetramer. Based on catalytic complementation between two inactive MuA variants, we have derived certain rules by which the physical location of a MuA monomer within the transposition complex specifies its role in DNA breakage and transfer. During strand transfer, MuA monomers contributing domain II to the reaction occupy R1 (the subsite proximal to the strand-transferred nucleotide), while those contributing domain IIIalpha occupy R2. The positions of the monomers contributing these two domains appear to be reversed during DNA cleavage."

https://openalex.org/W1980668708,"Actin exhibits ATPase activity of unknown function that increases when monomers polymerize into filaments. Differences in the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and the release of the hydrolysis products ADP and inorganic phosphate suggest that phosphate-rich domains exist in newly polymerized filaments. We examined whether the enrichment of phosphate on filamentous ADP-actin might modulate the severing activity of gelsolin, a protein previously shown to bind differently to ATP and ADP actin monomers. Binding of phosphate, or the phosphate analogs aluminum fluoride and beryllium fluoride, to actin filaments reduces their susceptibility to severing by gelsolin. The concentration and pH dependence of inhibition suggest that HPO4(2-) binding to actin filaments generates this resistant state. We also provide evidence for two different binding sites for beryllium fluoride on actin. Actin has been postulated to contain two Pi binding sites. Our data suggest that they are sequentially occupied following ATP hydrolysis by HPO4(2-) which is subsequently titrated to H2PO4-. We speculate that beryllium fluoride and aluminum fluoride bind to the HPO4(2-) binding site. The cellular consequences of this model of phosphate release are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1587960570,"Human apolipoprotein E is a plasma lipoprotein that appears to play an important protective role in the development of atherosclerosis. While little is known about the regulation of apoE, recent studies have shown that cytokines repress apoE synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we have recently shown that the endogenous apoE gene is negatively regulated by the nuclear trans-repressor BEF-1 in the human HepG2 cell line. In this study we demonstrate that treatment of HepG2 cells with the cytokine interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 resulted in the induction of an isoform of BEF-1, designated B1. The induction of the B1 isoform could be blocked by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, suggesting that B1 is a phosphorylated form of BEF-1. As further support, the B1 isoform could also be induced by phorbol ester, and subsequently inhibited by staurosporine, implicating a role for protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation. Quantitation of the levels of the BEF-1 isoforms, and studies in the presence of cyclohexamide, provided evidence for the phosphorylation of an existing intracellular pool of BEF-1, with no change in the total intracellular level. Under conditions that generated increased levels of the B1 isoform, there was a concomitant and proportional decrease in the level of apoE mRNA. The effect did not appear to be the result of improved binding to the apoE regulatory region as the DNA binding affinity of B1 was identical to native BEF-1. Our data suggest that the regulation of apoE by BEF-1 is modulated by differential phosphorylation, possibly through the protein kinase C pathway."
