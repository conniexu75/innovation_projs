https://openalex.org/W2157832271,To my knowledge no method is available for determining the number of antibody-forming cells by simple counting in a hæmocytometer. For this reason the technique proposed here provides possibilities not yet covered by the already known methods for the detection of single antibody-forming cells1–3.

https://openalex.org/W2025241734,SEMI-SYNTHETIC media favouring high conidiation of N. crassa have been devised1–4. Use of an organic nitrogen source for growth or incubation at 37° C were also shown to enhance conidial production in the red bread mould5.
https://openalex.org/W2077879242,"Hosoya and Yoshida1, and especially Ottoson2, showed that a slow potential appears in the olfactory epithelium when an odour is applied. A similar slow potential was found at the cessation of odour application in our laboratory3–5. These potentials were electronegative when recorded by means of a macro-electrode placed on the surface of the olfactory epithelium. Later, an electropositive slow potential was found in our laboratory when some kind of odours were applied6,7. Consequently, three kinds of responses, electronegative on-, electropositive on- and electronegative off-slow potentials were found in the olfactory epithelium of the frog, toad, fish and newt."

https://openalex.org/W2063005248,"QUINACILLIN, the disodium salt of 3-carboxy-2-quinoxalinylpenicillin, has recently been described1,2 and has, for a penicillin, unusual properties. The striking feature is the pattern of the antibacterial spectrum which shows that quinacillin is significantly active (0.15–0.62 µg/ml., 0.32–1.35 µM) against Staphylococcus aureus (Oxford strain) but that a 10–100-fold increase in concentration is necessary before activity against other Gram-positive organisms can be demonstrated. It seemed profitable, therefore, to compare the action, if any, of quinacillin on causing the intracellular accumulation of N-acetylamino sugars and to compare this quantitatively with benzyl-penicillin as evidence of a typical penicillin-like mode of action3,4. Staphylococcus aureus was growrn for 18 h in a medium containing yeast extract 5 g peptone, 5 g glucose, 2 g K2HPO4, 1 g water to 1 1. In the middle of the logarithmic growth the penicillin was added and after 90 min the intracellular acetylaminosugar was determined colorimetrically5. Results are shown in Fig. 1."

https://openalex.org/W2021088218,THE rate-determining step in the Grotthuss mechanism for protonic conduction in aqueous solution at ordinary pressures is the rotation of water molecules to assume the particular H-bonded mutual orientation necessary for the actual proton flip1. Our present work on the activation energy of protonic conduction in 0.10 M aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid in the 0°–10° C region has failed to disclose a maximum in this parameter at the temperature of maximum density in contrast to sea water2 and 0.10 M potassium chloride solutions3.
