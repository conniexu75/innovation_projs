https://openalex.org/W2098669559,"Formaldehyde is a well known cross-linking agent that can inactivate, stabilize, or immobilize proteins. The purpose of this study was to map the chemical modifications occurring on each natural amino acid residue caused by formaldehyde. Therefore, model peptides were treated with excess formaldehyde, and the reaction products were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Formaldehyde was shown to react with the amino group of the N-terminal amino acid residue and the side-chains of arginine, cysteine, histidine, and lysine residues. Depending on the peptide sequence, methylol groups, Schiff-bases, and methylene bridges were formed. To study intermolecular cross-linking in more detail, cyanoborohydride or glycine was added to the reaction solution. The use of cyanoborohydride could easily distinguish between peptides containing a Schiff-base or a methylene bridge. Formaldehyde and glycine formed a Schiff-base adduct, which was rapidly attached to primary N-terminal amino groups, arginine and tyrosine residues, and, to a lesser degree, asparagine, glutamine, histidine, and tryptophan residues. Unexpected modifications were found in peptides containing a free N-terminal amino group or an arginine residue. Formaldehyde-glycine adducts reacted with the N terminus by means of two steps: the N terminus formed an imidazolidinone, and then the glycine was attached via a methylene bridge. Two covalent modifications occurred on an arginine-containing peptide: (i) the attachment of one glycine molecule to the arginine residue via two methylene bridges, and (ii) the coupling of two glycine molecules via four methylene bridges. Remarkably, formaldehyde did not generate intermolecular cross-links between two primary amino groups. In conclusion, the use of model peptides enabled us to determine the reactivity of each particular cross-link reaction as a function of the reaction conditions and to identify new reaction products after incubation with formaldehyde.

Aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are widely employed reagents in the biochemical, biomedical, and pharmaceutical fields. Formaldehyde, for example, is applied to inactivate toxins and viruses for the production of vaccines, such as diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, hepatitis A, anthrax, and inactivated polio vaccine, and to stabilize recombinant pertussis toxin (1Rappuoli R.

The vaccine quality depends to a considerable extent upon the chemical modifications caused by the formaldehyde treatment (1Rappuoli R. Levine M.M. Woodrow G.C. Kaper J.B. Cobon G.S.

Formaldehyde is also used for isotope-labeling of proteins (7Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 8Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Anal.

Protein Immobilization. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1991: 123-124Google Scholar). These examples demonstrate the wide range of roles of aldehydes in the biomedical field. Besides the use of aldehydes in diverse applications, they can also destroy important sites of proteins, such as crucial epitopes or active sites in enzymes. Several decades ago, extensive model studies were performed on reactions of formaldehyde with mixtures of amino acids and derivatives to determine which amino acids can cross-link (18Fraenkel-Conrat H. Olcott H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 174: 827-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fraenkel-Conrat H. Olcott H.S. J. Amer. Chem.

Fr. 1966; 10: 3120-3121Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that formaldehyde reacts first with the amino and thiol groups of amino acids and forms methylol derivatives. In the case of primary amino groups, the methylol groups partially undergo condensation to an imine, also called a Schiff-base (Scheme 1). Subsequently, the imine can cross-link with glutamine, asparagine, tryptophan, histidine, arginine, cysteine, and tyrosine residues. Some of the chemical structures of the proposed adducts have been elucidated by NMR (22Kelly D.P. Dewar M.K. Johns R.B. Wei-Let S. Yates J.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 86A: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This knowledge, however, is not sufficient to predict all possible modifications in proteins that are induced by formaldehyde. Moreover, the formation of modifications is influenced by various factors, such as the rate of a particular cross-link reaction, the position and local environment of each reactive amino acid in the protein, the pH, the components present in the reaction solution, and the reactant concentrations. Importantly, the nature of all possible chemical modifications in proteins caused by formaldehyde has not yet been fully elucidated, in part because of the low resolution and sensitivity of the analytical methods available at the time the above studies were performed (18Fraenkel-Conrat H. Olcott H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 174: 827-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fraenkel-Conrat H. Olcott H.S. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70: 2673-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 20Blass J. Bizzini B. Raynaud M. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1965; 261: 1448-1449Google Scholar, 21Blass J. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1966; 10: 3120-3121Google Scholar). However, the current availability of tandem high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry provides more detailed insight into the chemistry of protein-formaldehyde reactions. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the chemical nature of the reactions between formaldehyde and proteins. Therefore, a set of model peptides was prepared and used to map systematically the different chemical modifications induced by formaldehyde treatment. The selected peptides can be divided into two groups (see Table I): the first group had the amino acid sequence Ac-VELXVLL, in which one amino acid residue (X) varies and the remaining amino acid residues are non-reactive with formaldehyde. The second group was synthesized for studying the possible formation of intramolecular, formaldehyde-mediated cross-links between two reactive residues and contained peptides with the following sequence: Ac-LOENXLLZF-NH2, where O, X, and Z are either a (non-reactive) alanine residue or an arginine, lysine, and histidine residue in different permutations (see Table I). The reaction conditions were largely based on the detoxification process of diphtheria toxin for vaccine production (1Rappuoli R. Levine M.M. Woodrow G.C. Kaper J.B. Cobon G.S. New Generation Vaccines. 2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 417-435Google Scholar). Because glycine is used as a reagent during the inactivation of diphtheria toxin by formaldehyde for the preparation of diphtheria toxoid vaccines (6Metz B. Jiskoot W. Hennink W.E. Crommelin D.J.A. Kersten G.F.A. Vaccine. 2003; 22: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it was especially chosen to study in detail the cross-link reaction with peptides. The conversion of peptides was monitored by tandem reversed-phase liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/MS). 1The abbreviations used are: LC/MS, tandem liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; TFA, trifluoroacetic acid; Ac-Arg-OME, Nα-acetylarginine methyl ester; MS, mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: LC/MS, tandem liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; TFA, trifluoroacetic acid; Ac-Arg-OME, Nα-acetylarginine methyl ester; MS, mass spectrometry. In this paper, we present an overview of the major conversion products resulting from reactions between model peptides and formaldehyde (in the absence and presence of glycine), several of which have not been identified before. Our data can be used for the prediction and identification of reactive sites in proteins after exposure to formaldehyde.Table IPeptides involved in this study and their mass increments after formaldehyde treatment under standard conditionsaFor details, see “Experimental Procedures”PeptidePeptide sequenceFormaldehyde, ΔmFormaldehyde/NaCNBH3, ΔmFormaldehyde/glycine, ΔmFormaldehyde/Ac-Arg-OMe, ΔmDaDaDaDa1Ac-VELAVLL-OH0-bExperiment was not performed0-2Ac-VELCVLL-OH30-302423Ac-VELDVLL-OH0-0-4Ac-VELFVLL-OH0-0-5Ac-VELHVLL-OH0-8706Ac-VELKVLL-OH02802547Ac-VELMVEL-OHcThe peptides Ac-VELMVLL-OH and Ac-VELYVLL-OH could not be obtained in acceptable purity.

Therefore, the peptides Ac-VELMVEL-OH and Ac-VELYVEL-OH were synthesizedd Peptide products with these mass increases were formed after 48-h incubation with formaldehyde followed by incubation with NaCNBH3 Open table in a new tab Chemicals—Formaldehyde (37%), formic acid (99%), glycine, potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4·3H2O), and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4·3H2O) were purchased from Merck (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Sodium cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3) was obtained from Sigma (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands). Nα-Acetylarginine methyl ester (Ac-Arg-OMe) was obtained from Bachem Ag (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) ultra-grade was acquired from Acros Organics ('s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands). Endoproteinase Glu-C was bought from Roche Applied Science (Almere, The Netherlands). Peptides—Peptides (Table I) were synthesized on a 30-mmol scale by using an automated multiple peptide synthesizer equipped with a 96- column reaction block (SYRO II, Fa. MultiSynTech Gmbh, Witten, Germany). Couplings were performed with N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-amino acid (90 mmol), benzotriazolyloxy-tris-[N-pyrrolidino]phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (90 mmol), and N-methylmorpholine (180 mmol). Single couplings were performed in cycles 1-9 and double couplings from cycle 10. The Fmoc group was cleaved with piperidine/N,N-dimethylacetamide, 2/8 (v/v). Side-chain deprotection and cleavage from the solid support was effected with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/water (95/5, v/v), except for cysteine-, methionine-, and tryptophan-containing peptides, which were treated with TFA/ethanethiol (95/5, v/v). The peptides were purified by reversed-phase (C8 column) high performance liquid chromatography and their identity was confirmed by LC/MS. Before use, peptides were dissolved in water or Me2SO/water (50/50, v/v) to a final concentration of 10 mm. Standard Reactions with Peptides—For the reaction of peptides with formaldehyde, 10 μl of a 10 mm peptide solution, 10 μl of 1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 5 μl of a second agent (1.0 m glycine, 1.0 m NaCNBH3, 1.0 m Ac-Arg-OME, or water) were added to 70 μl of water. The reaction was started by adding 5 μl of an aqueous solution of 1.0 m formaldehyde. After mixing, the solution was incubated for 48 h at 35 °C. Samples were stored at -20 °C before analysis. Variations in Reaction Conditions—The effect of different reaction conditions was investigated by varying the reaction time, pH, reagent concentrations, and the moment of addition of NaCNBH3. The reaction of peptides with formaldehyde and glycine was monitored for 6 weeks. Aliquots (10 μl) were taken after 2, 6, and 24 h, 2, 6 and 24 days, and 6 weeks, and stored at -20 °C before analysis. To investigate the effect of pH, reactions were performed in potassium phosphate buffer at pH 5.2, 7.2, and 9.2. The influence of the concentration of the reagents on adduct formation was studied by varying the formaldehyde or the glycine concentration to final concentrations of 5, 50, and 500 mm. To determine internal cross-links in peptides, NaCNBH3 was added 48 h after formaldehyde addition. Removal of Excess Formaldehyde—Removal of formaldehyde was performed on a high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a 10 cm long × 200-μm inner diameter column filled with Poros 10 R2 (5 μm; PerSeptive Biosystems). The sample was diluted with water to a peptide concentration of 100 μm, and 10 μl of the diluted sample was trapped on the column. The column was rinsed for 10 min with solvent A (0.075% TFA in water) at a flow rate of 3 μl/min to remove formaldehyde. The peptide was eluted by a linear gradient from 0-60% solvent B (0.075% TFA in acetonitrile) in 25 min. The fraction containing the peptide was dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Concentrator 5301, Eppendorf) and dissolved in 100 μl of water. Sample was stored at -20 °C before analysis. Formaldehyde Treatment of Ac-Arg-OME—Formaldehyde, glycine, and an arginine derivative, Ac-Arg-OME, were dissolved or diluted in D2O to final concentrations of 1.0 m. A reaction mixture was prepared by successively adding 400 μl of glycine solution, 100 μl of Ac-Arg-OME solution, and 200 μl of formaldehyde solution to 300 μl of D2O. After each addition, the solution was homogenized by gentle mixing. The preparation was incubated for 48 h at 35 °C. Sample was stored at -20 °C before analysis. Digestion by Endoproteinase Glu-C—Peptides were digested by mixing 5 μl of 1 mm peptide solution, 5 μl of 1.0 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 9.0, 1.0 μl of 1 μg/μl endoproteinase Glu-C solution, and 39 μl of water, followed by incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, samples were stored at -20 °C before analysis. Nano-electrospray MS—Analytes were diluted to a concentration of 10 μm in water containing 5% (v/v) Me2SO and 5% (v/v) formic acid. A gold-coated nano-electrospray needle with an orifice of 1-2 μm inner diameter was loaded with 10 μl of the sample. A stable spray was obtained by an overpressure of 0.5 bar onto the needles and adjusting the electrospray voltage to 0.75 kV. The capillary was heated to 150 °C. MS-spectra were acquired from m/z 50-2000, followed by successive stages of collision-induced dissociation (up to MS4 measurements). The collision energies were optimized for each individual collision-induced dissociation mass analysis (between 30-35%). LC/MS—Peptide samples were analyzed by nano-scale reversed phase-liquid chromatography (HP 1100 Series LC system, Hewlett Packard Gmbh, Waldbronn, Germany) coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry (LCQ™ Classic quadrupole ion trap), essentially as described previously by Meiring et al. (23Meiring H.D. van der Heeft E. ten Hove G.J. de Jong A. J. Sep. Sci. 2002; 25: 557-568Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, each peptide sample was diluted to a concentration of 0.1 μm in water containing 5% (v/v) Me2SO and 5% (v/v) formic acid. An injection volume of 10 μl was used for analysis. To desalt the samples for MS analysis, analytes were trapped on a 15 mm long × 100 μm inner diameter trapping column with Aqua C18 (5 μm; Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 3 μl/min and by using 100% solvent A (0.1 m acetic acid in water) as eluent for 10 min. Then, analytes were separated by reversed-phase chromatography by using a 25-cm long × 50 μm inner diameter analytical column with Pepmap (5 μm; Dionex) at a flow rate between 100-125 nl/min. A linear gradient was started from 10% solvent B (0.1 m acetic acid in acetonitrile) to 60% solvent B in 25 min. Next, the columns were equilibrated in 100% solvent A for 10 min. The analytes were measured in the MS1 mode (m/z 400-2000) to determine the mass increase and conversion of peptides after incubation with formaldehyde. The heated capillary was set to 150 °C and electrospray voltage was set to 1.6-1.7 kV. A second LC/MS measurement was performed to obtain detailed sequence information. Therefore, the peptides were analyzed by data-dependent scanning comprising an MS1 scan (m/z 400-2000) followed by collision-induced dissociation of the most abundant ion in the MS1 spectra. The collision energy was set on 35%. Establishment of Reaction Conditions—A set of synthetic peptides (Table I) was used to investigate the reactivity of amino acid residues reacting with formaldehyde. The reaction was monitored over a 6 week period by LC/MS. In general, shorter exposure of the peptides sensitive to formaldehyde resulted in lower conversions. After a reaction time of 48 h, all modifications that were observed in this introductory study were detectable by using LC/MS analysis. Variations in the pH showed that reactions did not occur below pH 5 and that a maximal conversion rate was reached above pH 7. Furthermore, the conversion of the peptides was proportional with the reactant concentration. Based on these experiments, we used the following standard reaction conditions in the rest of this study (unless stated otherwise): 50 times excess of formaldehyde (and glycine) with regard to the peptide concentration, incubation at pH 7.2 and 35 °C for 48 h. Formation of Methylol and Imine Adducts—Peptide 1 was designed with amino acids residues, which were expected not to react with formaldehyde (Table I). Indeed, LC/MS-analyses showed that peptide 1 was not modified after incubation with formaldehyde. On the other hand, peptides containing a cysteine (peptide 2), arginine (peptides 11 and 20), tryptophan (peptide 14), histidine (peptide 18), or lysine residue (peptide 19) gave products with a mass increase of 30 Da. A second modification in peptides containing a tryptophan or a lysine residue (peptides 14 and 19, respectively) was observed. This modification caused a mass increase of 12 Da. Unexpectedly, and in contrast with the results of histidine-containing peptide 18 and lysine-containing peptide 19 (showing mass increases of 12 and/or 30 Da), formaldehyde treatment of peptide 5 (containing histidine) and peptide 6 (containing lysine) did not yield detectable amounts of reaction products. Nonetheless, a formaldehyde-glycine adduct could be attached to the histidinyl in peptide 5, and the lysyl in peptide 6 could react with formaldehyde and NaCNBH3. Thus, both residues were reactive with formaldehyde (see Table I). Therefore, we assume that the reaction equilibrium toward the methylol and imine adduct depends upon the amino acid sequence. The increase of 30 Da is an indication of the formation of a methylol group (Scheme 1, reaction 1). Under standard reaction conditions, the conversion varied between 3-22%, depending upon the peptide. The formation of a methylol adduct to peptides is a reversible reaction, because the conversion of the arginyl peptide 20 was reduced form 17 to 4.5% after removal of free formaldehyde. Structural Analysis of Reaction Products—MS2 analyses were performed on formaldehyde-treated peptides to confirm that the methylol was located on cysteine, histidine, lysine, and arginine residues (peptides 2, 18, 19, and 20). The spectra revealed that peptide fragments were present with a mass increase of 30 Da, if they still contained a cysteine, arginine, or a histidine residue, whereas peptide fragments lacking these residues had the same mass as the corresponding MS2 fragments of non-treated peptides. MS2 measurements on the peptide containing a methylol on the lysine residue showed only peptide fragments with a mass increase of 12 Da instead of 30 Da, apparently because of dehydration of the methylol group (Scheme 1, reaction 2). The methylol located on a tryptophan residue could not be verified by MS2 measurements, possibly because of the low conversion (3%). In conclusion, side chains of cysteine, histidine, lysine, arginine, and tryptophan residues can form methylol groups in the presence of formaldehyde. Two possible reaction products could account for a mass increase of 12 Da found in formaldehyde-treated peptides 14 and 19: the formation of an imine or a methylene bridge (Scheme 1, reactions 2 and 3). These possibilities were studied by MS2 measurements by generating immonium ions as a consequence of peptide fragmentation (24Biemann K. McCloskey J.A. Mass Spectrometry. 193. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 886-887Google Scholar). MS2 measurements performed on formaldehyde-treated peptide 14 showed that the mass increase of 12 Da was located on the tryptophan residue. The typical immonium ion of tryptophan (159 Da) was lost after the reaction with formaldehyde and a new fragment appeared (171 Da), indicating that the tryptophan residue was modified. No other new masses were detected, excluding the possibility that cross-links were formed between two residues. The proposed structure of the modified tryptophan residue is given in Fig. 1. MS2 measurements were also performed on formaldehyde-treated peptide 19 to determine the type of modification formed. The spectra revealed that, during formaldehyde incubation, a fragment with a mass of 84 Da disappeared and a fragment of 113 Da appeared. The fragment of 84 Da can be attributed to an immonium ion of an unmodified lysine residue. Another expected immonium ion of 101 Da was not found, but in general, this fragment is less frequently observed than the immonium ion of 84 Da, which lacks the ϵ-NH2 group. The characteristic immonium ion of 113 Da, which was found after formaldehyde treatment, is indicative of the formation of a Schiff-base (Fig. 2). A second confirmation of the presence of a Schiff-base in peptide 19 was the reaction with NaCNBH3, which was added 48 h after the incubation with formaldehyde. The ϵ-amino group of lysine was quantitatively converted to a dimethylated amine with a mass increase of 28 Da (Scheme 2). In conclusion, side chains of tryptophan and lysine residues can form imines during incubation with formaldehyde.Scheme 2Reduction of primary amino groups by adding formaldehyde and NaCNBH3 (7Jentoft N.

According to the literature, formaldehyde (and acetaldehyde) can form a stable methylene bridge in such peptides, as determined by NMR and MS-measurements (25Braun K.P. Cody R.B. Jones D.R.

Chemistry. 2001; 7: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The resulting ring structure is a 4-imidazolidinone (Scheme 3, reaction 1). To confirm the formation of a 4-imidazolidinone, we added NaCNBH3 to the peptide after 48-h incubation with formaldehyde. This resulted in the formation of a peptide adduct with a mass increase of 26 Da (Scheme 3, reaction 2), indicating that an N-methyl-4-imidazolidinone had indeed formed. Normally, when adding formaldehyde and NaCNBH3 simultaneously, N-terminal amino groups are reduced to a dimethylated amine. Indeed, a mass increase of 28 Da was then shown for peptide 16. The formation of intramolecular cross-links was also expected for peptides 21-24, because they contain two (peptide 21-23) or three amino acid residues (peptide 24) that are reactive with formaldehyde; i.e. they contain lysine, arginine, and/or histidine residues. Under standard reaction conditions, peptide 21 showed one adduct with a mass increase of 30 Da after formaldehyde treatment. This suggests that one methylol adduct was formed, probably on the arginine or the histidine residue. A product with a mass increase of 60 Da was also expected, but could not be detected. When increasing the formaldehyde concentration to 500 mm, a reaction product was observed with a mass increase of 60 Da, indicating that two methylol groups were attached to the peptide. However, no intramolecular cross-link was formed in this peptide, because in that case, a mass increase of 12 Da was expected. Besides the product with a mass increase of 30 Da, formaldehyde-treated peptide 22 showed two minor products each with a mass increase of 12 Da (Fig. 3). These minor products might be due to the formation of a Schiff-base located on the lysine residue or a methylene bridge between lysine and histidine residues. Addition of NaCNBH3 to the formaldehyde-treated peptide yielded two products: small amounts of a peptide adduct with a mass increase of 26 Da and a larger amount with an increment of 28 Da. The mass increase of 28 Da can be explained by the formation of dimethylated lysine, whereas the increase of 26 Da presumably reflects a product with an intramolecular cross-link between the lysine and the histidine residue. Both formaldehyde-treated peptides 23 and 24 showed two LC-peaks of adducts with a mass increase of 24 Da. These products could not be reduced by NaCNBH3, which suggests that two methylene bridges had been formed between the side chains of lysine and arginine. The proposed structures are given in Fig. 4. The following experiment was performed to verify this hypothesis. Peptide 24 contains a glutamic acid residue between the arginine and the lysine residue (Table I), which allows cleavage of the peptides by endoproteinase Glu-C. So, the original and the formaldehyde-treated peptide 24 were both incubated with proteinase Glu-C. The original peptide was completely hydrolyzed by proteinase Glu-C, yielding two fragments with expected m/z of 770 and 459 Da. On the other hand, the formaldehyde-treated peptide 24 with a mass of 1234 Da was partially converted to a product with a mass of 1252 Da. The mass increase of 18 Da indicates that the peptide bond was hydrolyzed at the carboxylic site of the glutamic acid residue and that the two parts were still coupled to each other by means of cross-links between the lysine and arginine residues. This strongly supports the proposed structures given in Fig. 4. In contrast to previous studies with amino acids (18Fraenkel-Conrat H. Olcott H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 174: 827-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fraenkel-Conrat H. Olcott H.S. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70: 2673-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), intermolecularly cross-linked peptides were not detected. This may be because of differences in reaction conditions and possible lower reactivity of peptides as compared with free amino acids. Unfortunately, the poor solubility of the peptides did not allow us to investigate whether cross-linking between two peptides occurs at higher concentrations. Increasing reaction time or mixing peptides with different reactive residues did not result in any intermolecular cross-linking. Cross-links between Glycine and Peptides—From the previous experiments, it was shown that cross-links were formed between lysine and histidine residues or between lysine and arginine residues after formaldehyde treatment. To investigate whether formaldehyde can form methylene bridges between other amino acid residues, all peptides were individually incubated for 48 h with a 50-fold excess of formaldehyde and glycine. MS1 analysis showed that glycine and formaldehyde reacted to form a reactive imine adduct with an ion mass of 88 Da. This glycine/formaldehyde adduct reacted with peptides containing a histidine (peptide 5 and 18), asparagine (peptide 8), glutamine (peptide 10), or tryptophan residue (peptide 14), yielding products with a mass increase of 87 Da. This can be explained by the coupling of glycine to the peptides via a methylene bridge (Table II).Table IIProposed structures of glycine-formaldehyde adducts attached to different amino acid residues present in peptides Open table in a new tab The peptide with a tyrosine residue (peptide 15) gave two products with an increase of 87 Da and 174 Da, which means that one or two glycine/formaldehyde adducts were coupled to the peptide, most probably to the ortho positions of the phenolic group (Table II). This type of reaction is known as the Mannich synthesis (21Blass J. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1966; 10: 3120-3121Google Scholar, 28Walker J.F. Formaldehyde, 3rd Ed. Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York1964Google Scholar). Glycine was also coupled by formaldehyde to the N-terminal amino group of peptide 16, which gave the peptide a mass increase of 99 Da. The formation of this adduct presumably occurs in two steps: (i) a 4-imidazolidinone is formed and then (ii) the glycine is attached via a methylene bridge to this 4-imidazolidinone. The proposed structure is given in Scheme 3, reaction 3. Arginine-containing peptides were also modified by formaldehyde and glycine. Peptide products were found with mass increases of 99 and 198 Da. The mass increase can be explained by the coupling of one or two glycine molecules to the peptide via two methylene bridges (see Table II). To verify that this modification occurs specifically on the arginine residue, an arginine derivative, Ac-Arg-OME, was treated with formaldehyde and glycine. The two main products from Ac-Arg-OME had the same mass increase of 99 and 198 Da. Their proposed structures are given in Scheme 4. MS4 measurements were performed on both products with ion masses of 330 and 429 Da. The product with ion mass of 330 Da was degraded after four repeated fragmentations into fragment ions with m/z of 243, 214, and 172 Da. The product with ion mass of 429 Da was fragmented to ions with m/z of 342, 255, 226, and 184 Da. The possible structures of the fragment ions are given in Scheme 4. Unexpectedly, formaldehyde did not cross-link detectable amounts of glycine to peptides 2, 6, and 19 containing a cysteine or a lysine residue, whereas these types of cross-links have been described in several articles (1Rappuoli R. Levine M.M. Woodrow G.C. Kaper J.B. Cobon G.S. New Generation Vaccines. 2nd Ed. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 417-435Google Scholar, 8Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Anal.

Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 6236-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Prolonging the reaction time or increasing the formaldehyde and glycine concentration did not have any effect. The peptide samples were normally analyzed by LC/MS in an acidic environment. Because the methylene bridge between two amino groups might be unstable in an acidic environment (31Blass J. Bizzini B. Raynaud M. Ann. Inst. Pasteur (Paris). 1968; 115: 881-898PubMed Google Scholar), the samples were also measured at neutral pH by static nanoelectrospray ionization analysis. No modifications were found in these peptides. These outcomes are in contrast to the results of others who treated 1,3-diaminopropane and cysteine with formaldehyde. Methylene bridges were formed between the two amino groups in 1,3-diaminopropane and between the amino and thiol groups of cysteine (22Kelly D.P. Dewar M.K. Johns R.B. Wei-Let S. Yates J.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1977; 86A: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Kallen R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 6236-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, both 1,3-diaminopropane and cysteine formed intramolecular cross-links, whereas in our experiments, intermolecular cross-links have to be formed between the peptide and glycine. Follow-up studies with a peptide containing two lysine residues may shed light upon these different observations. MS analyses of peptides 21-24 treated with formaldehyde and glycine demonstrated that several products were formed with different masses (Table I). These peptides contain two or three residues that can react with formaldehyde. The determined masses can be explained as a combination of methylol adducts, imines, and intramolecular and intermolecular cross-links. The conversion of peptides after glycine/formaldehyde treatment might predict the reaction rate of formaldehyde-induced intramolecular cross-links. Especially, intramolecular cross-links in proteins are initiated by the reaction of formaldehyde with lysine residues. Subsequently, the adducts probably form cross-links with reactive residues in their direct environment and especially with the residues that have the highest reactivity. Therefore, the conversion of peptides was determined after 48-h incubation with formaldehyde and glycine (Table III). The results show that the formaldehyde-glycine adduct was rapidly attached to free N-terminal amino groups, to arginine and tyrosine residues of peptides, and to a lesser extent to asparagine, glutamine, histidine, and tryptophan residues.Table IIIConversion of peptides to a glycine-formaldehyde adduct after 48-h incubation with formaldehydeaMean ± S.D.; n = 3ResidueΔmConversionDa%Asparagine874.0 ± 1.8Arginine9956 ± 1319841 ± 14Glutamine873.6 ± 1.6Histidine876.6 ± 1.9Tryptophan874.7 ± 1.5Tyrosine8762 ± 41745.2 ± 1.3N-terminal amino group1276bn = 19913bn = 1a Mean ± S.D.; n = 3b n = 1 Open table in a new tab Cross-links between Ac-Arg-OME and Peptides—In theory, the cross-link reactions between glycine and peptides caused by formaldehyde can only occur via an imine. To verify this, peptides 5, 6, 11, and 14, containing a histidine, lysine, arginine, and tryptophan residue, respectively, were incubated with formaldehyde and Ac-Arg-OMe for 48 h. Ac-Arg-OME was only cross-linked to peptide 6 and gave the peptide a mass increase of 254 Da. This observation indicates that two methylene bridges were formed between the primary amine group of the lysine residue in peptide 6 and the arginine derivative (Fig. 5A). Peptides containing a histidine, arginine, or a tryptophan residue did not react with formaldehyde and Ac-Arg-OME, confirming that the reaction occurred by means of a Schiff-base. Additionally, peptide 2 with a cysteine residue was treated with formaldehyde and Ac-Arg-OME to demonstrate that thiol groups can also form cross-links with arginine residues. A product with mass increase of 242 Da was found, indicating that one methylene bridge had been formed between the thiol group of peptide 2 and the arginine derivative (Fig. 5B). It has been reported in the literature that formaldehyde can react with the α-amino group and β-thiol group of N-terminal cysteines under formation of thiazolidine derivatives (32Gesquière J.-C. Diesis E. Tartar A. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1990; : 1402-1403Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Mitchell M.A. Runge T.A. Mathews W.R. Ichhpurani A.K. Harn N.K. Dobrowolski P.J. Eckenrode F.M. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). From these reports and our present data we conclude that cysteine residues can form cross-links at least with arginines and with N-terminal amino groups as a result of formaldehyde treatment. This study has demonstrated that, depending on their sequence, peptides undergo a great diversity of chemical modifications after formaldehyde treatment. The modifications can be divided into three types: (i) methylol groups, (ii) Schiff-bases, and (iii) methylene bridges. The formation of methylol and Schiff-bases is reversible, and therefore these compounds are generally hard to detect. Still, methylol and Schiff-base derivatives could be demonstrated in several peptides by using LC/MS. They were located on residues with an amino or a thiol group."
https://openalex.org/W1487540566,"ACF7 is a member of the spectraplakin family of cytoskeletal crosslinking proteins possessing actin and microtubule binding domains. Here, we show that ACF7 is an essential integrator of MT-actin dynamics. In endodermal cells, ACF7 binds along microtubules but concentrates at their distal ends and at cell borders when polarized. In ACF7's absence, microtubules still bind EB1 and CLIP170, but they no longer grow along polarized actin bundles, nor do they pause and tether to actin-rich cortical sites. The consequences are less stable, long microtubules with skewed cytoplasmic trajectories and altered dynamic instability. In response to wounding, ACF7 null cultures activate polarizing signals, but fail to maintain them and coordinate migration. Rescue of these defects requires ACF7's actin and microtubule binding domains. Thus, spectraplakins are important for controlling microtubule dynamics and reinforcing links between microtubules and polarized F-actin, so that cellular polarization and coordinated cell movements can be sustained."
https://openalex.org/W2105736223,"Salmonella enterica invasion of host cells requires the reversible activation of the Rho-family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 by the bacterially encoded GEF SopE and the GAP SptP, which exert their function at different times during infection and are delivered into host cells by a type III secretion system. We found that SopE and SptP are delivered in equivalent amounts early during infection. However, SopE is rapidly degraded through a proteosome-mediated pathway, while SptP exhibits much slower degradation kinetics. The half-lives of these effector proteins are determined by their secretion and translocation domains. Chimeric protein analysis indicated that delivery of SptP into host cells by the SopE secretion and translocation domain drastically shortened its half-life. Conversely, delivery of SopE by the SptP secretion and translocation signals significantly increased its half-life, resulting in persistent actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. This regulatory mechanism constitutes a remarkable example of a pathogen's adaptation to modulate cellular functions."

Here, we explore the possibility of whether phosphorylation and inactivation of the microtubule-destabilizing protein Op18/stathmin could be a mechanism regulating microtubule dynamics downstream of Rac1 and p21-activated kinases. We find that, in vitro, Pak1 phosphorylates Op18/stathmin specifically at serine 16 and inactivates its catastrophe promoting activity in biochemical and time lapse microscopy microtubule assembly assays. Furthermore, phosphorylation of either serine 16 or 63 is sufficient to inhibit Op18/stathmin in vitro. In cells, the microtubule-destabilizing effect of an excess of Op18/stathmin can be partially overcome by expression of constitutively active Rac1(Q61L), which is dependent on Pak activity, suggesting that the microtubule cytoskeleton can be regulated through inactivation of Op18/stathmin downstream of Rac1 and Pak in vivo. However, in vivo, Pak1 activity alone is not sufficient to phosphorylate Op18, indicating that additional pathways downstream of Rac1 are required for Op18 regulation.

Tight regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in living cells is essential for many cellular behaviors such as mitosis or motility. Rho family GTPases are well characterized regulators of actin cytoskeleton reorganization in response to extracellular signals (1Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent evidence has also linked Rho GTPases to regulation of the dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton (2Wittmann T. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3795-3803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, RhoA and its downstream effector, mDia, have been implicated in the formation of stable, detyrosinated microtubules (3Cook T.A. Nagasaki T. Gundersen G.G. J.

In addition, activation of Rac1 promotes microtubule growth into advancing lamellipodia of migrating cells (7Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In cells and in vitro, microtubules exhibit a nonequilibrium polymerization behavior known as dynamic instability, the stochastic switching between phases of growth and shortening (8Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar). Dynamic instability can be described by four parameters: the rates of growth and shortening and the transition frequencies from growth to shortening (catastrophe frequency) and from shortening to growth (rescue frequency). In vivo, dynamic instability is regulated by microtubule-associated proteins, microtubule plus end-binding proteins, and soluble proteins, creating a balance between microtubule stabilizing and destabilizing factors that promote the rapid turnover of microtubules required for cellular morphogenesis (9Andersen S.S.

Although the mechanism by which Op18 induces microtubule catastrophes is not entirely understood, it appears that this activity is at least partially separable from its ability to sequester tubulin dimer (16Howell B.

Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of this is unknown. In migrating cells, a subset of microtubules exhibits increased growth into the advancing cell edge because of a decreased catastrophe frequency and an increased time microtubules spend in the growth phase (7Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 27Waterman-Storer C.M. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that expression of constitutively active Rac1(Q61L) results in similar microtubule net growth in nearly all cellular microtubules and that this depends on Pak kinase activity (7Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). One possibility is that this Rac1-mediated promotion of microtubule growth could be by Pak kinase regulation of the microtubule destabilizing activity of Op18. We find here that Pak1 can directly phosphorylate Op18 at serine 16 and inhibit its catastrophe promoting activity in vitro, although in vivo Pak kinase activity alone is not sufficient to phosphorylate Op18. In addition, inhibition of Paks downstream of Rac1(Q61L) increases microtubule destabilizing activity of Op18 in PtK1 cells, indicating that Op18 activity can be regulated by Paks in vivo. Recombinant Proteins and Constructs—pcDNA3 mammalian expression vectors (Invitrogen) encoding EGFP-Rac1(Q61L) or EGFP-Rac1(T17N) were a kind gift from Klaus Hahn (The Scripps Research Institute).

The antiserum specific for phosphorylated serine 16 was from André Sobel (INSERM U440, Paris, France).

The resulting protein contains the peptide MSHHHHHHS fused to the N terminus of human Op18. Histidine-tagged Op18 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Stratagene) and purified on TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Phosphorylation and Microtubule Polymerization Assay—Op18 or related proteins were phosphorylated with GST-Pak1 in 25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP or with PKA (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped at 70 °C for 10 min and analyzed by native gel electrophoresis on 4-15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) or SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For use in microtubule polymerization assays, 35 μm Op18 was phosphorylated in 30-μl reactions with 1 μm GST-Pak1. To achieve stoichiometric phosphorylation, fresh kinase was added after 2 h, and the incubation continued for another 2 h. HeLa cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). To analyze Op18 phosphorylation on immunoblots, Op18 was quantitatively enriched from the cell lysates by heat precipitation of most cellular proteins (75 °C, 10 min) and subsequent precipitation of the heat-stable Op18 from the remaining supernatant with 5-6 volumes methanol and 1% sucrose overnight at -20 °C. The pellet was directly dissolved in a small volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In vitro kinase assays with immunoprecipitated Pak1 were as described (29Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J.

Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) was mixed with 1-12 μm Op18 in 30 μl of 80 mm K-Pipes, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 7 μm taxol. The microtubules were polymerized at 37 °C for 1 h and separated from unpolymerized tubulin dimer by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 10 min at 37 °C. Equal amounts of supernatant and pellet were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and quantified on a personal densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). In Vitro Microtubule Dynamics—Sea urchin axonemes (32Bell C.W. Fraser C. Sale W.S. Tang W.J. Gibbons I.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 373-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in 80 mm K-Pipes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2 were perfused into a 5-10-μl chamber (consisting of a clean coverslip mounted with two strips of double-sided tape on a microscope slide) on ice and allowed to adhere. The chamber was perfused with about 5 volumes of 10 μm tubulin and 1 mm GTP in the same buffer, sealed, and transferred to the microscope stage that had been prewarmed to 37 °C with an air stream incubator (NevTek). The samples were observed on an inverted TE-300 microscope (Nikon) equipped with differential interference contrast optics, a 100×/1.4 NA Plan Apo objective lens, a 1.4 NA condensor, and a metal halide liquid light guide illuminator (Nikon). The images were acquired in 12-bit mode with an Orca II cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu) and subarrayed such that a frame rate of less than 60 ms could be achieved using “stream acquisition” in Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). To reduce noise, eight such frames were background-subtracted, averaged, and contrast-stretched for each microtubule image. Such averaged images were acquired every 5 s, and dynamic instability parameters were quantified by measuring microtubule length over time. Plus ends were identified as the longer microtubules growing from the axoneme (31Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Determination of Tubulin Polymer to Dimer Ratio in Cells—PtK1 cells were cultured and injected as described (7Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The microtubule polymer:dimer ratio was essentially determined as described (33Zhai Y. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 881-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown on CELLocate coverslips (Eppendorf) were injected with X-rhodamine-labeled tubulin at 2-3 mg/ml. The cells were imaged with a 40×/1.3 NA Plan Fluor objective lens (Nikon) with the Orca II camera before and after extraction. To extract tubulin dimers, the cells were washed briefly with 80 mm K-Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm taxol, and extracted in the same buffer containing Oxyrase (Oxyrase Inc.) to inhibit photobleaching and 0.5% Triton X-100. During the whole procedure the slide was kept at 37 °C. The total tubulin fluorescence in cells before and after extraction was determined using Metamorph and after background correction, and the ratio of polymerized tubulin to soluble dimer was calculated. Statistical analysis of the data was performed with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft) and Analyze-it for Excel (Analyze-it Software, Ltd.). Pak1 Directly Phosphorylates Op18 at Serine 16—Because Op18 phosphorylation downstream of EGF stimulation is dependent on Pak kinase activity in cells (23Daub H. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Sobel A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1677-1680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), we first wanted to determine whether purified Pak could directly phosphorylate Op18 in vitro. For this purpose, Op18 was incubated with constitutively active GST-Pak1 (28Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1A). Although in vitro phosphorylation by GST-Pak1 proceeded relatively slowly, possibly because of the low specific activity of the bacterially expressed kinase, the rate of Op18 phosphorylation was comparable with the rate of GST-Pak1 autophosphorylation, suggesting that Op18 is a physiological substrate of Pak1. The incorporation of radioactivity was significantly reduced when mutated Op18(S16A) or Op18(S16A,S63A) was used as a substrate (Fig. 1B). This indicates that Pak1 phosphorylates Op18 predominantly at serine 16. To further examine the site specificity of Op18 phosphorylation by Pak1, we analyzed in vitro phosphorylated wild-type and mutant Op18 proteins by native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). Op18 and Op18(S63A) were phosphorylated by GST-Pak1 predominantly at a single site. However, Op18(S16A) was essentially not phosphorylated, demonstrating that Pak1 is highly specific for serine 16. Some minor phosphorylation occurred most likely on serine 63 because a minor band corresponding to a second phosphorylation site was present with Op18 or Op18(S16A) as a substrate but was absent with Op18(S63A). As a positive control, PKA phosphorylated Op18 at both serines 16 and 63, as described previously (21Melander Gradin H. Larsson N. Marklund U. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and showed a slight preference for serine 63 over serine 16. Interestingly, we also found that Pak1 and PKA phosphorylated the stathmin-like domain of one neuronal Op18 homologue, SCG10, but not another, RB3, suggesting that phosphorylation of these sites may regulate specific stathmin family members only (Fig. 1, D and E). Phosphorylation by Pak1 Inhibits Op18 in Vitro—We next determined whether phosphorylation by Pak1 affected the ability of Op18 to inhibit the polymerization of purified tubulin in vitro (19Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Tubulin dimer was mixed with increasing amounts of Op18, and microtubule polymerization was induced by the addition of GTP and taxol and incubation at 37 °C. Polymerized microtubules were then separated from unpolymerized tubulin dimer by centrifugation. Nonphosphorylated Op18 efficiently inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas Op18 that had been phosphorylated with Pak1 allowed microtubule polymerization even at Op18 concentrations exceeding the concentration of tubulin present in the reaction (Fig. 2A). As a positive control, phosphorylation with PKA equally inhibited Op18 (21Melander Gradin H. Larsson N. Marklund U. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To test whether Pak1-mediated inactivation of the microtubule destabilizing activity of Op18 was due to phosphorylation at serine 16, Op18 and Op18(S16A) were phosphorylated with Pak1 for increasing periods of time, and their effects on tubulin polymerization were compared. The inhibition of Op18 correlated with the progress of the phosphorylation reaction, whereas incubation of Op18(S16A) with Pak1 for long periods had no effect on its ability to inhibit microtubule polymerization (Fig. 2B). Together, these results demonstrate that Pak1 phosphorylation at serine 16 is necessary and sufficient to inhibit the microtubule destabilizing activity of Op18 in vitro. Because such a bulk tubulin polymerization assay does not distinguish between tubulin dimer sequestration and direct catastrophe promotion, we also examined the effect of Pak1 phosphorylation of Op18 on microtubule plus end dynamic instability parameters. The microtubules were nucleated from axonemes at 10 μm tubulin concentration and observed by digitally enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. This assay was performed at pH 7.5, a level at which binding of Op18 to tubulin dimers is reduced (34Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol.

Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the addition of 0.8 or 1.5 μm Op18 increased the catastrophe frequency ∼2- or 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table I). We also observed a slight decrease in plus end growth rate that was statistically significant at high Op18 concentrations (p < 0.01 by analysis of variance; Table I). In contrast, concentrations as high as 2.0 μm Pak1-phosphorylated Op18 had no significant effect on either plus end catastrophe frequency or growth rate (Fig. 3 and Table I), showing that phosphorylation by Pak1 alone can regulate the catastrophe promoting activity of Op18.Table IPhosphorylation by Pak1 inactivates Op18Growth rateCatastrophe frequencyNumber of catastrophesShortening rateTime observed (in growth)Number of microtubulesμm/mins−1μm/minminNone1.01 ± 0.220.001312−30.1 ± 14.1159 (156)220.8 μm Op180.89 ± 0.230.002824−27.1 ± 13.6151 (145)271.5 μm Op180.79 ± 0.150.004327−24.7 ± 10.5109 (105)290.8 μm Op18, Pak1-phosphorylated1.05 ± 0.250.00149−32.2 ± 12.9113 (110)192.0 μm Op18, Pak1-phosphorylated0.99 ± 0.190.001310−28.0 ± 12.4134 (131)19 Open table in a new tab How Op18 phosphorylation affects microtubule dynamics in vitro has so far only been analyzed with protein that had been dual phosphorylated on both serines 16 and 63 (35Holmfeldt P. Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because Pak1 primarily phosphorylated Op18 at serine 16, we wanted to examine the relative contribution of phosphorylation at either serine 16 or 63 to Op18 inhibition. For this purpose, we analyzed plus end microtubule dynamic instability in vitro in the presence of either Op18(S16A) or Op18(S63A) phosphorylation site-deficient mutants. At similar concentrations, both nonphosphorylated mutant proteins increased the catastrophe frequency comparable with wild-type Op18. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of both mutant proteins with PKA resulting in single site phosphorylation of either serine 63 or 16, respectively, equally inhibited the catastrophe promoting activity of Op18. This suggests that phosphorylation at either serine 16 or 63 is sufficient to inactivate Op18 in vitro (Fig. 3B and Table II).Table IIPhosphorylation of either serine 16 or serine 63 inactivates Op 18Growth rateCatastrophe frequencyNumber of catastrophesShortening rateTime observed (in growth)Number of microtubulesμm/mins−1μm/minmin1.6 μm Op18(S16A)0.78 ± 0.190.004025−33.3 ± 15.2108 (105)251.6 μm Op18(S16A), PKA-phosphorylated0.99 ± 0.120.001312−33.3 ± 12.6160 (156)191.6 μm Op18(S63A)0.75 ± 0.120.004023−26.2 ± 11.1101 (97)231.6 μm Op18(S63A), PKA-phosphorylated1.00 ± 0.180.001514−33.2 ± 13.0162 (158)20 Open table in a new tab Regulation of Op18 Phosphorylation Downstream of Rac1 in Vivo—Phosphorylation of Op18 in response to EGF has been observed in cancer cells; however, how this affects microtubules in these cells has not been examined (23Daub H.

To study whether such growth factor-induced Op18 phosphorylation could be important for the regulation of microtubule stability in vivo, we first determined the extent of Op18 phosphorylation after EGF stimulation in PtK1 cells, the same cell type in which we have observed increased microtubule growth downstream of Rac1 activation (7Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). PtK1 epithelial cells that had been treated with EGF for 5-60 min were lysed and analyzed by immunoblot with an anti-Op18 antibody or an antiserum specific for phosphorylated serine 16 (37Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We clearly detected serine 16 phosphorylation 15 min after EGF stimulation, and maximal phosphorylation was reached after 30 min (Fig. 4A). However, the fraction of total Op18 that was phosphorylated was relatively low, as judged by the intensity of bands of lower electrophoretic mobility that appeared after EGF addition and were recognized by the anti-Op18 antibody. In addition, these bands indicate that EGF treatment induces phosphorylation at other sites besides serine 16 as previously shown (23Daub H. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Sobel A. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1677-1680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We had previously found that expression of constitutively active mutants of Pak1 was not sufficient to induce the net microtubule growth observed in Rac1(Q61L)-expressing cells (7Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To clarify this, we wanted to test whether constitutively active Pak1 can phosphorylate Op18 in vivo. For this purpose, we used HeLa cells, because high transfection efficiency could be obtained, and examined phosphorylation of Op18 at serine 16 in cells expressing either dominant negative Rac1(T17N), constitutively active Rac1(Q61L), or two different constitutively active Pak1 mutants, Pak1(T423E) or Pak1(H83L,H86L) (38Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that Op18 phosphorylation at serine 16 was only increased in Rac1(Q61L)-expressing cells but not in cells expressing either of the constitutively active Pak1 mutants (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the Pak1 mutants were active in HeLa cells, we immunoprecipitated Pak1 from transfected cells and tested its activity in a kinase assay. This showed that Pak1(T423E) was clearly active and capable of phosphorylating Op18 in vitro (Fig. 4D). To test whether other kinases that are known to phosphorylate Op18 at serine 16 are involved, we used different kinase inhibitors and determined their effect on EGF-induced Op18 phosphorylation in PtK1 cells (Fig. 4B) and Rac1(Q61L)-induced Op18 phosphorylation in HeLa cells (data not shown) (39Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar). Neither 10 μm KN-62, a selective inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases, nor 10 μm H-89, a potent inhibitor of PKA and Rock-II, inhibited EGF-induced Op18 phosphorylation, indicating that these kinases do not phosphorylate Op18 downstream of Rac1. Furthermore, up to 20 μm H-89 had no effect on Rac1(Q61L)-induced microtubule growth in Ptk1 cells (data not shown) (7Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, 1 mm 8-bromoadenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, a direct activator of PKA, induced only very little phosphorylation at serine 16 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that PKA is not a major regulator of serine 16 phosphorylation in PtK1 cells.

Ub-protein isopeptide ligases (E3) catalyze the formation of poly-Ub chains on substrate proteins via isopeptide bonds that link the C-terminal Gly residue of one Ub molecule (activated in an ATP-dependent manner by the enzyme E1) to the ϵNH2 group of a Lys side chain in another Ub molecule (11Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). The most common poly-Ub chain is linked through Lys-48 of Ub and serves as a signal for rapid degradation of substrates by the proteasome-dependent proteolysis pathway (12Chau V. Tobias J.W.

Several groups have characterized the type of poly-Ub linkages formed by the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer. It was reported that the poly-Ub chain built by the BRCA1-BARD1 ligase is linked through Ub Lys residues other than Lys-48, suggesting they may not serve as a degradation signal (6Chen A. Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Ouchi T. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22085-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Another group reported that BARD1 stimulates the formation of both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked poly-Ub chains and that the BRCA1 autoubiquitylation by BARD1 mostly results in poly-Ub chains linked through Lys-63 (7Xia Y. Pao G.M. Chen H.W. Verma I.M. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, in studies involving a series of Ub lysine mutants, Baer and co-workers (22Wu-Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34743-34746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) recently reported that BRCA1-BARD1 catalyzes Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains in vitro. Thus, the type(s) of poly-Ub chains catalyzed by BRCA1-BARD1 has yet to be resolved unambiguously. In the present study we provide further evidence that BRCA1-BARD1 catalyzes Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chain. In addition to in vitro analyses, in vivo analyses also suggest that the autoubiquitinated form of BRCA1 can be assembled with Ub containing a single Lys residue at Lys-6. More importantly, mass spectrometric analysis identified the Lys-6-linked branched Ub fragment from poly-Ub chains produced by BRCA1-BARD1. These data strongly support the previous data reported by Baer and co-workers (22Wu-Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34743-34746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). When incubated with purified 26 S proteasome in vitro, the Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains mediated by BRCA1-BARD1 as well as Lys-48-linked chains mediated by ROC1-CUL1 disappear. Disappearance of the Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains is blocked by Ub aldehyde (Ubal), a potent inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes. In contrast, the disappearance of ROC1-CUL1-mediated Lys-48-linked chains is unaffected by the presence of Ubal. Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and LLnL do not stabilize the autoubiquitinated form of BRCA1 in vivo. Hence, the results indicate that the BRCA1-BARD1 Ub ligase catalyzes novel Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains as a signal recognized, but possibly distinctly processed, by 26 S proteasome relative to traditional Lys-48-linked poly-Ub chain. Plasmids—N-terminally tagged constructs pcDNA3-Myc-BRCA11–772, pcDNA3-HA-BARD1, pcDNA3-HA-ROC1, pcDNA3-Myc-CUL1, pET-His6-BRCA11–304, pET-His6-BARD114–189, and pET-His6-UbcH5c were described previously (5Hashizume R.

The truncated pcDNA3-Myc-BRCA1 plasmids (1–338, 1–467, 1–503, 1–519, 1–609, 1–651, and 1–679) were produced by introducing a stop codon at the appropriate site by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The full-length Ub linked with a cAMP-dependent kinase recognition site in pET-3E-His6 vector (pET-His6-PK-Ub) was described previously (5Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D.

Ub with a single Lys-Arg mutation (K6R, K11R, K29R, K48R, or K63R) was produced by single site-directed mutagenesis. The Ub mutant in which all but one Lys residue (Lys-6, Lys-11, Lys-29, Lys-48, or Lys-63) were substituted with Arg was produced by repeated Lys-Arg site-directed mutagenesis to the six Lys residues. To construct pcDNA3-HA-Ub that contained four tandem repeats of HA-Ub for efficient expression in mammalian cells (24Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), XbaI and SpeI sites were first introduced at the 5′- and 3′-end of HA-Ub, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis. The Ubs with a single Lys residue were produced as described above. After the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing, the XbaI- and SpeI-digested insert fragments were subcloned into the same plasmid with only XbaI digestion, resulting in a tandem HA-Ub repeat with single XbaI and SpeI sites at 5′ and 3′, respectively. The four-repeat HA-Ub construct was produced from the two-repeat HA-Ub construct by repeating the same XbaI-SpeI subcloning strategy. After the subcloning the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing again. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cells (293T and T47D) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic agent (Invitrogen) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. For transient expression experiments 293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. For each transfection, the total plasmid DNA was adjusted to 15 μg/100-mm dish by adding the parental pcDNA3 vector. To analyze the effect of proteasome inhibitors on autoubiquitinated BRCA1, transfected 293T cells were treated with LLnL (final concentration of 50 μm), MG132 (final concentration of 50 μm), or the same volume of Me2SO solvent (1 μl/ml of culture) for 6 h before harvesting. Immunological Techniques—Mouse monoclonal antibodies to affinity tags HA (clone 12CA5, Roche Applied Science), Myc (clone 9E10, BabCo), and FLAG (clone M2, Sigma) were purchased commercially. For immunoprecipitation, cells were harvested 36 h after transfection and lysed by incubating at 4 °C for 30 min with 0.6 ml/100-mm dish buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm NaVO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 150 μg/ml benzamidine. Lysed cells were then clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants (0.3 ml) were mixed with 3 μg of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, and then the antibody-bound proteins were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads (7.5 μl). The proteins bound to the beads were washed three times with buffer A and used in the Ub ligation assay. To immunoprecipitate in vivo autoubiquitinated BRCA1, 293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing HA-Ub, Myc-BRCA1, and BARD1 were harvested, lysed in 200 μl of preboiled 1% SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm DTT), and further boiled for an additional 10 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant (100 μl) was diluted 10 times with buffer A, and anti-Myc immunocomplexes were precipitated as described above. The precipitates were washed three times, and half of the sample was resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (1 μg/ml). For straight immunoblotting, cells were lysed and clarified as described above, and 50 μg of each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Purified Proteins—Rabbit E1 (Affiniti Research Products), CDC34, 26 S proteasome (Boston Biochem), bovine Ub, and FLAG-Ub (Sigma) were purchased commercially. His6-UbcH5c, His6-BRCA11–304, His6-BARD114–189, and His6-PK-Ub (wild type and mutants) were purified from BL21/DE3 bacteria cells with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyrano-side induction as described previously (5Hashizume R.

Ub Ligation Assay and in Vitro Degradation/Deubiquitination Assay—The procedure used for the in vitro Ub ligation assay was described previously (5Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H.

Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified His6-PK-Ub was labeled with 32P by incubating 25 μg of His6-PK-Ub with reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 25 μm ATP, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 units of cAMP-dependent kinase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min and was applied to a Micro Bio-Spin chromatography column (Bio-Rad) to exclude free [γ-32P]ATP. The 32P-labeled His6-PK-Ub (0.75 μg) was added to a Ub ligation reaction mixture (30 μl) that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5mm MgCl2,2mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mm ATP, and 0.6 mm DTT as well as 40 ng of E1, 0.3 μg of E2, and 1 μg of purified E3 (His6-tagged proteins). In some experiments E3 immunocomplexes immobilized on protein A-agarose beads as described above were used instead of the purified E3 after washing two times with buffer B containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking, and the reaction was terminated by boiling in Laemmli SDS loading buffer with a final concentration of 0.1 m DTT. Half of the sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The interaction of E2 with 32P-labeled Ub was analyzed by the same procedure without E3. One μg of bovine Ub or FLAG-Ub was used (instead of the 0.75 μgof 32P-labeled His6-PK-Ub) in the Ub ligation assay for mass spectrometric analysis or in vitro degradation/deubiquitination assay, respectively. For the in vitro degradation/deubiquitination assay, the incubated FLAG-Ub ligation reactions were terminated by adding 1 ml of cold buffer B and washed twice with the same buffer. The autoubiquitinated Myc-BRCA1- or Myc-CUL1-containing protein complex immobilized on the beads was then incubated with 30 μl of 26 S proteasome mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and the indicated amount of 26 S proteasome for 2 h. To inhibit the deubiquitinating activity of 26 S proteasome the indicated amount of Ubal (Boston Biochem) was added to the reaction. The reactions were terminated by boiling in Laemmli SDS loading buffer with a final concentration of 0.1 m DTT, and half of the sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) Analysis of Polyubiquitinated Products—Products from the in vitro Ub ligation assays were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probe) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The polyubiquitinated products were excised from the gel and digested by trypsin using an in-gel digest kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After peptide extraction, the proteolytic peptide mixture was concentrated to 5 μl by evaporation, added to 35 μl of 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to an autosampler (HTC PAL, CTC Analytics AG) for nanoscale capillary LC/MS/MS analysis. The LC/MS/MS system used was a capillary LC system (MAGIC2002, Michrom BioResources, Inc) coupled to an in-line nanoelectrospray mass spectrometer (LCQ Advantage, Thermo Finnigan) with a silica-coated glass capillary installed (PiclTip™, New Objective, Inc.). For the capillary LC system the sample was loaded in 5% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient consisted of 6.4% acetonitrile in 5 min and subsequently 6.4–76.8% acetonitrile in 45 min. The spectra were collected as MS and MS/MS scans. The MS scan defined the ion composition at an m/z range of 450–2000, and the MS/MS scan acquired the mass spectrum of the parental ion upon collision-induced dissociation. The acquired collision-induced dissociation spectra were analyzed by direct inspection using Bioworks browser software. Theoretical masses of the peptide ion were calculated using the ExPASy “Compute pI/Mw” tool at kr.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html. To calculate the theoretical masses of branching Ub fragment the C-terminal sequence of Ub (GG or LRGG) was simply added to the acceptor fragment of Ub as a linear sequence. K6R Mutation of Ub Reduces the Poly-Ub Products Mediated by BRCA1-BARD1—Ubiquitination acts on numerous biological processes in addition to proteasome-dependent proteolysis mediated by Lys-48-linked poly-Ub chain. The discovery of BRCA1-BARD1 as a Ub ligase therefore prompted us to characterize the poly-Ub chain. We have sought to determine which lysine residue(s) of Ub is required for polyubiquitination chain formation by BRCA1-BARD1. Mutant Ubs, in which the Lys residue at position 6, 11, 29, 48, or 63 was individually substituted with Arg (UbK6R, UbK11R, UbK29R, UbK48R, and UbK63R), were labeled with 32P and added to Ub ligation reactions containing ATP, E1, E2/UbcH5c, His6-BRCA1, and His6-BARD1. The poly-Ub-protein conjugates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The reaction was fully dependent on enzymes E1, E2 (data not shown) (5Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and E3 (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). The poly-Ub-protein conjugates produced by BRCA1-BARD1 (Fig. 1A, lane 3) were significantly reduced by K6R mutation of Ub (lane 4), whereas the reaction did not appear to be significantly affected by other mutations (K11R, K29R, K48R, and K63R) (lanes 5–8). The reduction of polyubiquitinated products was not due to degradation or misfolding of UbK6Rin vitro, as it interacts with UbcH5c as well as wild type and the other mutants (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, ROC1-CUL1 with CDC34 failed to catalyze polyubiquitinated product using UbK48R (Fig. 1C, lane 6), consistent with the notion that this E2-E3 mediates Lys-48-linked poly-Ub chain. This demonstrates the specificity of the in vitro Ub ligation reaction using Lys-Arg Ub mutants. BRCA1-BARD1 Preferentially Utilizes Ub with a Single Lys Residue at Lys-6 or Lys-29 —To further analyze the lysine residue of Ub required for polyubiquitination by BRCA1-BARD1, Ub mutants in which all but one Lys residue are substituted with Arg (UbLys-6, UbLys-11, UbLys-29, UbLys-48, and UbLys-63) were produced. Although the single-Lys Ubs were all less effective (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–7) compared with the wild type (lane 2) in the in vitro Ub ligation reaction, there is some preference for UbLys-6 (lane 3) and UbLys-29 (lane 5) to form slower migrating products. The less effective ligation reaction was not due to the failure of interaction of the Ub mutants with UbcH5c (Fig. 2B). Again consistent with previous reports, ROC1-CUL1 with CDC34 catalyzed dimer and trimer formation of UbLys-48 (Fig. 2C, lane 6), demonstrating the specificity of the in vitro Ub ligation reaction using the single-Lys Ubs. We next tested the single-Lys Ubs in the autoubiquitination of BRCA1 in vivo. To allow detection of autoubiquitinated BRCA1, Ub constructs containing four tandem repeats of HA-tagged Ub (HA-Ub-HA-Ub-HA-Ub-HA-Ub, described as HA-Ub) were constructed for expression in mammalian cells and co-expressed in 293T cells with Myc-BRCA11–772 and BARD1. Cells were boiled in 1% SDS containing buffer to dissociate non-covalently bound proteins. Myc-BRCA11–772 was immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc antibody after the lysate was diluted to 0.1% SDS. Ubiquitinated Myc-BRCA11–772 appears in an anti-HA Western blot as a smear that migrates slower than Myc-BRCA11–772 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The absence of Myc-BRCA11–772 (Fig. 3A, lane 1), HA-Ub (lane 2), or BARD1 (lane 4) or the use of the breast cancer-derived RING finger mutant BRCA1C61G (lane 5) abolishes the smear, consistent with it being autoubiquitinated BRCA1. To eliminate the possibility that the smear could be contaminated by polyubiquitinated products other than autoubiquitinated BRCA1, we constructed sequentially truncated Myc-BRCA1 fragments and expressed these in cells. In each case, the smears appear just above the corresponding position of each fragment (Fig. 3B), confirming that they are indeed autoubiquitinated Myc-BRCA1 products. Single Lys-HA-Ubs were then co-expressed with Myc-BRCA11–772 and BARD1. Autoubiquitinated BRCA1 products were produced when HA-UbLys-6 (Fig. 3C, top, lane 3), HA-UbLys-29 (lane 5), or both (lane 8) were co-expressed, consistent with the in vitro Ub ligation assay using the purified Ub mutants (Fig. 2A). In contrast, significantly less autoubiquitinated BRCA1 was detected when other HA-Ub mutants, HA-UbLys-11, HA-UbLys-48, or HA-UbLys-63, were co-expressed (Fig. 3C, top, lanes 4, 6, and 7). A Western blot of total cell lysates indicates that each of the single-Lys Ubs can be similarly incorporated into poly-Ub chains in vivo (Fig. 3C, bottom). This suggests that the contrast among HA-UbLys-6, HA-UbLys-29, and others in autoubiquitination of BRCA1 is not caused by different expression or the inability of the HA-Ub mutants to be incorporated into poly-Ub chains. We note that low levels of autoubiquitinated BRCA1 are also detected with HA-UbLys-11, HA-UbLys-48, or HA-UbLys-63. These products could represent small populations of BRCA1 containing poly-Ub chains linked via Lys-11, Lys-48, or Lys-63. More likely, the products may be due to poly-Ub chains generated from endogenous Ub that have their chains terminated by the incorporation of a mutant single-Lys Ub. Identification of Poly-Ub Chain Linkage by LC/MS/MS—We were concerned that the use of mutant Ub molecules could yield unnatural poly-Ub chains if, for example, elimination of the intrinsic Lys residue allows an adjacent Lys residue to be used instead. N-terminal tagging of Ub might also affect the chain formation. We therefore employed a procedure to detect the Lys residue linked in poly-Ub chains produced by BRCA1-BARD1 under more physiological conditions. Wild type untagged bovine Ub, whose sequence is identical to that of human Ub, was added to a Ub ligation reaction containing ATP, E1, UbcH5c, and BRCA1-BARD1 immunocomplex. The poly-Ub-protein conjugates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Sypro Ruby staining. The slowest migrating proteins just under the border of the stacking gel (Fig. 4A, indicated with *) were excised, digested with trypsin, and subjected to nanoscale capillary LC/MS/MS analysis. The masses for each possible branched Ub fragment, consisting of the acceptor Ub tryptic fragment linked to amino acids GG or LRGG from the C terminus of the donor Ub, were calculated, and the experimental data were searched for matches. A peptide ion with m/z 1517.83 was identified and matched with the Lys-6-linked Ub fragment missing the N-terminal Met residue (2QIFVKTLTGK conjugated with 73LRGG, where K is Lys-6), whereas peptide ions that match the other candidate branched Ub fragments were not observed. We confirmed that the recombinant bovine Ub used in the study is missing its N-terminal Met residue by LC/MS/MS analysis. The parental peptide ion was further analyzed by collision-induced dissociation spectrum (MS/MS) to confirm the peptide sequence. The fragment possesses two N termini. Therefore we calculated the theoretical m/z of the MS/MS fragment from the two straight fragments, QIFVKTLTGK and LRGGKTLTGK, each possessing one N and one C terminus, and we compared this with the experimental data (Fig. 4B). Other spikes shown in Fig. 4B included more complicated fragments as represented by QIFVGGKTLTG at m/z 1074.6 that consisted in part of a branching lesion (GG) and a part of an N-terminal lesion. The results clearly indicate that the poly-Ub chain catalyzed by BRCA1-BARD1 indeed contains Lys-6-linked Ubs. The Poly-Ub Chain Products Catalyzed by BRCA1-BARD1 Are Deubiquitinated by the 26 S Proteasome in Vitro—Because the Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chain we identified has not been characterized previously we next necessarily tested whether or not it signals degradation. We first employed an in vitro degradation assay using purified 26 S proteasome and the polyubiquitination products catalyzed by BRCA1-BARD1. Poly-Ub chains were produced by reactions containing ATP, FLAG-Ub, E1, UbcH5c, and anti-Myc immunocomplexes precipitated from lysates of 293T cells expressing Myc-BRCA11–772 and BARD1. Immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody nicely detected the polyubiquitination products after incubation for 60 min (Fig. 5A, top, lane 3). The protein complex containing polyubiquitinated products immobilized on the beads was then incubated with 26 S proteasome supplemented with MgCl2 and ATP. The polyubiquitinated products disappeared after incubation with 30 or 60 nm purified 26 S proteasome (Fig. 5A, top, lane 5 or 6, respectively), whereas incubation with buffer alone did not alter the level of polyubiquitinated products (lane 4). We blotted the same reaction with anti-Myc antibody to detect the autoubiquitinated substrate, Myc-BRCA1. Mono- and polyubiquitinated forms of Myc-BRCA1 were detected 5 and 60 min after the Ub ligation reaction, respectively (Fig. 5A, bottom, lanes 2 and 3). The majority of the non-ubiquitinated Myc-BRCA1 correspondingly disappeared as the polyubiquitinated form appeared (Fig. 5A, bottom, lane 3). Consistent with the anti-FLAG immunoblotting the autoubiquitinated Myc-BRCA1 disappeared after incubation with 26 S proteasome (Fig. 5A, bottom, lanes 5 and 6). Purified 26 S proteasomes have an intrinsic deubiquitinating activity that rapidly releases poly-Ub chains from substrates before their degradation by the 20 S proteases. To determine whether the observed disappearance of polyubiquitinated products is due to degradation or to the deubiquitinating activity in the 26 S proteasome fraction, a deubiquitination inhibitor, Ubal, was added to the reaction. The decrease in autoubiquitinated Myc-BRCA1 observed upon incubation with 30 nm 26 S proteasome (Fig. 5B, top, lane 2) was slightly inhibited or completely blocked by the presence of 1 or 10 μm Ubal, respectively (lanes 3 and 4). In contrast autoubiquitinated Myc-CUL1 that is comprised of Lys-48-linked poly-Ub chains (Fig. 1C) also disappeared upon incubation with 26 S proteasome but was unaffected by Ubal (Fig. 5B, bottom, lanes 2–4). The results suggest that the Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains mediated by BRCA1-BARD1 are deubiquitinated by 26 S proteasome, whereas Lys-48-linked polyubiquitinated substrates are degraded. The Steady State Level of Autoubiquitinated BRCA1 Is Not Affected by Proteasome Inhibitors in Vivo—We next investigated the in vivo effect of the proteasome on Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains by testing whether the steady state level of autoubiquitinated BRCA1 can be stabilized by proteasome inhibitors. Myc-BRCA11–772, BARD1, and HA-Ub (wild type or Lys-6) were co-expressed in 293T cells. Thirty h after transfection cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132, LLnL, or solvent Me2SO for 6 h. Autoubiquitinated Myc-BRCA1 was then immunoprecipitated and blotted as described above. None of these reagents affected the steady state level of Myc-BRCA1 autoubiquitinated with wild type HA-Ub (Fig. 6, lanes 1–4) or HA-UbLys-6 (lanes 5–8). This suggests that the Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chain is not a proteasomal degradation signal in vivo. The fact that deleterious missense mutations in the RING finger domain of BRCA1 found in familial breast cancer all abolish the Ub ligase activity of BRCA1-BARD1 suggests a strong connection between this activity and the tumor suppressor function of BRCA1 (5Hashizume R.

However, the manner in which the Ub ligase activity contributes to the biological functions of BRCA1 remains to be determined. There are two key types of information required to elucidate the role of the BRCA1-BARD1 Ub ligase. One is, of course, the identity of its specific substrate(s). The other is the type of poly-Ub chain built by BRCA1-BARD1 and what biological consequence it signals. The studies reported herein identify the Lys linkage of poly-Ub catalyzed by BRCA1-BARD1. Three lines of evidence demonstrate that BRCA1-BARD1 catalyzes poly-Ub chain through the Lys-6 residue of Ub. First, K6R mutation of Ub dramatically reduces the poly-Ub products mediated by BRCA1-BARD1 in vitro (Fig. 1). We note that this result is inconsistent with a previous report that Lys-48 and Lys-63 of Ub are important for the polymer formation by BRCA1-BARD1 (7Xia Y. Pao G.M. Chen H.W. Verma I.M. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). There are two clear differences between our experimental protocol and that in the earlier report that may account for the different results. (a) To preserve the native properties of Ub as much as possible, we used the conservative Lys-Arg mutation rather than the Lys-Ala substitution. Also, (b) we used a His6 affinity tag on our mutant Ubs, whereas the earlier study employed glutathione S-transferase-tagged Ubs, which will exist as dimers in solution. Second, BRCA1-BARD1 preferentially utilizes UbLys-6 or UbLys-29 to mediate autoubiquitination of BRCA1 in vivo. Third, mass spectrometry analysis identified the Lys-6-linked branched Ub fragment from poly-Ub chain produced by BRCA1-BARD1 using wild type Ub. The results clearly indicate that BRCA1-BARD1 catalyzes Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chain formation. The significance of poly-Ub chain formation catalyzed by BRCA1-BARD1 in vivo using UbLys-29 is not clear at present. BRCA1-BARD1 may catalyze heterogeneous poly-Ub chains. However, despite extensive effort, we failed to detect any branched Ub fragments other than that at Lys-6. Lys-29 may be used by the BRCA1-BARD1-E2 complex when its preferred Lys-6 side chain is not available. Whereas the roles of poly-Ub chains linked through Lys-29, Lys-48, and Lys-63 have been studied extensively, there is only limited information available on Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains. In vitro, the yeast E2, RAD6, catalyzes the addition of up to six or seven Ub molecules on histone H2B (in a reaction that does not require an E3), and the product formation is inhibited by UbK6R (27Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, in combination with rabbit reticulocyte fraction II, RAD6 appears to mediate Lys-48-linked poly-Ub-dependent proteolysis (27Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although the function of Lys-6-linked poly-Ub mediated by an E3 is yet to be determined, it has been reported that the RAD6-mediated Lys-6-linked chains can be deubiquitinated by a Ub isopeptidase in the PA700, the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome (28Lam Y.A.

The 26 S complex contains a 20 S proteasome with multiple peptidase activities functioning in proteolysis and a 19 S regulatory complex composed of multiple ATPases and components necessary for binding protein substrates (29Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). It is now known that the 19 S regulatory complex also has two different types of deubiquitinating enzyme. Rpn11, a metalloprotease subunit of the 19 S complex, removes poly-Ub chains from substrates at the proximal site of the chains, thereby allowing entry of the substrates into the 20 S complex and subsequent degradation (30Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 31Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). This activity is Ubal-insensitive. There is also a Ubal-sensitive deubiquitinating activity in the 19 S complex that disassembles poly-Ub chains from the distal end, selectively rescuing some ubiquitinated proteins from proteolysis (28Lam Y.A.

J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As such, the 26 S proteasome edits different types of Ub conjugates using the two deubiquitinating activities. The results shown in Fig. 5B clearly demonstrate that Lys-6-linked autoubiquitinated BRCA1 is distinctly edited by the 26 S proteasome in vitro, relative to a Lys-48-linked polyubiquitinated substrate that is known to be degraded. However, purified 26 S proteasome preparations do not contain all the accessory subunits that could facilitate recognition of Lys-6-linked chains for degradation. Although the Lys-6-linked chains do not accumulate by proteasome inhibitors in vivo (Fig. 6), suggesting a role for these chains that is distinct from the role of traditional Lys-48-linked chains, whether the mechanism of deubiquitination by the 26 S proteasome seen in vitro also exists in vivo remains to be shown. It is noteworthy that BRCA1 and BARD1 stabilize each other in vivo (5Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 7Xia Y. Pao G.M. Chen H.W. Verma I.M. Hunter T. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 12078-12083Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), when their autoubiquitination is enhanced. A possible explanation is that autoubiquitination of BRCA1 through Lys-6-linked chains stabilizes BRCA1, while it is also possible that formation of the BRCA1-BARD1 dimer stabilizes the complex resulting in a detectable amount of autoubiquitinated BRCA1. Interestingly the autoubiquitination of BRCA1 enhances its own Ub ligase activity (8Mallery D.L. Vandenberg C.J. Hiom K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6755-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Enhanced activity of BRCA1-BARD1 by autoubiquitination results in efficient monoubiquitination of nucleosome core histones in vitro (8Mallery D.L. Vandenberg C.J. Hiom K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6755-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Autoubiquitination of BRCA1 may have a role as a positive feedback loop by stabilizing itself. To ascertain whether Lys-6-linked polyubiquitination is a signal for protein stabilization rather than degradation, bona fide substrate(s) other than BRCA1 or BARD1 will need to be identified. Recent proteomics study of protein ubiquitination in yeast using mass spectrometry revealed that Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains exist in vivo, although they are less abundant than other types of poly-Ub chains, observed in the order Lys-48, Lys-63, Lys-11, Lys-33, and Lys-27 (35Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains are more frequently utilized in higher eukaryotes where additional complexity and levels of regulation may be needed, for example, to maintain the genomic stability using BRCA1. Because Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chains have not been widely studied to date, other Ub ligases that mediate Lys-6-linked poly-Ub chain formation, besides BRCA1-BARD1, may exist in nature. Mass spectrometry analysis combined with mutational analysis, as shown in this report, may contribute to the discovery of such ligases.

Here we demonstrate that complex formation with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is unique for cathepsin K among human papain-like cysteine proteases and that different GAGs compete for the binding to cathepsin K. GAGs predominantly expressed in bone and cartilage, such as chondroitin and keratan sulfates, enhance the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K, whereas dermatan, heparan sulfate, and heparin selectively inhibit this activity. Moreover, GAGs potently inhibit the collagenase activity of other cysteine proteases such as cathepsins L and S at 37 °C. Along this line MMP1-generated collagen fragments in the presence of GAGs are stable against further degradation at 28 °C by all cathepsins but cathepsin K, whereas thermal destabilization at 37 °C renders the fragments accessible to all cathepsins. These results suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of matrix protein degradation by GAGs. It further implies that cathepsin K represents the only lysosomal collagenolytic activity under physiologically relevant conditions.

It further implies that cathepsin K represents the only lysosomal collagenolytic activity under physiologically relevant conditions. Controlled degradation of collagen is observed in bone remodeling, wound healing, angiogenesis, and during organ development (1Lecaille F. Kaleta J. Brömme D. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4459-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 2Benjamin I.J. J. Investig. Med. 2001; 49: 381-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ortega N. Behonick D. Stickens D. Werb Z. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 995: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). On the other hand excessive collagen degradation leads to pathological phenotypes such as osteoporosis (4Yamashita D.S. Dodds R.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), various forms of arthritis (5Buttle D.J. Immunopharmacology of Joints and Connective Tissue. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 225-243Google Scholar), or aneurysms of blood vessels (6Longo G.M. Xiong W. Greiner T.C. Zhao Y. Fiotti N. Baxter B.T. J. Clin.

However, triple helical collagens, in particular type I and II collagens, are highly resistant to general proteolysis and require specific proteases for their degradation. Known mammalian collagenolytic activities include members of the matrix metalloprotease family such as MMP-1, -2, -8, -13, and -14 (8Lauer-Fields J.L. Juska D. Fields G.B. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the serine protease, human neutrophil elastase (9Kafienah W. Buttle D.J. Burnett D. Hollander A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and thiol-dependent cathepsins (1Lecaille F. Kaleta J. Brömme D. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4459-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Collagenases of the MMP family cleave triple helical collagen at a specific single site and release ¾ and ¼ fragments. Similar to MMPs, human neutrophil elastase generates ¾ fragments from type I collagen but is unable to degrade type II collagen (9Kafienah W. Buttle D.J. Burnett D. Hollander A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Lysosomal cysteine proteases such as cathepsins L and B have also been discussed as collagenolytic activities, but these data were mostly based on inhibitor experiments in cell extracts or on early preparations of cathepsins, which may not have excluded contaminating activities (10Evans P. Etherington D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 83: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Maciewicz R.A. Etherington D.J. Biochem.

Thorough enzymatic studies suggested that cathepsins B and L primarily cleave in the non-helical telopeptide extensions of collagens (14Burleigh M.C. Barrett A.J. Lazarus G.S. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 15Kirschke H. Kembhavi A.A. Bohley P. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A truly triple helical collagenase activity is found in cathepsin K, which is predominantly expressed in osteoclasts and to a lower degree in various other cell types including fibroblasts (16Brömme D.

It was demonstrated that cathepsin K, similar to the bacterial Clostridium collagenase, cleaves at multiple sites within the triple helical region of types I and II collagens (20Garnero P. Borel O. Byrjalsen I. Ferreras M. Drake F.H. McQueney M.S. Foged N.T. Delmas P.D. Delaisse J.M. J. Biol.

The biological relevance of the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K was underlined by the finding that deficiency in this protease causes the bone-sclerosing dysplasia, pycnodysostosis, in man (22Gelb B.D. Shi G.P. Chapman H.A. Desnick R.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) and an osteopetrotic phenotype in mice (23Saftig P. Wehmeyer O. Hunziker E. Jones S. Boyde A. Rommerskirch W. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13453-13458Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The microscopic phenotype of pycnodysostosis is characterized by the accumulation of undigested collagen fibrils in osteoclasts (24Everts V. Aronson D.C. Beertsen W. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1985; 37: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and other collagen-degrading cells such as fibroblasts (25Everts V. Hou W.S. Rialland X. Tigchelaar W. Saftig P. Brömme D. Gelb B.D. Beertsen W. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 73: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The accumulation of collagen fibrils in cathepsin K-deficient fibroblasts throughout the body suggests a broader role of cathepsin K in collagen turnover than previously thought and is, thus, not only limited to the osteoclast-mediated bone collagen degradation. The inhibition of cathepsin K in synovial fibroblasts, which are considered as the main cartilage-destroying cells in rheumatoid arthritis (26Firestein G.S. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 1781-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), also leads to the appearance of intralysosomal collagen fibrils (27Hou W.S. Li Z. Gordon R.E. Chan K. Klein M.J.

To better understand the collagen catabolism and its regulation, we investigated the interactions of various GAGs with physiologically relevant human cathepsins and their abilities to degrade triple helical collagens.

Enzymes—Human cathepsins K, L, and F were expressed in Pichia pastoris as described in (29Linnevers C.J. McGrath M.E. Armstrong R. Mistry F.R. Barnes M.G. Klaus J.L. Palmer J.T. Katz B.A. Brömme D.

Recombinant human cathepsin B was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Menard (Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Chondroitin-6 sulfate (C-4S), C-6S, dermatan sulfate (DS), keratan sulfate (KS), heparan sulfate (HS), and heparin were purchased from Sigma. C-4S was fractionated on a Sephadex G-75 Superfine column, and the molecular masses of the individual fractions were determined by dynamic light scattering (28Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Molar concentrations of active cathepsins K, B, L, and S were obtained by titration with E64 (32Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), and that of cathepsin F was obtained with the irreversible inhibitor, LHVS (kindly provided by Celera Corp, South San Francisco, CA) using the same method as described for E64. Human recombinant collagenase 1 (MMP-1) was cloned from human smooth muscle cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the following primer pair: 5′-CGTCATATGTTCCCAGCGACTCTAG and 5′-CGCCAGATCTTCAATTTTTCCTGCAG by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase. A 1.4-kbp PCR product was obtained and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), digested with NdeI/BglII and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of the pET16b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI)). The sequence of the final plasmid was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. BL21[DE3] cells transformed with MMP-1/pET16b were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 1 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and treated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100) and sonicated on ice. The washed pellet was resuspended in denaturing buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min by gently vortexing. After centrifugation the supernatant was applied on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid resin equilibrated with the same buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Unbound proteins were washed out with washing buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 5.9, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea). MMP-1 was eluted with elution buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.5, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea) and diluted into folding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ZnSO4, 0.05% Brij35, 2.5 mm GSSG, 2.5 mm GSH, and 20% glycerol) to a final concentration of 4 m urea. The refolding reaction was carried out at 4 °C overnight. The urea concentration was reduced to 2, 1, 0.5, and 0 m by dialysis against dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij35). Pro MMP-1 was activated by treating with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate at 37 °C for 30 min. 150 μg of purified enzyme was obtained from a 100-ml culture. Size Exclusion Chromatography—40 μg of purified recombinant human cathepsins K and L were separately preincubated with 0.1% C-4S (29.8-kDa fraction) in the elution buffer for 20 min and then applied onto a Superdex 200 column and eluted either in the presence or absence of 300 mm NaCl with 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). To determine the competitive binding of C-4S and DS to cathepsin K, the protease was incubated with 0.1% DS or with a mixture of C-4S and DS, each at 0.1% concentration for 20 min, and then separated on Sephadex 200. Protein elution was monitored at 280 nm, and cathepsin activities were assayed for the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin as previously described (17Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Labeling of Cathepsins and Complex Formation with Chondroitin Sulfate—Cathepsins K, L, B, S, and F were labeled with 125I-labeled DCG-04 as previously described (28Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). DCG-04 is an epoxide inhibitor derivative of E64 containing a tyrosine residue for iodination and a biotin moiety (33Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). 50 ng of 125I-labeled DCG-04 cathepsins were preincubated in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT in the presence or absence of 0.1% of C-4S, respectively, for 20 min and then mixed at 37 °C with non-reducing protein loading buffer and preheated agarose gel. The sample was loaded into the well of a 0.5% agarose gel and analyzed as previously described (28Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To determine potential complex formations of cathepsin K with other glycosaminoglycans, DCG-04-labeled cathepsin K was incubated in the presence of C-4S, C-6S, DS, KS, HS, or heparin and analyzed as described above. Collagen and Gelatin Digests—0.4 mg/ml type I collagen (calf skin, Calbiochem) or 0.4 mg/ml type II collagen (calf articular joints, Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with human cathepsins K, B, L, S, or F (each cathepsin at 800 nm) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2.5 mm DTT and EDTA. Collagen digestion was performed at 28 and 37 °C for 8 h in the absence and the presence of 0.15% (w/v) C-4S. Heat-denatured type I collagen (gelatin) was incubated with cathepsins (each at 2 nm) for 4 h at 28 °C. For the analysis of the effect of different GAGs on the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K, recombinant human cathepsin K (800 nm) was incubated with 0.4 mg/ml type I collagen in the presence of 0.15% C-4S, C-6S, DS, KS, HS, or heparin at 28 °C for 8 h. To study the competitive effect of GAGs on cathepsin K-catalyzed collagen degradation, 0.15% C-4S in the digest mixture was successively replaced with increasing amounts of DS, HS, or heparin to reach a final concentration of 0.15%. All digest reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μm E64 or LHVS in the case of cathepsin F. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis using 4-20% Tris/glycine gels that subsequently were stained with Coomassie Blue. Degradation of Insoluble type I Collagen and Cartilage—4 mg/ml insoluble bovine collagen of type I (Achilles tendon, Sigma) and 45 mg of finely minced bovine cartilage pieces (∼1 mg) (Animal Organ and Tissues for Research, NJ) were washed 3 times with 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and incubated with recombinant cathepsins K, L, B, S, or F (each 800 nm) in 900 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2.5 mm DTT/EDTA in the absence or the presence of 0.15% C-4S at 28 °C for 24 h. After the completion of the incubation time, 100 μl of supernatant were taken and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl. The hydroxyproline content of soluble collagen fragments was measured according to the method described by Firschein and Shill (34Firschein H.E. Shill J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and as previously described (28Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Analogous experiments were performed with cathepsin K in the presence of various glycosaminoglycans such as C-6S, DS, KS, HS, or heparin (0.15% each). For SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis analysis, predigestions of 25 mg of insoluble type I collagen with recombinant human MMP-1 (400 nm) were performed at room temperature for 2 days in 0.5 ml of 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was centrifuged, the supernatant was substituted with 2.5 mm DTT and 20 mm EDTA, and the MMP-1-digested samples were incubated with cathepsins K, L, B, S, or F (each 800 nm) at 28 or 37 °C for 8 h in the presence of 0.15% C-4S. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μm E-64 after 24 h, and aliquots of the supernatant were taken and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis using 4-20% Tris/glycine gels that subsequently were stained with Coomassie Blue. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Type I collagen was dissolved in 5 mm aqueous acetic acid at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml and clarified by centrifugation. In one set of experiments the soluble collagen sample was either analyzed directly or treated with 0.1% C-4S and analyzed. In a second set of experiments, 100 μl of the soluble collagen sample was either treated with 2 μl of enzyme buffer (50 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij35) and analyzed or treated with 2 μl of 1 nm MMP-1 (dissolved in enzyme buffer) overnight at 37 °C, stored at 4 °C for 48 h, and analyzed. CD spectra were recorded over the range λ = 190-250 nm on a Jasco J-600 using a 10-mm path length quartz cell. Thermal transition curves were obtained by recording the molar ellipticity ([Θ]) at λ = 225 nm while the temperature was continuously increased in the range of 5-80 °C at a rate of 0.2 °C/min. Temperature was controlled using a Jasco PTC-348WI temperature control unit. For samples exhibiting sigmoidal melting curves the reflection point in the transition region (first derivative) is defined as the melting temperature (Tm). Electron Microscopic Analysis of Cartilage Degradation by Cathepsins and MMP-1—Bovine cartilage disc were incubated with cathepsin K, with a mixture of cathepsins L and B, with MMP-1, or with a mixture of MMP-1 and cathepsin L and B, respectively, for 24 h at 37 °C. The cathepsin concentrations were 800 nm, and the concentration of MMP-1 was 400 nm in the assays. The digestion experiments with cathepsins were performed in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2.5 mm DTT/EDTA, whereas digestions with MMP-1 alone or consecutively with cathepsins B and L were performed in 100 mm Tris·HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing and 10 mm CaCl2. Before incubation with cathepsins B and L, the Tris buffer was exchanged with 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2.5 mm DTT/EDTA. Following the enzymatic digest, cartilage specimens were immersed in a solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde with 0.2 m sodium cacodylate at pH 7.4. After overnight fixation the fixative solution was removed and replaced with phosphate buffer followed by 1% osmium tetroxide buffered with sodium cacodylate. After 1 h the osmium was replaced with increasing concentrations of ethanol. Cartilage samples were then placed in the critical point drier where the alcohol was exchanged for liquid CO2. The CO2 was removed at the critical temperature and pressure and coated with a light coat of gold palladium. The specimen was then mounted on an aluminum stub and viewed with a S-530 Hitachi S.E. Lack of Complex Formation for Cathepsins Other Than Cathepsin K and Complex Formation of Cathepsin K with Other Physiologically Relevant Glycosaminoglycans—We have previously reported that human cathepsin K forms a high molecular mass complex in the presence of C-4S. This complex was demonstrated by gel filtration and in a gel mobility shift assay (28Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that complex formation is unique for cathepsin K among closely related lysosomal cysteine proteases. Fig. 1 shows the absence of complex formation for cathepsins B, L, S, and F in the presence of C-4S (using the gel mobility shift assay, panel A) and the lack of a high molecular weight component in the gel filtration assay as demonstrated for cathepsin L (panel B). Cathepsin L activity eluted from the Superdex 200 column with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa irrespective of whether C-4S was present or absent in the preincubation mixture. In contrast, cathepsin K eluted with a molecular mass of 310 kDa when preincubated with C-4S (29.8 kDa) and as a 25-kDa protein in the absence of C-4S (panel B). Although the complex formation between cathepsin K and C-4S seems to be unique among cysteine proteases, C-4S is not the only GAG capable of binding to cathepsin K. In addition to C-4S, cathepsin K binds to a variety of GAGs such as C-6S, DS, KS, HS, and heparin (Fig. 1C). In contrast, none of these polysaccharides binds to cathepsin L (data not shown). Degradation of Type I and II Collagens by Lysosomal Cathepsins in the Presence or Absence of C-4S—Type I and II collagens were incubated at 28 °C and at a body temperature of 37 °C in the presence or absence of C-4S with cathepsins K, B, L, S, and F (Fig. 2). As previously shown (35Li Z. Hou W.S. Brömme D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K is dramatically enhanced in the presence of C-4S. The complete degradation of both types of collagen at 37 °C by cathepsin K in the apparent absence of C-4S is due to contamination with GAGs in commercially available collagen preparations as previously demonstrated. The addition of 0.3 m NaCl, which prevents the formation of cathepsin K/C-4S complexes, also prevents the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K at body temperature (28Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Brömme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Contrary to cathepsin K, recombinant human cathepsins B and F did not reveal any detectable collagenase activities at both temperatures in the presence or the absence of C-4S. The relative amount of the β and γ bands did not significantly change in the presence of both enzymes, suggesting only a weak, if any telopeptide-cleaving activity. However, cathepsins S and L displayed weak to moderate triple-helical collagenolytic activities at 28 °C and a strong collagenolytic activity at 37 °C in the absence of C-4S, suggesting a different cleavage mechanism. Surprisingly, the addition of C-4S to the digest mixture strongly suppressed the collagenolytic activity of both enzymes even at 37 °C. This reveals that individual GAGs can have opposite effects on the collagen-cleaving capability of closely related cysteine proteases, i.e. the activation of cathepsin K activity and the inactivation of cathepsins S and L activities, and thus, suggesting a specific mode of protease regulation. The collagenase activity of cathepsin K in the presence of C-4S and the inhibition of the collagenase activities of cathepsins L and S was also reflected in degradation assays using insoluble type I collagen and cartilage (containing mostly type II collagen) (Fig. 3). The release of hydroxyproline-containing peptides from insoluble type I collagen into the supernatant of the reaction mixture increased more than 10-fold for cathepsin K in the presence of C-4S, whereas the activities of cathepsins L and S decreased 10 and 5 times, respectively. Similar to the activities toward soluble collagens, the activities of cathepsin B and F were negligible for insoluble collagen and not affected by the absence or presence of C-4S. Type II collagen in cartilage was exclusively degraded by cathepsin K with only a small increase of activity in the presence of C-4S. This can be attributed to the high concentration of GAGs, in particular chondroitin sulfates in the cartilage matrix. It should be noted that cathepsins could release up to 2.5 mg/ml GAGs from cartilage (data not shown). The major source of chondroitin sulfate is aggrecan, an abundant proteoglycan in cartilage. The inhibitory effect of cartilage-resident chondroitin sulfate on other cathepsins is reflected by the low activities of cathepsins L and S irrespective of the addition of exogenous C-4S. The hydroxyproline-releasing activities of both enzymes are similarly as low as those of the non-collagenolytic cathepsins B and F. Surprisingly, recombinant human cathepsin B did not show any collagenase activity in our experiments either in the absence or the presence of GAGs nor at 37 °C, which is in contradiction to older reports (11Maciewicz R.A. Etherington D.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Burleigh M.C. Barrett A.J. Lazarus G.S. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Because previously enzyme preparations from tissues were used, it can be speculated that they contained small but sufficient contaminations of cathepsins L or K, accounting for the observed collagenase activities. On the other hand, the degradation of denatured type I collagen (gelatin) by any of the cathepsins tested was not affected by the presence of C-4S, suggesting that C-4S does not block or otherwise influence the catalytic site of the proteases (Fig. 4). Consecutive Degradation of Type I and II Collagen with MMP-1 and Cathepsins—Collagenases of the matrix metalloproteinase family have been implicated in the extracellular degradation of triple helical collagens at neutral pH. Here, we investigated whether MMP-1-mediated predigestion of type I and II collagens permits the further degradation by lysosomal cathepsins at acidic pH in the presence of C-4S. MMP-1 cleaves both types of collagen at a single peptide bond within the appropriate α-chains and releases so-called ¾ and ¼ fragments. These fragments are only degraded by cathepsin K at 28 °C, whereas all other cathepsins tested were unable to further cleave these fragments in the presence of C-4S at this temperature (Fig. 5; data shown only for type I collagen). However, at 37 °C all cathepsins were capable of hydrolyzing the fragments in the presence of C-4S, indicating that the triple helical structure of the collagen fragments is sufficiently destabilized to allow complete degradation (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained using cartil"
https://openalex.org/W2114936261,"Cell migration is essential throughout embryonic and adult life. In numerous cell systems, the small GTPase Rac is required for lamellipodia formation at the leading edge and movement ability. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to Rac activation during migration are still unclear. Recently, a mammalian superfamily of proteins related to the prototype member Dock180 has been identified with homologues in <i>Drosophila</i> and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Here, we addressed the role of Dock180 and ELMO1 proteins, which function as a complex to mediate Rac activation, in mammalian cell migration. Using mutants of Dock180 and ELMO1 in a Transwell assay as well as transgenic rescue of a <i>C. elegans</i> mutant lacking CED-5 (Dock180 homologue), we identified specific regions of Dock180 and ELMO1 required for migration <i>in vitro</i> and in a whole animal model. In both systems, the Dock180·ELMO1 complex formation and the ability to activate Rac were required. We also found that ELMO1 regulated multiple Dock180 superfamily members to promote migration. Interestingly, deletion mutants of ELMO1 missing their first 531 or first 330 amino acids that can still bind and cooperate with Dock180 in Rac activation failed to promote migration, which correlated with the inability to localize to lamellipodia. This finding suggests that Rac activation by the ELMO·Dock180 complex at discrete intracellular locations mediated by the N-terminal 330 amino acids of ELMO1 rather than generalized Rac activation plays a role in cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2014609759,"Spindle disassembly at the end of mitosis is a complex and poorly understood process. Here, we report that the AAA-ATPase Cdc48/p97 and its adapters Ufd1-Npl4, which have a well-established role in membrane functions, also regulate spindle disassembly by modulating microtubule dynamics and bundling at the end of mitosis. In the absence of p97-Ufd1-Npl4 function, microtubules in Xenopus egg extracts remain as monopolar spindles attached to condensed chromosomes after Cdc2 kinase activity has returned to the interphase level. Consequently, interphase microtubule arrays and nuclei are not established. Genetic analyses of Cdc48, the yeast homolog of p97, reveal that Cdc48 is also required for disassembly of mitotic spindles after execution of the mitotic exit pathway. Furthermore, Cdc48/p97-Ufd1-Npl4 directly binds to spindle assembly factors and regulates their interaction with microtubules at the end of mitosis. Therefore, Cdc48/p97-Ufd1-Npl4 is an essential chaperone that regulates transformation of the microtubule structure as cells reenter interphase."

As PER and CRY cytoplasmic levels rise, they can translocate back to the nucleus, and negatively regulate their own transcription by directly interacting with CLOCK:BMAL1 or NPAS2:BMAL1 heterodimers (9Shearman L.P.

Thereafter, nuclear levels of the PER/CRY complex decline, relieving repression on the bHLH-PAS heterodimer and restarting the cycle with a period of ∼24 h.

Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and sonicated using a Misonix Sonicator 3000 for four 15-s bursts at setting 4 for cells or eight 40-s bursts at setting 4 for tissue: this results in DNA being fragmented to sizes of 500-1000 base pairs. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using a range of antibodies: anti-acetyl Histone 3 (acetylated lysine residues 9, 14, 18, and 23), anti-acetyl Histone 4 (acetylated lysine residues 5, 8, 12, and 16) from Upstate Biotechnology and anti-Pol II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which recognizes the N terminus of the large subunit of human RNA polymerase II. ChIP assays were also performed in the absence of antibody or the presence of anti-hemagglutinin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to control for nonspecific interactions. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7000, PE Applied Biosystems). RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells and mouse heart tissue using RNAqueous (Ambion) and TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA (400 ng) was used in a reverse transcription (RT) reaction (Applied Biosystems Reverse Transcription Kit). The resulting cDNA (40 ng) for each time interval was subjected to quantitative Real Time PCR. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Primers for RNA and ChIP analysis were designed by PRIMER EXPRESS 1.0 (PE Applied Biosystems) to amplify 50-150-bp amplicons and the DNA intercalating SyBr green reagent (Applied Biosystems) was used for detection of all products. The relative differences among the intervals following serum induction for ChIP and RNA expression were calculated using the ΔΔCT method as described (Applied Biosystems User Bulletin 2). A ΔCT value was calculated for GAPDH to account for differences in starting material for RNA expression and a ΔCT for the ChIP total input control to normalize for variation in the amount of starting material. Primer sequences: hPer 1 promoter, 5′-CTTCAATTGTCCGCATCCTT-3′ and 3′-TCAAATCCTGGGAGAGGACAGT-5′; mPer1 promoter, 5′-GCTGACTGAGCGGTGTCTGA-3′ and 3′-AAGGATCTCTTCCTGGCATCTG-5′; hPer1, 5′-TCCATTCGGGTTACGAAGCT-3′ and 3′-GCAGCCCTTTCATCCACATC-5′; hPer2, 5′-AGGGTGCGCTCGTTTGAA-3′ and 3′-GGCGGAAATTCCGCGTAT-5′; mPer1, 5′-TCGAAACCAGGACACCTTCTCT-3′ and 3′-GGGCACCCCGAAACACA-5′; mPer2, 5′- GCTCGCCATCCACAAGAAG-3′ and 3′-GCGGAATCGAATGGGAGAATA-5′; mClock, 5′-CGGCGAGAACTTGGCATT-3′ and 3′-AGGAGTTGGGCTGTGATCA-5′; mNpas2, 5′-TCCATGCTCCCTGGTAACACT-3′ and 3′- TCTGCAAGAATCCGATGACCTT-5′; mBmal1, 5′-CACTGTCCCAGGCATTCCA-3′ and 3′-TTCCTCCGCGATCATTCG-5′; mCry2 5′-CCATTATGAAGATGGCCAAGGA-3′ and 3′- CTGCCCATTCAGTTCGATGATT-5′; Rev-erba 5′-CCGGACTGTGCAGGAGATCT-3′ and 3′- CACCTGGTCGTGCTGAGAAAG-5′. In Vitro Interaction Assays—35[S]methionine-labeled BMAL1, CLOCK, NPAS2, ACTR, CBP, p300, and PCAF were synthesized by Promega (TnT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems), run on SDS-PAGE gel, and expression analyzed by phosphorimager. 35[S]methionine-labeled BMAL1, CLOCK, and NPAS2 were incubated with recombinant FLAG-tagged p300 and PCAF, and immunoprecipitated with or without anti-p300 and anti-PCAF antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with Rabbit IgG as a control for co-immunoprecipitation assays. GST-NPAS2 was synthesized using the pGEX4T vector (Amersham Biosciences) and used in GST pull-down assays as described (8McNamara P. Seo S.B. Rudic R.D. Sehgal A. Chakravarti D. FitzGerald G.A.

GST alone and GST-NPAS2 were run on a 12% Coomassie-stained SDS gel, and equal amounts were determined for pull-down experiments. Equal amounts of GST-NPAS2 and GST were incubated with 35[S]methionine-labeled ACTR, CBP, p300, and PCAF for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively and analyzed by phosphorimager. CBP and NPAS2 were subcloned into the GAL4DBD and VP16 vectors respectively for cell-based assays. CV-1 cells were transfected with the pMH100TKLuc reporter along with combinations of GAL4, GAL4NPAS2, VP16, and VP16CBP. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activity (Turner Design) Histone Acetyltransferase Assays—GST-NPAS2 was incubated with recombinant FLAG tagged p300 or CBP, and beads were washed extensively. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) assays were performed on the beads using commercially available purified histones (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 14[C]acetyl-CoA (32Chakravarti D.

Acetylated histone H3 and histone H4 were analyzed by phosphorimager. Transfection Studies—NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected as described (31Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) with the E-box reporter construct pGL3M34Luc, pRLSV40 along with combinations of NPAS2, BMAL1, CLOCK, p300, CBP, PCAF, INHAT, E1A, TWIST, and CRY2 where indicated. The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by addition of empty pCDNA3 vector. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activity by luminometer (Turner Design) Immunofluorescence—Quiescent HVSMC were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Cells were incubated with CLOCK or NPAS2 antibodies (Alpha Diagnostic and Affinity Bioreagents) and p300 (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies and were incubated with a corresponding fluorescein isothiocyanate and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody, following repeated washing. Cells were again washed and mounted on cover slips, and fluorescence was detected by confocal laser microscopy. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Intact HeLa cells were incubated with the cross-linker DSP (Pierce Biotechnology) 3 mm for 30 min and lysed in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described (31Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) with equal concentrations of protein and probed with anti-p300, anti-CBP (Upstate), and anti-PCAF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Frozen whole mouse hearts were pulverized and protein extracted using lysis buffer A. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as detailed above. Rhythmic Changes in Chromatin Remodeling on the Per1 Promoter—The hPer1 gene contains 5 consensus E-box sequences (CACGTG), the strict consensus motif for heterodimeric bHLH-PAS CLOCK:BMAL1 binding. These occur within 4 kb of the hPer1 gene promoter and each of which has been shown to contribute to the regulation of Per1 expression (33Hida A. Koike N. Hirose M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Tei H. Genomics. 2000; 65: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast, the hPer2 gene does not contain any such sequences within 1.6 kb of the promoter (34Travnickova-Bendova Z. Cermakian N. Reppert S.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7728-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Changes in mRNA levels of hPer1 and hPer2 in HeLa cells following serum induction were observed to exhibit a circadian expression pattern. Per1 levels reached a trough at T6 and then entered a cyclical expression pattern, peaking at T24 and at T48. Per2 levels, by contrast, remained high at T6, reached a measured trough at T12 exhibiting further peaks at approximately T18 and T42 (Fig. 1A). ChIP assays were performed on serum induced HeLa cells using primers that bracket the second most proximal E-box to exon 1 in the hPer1 promoter (Fig. 1B). Histone H3 acetylation peaked at T42, while histone H4 acetylation peaked at T24 and T48 which coincides with the peaks of hPer1 mRNA expression. Although we did not observe a peak in histone H3 acetylation in the first 24 h post-serum induction, the peak of histone H3 acetylation at T42 precedes that of maximum mRNA expression of hPer1 at T48. This is in agreement with our in vivo results (see below). A sharp increase in unphosphorylated Pol II recruitment was also observed at T24 (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with the temporal recruitment of enzymes with HAT activity to the promoter of clock-controlled genes activating circadian gene expression. In Vitro Association of Core Clock Proteins and HAT Co-activator Proteins—Other members of the bHLH-PAS family interact with coactivator proteins, such as p300/CBP (35Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kobayashi A. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This prompted investigation of whether p300/CBP, PCAF, or ACTR could interact specifically with CLOCK, BMAL1, or NPAS2. A modest interaction was observed between all three bHLH-PAS proteins and p300 (Fig. 1C, panel I), while PCAF was observed to associate preferentially with NPAS2 and, to a lesser extent, with CLOCK (Fig. 1C, panel I). Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-rabbit IgG in the presence of CLOCK and PCAF was used as an additional control (Fig. 1C, panel II). Importantly, and in agreement with the in vitro immunoprecipitation experiments, in vitro binding assays showed formation of complexes between ACTR, p300/CBP, and PCAF and the GST-NPAS2 glutathione-Sepharose affinity matrices, (Fig. 1D). This interaction was specific since a complex was not formed between GST-NPAS2 and TAFIβ, one of the subunits of the INHAT complex (31Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both p300 and PCAF bound to GST-NPAS2 still retained functional HAT activity, as detected by acetylated histone H3 and histone H4. This activity is comparable to that of unbound p300 or PCAF (Fig. 1E, panel I). The identity of p300 or PCAF bound to GST NPAS2 was also verified by Western blotting (Fig. 1E, panel II). Interaction of CLOCK Proteins with Coactivators in Intact Cells—The temporal colocalization of the endogenous proteins in primary cultures of human vascular smooth cells (HVSMC) was subsequently investigated. Immunofluorescent analysis of HVSMC by confocal microscopy revealed that CLOCK and p300 both exhibit predominantly nuclear localization, while NPAS2 is evident both in the nucleus and in the perinuclear cytoplasm in untreated quiescent cells (Fig. 2A). Overlay analysis of HVSMC immunostained with either anti-CLOCK or anti-NPAS2, together with anti-p300, produced discrete speckles of colocalization within the nucleus. This was more apparent for NPAS2 and p300 than for CLOCK and p300 (Fig. 2A). In addition, a Gal4BD fusion of NPAS2 and a VP16 fusion of CBP used in mammalian two-hybrid assays confirmed their association in intact cells, consistent with the GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 2B). The association of endogenous coactivators to clock proteins was then investigated in intact cells. CLOCK and NPAS2, immunoprecipitated from quiescent HeLa cell lysates, were probed for the presence of the coactivator p300, CBP, and PCAF. p300 co-precipitated with CLOCK and, to a lesser extent, NPAS2 (Fig. 2C). However, CBP was only detected from immunoprecipitated CLOCK and not NPAS2 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, PCAF selectively coprecipitated with only NPAS2 in these cells (Fig. 2C). Given the precedent with CLOCK and p300 in the liver (27Etchegaray J.P. Lee C. Wade P.A. Reppert S.M. Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the NPAS:p300 interaction might exhibit temporal regulation. HeLa cells were serum shocked and lysates taken at intervals following treatment. They were immunoprecipitated with NPAS2 and the immune complexes were probed for p300. Though only a modest association between NPAS2 and p300 was observed in quiescent cells (Fig. 2C), a robust and dynamic interaction occurred in synchronized cells (Fig. 2D, panel I). The interaction between NPAS2 and p300 decreased at T16 and T18 compared with T0 (Fig. 2D, panel III). This trough was followed by a significant increase, at T20 and T24, which corresponded with maximum RNA levels of Per1 and Per2 (Fig. 1A). A low level of interaction was again evident at T36, synchronous with a fall in Per1 and Per2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2D, panel III). All data was normalized to β-actin (Fig. 2D, panel II). The observation that serum-induced cells display a rhythm in histone acetylation surrounding the Per1 promoter and that NPAS2 associates in a time-dependent manner with histone acetyltransferases at a time of maximum transcriptional activity is consistent with regulation of the circadian feedback loop. Transcriptional Activity of NPAS2/CLOCK:BMAL1 Is Modulated by Acetylation—The association of the clock bHLH-PAS proteins with the HATs, p300/CBP, PCAF and ACTR, is consistent with a role for targeted coactivator recruitment and chromatin remodeling in the temporal regulation of circadian gene activation in the mammalian feedback loop. This hypothesis was addressed by analyzing the effect of overexpression of the HAT-coactivators on E-box-induced gene transcription in intact cells. Both NPAS2:BMAL1 and CLOCK:BMAL1 activated transcription via an E-box-dependent mechanism (10Gekakis N. Staknis D. Nguyen H.B. Davis F.C. Wilsbacher L.D. King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Weitz C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Importantly, and consistent with previous interaction specificity assays, over expression of CBP and PCAF markedly enhanced NPAS2- and CLOCK-mediated luciferase reporter gene activation (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, coactivation of E-box-dependent transcription was maximally enhanced when CBP and PCAF were co-expressed (Fig. 3, A and B). Cotransfection of deletion mutants of NPAS2, NPAS2Δ322 and NPAS2Δ425, decreased the transactivation of BMAL1 by full-length NPAS2, indicating a direct effect of the coactivators on the transcription factor complex (Fig. 3C, panel II). Both of these mutants lack the LXXLL motif (Fig. 3C, panel I), which is present in nuclear receptor cofactors and in the ligand binding domains (LBDs) of some nuclear receptors, and is necessary for their interactions (37Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both recruitment of specific coactivators to the clock complex and HAT-dependent activation are critical features of CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1-mediated E-box activation. Furthermore, the histone acetylation regulatory proteins, E1A and Twist (32Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), can all repress basal E-box activation of NPAS2:BMAL1 (Fig. 3D), providing further evidence for underlying HAT-dependent regulation of these circadian transcriptional co-regulators. Analyses of Chromatin Remodeling and Coactivator Recruitment in Vivo—Real time PCR was used to examine mRNA expression profiles of Npas2, Bmal1, Clock, Per (1Panda S. Hogenesch J.B. Kay S.A.

Physiol. 2001; 63: 647-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), Cry1, and Rev-erbα within cardiac tissue. This was obtained from Balb/c mice, which had been maintained in constant darkness. Hearts were harvested at 4-h intervals, over a 48-h period (Fig. 4A). Npas2 and Bmal1 cycled in the same phase, peaking at approximately ct1 and again at approximately ct29 (Fig. 4A, panel I). Clock expression does not cycle robustly throughout the daily period (Fig. 4A, panel I), as previously reported (9Shearman L.P. Sriram S. Weaver D.R. Maywood E.S. Chaves I. Zheng B. Kume K.

Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In addition, Rev-erbα mRNA oscillation was antiphase to that of Bmal1 mRNA (Fig. 4A, panel II). This is in agreement with the finding that REV-ERBα can repress Bmal1 expression through binding to the ROR response elements in the promoter of Bmal1 (16Nicolas Preitner F.D. Luis-Lopez-Molina Joszef Zakany Denis Duboule Urs Albrecht Ueli Schibler Cell. 2002; 110: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Both Per1 and Per2 cycled rhythmically and in phase with each other, but antiphase to the genes, which drive their oscillatory expression, Bmal1, Npas2, and Clock (Fig. 4A, panel III). ChIP assays were performed on whole mouse heart homogenates taken at ct 6, 18, and 32 and analyzed using primers that bracket the most proximal E-box to exon 1 in the mPer1 promoter (Fig. 4B). Consistent with previous observations (27Etchegaray J.P. Lee C. Wade P.A. Reppert S.M. Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), time-dependent histone H3 acetylation, was observed on the proximal E-box, preceding the Per1 rhythm (Fig. 4A, panel III). This is in agreement with the in vitro data from serum induced HeLa cells, where the peak in histone H3 acetylation at T42 preceded Per1 maximum expression at T48 (Fig. 1B). Immunoprecipitations using anti-rabbit IgG was used to determine nonspecific interactions of NPAS2 in whole mouse heart homogenates (Fig. 4C, panel I). Anti-NPAS2 immunoprecipitates showed significant temporal changes in both association and disassociation of p300 bound to NPAS2 (Fig. 4C, panel II). Interestingly, association was increased at T6 and T32 correlating with the rise of Per1 mRNA and the increase in histone H3 acetylation levels on the E-box surrounding its promoter (Fig. 4A, panel III and Fig. 4B). In addition to regulating Per1, CLOCK and BMAL1 have been shown also to drive rhythmically Cry expression (10Gekakis N. Staknis D. Nguyen H.B. Davis F.C. Wilsbacher L.D. King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Weitz C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 15Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M.

Cell. 1999; 96: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The observation that NPAS2-p300 association also increases at T20, preceding peak Cry expression (Fig. 4A, panel II), is consistent with a pervasive role for HAT-dependent mechanisms in regulating clock gene expression. Finally, using E-box reporter transactivation studies, we observe CRY2 mediated repression on basal NPAS2 and CLOCK-mediated luciferase reporter gene activation (Fig. 4D). Importantly, overexpression of CBP was partially able to relieve this repression, indicating that modulation of histone acetylation may be the target of CRY mediated E-box repression (Fig. 4D). Acetylation of core histones on target promoters has been closely linked to transcriptional gene activation (22Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In the present study, the coincidence of a rhythm in histone H3 and histone H4 acetylation on the proximal E-box of hPer1 with transcriptional activation of per1 and per2 is consistent with the heterodimeric complexes of CLOCK, NPAS2 and BMAL1 recruiting a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-containing transcriptional co-activation complex to achieve maximal target gene activation. We considered p300, CBP, PCAF, and ACTR as potential circadian coactivators, all of which are known to possess acetyltransferase activity (40Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar, 41Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Other known members of the bHLH-PAS family, such as HIF-1α and the AHR:AHRNT heterodimer, utilize p300/CBP to augment gene transcription (35Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kobayashi A. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated an interaction between both CLOCK and NPAS2 with p300, CBP, PCAF, and ACTR by in vitro interaction assays. Importantly, this interaction does not constrain the enzymatic activity of p300 and PCAF, allowing them freely to acetylate core histones. The interactions of CLOCK and NPAS2 with p300, CBP, and PCAF were also observed in resting cells. Indeed, the binding of CBP to CLOCK and of PCAF to NPAS2, raises the possibility of selective association of proteins to elements of the clock transcription complex in a manner which might relate to tissue type and/or activation stimulus. Thus, p300 interacts in a time-dependent manner with NPAS2 under synchronized conditions. Increased association was observed at the time of maximal RNA expression, suggesting that temporal coactivator recruitment is a necessary step in driving circadian rhythmicity. This association is dramatically reduced at T12 and T36 corresponding with Cry2 mediated repression of Per1 and Per2. This finding agrees with the model proposed by Etchegaray et al. (27Etchegaray J.P. Lee C. Wade P.A. Reppert S.M. Nature. 2003; 421: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) that Cry proteins may disrupt the Clock associated transcriptional coactivator complex. Cell-based luciferase assays using an E-box reporter revealed that the transcriptional activity of CLOCK:BMAL1 and NPAS2:BMAL1 heterodimers is enhanced in the presence of CBP and PCAF and a further increase in activity occurs when CBP and PCAF are co-expressed together. CBP and PCAF are known to act cooperatively to enhance transcriptional activity of both FKLF2 (43Song C.Z. Keller K. Murata K. Asano H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7029-7036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and IFN-β, the latter one of the best characterized transcriptional switches in eukaryotic cells (44Munshi N. Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G. Thanos D. Science. 2001; 293: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In the present studies, basal E-box activation was sensitive to inhibition by enzymes and complexes, which are known to inhibit or block HAT activity or function, highlighting the importance of HAT activity in regulating circadian gene expression. A time-dependent recruitment of chromatin remodeling machinery by NPAS2 was also observed in vivo. Increased association of NPAS2 with p300 resulted in marked acetylation of N-terminal lysine residues on histone H3 surrounding the proximal E-box on the Per1 promoter in mouse heart homogenates, which was synchronous with circadian variability in its mRNA levels. The mechanism by which the cryptochrome proteins potently inhibit CLOCK/NPAS2:BMAL1-mediated transcription is presently unclear (15Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 193-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of CBP was partially able to relieve this repression, indicating that modulation of histone acetylation may be the target of CRY-mediated E-box repression (Fig. 4D). Targeted histone acetylation surrounds the proximal E-boxes on the Per1 promoter, causing localized chromatin remodeling and enhanced assembly of the basal transcription machinery. This regulates circadian gene expression in the cardiovascular system. Periodic recruitment of p300 to NPAS2 facilitates time-dependent chromatin remodeling and CRY2-mediated repression is induced by disruption of HAT-associated complexes on core clock heterodimers. These studies provide insight into the regulation of circadian rhythms in the cardiovascular system and elucidate further the fundamental role of chromatin remodeling in mammalian circadian biology.

We report nuclear expression as a characteristic of these receptors, including a nuclear localization for the apelin receptor in brain and cerebellum-derived D283 Med cells and the AT1 and bradykinin B2 receptors in HEK-293T cells. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed the apelin receptor with localization in neuronal nuclei in cerebellum and hypothalamus, exhibiting expression in neuronal cytoplasm or in both nuclei and cytoplasm.

The apelin receptor was discovered as an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR(s), G protein-coupled receptor(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; IR, immunoreactivity; MEM, minimal essential medium; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. known as APJ, sharing highest identity with the angiotensin II AT1 receptor, although no binding to the receptor was observed with angiotensin II (1O'Dowd B.F.

The apelin peptide was subsequently discovered as the endogenous ligand for this receptor (2Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C.

At least two isoforms of the apelin peptide are known to exist, apelin-36 and apelin-13, both of which act as agonists of the apelin receptor with distinct pharmacological properties (2Tatemoto K.

Overall, the apelinergic system is most closely related to the angiotensin and bradykinin systems, as observed through peptide and receptor structural and sequence similarities, expression patterns, and physiology (6Lee D.K. Cheng R. Nguyen T. Fan T. Kariyawasam A.P. Liu Y. Osmond D.H. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 20AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Apelin, angiotensin II, and bradykinin all have blood pressure-modulating effects, expression in cardiovascular tissue, and are cleaved by the human endothelial angiotensin I-converting enzymes (21Vickers C. Hales P. Kaushik V. Dick L. Gavin J. Tang J. Godbout K. Parsons T. Baronas E. Hsieh F. Acton S. Patane M. Nichols A. Tummino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14838-14843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Recently, the AT1 receptor was found to form a heterodimer with the bradykinin B2 receptor, with consequent alterations in G protein activation and internalization (20AbdAlla S. Lother H. Quitterer U. Nature. 2000; 407: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Thus, there is considerable evidence to support the notion that the apelin, angiotensin and bradykinin receptors make up a subfamily of GPCRs with shared ligand and receptor characteristics. To date, there have been many reports of the intracellular localization and trafficking of GPCRs both in vivo and in vitro (22Kallal L. Benovic J.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 175-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol.

Whereas GPCRs have been best characterized as cell-surface mediators of signal transudation, there are few reports of GPCRs capable of nuclear translocation. In the large family I rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs, the AT1 receptor has been best characterized to have nuclear localization. Early studies revealed angiotensin II-binding sites were present in nuclei with angiotensin II-induced transcription of renin and angiotensinogen mRNA (25Eggena P. Zhu J.H. Clegg K. Barrett J.D. Hypertension. 1993; 22: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the nuclear localization of the AT1 receptor was reported to be induced by angiotensin II (26Chen R. Mukhin Y.V. Garnovskaya M.N. Thielen T.E. Iijima Y. Huang C. Raymond J.R. Ullian M.E. Paul R.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F440-F448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lu D. Yang H. Shaw G. Raizada M.K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a family II GPCR, the parathyroid hormone receptor, was observed to localize to the nucleus both in tissues and cultured cells (28Watson P.H. Fraher L.J. Natale B.V. Kisiel M. Hendy G.N. Hodsman A.B. Bone (NY). 2000; 26: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and a recent study observed a family III GPCR, the metabotropic glutamate mGluR5 receptor, in nuclear membranes (29O'Malley K.L. Jong Y.J. Gonchar Y. Burkhalter A. Romano C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28210-28219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The prostaglandin EP1 (30Bhattacharya M.

Villeneuve L.R. Rousseau E. Allen B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29153-29163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) described the endothelin ETA and ETB receptors to be localized in the nuclear membrane, with ETB receptors present in the interior of the nucleus as well. In the present study we report for the first time a nuclear localization of the apelin receptor in brain. Following our observations of immunocytochemical detection of apelin receptors in cell nuclei, we carried out experiments involving immunoblot analyses of subcellular fractionated cells and confocal microscopy of cells to verify the nuclear distribution. Previously, the AT1 receptor was reported to traffic to cell nuclei by the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence (27Lu D. Yang H. Shaw G. Raizada M.K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of a similar sequence in the closely related B2 receptor suggested comparable nuclear localization of this receptor. In addition, the presence of an NLS-like sequence in an alternate position in the apelin receptor suggested distinctive patterns of nuclear localization of the apelin receptor compared with the AT1 receptor. We have utilized confocal microscopy analyses to (i) compare subcellular distributions of the apelin, AT1, and B2 receptors in various cell lines and (ii) to confirm the identity of the apelin receptor NLS sequence using a site-directed mutagenesis strategy. Together, our results provide evidence of an additional commonality between the apelin, AT1, and B2 receptors which is that of nuclear expression due to the presence of NLS motifs. Construction of cDNA Encoding Apelin, AT1, and B2 Receptors—DNA encoding the human and rat apelin receptors were obtained as described previously (1O'Dowd B.F. Heiber M. Chan A. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C.

Osmond D.H. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding AT1 receptor was a gift from Dr. Sylvain Meloche (University of Montreal, Montreal, Québec, Canada). The cDNA encoding the B2 receptor was a gift from Dr. Fred Hess (Merck). The cDNA encoding monomeric red fluorescent protein mRFP1 was a gift from Dr. Roger Tsien (University of California, San Diego). The cDNA encoding arrestin1-GFP was a gift from Dr. Stephen Ferguson (University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada). The stop codons of cDNAs encoding the human apelin, angiotensin II AT1, bradykinin B2, and dopamine D1 receptors were modified to contain BamHI or KpnI sites by PCR amplification from vectors containing these full-length coding regions. These fragments were subsequently cloned in-frame into the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or the mRFP-1 vector. For epitope-tagged human and rat apelin receptors, a C9 epitope tag sequence (encoding the nine carboxyl-terminal amino acids of rhodopsin) was inserted just prior to the stop codons by PCR mutagenesis. Cell Culture and Transfection of Cells—COS-7 monkey kidney, human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T), and human cerebellum D283 Med cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained as monolayer cultures at 37 °C. COS-7 and HEK-293T cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) and the D283 Med cells in MEM with 2 mm l-glutamine, Earle's balanced salt solution with 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. COS-7 and HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with cDNA by the use of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen), whereas D283 Med cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Confocal Microscopy—For the live cell βarrestin1 activation assay, HEK-293T cells were transfected with DNA encoding βarrestin1-GFP and GRK2 with or without DNA encoding the apelin receptor-mRFP constructs for 48 h. 10 μm apelin-13 was administered to these cells, and confocal images were taken every minute. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with a nuclear marker, DsRed2-Nuc (BD Biosciences Clontech), and either the apelin receptor-GFP, AT1 receptor-GFP, or B2 receptor-GFP construct for 48 h. D283 Med cells were transfected with either apelin receptor-GFP, apelin receptor (K242Q)-GFP, AT1 receptor-GFP, or the dopamine D1 receptor-GFP. Live cell confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. Cell counts for nuclear localization were obtained from at least 100 and 250 cells for D283 Med cells and HEK-293T, respectively. Images were acquired and processed with Zeiss LSM Image Browser software. Membrane Preparation—COS-7 cells were washed extensively with PBS. P2 pellets were prepared by Polytron disruption in ice-cold 5:2 lysis buffer (containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA buffer, containing 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) as described previously (33Ng G.Y. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Chung H.T. Brann M.R. Seeman P. George S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—Cell fractionation of D283 Med cells was performed by a modified method of the previously reported hypotonic/Nonidet P-40 lysis (34Gobeil Jr., F. Dumont I. Marrache A.M. Vazquez-Tello A. Bernier S.G. Abran D. Hou X. Beauchamp M.H. Quiniou C. Bouayad A. Choufani S. Bhattacharya M. Molotchnikoff S. Ribeiro-Da-Silva A. Varma D.R. Bkaily G. Chemtob S. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, washed and pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), homogenized by several short bursts of low-force Polytron disruption on ice, and then centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and nuclei pellets were separated for recovery of P2 and nuclear fractions, respectively. The supernatant was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to collect the P2 fraction. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, layered over a discontinuous sucrose gradient of 4.5 ml of 2.0 and 1.6 m sucrose containing 1 mm MgCl2, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The morphological integrity and purity of the samples were assessed by light microscopy after cresyl violet staining and with a plasma membrane marker 5′-nucleotidase assay kit (Sigma). Protein levels were determined by the Bradford assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Nuclear fractionation of unfixed human cerebellum tissue of a control 22-year-old Caucasian male (Brain and Tissue Banks for Developmental Disorders, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD) was performed by a modified version of the Gorski method (35Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 g of cerebellum tissue was minced in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing sodium fluoride (10 mm), sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml antipain, chymostatin, pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. Samples were homogenized on ice using a motor-driven Teflon-glass homogenizer (5 strokes), diluted to 75 ml with homogenization buffer, and layered over cushions of homogenization buffer. These samples were then centrifuged at 76,000 × g for 30 min at -2 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of nuclear lysis buffer, left on ice for 30 min, gently homogenized (5 strokes), and lysed further for 30 min. The sample was further diluted to yield ∼0.5 mg/ml DNA concentration (determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm), and 0.1 times the total volume of 4.0 m (NH4)2SO4 was added dropwise. The sample was gently shaken for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 1hat0 °C. 0.3 g of (NH4)2SO4 was added per ml of supernatant, shaken for 1 h on ice, centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 25 min at 0 °C, and pellets stored overnight at 4 °C. Sample purity and protein levels were determined as for D283 Med cells. Immunoblot Analyses—Nuclear fractions were treated with DNase and RNase (0.5 μg/μl each, Marligen Biosciences, Inc., Ijamsville, MD) for 20 min at 37 °C. The protein samples were solubilized in sample buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.003% bromphenol blue, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were subjected to PAGE with 12% acrylamide gels and electroblotted onto PVDF transfer membrane as described previously (33Ng G.Y. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Chung H.T. Brann M.R. Seeman P. George S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Apelin receptor immunoreactivity (IR) was revealed with a mouse monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (catalogue number MAB856, R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). This antibody was raised using membrane-embedded apelin receptors (36Puffer B.A. Sharron M. Coughlan C.M. Baribaud F. McManus C.M. Lee B. David J. Price K. Horuk R. Tsang M. Doms R.W. Virology. 2000; 276: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Initial experiments with this antibody were made possible by a generous gift from Dr. Robert W. Doms (University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA). C9 epitope-tagged receptor-IR was detected with the 1D4 antibody (National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN). In addition, immunoblot analyses to test the purity of the subcellular fractionated samples were performed using antibodies specific for nucleoporin p62 (nuclear fraction, number N43620), annexin II (plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles, number A14020), and GM130 (Golgi apparatus, number G65120) from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Immunocytochemistry—Fixed cerebellum and hypothalamic samples from the same human individual used in the subcellular fractionation immunoblot analysis as well as samples from an additional human individual (Brain and Tissue Banks for Developmental Disorders) were cut on a cryostat 32 μm thick and mounted on gelatin-coated slides for immunocytochemical analysis as reported previously (37Lanca A.J. Wu P.H. Jung B. Liu J.F. Ng V. Kalant H. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, fixed brain sections were pre-treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed for 10 min in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 1% normal goat serum in PBS and 0.3% Triton X-100. The sections were washed (2 times for 10 min) in PBS/Triton X-100 and incubated with the apelin receptor antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 48 h at 4 °C. The sections were then washed (2 times for 10 min) in PBS/Triton X-100 and processed with the avidin-biotin complex method (Vectastain Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Some of the previously immunostained sections were subsequently stained with cresyl violet (Nissl staining). Sections were dehydrated and mounted in Permount mounting medium via xylenes, viewed under a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and photographed with Kodak ASA-160 film. Control experiments were also performed by using rat versus human cerebellum tissue or by the exclusion of primary antibody. Nuclear Localization of the Apelin Receptor in Human Brain—The similarities between the apelin, angiotensin, and bradykinin systems are observed from the shared sequence identities between their respective receptors and ligands, expression distribution, and roles in comparable physiological functions. Our studies observed levels of sequence identity between the apelin and angiotensin receptors (1O'Dowd B.F. Heiber M. Chan A. Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Kennedy J.L. Shi X. Petronis A. George S.R. Nguyen T. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), as well as structural similarities between the apelin and angiotensin II peptides (6Lee D.K. Cheng R. Nguyen T. Fan T. Kariyawasam A.P. Liu Y. Osmond D.H. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). We also reported comparable expression distribution patterns between the two systems, particularly in the choroid plexus, hippocampus, and hypothalamus in the brain and associated roles in the modulation of blood pressure and water consumption behavior (6Lee D.K. Cheng R. Nguyen T. Fan T. Kariyawasam A.P. Liu Y. Osmond D.H. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In this study, we continued to characterize the apelinergic system by investigating the distribution of the receptor. By using a specific antibody for the human apelin receptor (36Puffer B.A. Sharron M. Coughlan C.M. Baribaud F. McManus C.M. Lee B. David J. Price K. Horuk R. Tsang M. Doms R.W. Virology. 2000; 276: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), apelin receptor IR was observed abundantly in the cerebellum and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (Fig. 1). Apelin receptor distributions were performed on these two regions as they were determined previously (6Lee D.K. Cheng R. Nguyen T. Fan T. Kariyawasam A.P. Liu Y. Osmond D.H. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) to express high levels of apelin receptor mRNA. Virtually all neuronal cell nuclei in the granular layer of the cerebellum was densely labeled by the apelin receptor antibody, with abundant levels also observed in the cellular nuclei of the molecular layer (Fig. 1A). Purkinje cells displayed apelin receptor-IR in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Cerebellar sections labeled for apelin receptor-IR (brown stain) were subsequently Nissl-stained with cresyl violet (purple stain), which confirmed the dense nuclear localization of the apelin receptor in the granular layer and demonstrated a heterogeneous population of nuclei with some nuclei negative for apelin receptor-IR in the molecular layer (Fig. 1B). In addition, some neurons had an exclusive cytoplasmic distribution of apelin receptor-IR, as seen in large pyramidal cells (Fig. 1C). In the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, there were two populations of apelin receptor-IR neurons, smaller neurons (parvocellular) with dense labeling in the nucleus and larger neurons (magnocellular) with labeling in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). Control sections of human cerebellum processed without the apelin receptor antibody (Fig. 1E) or from rat cerebellum processed with both apelin receptor and secondary antibodies (Fig. 1F) were absent of immunoreactive signals. These results revealed specificity of the unique nuclear expression of the apelin receptor between different cell types in human brain. The specificity of the apelin receptor antibody was verified. DNA encoding the human or rat apelin receptors or empty vector DNA was transfected into COS-7 cells. Immunoblot analyses of P2 membrane fractions revealed specific bands in cells expressing the human apelin receptor, correlating to an expected molecular mass of ∼42 kDa for the unglycosylated, monomeric receptor as well as bands of higher molecular mass consistent with glycosylated, monomeric (∼45 kDa (36Puffer B.A. Sharron M. Coughlan C.M. Baribaud F. McManus C.M. Lee B. David J. Price K. Horuk R. Tsang M. Doms R.W.

Apelin receptor-specific bands were not detected in COS-7 cells expressing the rat apelin receptor, indicating the antibody to be species-specific despite the receptors having a high degree of sequence similarity (>90%). To confirm expression of rat apelin receptors, human and rat apelin receptors were fused with a rhodopsin-derived C9 epitope tag at their carboxyl-terminal ends and detected by immunoblot analyses using the 1D4 antibody. Immunoblot analyses of P2 membrane fractions revealed specific bands in cells expressing either the human or rat apelin receptors correlating to the unglycosylated (42 kDa) and glycosylated (∼45 kDa) monomers and dimers (80–90 kDa) (Fig. 2B), confirming that the apelin receptor antibody was highly specific for the human apelin receptor.

The fast removal of H2O2 by antioxidant enzymes is able to generate a gradient if H2O2 is produced in a different compartment from that containing the enzymes (Antunes, F., and Cadenas, E. (2000) FEBS Lett. 475, 121-126). In this work, we extended these studies and tested whether an active regulation of biomembranes permeability characteristics is part of the cell response to oxidative stress. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we showed that: (a) H2O2 gradients across the plasma membrane are formed upon exposure to external H2O2; (b) there is a correlation between the magnitude of the gradients and the resistance to H2O2;(c) there is not a correlation between the intracellular capacity to remove H2O2 and the resistance to H2O2; (d) the plasma membrane permeability to H2O2 decreases by a factor of two upon acquisition of resistance to this agent by pre-exposing cells either to nonlethal doses of H2O2 or to cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis; and (e) erg3Δ and erg6Δ mutants, which have impaired ergosterol biosynthesis pathways, show higher plasma membrane permeability to H2O2 and are more sensitive to H2O2. Altogether, the regulation of the plasma membrane permeability to H2O2 emerged as a new mechanism by which cells respond and adapt to H2O2. The consequences of the results to cellular redox compartmentalization and to the origin and evolution of the eukaryotic cell are discussed.

The consequences of the results to cellular redox compartmentalization and to the origin and evolution of the eukaryotic cell are discussed. In general, the first cellular defense against exogenous toxic agents is the plasma membrane, which limits the influx of these agents into cells. For lipophilic agents that cross the plasma membrane, the cells evolved exporting mechanisms to expel the agent, and acquired drug resistance is often associated with the expression of drug efflux pumps such as the P-glycoprotein and the multidrug resistance protein (1Larsen A.K. Escargueil A.E. Skladanowski A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Concerning H2O2, the most abundant cellular reactive oxygen species, it is widely believed that this agent crosses biomembranes freely, and so mechanisms that impose an extracellular/intracellular gradient for this species have been ignored so far, being implicitly assumed that such gradient does not occur.However, in extracellular fluids concentrations up to 100 μm H2O2 have been reported (2Halliwell B. Clement M.V. Long L.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), whereas the intracellular H2O2 concentration is estimated in the range 0.01-0.1 μm (3Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar, 4Antunes F. Salvador A. Marinho H.S. Alves R. Pinto R.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 917-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), implying the existence of an outside/inside gradient. Supporting this, we showed that H2O2 does not permeate biomembranes freely in a human cell line and that upon exposure to external H2O2 the intracellular consumption of H2O2 catalyzed by antioxidant enzymes is able to generate a gradient of H2O2 across the plasma membrane, resulting in a lower H2O2 concentration in the intracellular milieu (5Antunes F. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). These results were later confirmed in an Escherichia coli strain by others (6Costa S.L. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7182-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Furthermore, if an extracellular/intracellular gradient is not formed, the intracellular enzymes are not able to protect individual cells against H2O2, and it was shown in an E. coli strain that does not show a gradient that the increase in catalase activity only protects high density or colonial E. coli and does not protect low density or individual E. coli (7Ma M. Eaton J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7924-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Further supporting the importance of the plasma membrane is the observation that after a nonlethal dose of H2O2, the levels of mRNA that are more repressed are those corresponding to the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (8Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). This is the rate-limiting enzyme of the synthesis of sterols, which are key components of the plasma membrane controlling its fluidity (9Mukhopadhyay K. Kohli A. Prasad R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3695-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and consequently the permeability of this membrane to a species like H2O2 (10Mathai J.C. Sitaramam V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11784-11793Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).The possibility that the plasma membrane protects cells against external H2O2 is important because, in most cases, oxidative stress is expected to occur as a result of cells being exposed to an exogenous source of H2O2 (2Halliwell B. Clement M.V. Long L.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) such as that produced from environmental factors (i.e. redox-cycling agents and radiation) in unicellular organisms or inflammation and injury responses, which in humans are associated with the etiology of several vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, neuronal disorders, and ischemia reperfusion injury (11Lum H. Roebuck K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C719-C741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, intracellular production of H2O2 is expected to have mainly a regulatory role (12Stone J.R. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15621-15628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (e.g. regulation of cell proliferation (13Pani G. Colavitti R. Bedogni B. Anzevino R. Borrello S. Galeotti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38891-38899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)), although in some pathological situations, like aging, high levels of oxidative stress may be expected to be generated endogenously (14Brunk U.T. Terman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1996-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar).In this work, we tested the hypothesis that the plasma membrane is a key cellular site protecting cells against external H2O2. If the hypothesis is correct, then the adaptation to H2O2, i.e. the induction of resistance to a high level (usually lethal) of H2O2 by a preliminary low (adaptive) dose of H2O2, could involve alterations in the plasma membrane permeability to H2O2. Therefore, we carried out rigorous kinetic studies on the adaptation to H2O2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) 1The abbreviation used is: Sc, S. cerevisiae. 1The abbreviation used is: Sc, S. cerevisiae. cells growing in exponential phase, a well known model for adaptation to oxidative stress (15Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). We further investigated the susceptibility to H2O2 in two mutant Sc strains with impaired ergosterol biosynthesis, which show higher membrane permeability to lipophilic agents. We concluded that the plasma membrane is important in the protection against H2O2 and that its properties are subjected to regulation leading to a decrease of the permeability coefficient to H2O2 during adaptation to this agent.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sc strains used in this work are Y00000 (wild type, genotype BY4741 MATa; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0), Y02667 (erg3Δ, isogenic to BY4741 with YLR056w::kanMX4), Y00568 (erg6Δ, isogenic to BY4741 with YML008c::kanMX4), and Y04718 (ctt1Δ, isogenic to BY4741 with YGR088w::kanMX4), and they were obtained from EUROSCARF (Frankfurt, Germany).Yeast extract, bactopeptone, yeast nitrogen base, and agar were from Difco (Detroit, MI). Glucose oxidase (Aspergillus niger) and digitonin were from Aldrich. Bovine liver catalase, lyticase (Arthrobacter luteus), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and cytochrome c were from Sigma. Hydrogen peroxide was obtained from Merck, pyruvate was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), and NADH was from Roche Applied Science.Media and Growth Conditions—Sc cells were inoculated at an A600 of 0.05 and cultured in synthetic complete medium (6.8% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.002% (w/v) arginine, 0,002% (w/v) methionine, 0.003% (w/v) tyrosine, 0.003% (w/v) isoleucine, 0.003% (w/v) lysine, 0.005% (w/v) phenylalanine, 0.01% (w/v) glutamic acid, 0.015% (w/v) valine, 0.01% (w/v) aspartic acid, 0.0025% (w/v) adenine, 0.04% (w/v) serine, 0.01% (w/v) leucine, 0.005% (w/v) tryptophan, 0.01% (w/v) histidine, 0.02% (w/v) threonine, and 0.0025% (w/v) uracil) at 30 °C with shaking at 160 rpm. For all experiments, the cells in the exponential phase were harvested at A600 = 0.5 (1 A600 = 2-3 × 107 cells).Cell Permeabilization—Cell membrane permeabilization was achieved by incubating cells with 0.01% (w/v) digitonin dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, for 5 min at 30 °C with shaking. Permeabilization was checked by means of lactate dehydrogenase activity measurement, according to Ref. 16Vassault A. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1983: 118-126Google Scholar.Preparation of Spheroplasts—Spheroplasts were obtained by treating cells for 30 min at 30 °C with lyticase (40 units/ml) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 m sorbitol, 6.8% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, and 2% (w/v) glucose. Spheroplast formation was checked by following the decrease of absorption at 660 nm, according to Ref. 17Ovalle R. Lim S.T. Holder B. Jue C.K. Moore C.W. Lipke P.N. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar.Exposure to and Measurement of H2O2 and Cell Survival—The cells were exposed to steady state hydrogen peroxide concentrations in synthetic complete medium at 30 °C and with shaking at 160 rpm, using glucose oxidase as described in Ref. 18Antunes F. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar. In brief, steady state levels of H2O2 were obtained by adding an initial amount of H2O2 together with some glucose oxidase that, by forming H2O2, compensated for the consumption of H2O2 by the cells. The consumption of H2O2 in Sc cells shows first order decay kinetics with a rate constant of 0.059 min-1 A600-1 (see “Results”). By balancing the initial additions of H2O2 and glucose oxidase, a steady state concentration range of 0.15-1 mm was generated.To establish the sublethal hydrogen peroxide dose, the cells were exposed to steady state concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (150-400 μm), up to 90 min at 30 °C and with shaking at 160 rpm. Cell survival was monitored by taking samples at 30-min intervals, diluting them, and plating aliquots on YPD plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bactopeptone, 2% (w/v) glucose with 2% (w/v) agar) and counting colonies after 48-72 h. The sublethal dose was defined as the dose that induced about 10% loss in cell viability when compared with control (150 μm under our conditions).H2O2 was measured as O2 release with an oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments Ltd., Norfolk, UK) following the addition of catalase (18Antunes F. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Glucose oxidase activity was measured by following O2 consumption with the oxygen electrode.Enzyme Activities and H2O2 Consumption—Crude extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis as described in Ref. 19Cyrne L. Martins L. Fernandes L. Marinho H.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Determinations of total protein were done according to Peterson (20Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7089) Google Scholar). H2O2 catabolism in Sc cells has some differences when compared with higher eukaryotes, namely: two catalases are present, the cytosolic catalase T encoded by the gene CTT1 and the peroxisomal catalase A encoded by the gene CTA1 (15Jamieson D.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar); in the mitochondrial intermembrane space a cytochrome c peroxidase, encoded by the gene CCP1, uses cytochrome c to reduce H2O2 (21Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the glutathione peroxidases are phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidases (encoded by the genes GPX1, GPX2, and GPX3) and do not have selenium in the active center (22Avery A.M. Avery S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33730-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We focused in catalase and cytochrome c peroxidase activities because these are the most important enzymes in the H2O2 catabolism for SC cells growing in exponential phase (23Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).Cytochrome c peroxidase activity was measured in protein extracts by following spectrophotometrically the oxidation of cytochrome c at 550 nm (ϵ550 = 29 mm-1 cm-1) at 25 °C for 4 min by adding 50 μm H2O2 (24Yonetani T. Ray G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4503-4508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ferrocytochrome c was prepared as described in Ref. 24Yonetani T. Ray G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4503-4508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. One unit is defined as the quantity of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of cytochrome c/min at 25 °C and pH 7.4. Catalase activity in protein extracts was measured spectrophotometrically by following H2O2 consumption (initial concentration, 10 mm) at 240 nm at 25 °C for 2 min according to Ref. 25Aebi H.E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1983: 273-284Google Scholar.The assays performed to measure H2O2 consumption rate, either overall or only catalase-driven, were as follows: (a) For catalase activity in situ, H2O2 consumption (initial concentration, 100 μm) by permeabilized cells suspended in the permeabilization buffer at 30 °C was followed using the oxygen electrode. This assay can also be considered a measurement of the overall H2O2 consumption rate in permeabilized cells because catalase is the only active enzyme (see below). (b) For catalase activity in intact cells, the activity should be called apparent because it is partially limited by the plasma membrane, being thus lower than the real activity (see “Results”). A similar approach to the first assay was used with the following alterations: no digitonin was added to the buffer, and the cells were incubated with 150 μm H2O2 for 15 min before starting the measurements of H2O2 consumption, to oxidize internal pools of reducing equivalents. (c) For overall H2O2 consumption rate in intact cells, the rate was measured as in the second assay, but with cells suspended in synthetic complete medium (instead of buffer), and measurements were started immediately after adding 100 μm H2O2.Because in the ctt1Δ strain no activity was detected with either the first or second approach but an H2O2 consumption rate was observed with the third assay, the first and second assays measured only cytosolic catalase activity, whereas in the third assay other enzymes were also active. Therefore, under our experimental conditions peroxisomal catalase did not represent an important H2O2 removing activity. The reason why enzymes other than catalase were not active in the first and second assays is probably the rapid depletion of internal pools of reducing equivalents necessary for these enzymes because of either the plasma membrane permeabilization (in the first assay) or the exposure to a 15-min preoxidation period with H2O2 (in the second assay). After being oxidized, they cannot be reduced back because of the lack of carbon sources in the buffer. In the third assay, the pools of reducing equivalents can be maintained in a quasi steady state, because incubation is done with intact cells in the presence of carbon sources.In all cases, H2O2 concentrations were plotted semi-logarithmically against time, and catalase activity (or H2O2 consumption) was calculated as the slope of the linear fitting (i.e. as a first order rate constant).Determination of Cellular H2O2 Gradient—The gradient generated by catalase was determined using the principle of enzyme latency (see “Results”). The ratio between apparent catalase activity in intact cells and catalase activity in permeabilized cells was used.Statistical Analysis—The results presented are the means ± S.D. of independent experiments. Data statistical analysis was undertaken using either a two-tailed Student t test for comparison between means of two different groups or by using analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test for comparison of more than two different groups.RESULTSAdaptation to H2O2 Does Not Increase H2O2 Removal—Fig. 1A shows that a 150 μm steady state H2O2 concentration triggered an adaptation in Sc cells. In accordance with the data in the literature (23Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), during this adaptation there were approximate 2- and 3-fold increases in two antioxidant enzymes activities, catalase and cytochrome c peroxidase, respectively (Table I). These enzymes are accountable for the removal of H2O2 in the cell (23Izawa S. Inoue Y. Kimura A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and so it could be expected that their induction increases the capacity of Sc cells to remove H2O2. Surprisingly, this was not observed (Fig. 1B), and the pseudo-first order rate constant describing the consumption of H2O2 by Sc was similar in control and adapted cells (Table I). Therefore, contrary to what is widely believed, an increased removal of external H2O2 is not part of the mechanism leading to resistance to external H2O2 in Sc.Table IUpon adaptation of Sc cells to H2O2, intracellular H2O2 removal enzyme activities increase, but the overall H2O2 consumption rate in intact living cells remains constant Catalase and cytochrome c peroxidase activities in cell extracts and the kinetics of H2O2 removal in living cells were measured in control and in Sc cells pre-exposed to a H2O2 steady state of 150 μm for 90 min.Control cellsAdapted cellsCatalase activity in protein extracts (min-1 mg-1 ml)0.66 ± 0.141.40 ± 0.09ap < 0.0001; n = 6Cytochrome c peroxidase activity (milliunits mg-1)0.64 ± 0.082.00 ± 0.17ap < 0.0001; n = 6H2O2 consumption rate constant in intact cells (min-1 A600-1)0.059 ± 0.0090.062 ± 0.012a p < 0.0001; n = 6 Open table in a new tab H2O2 Does Not Diffuse Freely into Sc Cells—One possible explanation for the lack of increase in H2O2 consumption rate constant by Sc H2O2-adapted cells is that H2O2 does not freely diffuse into Sc cells, because of a permeability barrier either at the level of the plasma membrane or the cell wall. If this is the case, then the overall H2O2 consumption rate in Sc cells is not only determined by the intracellular capacity to remove H2O2, but it is also dependent on the permeability of Sc cells to H2O2.To test the hypothesis that the diffusion of H2O2 into Sc cells limits the overall H2O2 consumption rate, the role of both the cell wall and the plasma membrane as barriers to the diffusion of H2O2 were studied. Firstly, spheroplasts (i.e. cells with removed cell wall) from H2O2-adapted and control cells were obtained. Despite the increased catalase and cytochrome c peroxidase activities in spheroplasts produced from adapted cells, the H2O2 consumption rate consumption was similar in spheroplasts produced from control and from adapted cells (not shown). Therefore, the cell wall does not limit H2O2 diffusion into Sc cells, as could be expected because the cell wall has pores that are permeable to low molecular weight molecules (26Klis F.M. Mol P. Hellingwerf K. Brul S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 239-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation is also consistent with the fact that Sc cell susceptibility to H2O2 is not altered by deleting genes ECM25, ECM33, and YOR275c, which are involved in cell wall integrity (27Higgins V.J. Alic N. Thorpe G.W. Breitenbach M. Larsson V. Dawes I.W. Yeast. 2002; 19: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Next, the hypothetical role of the plasma membrane in limiting the diffusion of H2O2 was analyzed by selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with a low dose of digitonin. The H2O2 consumption rate constant in digitoninpermeabilized adapted cells (0.097 ± 0.009 min-1 A600-1, n = 5) was ∼2-fold higher than in permeabilized control cells (0.048 ± 0.004 min-1 A600-1, n = 8). Therefore, it can be concluded that in fact the diffusion of H2O2 across the plasma membrane limits, at least partially, the overall H2O2 consumption rate in Sc cells.H2O2 Gradients Are Higher in H2O2-adapted Sc than in Control Sc Cells—According to the principle of enzyme latency, a direct consequence of the limited diffusion of H2O2 across the plasma membrane is the formation of gradients between the extracellular and the intracellular milieu when cells are exposed to external H2O2 (5Antunes F. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), i.e. the intracellular concentration is lower than the extracellular concentration. This principle states that an enzyme entrapped in a compartment shows a lower activity than when it is free in solution because of the permeability barrier made up by the compartment that limits the diffusion of the substrate to the enzyme (28De Duve C. Harvey Lect. Ser. 1965; 59: 48-87Google Scholar), and from it Equation 1 is derived (28De Duve C. Harvey Lect. Ser. 1965; 59: 48-87Google Scholar, 29Nicholls P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 99: 286-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), [H2O2]in[H2O2]out=kpermkperm+kcatabolism=R(Eq. 1) in which kperm and kcatabolism refer to the first order rate constants for the permeation of H2O2 across the plasma membrane and to the intracellular catabolism of H2O2, respectively, and R refers to the ratio between the overall H2O2 consumption rate constant in intact cells over the consumption rate constant in permeabilized cells.Despite its simplicity, three important biological implications can be obtained from the analysis of Equation 1: (a) If kperm >> kcatabolism, then [H2O2]in = [H2O2]out, i.e. there is no gradient; but if kperm is limiting the consumption of H2O2 (either partially or totally), as observed in Sc cells, a H2O2 gradient is formed. (b) If kcatabolism increases, the gradient is also increased; so we can expect that in H2O2-adapted Sc cells, which showed an increase in the activities of catalase and cytochrome c peroxidase (Table I), there is a gradient that is larger than in control cells. 3) The determination of this gradient can be based on the experimental measurement of R (5Antunes F. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), which is very helpful because a direct measurement of H2O2 inside the cells is not available.To determine R, the overall H2O2 consumption rate constants both in intact cells and in permeabilized cells have to be measured. Experimentally, it was difficult to measure the overall rate of consumption of H2O2 in disrupted cells because after a short period where a rapid and changing consumption rate was observed, the rate of consumption decreased and then remained constant (not shown). Catalase is responsible for this constant rate because this consumption was not observed in the ctt1Δ mutant (not shown). Therefore, only the gradient generated by the action of catalase could be measured accurately. In this case, Equation 1 is transformed in Equation 2, [H2O2]in[H2O2]out=kpermkperm+kcatalase=Rcatalase(Eq. 2) where kcatalase refers to the first order rate constant describing the intracellular consumption of H2O2 by catalase (i.e. catalase activity) and Rcatalase refers to the ratio between the apparent activity of catalase in intact cells and the activity in permeabilized cells. Because kcatalase < kcatabolism, the gradient caused by catalase is lower than the gradient when all antioxidant enzymes removing H2O2 are active, but it is a good indication for relative values of the overall gradient when comparing different cells.As can be seen in Table II, the gradient is significantly higher in H2O2-adapted Sc cells than in control cells. Therefore, when exposed to the same external H2O2 concentration, adapted cells will endure a lower intracellular H2O2 concentration than control cells. Thus, the increase in catalase and cytochrome c peroxidase activities does not cause a higher rate of H2O2 disposal but the formation of a steeper gradient of H2O2 across the plasma membrane.Table IIThe H2O2 gradient across the plasma membrane and the permeability constant are changed upon adaptation to H2O2 in Sc cells Adaptation to H2O2 is as in Table I (5 ≤ n ≤ 9).Control cellsAdapted cellsApparent catalase activity in intact cells (min-1 A600-1)0.030 ± 0.0030.033 ± 0.005Catalase activity in permeabilized cells (min-1 A600-1)0.048 ± 0.0040.097 ± 0.009ap < 0.0001RcatbRcat, the gradient established by the activity of catalase.

If the existence of this permeability barrier is important to provide protection against H2O2, it could be expected that during H2O2 adaptation changes in the plasma membrane occur to decrease H2O2 diffusion into the cell. To test this hypothesis we used Equation 2 to calculate kperm in control and H2O2-adapted cells (Table II). kperm in H2O2-adapted cells decreased ∼2-fold when compared with control cells, indicating that H2O2-adapted cells are less permeable to H2O2.Therefore, in addition to the well known increase in antioxidant enzyme activities during H2O2 adaptation, we showed for the first time that in Sc cells, plasma membrane properties are altered, making it less permeable to H2O2 and thus protecting Sc cells against H2O2. Two important biological consequences of the combined effect of increased catalase and cytochrome c peroxidase activities and decreased plasma membrane permeability to H2O2 are: (a) a significant increase in the gradient between extracellular and intracellular H2O2 during adaptation to H2O2, because kcatabolism is increased and kperm is decreased in Equation 1 and (b) unaltered H2O2 overall consumption rate in adapted cells, because the increased intracellular capacity for H2O2 removal is compensated by the decreased diffusion of H2O2 into the cell, as observed experimentally (Table I).Cycloheximide Causes H2O2 Adaptation and Decreases Plasma Membrane Permeability to H2O2 in Sc Cells—If the decrease in the plasma membrane permeability to H2O2 is an important regulatory response during adaptation to H2O2, then other agents that induce resistance to H2O2 could also decrease cell permeability to H2O2. Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, increases Sc cells resistance to H2O2 (30Collinson L.P. Dawes I.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Go"

Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are candidates to control ENaC surface expression, but it is not known which of these proteins contributes to ENaC regulation in epithelia. To address this question, we used RNA interference to selectively reduce expression of Nedd4 or Nedd4-2. We found that endogenous Nedd4-2, but not Nedd4, negatively regulates ENaC in two epithelial cell lines (Fischer rat thyroid and H441); small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Nedd4-2 increased amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (compared with control siRNA), but Nedd4 siRNA did not. A mutation associated with Liddle's syndrome (βR566X) abolished the effect of Nedd4-2 siRNA, suggesting that a defect in ENaC regulation by Nedd4-2 contributes to the pathogenesis of this inherited form of hypertension. Previous work found that Nedd4-2 is phosphorylated by serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase, a Ser/Thr kinase induced by steroid hormones.

Consistent with this model, ENaC stimulation by dexamethasone was reduced by Nedd4-2 siRNA and by overexpression of a mutant Nedd4-2 lacking serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase phosphorylation sites.

However, an important limitation is that previous studies tested the effect of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 overexpression. Although both have the potential to inhibit ENaC, a key unanswered question is, which of these ubiquitin-protein ligases is a physiological regulator of ENaC? ENaC surface expression is also regulated by steroid hormones; mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids increase epithelial Na+ absorption primarily by increasing ENaC expression at the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 15Stockand J.D.

This suggests the possibility that steroid hormones regulate Na+ transport in part through negative regulation of Nedd4-2. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 contribute to ENaC regulation in epithelia. Our strategy was to deplete cells of these proteins using RNA interference and to disrupt their function using a mutant construct. Our first goal was to distinguish the relative contribution of endogenous Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 to ENaC regulation under basal conditions and to test whether this regulation is disrupted in Liddle's syndrome. Our second goal was to test the hypothesis that Nedd4-2 is part of a signaling pathway that links steroid hormones to ENaC. RNA and cDNA Constructs—Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were generated (Qiagen-Xeragon) against Nedd4 (5′-TAGAGCCTGGCTGGGTTGTTTTG-3′) and Nedd4-2 (5′-AACCACAACACAAAGTCACAG-3′). These sequences correspond to human nucleotide positions 503-525 and 1103-1125, respectively. We chose sequences that are identical in human and rat but do not match other sequences in GenBank™. We tested additional siRNAs against Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 that did not decrease protein levels. As a negative control, we generated an siRNA against green fluorescent protein (GFP, 5′-GCACAAGCTGGAGTACAACTACA-3′). Human α-, β-, and γ-ENaC (22McDonald F.J. Snyder P.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Welsh M.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) were cloned as described previously and subcloned into pMT3. Nedd4-GFP and Nedd4-2-GFP fusion constructs were generated by cloning Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 in-frame to the C terminus of GFP in pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Nedd4-2S/T-A was generated by mutating Ser221, Thr246, and Ser327 simultaneously to alanine (QuikChange, Stratagene). SGKK127M was generated as described by Snyder et al. (16Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells were seeded onto permeable filter supports (Millicell PCF, 0.4 μm pore size, 12 mm diameter) and maintained in F-12 Coon's medium (Sigma) with 5% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, as described previously (24Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). One day after seeding, cells were cotransfected with siRNA and cDNAs encoding Nedd4, Nedd4-2, Nedd4-GFP, Nedd4-2-GFP, or α-, β-, and γ-ENaC. In experiments where Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 cDNA was varied, total DNA was kept constant with GFP cDNA (expression of GFP did not alter ENaC Na+ currents). siRNA (0.5 ng/μl) and cDNA (5 ng/μl) were mixed with TFX 50 (Promega, 40 ng/μl) in 200 μl/Millicell serum-free F-12 Coon's medium for 15 min and then transferred to the apical surface of the monolayer. One h later, the apical solution was supplemented with 200 μl of F-12 Coon's medium containing fetal calf serum (final concentration 5%). After 24 h, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 18 h and then in serum-free medium with or without dexamethasone (100 nm) for 6 h. H441 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown on permeable filter supports in RPMI 1640 medium with 8.5% fetal calf serum, 20 mml-glutamine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C. The cells were transfected 1 day after seeding (as described above) with 5 ng/μl siRNA and 40 ng/μl TFX 50; ∼80% of the cells were transfected as determined by flow cytometry using a fluorescein-labeled siRNA. For fluorescence microscopy studies, the cells were cotransfected with 1.7 ng/μl cDNA encoding Nedd4-GFP or Nedd4-2-GFP cDNA. Dexamethasone was withdrawn 72 h after transfection, and 18 h later the cells were incubated in serum-free medium with or without dexamethasone (100 nm) for 6 h prior to study. Fluorescence Microscopy—FRT or H441 cells on permeable filter supports were transfected with Nedd4-GFP or Nedd4-2-GFP with or without siRNA (Nedd4 or Nedd4-2) as described above. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 48 h after transfection. Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 proteins were detected as GFP fluorescence using confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 1024, krypton/argon laser). Electrophysiology—Na+ transport was measured in FRT cells and in H441 cells using modified Ussing chambers (Warner Instrument Corporation). The apical and basolateral surfaces were bathed in 135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current was determined as the difference in current with and without amiloride (100 μm) in the apical bathing solution. Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Total RNA was extracted from FRT and H441 cells (RNeasy, Qiagen), reverse transcribed (Superscript, Invitrogen), and amplified by PCR (Clontech Advantage HF) as follows: 94 °C for 1 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, and extension for 7 min at 72 °C. The following primers were used: human and rat Nedd4 (forward, 5′-CCAGATGCTGCTTGCCATTTGCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTAATCCCTGGAGTAGGGCACTGC-3′), human Nedd4-2 (forward, 5′-TACTCATGGACGCCGAAAAGCG-3′; reverse, 5′-AAATCCATTCATAGGTACTCGC-3′), and rat Nedd4-2 (forward, 5′-ATGGAGCGACCCTATACATTTAAGGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTAATCCACCCCTTCAAATCCTTGAGC-3′). Selective Silencing of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 with siRNAs—To determine the role of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 in ENaC regulation, we generated siRNA duplexes to selectively reduce their expression and used two independent assays to test siRNA activity and specificity. First, we asked whether siRNAs would reduce the expression of Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 proteins (GFP-tagged). We cotransfected FRT cells with Nedd4-GFP and Nedd4 siRNA, Nedd4-2 siRNA, or no siRNA and detected Nedd4 protein by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1A, left). Nedd4 siRNA decreased the expression of Nedd4-GFP (compared with no siRNA). In contrast, Nedd4-2 siRNA did not decrease Nedd4-GFP protein. Conversely, in cells transfected with Nedd4-2-GFP, Nedd4-2 siRNA decreased Nedd4-2-GFP protein, but Nedd4 siRNA did not (Fig. 1A, right). The results in H441 cells transfected with Nedd4-GFP or Nedd4-2-GFP were similar (Fig. 1B). Second, we used an electrophysiological assay to test whether siRNAs would prevent Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 from inhibiting ENaC. We transfected FRT cells with α-, β-, and γ-ENaC and measured transepithelial amiloride-sensitive Na+ current as an assay of ENaC function. When cotransfected with ENaC, Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 each decreased Na+ current in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and D). siRNA against Nedd4 abolished the ability of Nedd4, but not Nedd4-2, to inhibit ENaC (Fig. 1, C and D). Conversely, Nedd4-2 siRNA prevented Nedd4-2, but not Nedd4, inhibition of ENaC (Fig. 1, C and D). Together, the data indicate that siRNAs selectively reduce expression of Nedd4 or Nedd4-2. This provides a strategy to distinguish their relative contribution to ENaC regulation. ENaC Regulation by Endogenous Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 in Epithelia—If Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 is a physiological negative regulator of ENaC under basal conditions, we predicted that reducing its expression would increase ENaC Na+ current. We tested this hypothesis using two epithelial cell lines: FRT cells, which reconstitute critical aspects of ENaC regulation and provide a useful model system (8Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J.

Investig. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and H441 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line that transports Na+ via endogenous ENaC (25Sayegh R. Auerbach S.D. Li X.

Both express Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 mRNAs (Fig. 2A). We cotransfected FRT cells with ENaC and siRNA against Nedd4 or Nedd4-2. As negative controls, we used siRNA against GFP or no siRNA. Nedd4 siRNA did not alter amiloride-sensitive Na+ current compared with no siRNA or GFP siRNA (Fig. 2B). In contrast, Nedd4-2 siRNA increased Na+ current (1.9-fold relative to no siRNA) (Fig. 2B). In H441 cells, we measured endogenous amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (Fig. 2C). Transfection with Nedd4-2 siRNA increased current (2.8-fold relative to GFP siRNA), but Nedd4 siRNA did not alter current. Together, the data suggest that endogenous Nedd4-2, but not Nedd4, negatively regulates ENaC in FRT and H441 epithelia. Nedd4-2 inhibits ENaC through its binding to PY motifs located in the C termini of ENaC subunits (9Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10McDonald F.J. Western A.H. McNeil J.D. Thomas B.C. Olson D.R. Snyder P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F431-F436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the PY motifs are deleted or mutated in Liddle's syndrome, ENaC regulation by Nedd4-2 might be disrupted in this disorder. We therefore tested the hypothesis that a Liddle's syndrome mutation would prevent Nedd4-2 siRNA from increasing Na+ current. FRT cells were transfected with wild-type α- and γ-ENaC and a mutant β-subunit (βR566X) that lacks most of the C terminus including the PY motif. The cells were cotransfected with or without siRNA. Nedd4-2 siRNA did not increase Na+ current in cells transfected with the mutant ENaC (Fig. 2D) in contrast to our results with wild-type ENaC (Fig. 2B). Thus, an intact PY motif in β-ENaC is required for ENaC regulation by endogenous Nedd4-2. Role of Nedd4-2 in Steroid Hormone Regulation of ENaC—Steroid hormones increase epithelial Na+ transport in part by inducing transcription of SGK. Previous work indicates that SGK phosphorylates Nedd4-2 and thereby decreases its interaction with ENaC (16Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 17Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that steroid hormones regulate Na+ transport, in part, through a pathway that includes Nedd4-2. We first asked whether Nedd4-2 depletion (by siRNA) would alter ENaC stimulation by dexamethasone. FRT cells transfected with ENaC were treated with or without dexamethasone (100 nm) for 6 h (following serum withdrawal for 24 h). Dexamethasone increased Na+ current in cells cotransfected with siRNA against GFP (1.0 μA/cm2) or Nedd4 (0.9 μA/cm2) (Fig. 3A, top panels). In contrast, dexamethasone failed to increase Na+ current in cells cotransfected with Nedd4-2 siRNA (Fig. 3A, top panels). This suggests that Nedd4-2 is required for dexamethasone to stimulate ENaC in FRT cells. We asked whether Nedd4-2 also contributes to steroid hormone signaling in H441 epithelia. Dexamethasone (6 h) increased Na+ current in cells transfected with GFP siRNA or Nedd4 siRNA (4.3 and 3.7 μA/cm2, respectively) (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). In cells transfected with Nedd4-2 siRNA, dexamethasone produced a much smaller increase in Na+ current (1.6 μA/cm2) (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). Thus, in H441 cells, Nedd4-2 contributes to steroid hormone regulation of endogenous ENaC. As a reciprocal strategy, we overexpressed a constitutively active Nedd4-2 in FRT epithelia. SGK inhibits Nedd4-2 activity (shifting the Nedd4-2 dose-response relationship to the right) (Fig. 3B) by decreasing its binding to ENaC (16Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol.

By mutating the three sites phosphorylated by SGK, we generated a Nedd4-2 construct (Nedd4-2S/T-A) that inhibited ENaC but could no longer be negatively regulated by SGK (Fig. 3C). We found that overexpression of Nedd4-2S/T-A nearly abolished the dexamethasone-mediated increase in Na+ current (0.1 μA/cm2) (Fig. 3D). As a control, we overexpressed wild-type Nedd4-2, which did not prevent dexamethasone from increasing Na+ current (because it can be inhibited by SGK) (Fig. 3D). Together, data from these complementary approaches suggest that steroid hormones regulate ENaC in part by inhibiting Nedd4-2. Moreover, the data suggest that Nedd4-2 phosphorylation by SGK is a critical step in this signaling pathway. Nedd4-2 and ENaC Regulation—The data provide direct evidence that HECT WW domain ubiquitin-protein ligases regulate ENaC in epithelia. Moreover, they define a specific regulatory role for Nedd4-2; silencing of Nedd4-2- increased Na+ current in two different epithelia, suggesting that endogenous Nedd4-2 inhibits ENaC in these cells. Conversely, the data suggest that Nedd4 does not regulate ENaC in these epithelia; silencing Nedd4 did not alter Na+ current. This was somewhat surprising because both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are expressed in a variety of Na+-transporting epithelia (9Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O.

Moreover, expressing either Nedd4 or Nedd4-2 in heterologous cells inhibits ENaC current (9Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O.

It is possible that Nedd4 or other members of the Nedd4 family (e.g. WWP2) (10McDonald F.J. Western A.H. McNeil J.D. Thomas B.C. Olson D.R. Snyder P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F431-F436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) inhibit ENaC in different epithelia and contribute to tissue-specific differences in ENaC regulation. Nedd4-2 and Steroid Hormones—The data also support a role for Nedd4-2 in ENaC regulation by steroid hormones; Nedd4-2 siRNA reduced ENaC stimulation by dexamethasone in FRT and H441 epithelia. This was specific to Nedd4-2, consistent with the lack of SGK phosphorylation consensus sites in Nedd4 (and other Nedd4 family members). Together with previous work, the data suggest the model illustrated in Fig. 3E. Under basal conditions, Nedd4-2 is unphosphorylated, allowing it to bind to ENaC PY motifs and to target the channel for degradation. As a result, Nedd4-2 minimizes epithelial Na+ transport. Conversely, in response to Na+ deprivation, steroid hormones increase expression of SGK, which phosphorylates Nedd4-2. In the phosphorylated state, Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC is reduced, stabilizing channel complexes at the cell surface. As a result, steroid hormones increase epithelial Na+ absorption. What is the relative contribution of this SGK/Nedd4-2 pathway to ENaC regulation by steroid hormones? Our data suggest that it plays an important role; Nedd4-2 siRNA abolished the response to dexamethasone in FRT cells and reduced it substantially in H441 cells. However, it is clear that additional pathways also contribute. First, in H441 cells, Nedd4-2 siRNA did not completely abolish ENaC regulation by dexamethasone (although we cannot exclude the possibility that Nedd4-2 expression was not completely silenced). Second, there is compelling evidence from previous studies that steroid hormones increase ENaC transcription, likely contributing to the “late” (6-24 h) increase in Na+ absorption (Fig. 3E) (28Stokes J.B. Sigmund R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1699-C1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). It is likely that additional steroid-induced genes also contribute to ENaC regulation, including K-Ras2A, a small G protein (30Stockand J.D. Spier B.J. Worrell R.T. Yue G. Al-Baldawi N. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35449-35454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Third, two recent studies found that mutation of ENaC PY motifs did not abolish ENaC regulation by steroid hormones in mouse collecting duct epithelia (31Dahlmann A. Pradervand S. Hummler E. Rossier B.C. Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F310-F318Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Auberson M. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Vandewalle A. Kellenberger S. Schild L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F459-F471Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, a limitation of these studies is that the PY motifs were not mutated in all three subunits; Nedd4-2 is capable of inhibiting ENaC when only a single PY motif is intact (9Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Nedd4-2 and Liddle's Syndrome—Two potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the excessive renal Na+ absorption that causes hypertension in Liddle's syndrome. First, the sequence disrupted by Liddle's syndrome mutations (PPPXYXXL) fits the consensus of a PY motif (PPXY), forming a recognition site for proteins containing WW domains, including Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 (6Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Thus, Liddle's syndrome might result from a defect in ENaC regulation by Nedd4 family members. Second, the disrupted sequence is also similar to clathrin-mediated endocytosis motifs (e.g. NPXY, YXXΦ) (Φ indicates hydrophobic residue) (11Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, Liddle's syndrome might result from a defect in ENaC endocytosis. Both mechanisms could explain the increase in ENaC surface expression that causes excessive epithelial Na+ absorption in this disorder. In the current studies, we found that Nedd4-2 depletion (by siRNA) mimicked the effect of Liddle's syndrome mutations by increasing Na+ current. Moreover, a Liddle's syndrome mutation in β-ENaC prevented a further increase in Na+ current in response to Nedd4-2 depletion. Thus, the data suggest that Nedd4-2 and Liddle's syndrome mutations alter Na+ current through a common pathway, supporting the hypothesis that Liddle's syndrome is caused at least in part by a defect in ENaC regulation by Nedd4-2. In addition, it raises the intriguing possibility that loss-of-function mutations in Nedd4-2 might contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension in some populations.

In this study, we evaluated the activities involved in ectodomain shedding of p75NTR, a neurotrophin receptor with critical roles in neuronal differentiation and survival. p75NTR is shed in a variety of cell types, including dorsal root ganglia cells and PC12 cells. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, inhibitors of the MEK/ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways uncovered distinct signaling pathways required for the constitutive and stimulated shedding of p75NTR. Stimulated p75NTR shedding is abrogated in M2 mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells that lack functional tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE, also referred to as ADAM17) and in cells isolated from adam17-/- mice, but not in cells from adam9/12/15-/- or adam10-/- mice. Stimulated p75NTR shedding is strongly reduced by deletion of 15 amino acid residues in its extracellular membrane-proximal stalk domain. However, similar to other shed proteins, point mutations and overlapping shorter deletions within this region have little or no effect on shedding. Because ectodomain shedding of p75NTR releases a soluble ectodomain and could also be a prerequisite for its regulated intramembrane proteolysis, these findings may have important implications for the functional regulation of p75NTR.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and of HB-EGF (43Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), syndecan-1 and -4 (41Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), and the L1 adhesion molecule (44Gutwein P. Oleszewski M. Mechtersheimer S. Agmon-Levin N. Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15490-15497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast, the constitutive shedding of TGFα depends on the p38 MAP kinase pathway (42Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluated the proteolytic and signaling activities involved in ectodomain shedding of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which serves as a common receptor for all known neurotrophins. The p75NTR receptor has diverse functions, including the promotion of cell survival in some cell types, and triggering apoptosis in others (45Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar, 46Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3295) Google Scholar, 47Hempstead B.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 48Dechant G. Barde Y.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The p75NTR also refines ligand specificity of a second class of neurotrophin receptors, the TRK receptors (49Mischel P.S. Smith S.G. Vining E.R. Valletta J.S. Mobley W.C. Reichardt L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11294-11301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p75NTR reportedly regulates myelination by Schwann cells in the developing peripheral nervous system (50Cosgaya J.M. Chan J.R. Shooter E.M. Science. 2002; 298: 1245-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Finally, recent work has demonstrated that p75NTR binds to the Nogo receptor, thereby inhibiting axon growth mediated by three myelin-associated proteins, MAG, OMgp, and Nogo-A (51Wong S.T. Henley J.R. Kanning K.C. Huang K.H. Bothwell M. Poo M.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 52Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z. Nature. 2002; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). One way to regulate p75NTR levels on the cell surface of Schwann cells was shown to occur via truncation by cellular metalloproteases (53Johnson Jr., E.M. Taniuchi M. DiStefano P.S. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 299-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Whereas the relevance of p75NTR ectodomain shedding in vivo is unclear, it has been proposed that shedding regulates the amount of cell surface p75NTR and may therefore affect axonal outgrowth (54DiStefano P.S. Chelsea D.M. Schick C.M. McKelvy J.F. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2405-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that p75NTR undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), which may in turn affect the association with TRK receptors and regulate the function of p75NTR (55Kanning K.C. Hudson M. Amieux P.S. Wiley J.C. Bothwell M. Schecterson L.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Jung K.M. Tan S. Landman N. Petrova K. Murray S. Lewis R. Kim P.K.

Like in other well characterized cases of RIP, such as in the cleavage of Notch, amyloid precursor protein, or sterol regulatory element-binding protein (57Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar), a membrane proximal cleavage is considered a prerequisite for the subsequent intramembrane cleavage of p75NTR (55Kanning K.C. Hudson M. Amieux P.S. Wiley J.C. Bothwell M. Schecterson L.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies highlight the significance of identifying the enzyme responsible for membrane proximal cleavage and ectodomain shedding of p75NTR. Our results uncover two distinct activities involved in the release of p75NTR ectodomain, and define characteristic features of these two shedding activities. Furthermore, we evaluate the role of different candidate sheddases of the ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloprotease) family of metalloproteases in p75NTR ectodomain shedding. Materials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), hydrogen peroxide, and sodium vanadate were purchased from Sigma. Pervanadate was generated immediately prior to each experiment by mixing sodium vanadate and hydrogen peroxide to a final concentration of 100 mm each. Protein A- and Protein G-Sepharose were purchased from Pharmacia. Restriction enzymes, Hi-Fidelity Taq, and Klenow fragment were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, MEK inhibitor U0126, p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB202190, compound E, lactacysteine, and EndoH and PNGaseF were purchased from Calbiochem.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with untagged wild-type p75NTR or St75 cDNA as a template and deletions were introduced with PCR and appropriate oligonucleotides using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). All of the resulting mutations were confirmed by cDNA sequencing.

All cells were transfected in 6-well tissue culture plates with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were allowed to recover for 6 to 18 h prior to metabolic labeling. For metabolic pulse labeling, cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking cysteine and methionine and then incubated in the same media supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for half an hour. 200 μCi/ml of [35S]Pro-mix (Amersham Biosciences) was then added for 30 min. For overnight labeling experiments, the 30-min starvation period was omitted and cells were labeled with 200 μCi/ml of [35S]Pro-mix for 10-14 h. In all cases, after labeling, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and immediately lysed in cell lysis buffer (TBS, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm iodoacetamide), or incubated in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for the indicated number of hours. Conditioned media was collected after 1 h and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min followed by a further 100,000 × g spin for 45 min. p75NTR protein was then immunoprecipitated from the media and lysates with anti-REX IgG. p75NTR protein from dorsal root ganglia cultures was immunoprecipitated with mc192 IgG. In all cases, immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C for at least 6 hours followed by washing, and samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described below. In experiments in which PMA, pervanadate, or BB-94 were added, cells were first chased for 2 h followed by an additional chase of 15 min or 1 h in fresh Opti-MEM containing the indicated concentration of additive(s). In experiments examining the effect of bisindolylmaleimide I or of the MAP kinase inhibitors U0126 and SB202190, the indicated concentration of inhibitor was present both during the initial 2-h chase and during the following 1-h chase. Supernatants were then collected and cells lysed as before. For immunoprecipitations, the appropriate antibody and Protein A-Sepharose were added to the lysate or supernatant and incubated at 4 °C from 2 h to overnight. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer (lysates) or PBS, pH 7.4, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (supernatant). 2× sample loading buffer supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol was added and the samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Gels were fixed in 50% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid for 15 min, rehydrated in water for 15 min, dried, and exposed to Kodak Bio-MAX MR film.

https://openalex.org/W2058917763,"Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) is a pro-angiogenic mediator that is secreted by both normal and neoplastic cells. Intriguingly, FGF-2 has been shown to be exported by an endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi-independent pathway; however, the molecular machinery mediating this process has remained elusive. Here we introduce a novel in vitro system that functionally reconstitutes FGF-2 secretion. Based on affinity-purified plasma membrane inside-out vesicles, we demonstrate post-translational membrane translocation of FGF-2 as shown by protease protection experiments. This process is blocked at low temperature but apparently does not appear to be driven by ATP hydrolysis. FGF-2 membrane translocation occurs in a unidirectional fashion requiring both integral and peripheral membrane proteins. These findings provide direct evidence that FGF-2 secretion is based on its direct translocation across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. When galectin-1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor, other proteins exported by unconventional means, were analyzed for translocation into plasma membrane inside-out vesicles, galectin-1 was found to be transported as efficiently as FGF-2. By contrast, migration inhibitory factor failed to traverse the membrane of inside-out vesicles. These findings establish the existence of multiple distinct secretory routes that are operational in the absence of a functional endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi system.

Intriguingly, several independent lines of evidence indicate that various kinds of mechanistically distinct non-classical export routes may exist (reviewed in Refs. 9Hughes R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar and 10Nickel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). For example, interleukin 1β has been reported to be imported into an endolysosomal compartment prior to secretion (23Andrei C. Dazzi C. Lotti L. Torrisi M.R. Chimini G. Rubartelli A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), whereas FGF-1 is likely to be translocated directly across the plasma membrane (40Prudovsky I. Bagala C. Tarantini F.

Tarantini F. Prudovsky I. Maciag T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2687-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In case of FGF-2, Gal-1, and MIF, the intracellular site of membrane translocation is unknown. Based on various experimental observations, at least four independent pathways of unconventional protein secretion may exist (10Nickel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). However, in all cases, the molecular machineries mediating ER/Golgi-independent protein secretion have not been revealed. A key aim of the current study was to implement an experimental system that allows for a thorough biochemical analysis of FGF-2 export. Here we establish a novel assay employing affinity-purified plasma membrane inside-out vesicles to reconstitute FGF-2 secretion in vitro. The rationale for this system is to measure post-translational membrane translocation of FGF-2 into the lumen of inside-out vesicles, a process that mimics FGF-2 secretion, as the lumen of these vesicles is topologically equivalent to the extracellular space. FGF-2 membrane translocation is shown to require elevated temperature; however, it neither depends on exogenously added ATP nor is it sensitive to treatment with apyrase, an ATP-degrading enzyme (42Kettlun A.M. Alvarez A. Quintar R. Valenzuela M.A. Collados L. Aranda E. Banda A. Chayet L. Chiong M. Mancilla M. et al.Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ouabain, an inhibitor of the sodium potassium ATPase (Na/K-ATPase), which has been suggested to play a role in FGF-2 export (18Florkiewicz R.Z. Anchin J. Baird A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 544-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 43Dahl J.P. Binda A. Canfield V.A. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14877-14883Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), does not inhibit FGF-2 membrane translocation in vitro. Therefore, our data suggest that the partial inhibitory activity of ouabain on FGF-2 export in living cells is not due to a direct function of the Na/K-ATPase in FGF-2 membrane translocation. Removal of peripheral membrane proteins blocks FGF-2 import into plasma membrane vesicles; however, FGF-2 can still bind to the cytoplasmic surface of these membranes. Translocation activity of salt-washed membranes can be restored by the addition of cytosol. These findings suggest that both integral membrane proteins and cytosolic factors are required for FGF-2 membrane translocation. When plasma membrane-derived inside-out vesicles were compared with right side-out vesicles, the latter ones were found not to be competent to import FGF-2, demonstrating that FGF-2 transport across the plasma membrane occurs in a unidirectional fashion. Intriguingly, when other unconventional secretory proteins such as MIF (24Flieger O. Engling A. Bucala R. Lue H. Nickel W. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and Gal-1 (25Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 29Cleves A.E. Cooper D.N. Barondes S.H. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were tested, differential uptake into plasma membrane inside-out vesicles was observed in that MIF was found not to be transported, whereas Gal-1 did translocate as efficiently as FGF-2. These data are consistent with the postulation of multiple independent transport routes for secretory proteins exported by unconventional means (8Cleves A.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R318-R320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hughes R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 10Nickel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Our findings provide the first direct evidence that FGF-2 and Gal-1 are exported from mammalian cells by direct translocation across the plasma membrane. Antibodies—Affinity-purified anti-FGF-2 antibodies, affinity-purified anti-galectin-1 antibodies, affinity-purified anti-GFP antibodies, and polyclonal anti-MIF antibodies were prepared as described (20Engling A.

Polyclonal antibodies directed against the influenza HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) were raised in rabbits according to standard procedures. Polyclonal anti-p30 antibodies (47Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D.

Wieland (Biochemie-Zentrum Heidelberg), respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against the Myc and the CD8 epitope were derived from the hybridoma cell lines 9E10 (63Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar) and Okt8 cells (53Hoffman R.A. Kung P.C. Hansen W.P. Goldstein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4914-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), respectively. Monoclonal rat anti-HA antibodies were obtained from Roche Diagnostics, and polyclonal anti-calnexin antibodies were purchased from Stressgen. All secondary antibodies used for the detection of antigens by Western blotting were obtained from Bio-Rad. Isolation of Plasma Membrane Vesicles—Genetically modified CHO cells stably expressing a modified form of the cell surface protein CD8 (CD8-LT) (44Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in spinner cultures according to standard procedures. Plasma membrane vesicles were prepared by a modification of the procedure described by Keppler and colleagues (45Keppler D. Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CHOCD8-LT cells (3 × 109) were washed twice with 50 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by a 40-fold dilution in hypotonic buffer (0.5 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.0; 0.1 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Following incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 40 min at 4 °C. The sediment was resuspended in 20 ml of hypotonic buffer and homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Following dilution in incubation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose), the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × gav at 4 °C. The sediment was resuspended and again subjected to the procedure described. Postnuclear supernatants from both steps were combined and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × gav for 40 min at 4 °C. The resulting sediment was resuspended in 20 ml of incubation buffer and manually homogenized by 50 strokes using a tight-fitting Dounce B (glass/glass) homogenizer. The resulting membrane suspension was layered on top of a 6-ml 38% (w/v) sucrose solution (5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). Following centrifugation at 280,000 × gav for 2 h in a Beckman SW41 swing-out rotor, membranes in the 0/38% interface were collected and diluted in 20 ml of incubation buffer. This suspension was again homogenized with a Dounce B homogenizer (30 strokes) followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × gav for 40 min at 4 °C. The corresponding sediment was resuspended in 1 ml of incubation buffer and passed 20 times through a 27-gauge needle. The resulting membrane vesicle suspension was stored at -80 °C. Affinity Purification of Inside-out and Right Side-out Vesicles— Plasma membrane vesicles were incubated with excess amounts of monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. After collecting the antibody-coated membranes by centrifugation (10 min, 7,600 × gav, 4 °C), the samples were washed with PBS, 0.1% BSA followed by incubation with 150 μl of a suspension of Dynabeads (M-280 sheep antimouse IgG) for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes bound to magnetobeads were reisolated, washed as described above, and finally resuspended in PBS, 0.1% BSA. The same procedure was used to affinity-purify right side-out vesicles employing monoclonal antibodies directed against the luminal domain of CD8 instead of anti-Myc antibodies. Electron Microscopy—Gradient-purified plasma membranes as well as affinity-depleted plasma membrane vesicles were placed onto a glow-discharged carbon-coated 300 mesh copper grid for 1 min. After rinsing the grid with water, it was placed face down onto a 100-μl droplet containing the antibodies indicated. Polyclonal anti-HA antibodies were used at a 1:25 dilution in PBS, 1% BSA. In case of double labeling experiments, the anti-HA antibody dilution was mixed 1:1 with Okt8 hybridoma cell supernatant. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the grids were washed twice with 100 μl of PBS, 1% BSA. Afterward, the grids were placed onto a 100-μl droplet of a 1:1 mixture of 5 nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and 10 nm gold-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) each diluted 1:5 in PBS, 1% BSA. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, the grids were rinsed as described above and stained for 1 min with 20 μl of 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. Micrographs were taken with a Zeiss 10 A electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. FGF-2 Membrane Translocation Assay—In standard incubations, about 7.5% of affinity-purified inside-out vesicles (prepared from 3 × 109 CHOCD8-LT cells) were incubated in a final volume of 100 μl containing transport assay buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 μm GTP, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), an ATP-regenerating system (8 units/ml creatine kinase, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μm ATP), rat liver cytosol (5 mg/ml). Recombinant human FGF-2 (18-kDa isoform (20Engling A. Backhaus R. Stegmayer C. Zehe C. Seelenmeyer C. Kehlenbach A. Schwappach B. Wegehingel S. Nickel W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3619-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)), recombinant human Gal-1 (32Seelenmeyer C. Wegehingel S. Lechner J. Nickel W. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), recombinant GFP (20Engling A. Backhaus R. Stegmayer C. Zehe C. Seelenmeyer C. Kehlenbach A. Schwappach B. Wegehingel S. Nickel W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3619-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), or recombinant MIF (64Mischke R. Gessner A. Kapurniotu A. Juttner S. Kleemann R. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml (5 μg of total protein per transport reaction). In some experiments the ATP-regenerating system and GTP were substituted for 25 mm EDTA. Where indicated apyrase (20 units/ml, Sigma) was added to degrade endogenous ATP. Transport mixtures were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C followed by the reisolation of magnetobead-bound plasma membrane vesicles. After two washing steps using PBS, 0.1% BSA, a potential luminal localization of the proteins in question was probed by protease protection experiments. The samples were treated for 2.5 h at 4 °C with 250 units of trypsin (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (1% w/v) in Tris buffer (0.05 m; pH 8.0). The reactions were terminated by adding protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applies Science) followed by elution of proteins using SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS gels and analyzed by Western blotting using the antibodies indicated. Affinity Purification of Plasma Membrane Inside-out Vesicles—In order to develop an FGF-2 export in vitro assay, we first established a procedure that allowed us to affinity-purify plasma membrane vesicles with homogenous inside-out topology. For this purpose, we made use of a CHO cell line stably expressing an engineered version of the cell surface molecule CD8 (44Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this fusion protein, which has been termed CD8-LT, the cytoplasmic tail was exchanged for an HA epitope, the cytoplasmic tail sequence of the adenoviral protein E19, and a Myc epitope at the extreme C terminus (Figs. 1 and 2). In terms of subcellular localization, CD8-LT was shown to behave identically to CD8wild-type as being a resident of the plasma membrane (44Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale of the affinity purification procedure described here was to isolate plasma membrane inside-out vesicles employing bead-immobilized anti-Myc antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic tail of CD8-LT. A subcellular fraction containing plasma membranes consisting of both inside-out and right side-out vesicles was prepared by conventional methods (for details see “Materials and Methods”) based on the procedure described by Keppler and colleagues (45Keppler D. Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the second part of the protocol, inside-out vesicles were affinity-purified employing anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the plasma membrane marker CD8-LT is strongly enriched in this fraction (lane 7) compared with the starting material (lane 1). By contrast, calnexin and p30, markers of the endoplasmic reticulum (46Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar) and mitochondria (47Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), respectively, are not enriched in the inside-out vesicle fraction (calnexin) or are absent (p30). p27, a marker protein for Golgi membranes (48Füllekrug J. Suganuma T. Tang B.L. Hong W. Storrie B. Nilsson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1939-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 49Jenne N. Frey K. Brugger B. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46504-46511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), was found to be abundant in the fraction shown in lane 7; however, p27 was only enriched about 4-fold, whereas CD8-LT was enriched about 34-fold in affinity-purified vesicles compared with the starting material (lane 1) as analyzed by quantitation of the corresponding fluorograms using QuantityOne® software from Bio-Rad (data not shown). The presence of p27 in the fraction containing affinity-purified plasma membranes is likely to be due to a subpopulation of CD8-LT present in the Golgi en route to the cell surface. To verify these results using an independent method, we conducted a quantitative lipid analysis based on mass spectrometry (50Brügger B. Erben G. Sandhoff R. Wieland F.T. Lehmann W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 51Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W.D. Nickel W. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we determined the ratio of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a bulk lipid present in all cellular membranes at similar concentrations, to sphingomyelin (SM), a phospholipid that is most abundant in plasma membranes (52van Meer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 29-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the starting material, the SM to PC ratio was found to be 0.26 which increased to 0.48 for gradient-purified plasma membranes. The SM to PC ratio of affinity-purified plasma membranes was found to be similar to that of gradient-purified plasma membranes, which most likely indicates that both SM-poor (ER) and SM-enriched (endosomes/lysosomes) membranes are removed. These findings are consistent with the biochemical analysis of marker proteins demonstrating the efficacy of the purification procedure.Fig. 2Biochemical analysis of the membrane topology of affinity-purified inside-out and right side-out vesicles. A, schematic description of the membrane topology and specific features of CD8-LT. B, affinity-purified inside-out and right side-out vesicles were treated with thrombin in the presence and absence of detergent as indicated. The samples were separated on SDS gels followed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies directed against the influenza HA epitope in order to detect CD8-LT. As indicated, the slow migrating form represents full-length CD8-LT, whereas the fast migrating form represents thrombin-cleaved CD8-LT (44Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N.

Slit-2 was shown to be frequently inactivated in lung and breast cancers because of hypermethylation of its promoter region. Furthermore, the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis has been reported recently to be actively involved in breast cancer metastasis to target organs such as lymph nodes, lung, and bone. In this study, we sought to characterize the effect of Slit (=Slit-2) on the CXCL12/CXCR4-mediated metastatic properties of breast cancer cells. We demonstrate here that breast cancer cells and tissues derived from breast cancer patients express Robo 1 and 2 receptors. We also show that Slit treatment inhibits CXCL12/CXCR4-induced breast cancer cell chemotaxis, chemoinvasion, and adhesion, the fundamental components that promote metastasis. Slit had no significant effect on the CXCL12-induced internalization process of CXCR4. In addition, characterization of signaling events revealed that Slit inhibits CXCL12-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion components such as RAFTK/Pyk2 at residues 580 and 881, focal adhesion kinase at residue 576, and paxillin. We found that Slit also inhibits CXCL12-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p44/42 MAP kinase, and metalloproteinase 2 and 9 activities. However, it showed no effect on JNK and p38 MAP kinase activities. To our knowledge, this is the first report to analyze in detail the effect of Slit on breast cancer cell motility as well as its effect on the critical components of the cancer cell chemotactic machinery.

Breast cancer metastasis is the main cause of treatment failure and death in patients with breast cancer. Tumor cells migrate to other distant organs, invading blood and lymphatic vessels and leading to secondary tumor formation. A wide number of molecules, including various cytokines, chemokines, and growth hormones, have been implicated to be responsible for the metastatic property of breast cancer cells (1Hyder S.M.

Moreover, breast cancer cells have been demonstrated to express the chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR7, whereas organs such as the lymph nodes and lungs, which represent important sites of breast cancer metastasis, have been reported to express ligands of these receptors (5Muller A.

Furthermore, in vitro neutralization of the CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction led to a marked inhibition of lymph node and lung metastasis. In other cancers, such as of the prostate and ovary, CXCL12 was shown to promote tumor cell transendothelial chemotaxis (8Taichman R.S. Cooper C. Keller E.T. Pienta K.J. Taichman N.S. McCauley L.K.

Besides CXCL12, other α-chemokines such as interleukin-8 and GROα have also been reported (11Moore B.B. Arenberg D.A. Stoy K. Morgan T. Addison C.L. Morris S.B. Glass M. Wilke C. Xue Y.Y.

CXCL12-induced leukocyte chemotaxis was shown recently to be inhibited by a secretory glycoprotein termed Slit (12Wu J.Y. Feng L. Park H.T. Havlioglu N. Wen L. Tang H. Bacon K.B. Jiang Z. Zhang X. Rao Y. Nature. 2001; 410: 948-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Slit was originally found to be expressed in neurons and glial cells in the neuronal system and was later shown to play the role of a multifunctional signaling molecule by acting as a silencer and a repellent, and perhaps as a branching and elongation factor (13Wong K.

Slit consists of a family of three genes, Slit-1, Slit-2, and Slit-3, that have been cloned from different model systems (20Holmes G.P. Negus K. Burridge L. Raman S. Algar E. Yamada T. Little M.H.

Robo, which is highly conserved from fruit flies to mammals, consists of a novel subfamily of Ig superfamily proteins (19Ghose A. Van Vactor D. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Identification of Robo mutations in genetic screens for guidance defects has revealed the importance of Slit/Robo signaling in axon guidance and cell migration (24Kidd T. Brose K. Mitchell K.J.

Recently, Slit was also shown to act as a tumor suppressor, since overexpression of Slit suppressed colony growth in breast tumor cell lines (28Dallol A. Da Silva N.F. Viacava P. Minna J.D. Bieche I. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5874-5880PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the importance of the Slit-Robo complex in breast cancer has been confirmed by genetic studies showing that the SLIT and ROBO genes are frequently inactivated in breast cancer patients due to hypermethylation of the promoter region (28Dallol A. Da Silva N.F. Viacava P. Minna J.D. Bieche I. Maher E.R. Latif F. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5874-5880PubMed Google Scholar). Although Slit has been demonstrated to play an important role in regulating the movement of neurons and leukocytes, the signaling pathways that mediate these effects are not well known. In this study, we present a novel observation that Slit inhibits breast cancer cell chemotaxis and chemoinvasion by downmodulating critical downstream molecules in the CXCR4-mediated signaling pathway, including components of focal adhesion kinase. It also inhibits MAP kinase and metalloproteinase 2 and 9 activities that may be involved in chemoinvasion. Thus Slit, by blocking breast cancer cell movement, may inhibit CXCL12-induced breast cancer metastasis. Cell Lines—DU4475 cells were obtained from ATCC. MDA-MB-231 cells were generously provided by Hava Avraham (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston). DU4475 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, according to the recommendations of the supplier. MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from DU4475 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using a standard TRIzol extraction protocol. 0.5–1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with extended PCR using the Titanium™ one-step RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences). The primers used are as follows: Robo 1 forward, GCCGCCCCACACCCACTAT, and Robo 1 reverse, GGCCACACAGCTGAGGACGAAAG; Robo 2 forward, CCCCAGCAGCCCAACAGTAGA, and Robo 2 reverse, TGGGCCGCAGTCCTCTTACA. The PCR was carried out at the annealing temperature of 60 °C, and the PCR products were analyzed on 0.7% agarose gels. Immunohistochemistry—The paraffin-mounted normal and malignant breast tissues slides obtained from the Co-operative Human Tissue Network (Philadelphia) were deparaffinized three times with xylene, followed by hydration with sequential treatment of the slides twice each to 100, 95, and 70% ethanol for 5 min per treatment. The DU4475 cells or the MDA-MB-231 cells were mounted and fixed on slides with paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, followed by washings with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The slides were subjected to immunohistochemistry by using the DAB staining kit (Vector Laboratories). Briefly, the slides were blocked for 10 min with 1.5% normal horse serum followed by incubation with either Robo 1 (1:20), Robo 2 (1:20), CXCR4 (1:100), or control IgG (1:20) for 1 h. The slides were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with pantothenate-specific universal secondary antibody for 10 min. Following a wash with PBS, the slides were further incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase complex reagent for 5 min. The slides were again washed and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as substrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The slides were mounted with aqua mount and photographed. Preparation of Slit and Control Supernatant—Slit was obtained from the supernatants of Myc-tagged Slit transfected human embryonic kidney cells, according to published procedures (12Wu J.Y. Feng L. Park H.T. Havlioglu N. Wen L. Tang H. Bacon K.B. Jiang Z. Zhang X. Rao Y. Nature. 2001; 410: 948-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 16Li H.S. Chen J.H. Wu W. Fagaly T. Zhou L. Yuan W.

Slit expression was monitored by anti-c-Myc or anti-Slit antibody. Control preparations obtained from the vector-transfected cell lines were prepared by using the same procedure as that employed for the Slit preparations. This partially purified Slit was further enriched on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column using the Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. The column was run on PBS containing 2 m NaCl. The fractions were analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE gels stained with silver stain or on immunoblots probed with anti-Myc antibodies. The purified fractions, which were found to be homogenous by silver staining and Western blotting with c-Myc tag antibodies, were dialyzed with PBS, concentrated, and used for the chemotaxis assays. Stimulation of Cells—Stimulation of cells was carried out as described earlier (29Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3067-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Fernandis A.Z.

Briefly, DU4475 cells were washed twice with Hanks’ buffered salt solution (Cellgro) and then resuspended in the Hanks’ buffered salt solution with a density of 107 cells/ml. The cells were subsequently starved of serum for 3 h at 37 °C followed with either Slit supernatant or control supernatants for 1 h at 37 °C. The pretreated cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml CXCL12 (10 nm) (PeproTech) at 37 °C for various times. At the end of the stimulation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay. Immunoprecipitation, Immunodepletion, and Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein from the stimulated time points were clarified by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B or GammaBind™-Sepharose beads (both from Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were removed by brief centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with different primary antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of the antibody-antigen complexes was performed by incubation at 4 °C overnight with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B or GammaBind™-Sepharose (50% suspension). Nonspecific interacting proteins were removed by washing the beads three times with modified RIPA buffer and once with PBS. Immune complexes were solubilized in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked in 5% nonfat milk protein for 2 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C and probed with primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For the immunodepletion experiments, the Slit or control supernatant concentrates were incubated with anti-Myc antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by overnight incubation with protein A-Sepharose. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used as the immunodepleted sample. Flow Cytometry—For receptor expression, both DU4475 and MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 106) were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of PBS with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Robo 1 or Robo 2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) or with goat IgG antibodies as control, and then incubated at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBS containing 5% FBS and incubated with anti-goat IgG labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were next washed three times with ice-cold PBS, 5% FBS buffer, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and then analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the surface expression levels of these receptors. For receptor down-modulation, DU4475 cells were pretreated with Slit or control supernatant and then stimulated with CXCL12 at different time points. The stimulation was terminated with ice-cold PBS, followed by 3 washes with PBS. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The CXCR4 receptor on the cells was stained with phycoerythrin-coupled anti-CXCR4 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were next washed with PBS, suspended in 1% formaldehyde in PBS, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Chemotaxis and Chemoinvasion Assays—Migration and invasion were assayed in 24-well cell-culture chambers with 8-μm pore membranes, as described (5Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4473) Google Scholar, 30Fernandis A.Z. Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Membranes were pre-coated with either fibronectin (FN) (2.5 μg/ml) for chemotaxis studies or with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) for chemoinvasion studies of the MDA-MB-231 cells. Breast cancer cells were resuspended in chemotaxis buffer (DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 12 mm HEPES for the MDA-MB-231 cells and RPMI 1640, 2.5% FBS for the DU4475 cells) at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were pretreated with Slit or control preparation for 30 min. 150 μl of cells from each sample was loaded onto the upper chamber. 0.6 ml of medium containing CXCL12 (5 nm) with Slit or the control was then loaded onto the lower chamber. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After incubation, the inserts were removed carefully, and the MDA-MB-231 cells were fixed, stained, and counted using standard procedures. For the DU4475 line, cells were counted directly by using a Neubar chamber. The results were expressed as the percent of migrated cells as compared with the control. Adhesion Assay—The wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate, precoated with 10 μg/ml FN (BD Biosciences) or collagen IV (BD Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C, were washed with PBS and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were again rinsed with PBS and air-dried. Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 200 μl of serum-free medium and allowed to attach for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of Slit or the control. Non-adherent cells were removed by gentle washing with PBS. The adherent cells were quantified by using the Roche Applied Science MTT cell proliferation assay kit. Receptor Binding Assay—Binding of CXCL12 to its receptor CXCR4 was assessed by using 1 ng/ml 125I-labeled CXCL12 (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of various concentrations of purified Slit or unlabeled CXCL12 (PeproTech) (32Salcedo R. Wasserman K. Young H.A. Grimm M.C. Howard O.M. Anver M.R. Kleinman H.K. Murphy W.J. Oppenheim J.J. Am. J.

Briefly, DU4475 cells at 107/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) and 25 mm/liter HEPES were incubated in the presence of various concentrations of purified Slit or unlabeled CXCL12 together with 1 ng/ml 125I-labeled CXCL12 for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times with cold RPMI 1640 containing 25 mm/liter HEPES. Cell pellet-associated radioactivity was determined in a gamma counter. JNK and p38 MAP Kinase Assays—The JNK and p38 MAP kinase assays were performed as described previously (33Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Munshi N. Ganju R.K. Avraham S. Mesri E.A. Groopman J.E. J. Biol.

The immune complexes were washed twice with RIPA buffer and once in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP). The complex was then incubated in kinase buffer containing recombinant glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun 0.2 μg/μl(1–79 amino acids) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. For the p38 MAP kinase assays, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p38 MAP kinase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune complexes were washed twice with RIPA buffer and once in kinase buffer and then incubated in kinase buffer containing 7 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. c-Src Kinase Assay—The c-Src kinase assay was carried out as described previously (30Fernandis A.Z. Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Munshi N. Ganju R.K. Avraham S. Mesri E.A. Groopman J.E. J. Biol.

The immune complexes were washed twice with RIPA buffer and once with kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 μm Na3VO4). For the in vitro kinase assays, the immune complexes were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in kinase buffer containing acid-denatured rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. PI 3-Kinase Assay—The Slit and control pretreated DU4475 cells were stimulated with CXCL12 (100 ng/ml) at different time points and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). PI 3-kinase activity was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of lysates using anti-p85 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads, as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed once with lysis buffer followed by three washes with wash buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA. The beads were suspended in 35 μl of reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA and 5 μl of sonicated phosphatidylinositol (Sigma). The reaction was initiated with the addition of 50 μm ATP containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and, after 10 min, terminated with the addition of 300 μl of methanol, 1 n HCl (1:1). The lipids were extracted with 250 μl of CHCl3, and the organic phase containing the labeled lipids was separated and vacuumdried. The lipids were suspended in chloroform and spotted on tartrate-impregnated silica gel TLC plates (Whatman). The TLC was developed with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (90:90:20:7), and the labeled lipids were visualized by autoradiography. The labeled products were cut from the plates and measured for radioactivity. Measurement of PTEN Activity—The Slit and control pretreated DU4475 cells were stimulated with CXCL12 (100 ng/ml) at different time points and lysed in lysis buffer without sodium vanadate. PTEN activities were measured using the PTEN Malachite Green Assay kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). MMP Assay—MMPs were assayed either by gelatin zymography or by using MMP ELISA kits. The gelatin zymography was performed with slight modifications, as described (35Barrett J.M. Puglia M.A. Singh G. Tozer R.G. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 72: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell culture was maintained to 80% confluency in serum-supplemented media. The monolayer was rinsed two times with PBS. The cells were then pretreated with Slit or control preparation for 30 min and stimulated with CXCL12 under serum-free conditions. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cell supernatants were collected and concentrated using Centricon units (Millipore). After standardization, samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE containing 0.3% gelatin. Following electrophoresis, gels were washed twice in wash buffer containing 2.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 6.5 mm CaCl2, 5 μm ZnCl2, and 0.5 g per liter of NaN3. Gels were then rinsed briefly in the same buffer without Triton X-100. The gels were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Subsequently, the gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The MMP-2 and -9 quantikine ELISAs were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems). Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of data obtained from three or four experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t test. Expression of Robo Receptors in Breast Cancer Cells and in Normal and Malignant Breast Tissues—Slit mediates its effect by binding to Robo receptors, which are highly conserved from fruit flies to mammals (19Ghose A. Van Vactor D. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In mammals, four ROBO genes (ROBO 1, ROBO 2, ROBO 3, and ROBO 4) have been identified (16Li H.S. Chen J.H. Wu W.

https://openalex.org/W2028497798,"Cofilin plays an essential role in actin filament dynamics and membrane protrusion in motile cells. Cofilin is inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser-3 by LIM kinase and reactivated by dephosphorylation by cofilin-phosphatase Slingshot (SSH). Although cofilin is dephosphorylated in response to various extracellular stimuli, signaling pathways regulating SSH activation and cofilin dephosphorylation have remained to be elucidated. Here we show that insulin stimulates the phosphatase activity of Slingshot-1L (SSH1L) and cofilin dephosphorylation in cultured cells, in a manner dependent on phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Consistent with this, the level of Ser-3-phosphorylated cofilin is increased in PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10)-overexpressing cells and decreased in PTEN-deficient cells. Insulin induced the accumulation of SSH1L and active Akt (a downstream effector of PI3K), together with a PI3K product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, onto membrane protrusions. Cofilin, but not Ser-3-phosphorylated cofilin, accumulated in membrane protrusions in insulin-stimulated cells, indicating that cofilin is dephosphorylated in these areas. Finally, suppression of SSH1L expression by RNA interference abolished insulin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and the membrane protrusion. These findings suggest that SSH1L is activated downstream of PI3K and plays a critical role in insulin-induced membrane protrusion by dephosphorylating and activating cofilin.

These findings suggest that SSH1L is activated downstream of PI3K and plays a critical role in insulin-induced membrane protrusion by dephosphorylating and activating cofilin. Cell migration plays a central role in a variety of physiological and pathological events, including wound healing, inflammation, immune responses, embryogenesis, organogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastasis. Lamellipodial membrane protrusions are formed in the initial stage of cell movement and maintained at the leading edge of the cell throughout polarized cell migration (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar). Rapid turnover of actin filaments is essential for the formation and maintenance of membrane protrusions for cell migration (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G.

In membrane protrusions, actin filaments are assembled and organized as a dendritic network by actions of the Arp2/3 complex, which stimulates nucleation and branching of actin filaments (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar). As a branched network of actin filaments grows by actin assembly at the barbed ends in the front side of membrane protrusions, it pushes the membrane forward (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar). On the other hand, actin filaments are rapidly disassembled at the pointed ends on the rear side of membrane protrusions, which is mediated by cofilin and its close relative, actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) 1The abbreviations used are: ADF, actin depolymerizing factor; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; LIMK1, LIM kinase-1; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; P-Akt, Ser-473-phosphorylated Akt; P-cofilin, Ser-3-phosphorylated cofilin; PHAKT, PH domain of Akt; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10; RNAi, RNA interference; SSH, Slingshot; SSH1L, a long isoform of Slingshot-1; WT, wild-type; CS, phosphatase-dead.

Cofilin and ADF (hereafter referred to as cofilin) stimulate depolymerization and severance of actin filaments at or near the pointed ends and thereby supply actin monomers for polymerization and support rapid turnover of actin filaments (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar, 2Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The filament-severing activity of cofilin also contributes to the appearance of free barbed ends, from which actin filaments can grow to the leading edge (4Zebda N. Bernard O. Bailly M. Welti S. Lawrence D.S. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, the activity of cofilin seems to play an essential role in maintaining continuous extension of the plasma membrane at the leading edge of locomoting cells (3Bailly M. Jones G.E. Curr.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of cofilin is negatively regulated by serine/threonine kinases, LIM kinase (LIMK) and TESK, through phosphorylation at Ser-3 of cofilin (6Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A.

LIMK1 is activated in response to various extracellular stimuli, including lysophosphatidic acid, stromal cell-derived factor-1α, and insulin, through Rho family small GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, and their downstream protein kinases, such as ROCK and PAK (6Yang N.

Biol. 2002; 22: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Ser-3-phosphorylated cofilin (P-cofilin) is dephosphorylated and reactivated by a family of protein phosphatases, termed Slingshot (SSH) (11Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). SSH was originally identified in Drosophila. The loss of SSH function in Drosophila leads to disorganized epidermal cell morphogenesis, including malformation of bristles, wing hairs, and ommatidia. Thus, SSH is implicated in the formation of cellular extensions by organizing the ordered assembly of actin filaments in Drosophila (11Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In mammals, members of a SSH phosphatase family, SSH1L, SSH2L, and SSH3L, were found to have distinct specific activities, subcellular distribution, and tissue expression patterns (11Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 12Ohta Y. Kousaka K. Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohashi K. Muramoto A. Shima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the phosphatase activity of SSH1L changes during the cell division cycle in cultured cells (13Kaji N. Ohashi K. Shuin M. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33450-33455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that cofilin is dephosphorylated in response to various extracellular stimuli (2Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 14Moon A. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15Meberg P.J. Ono S. Minamide L.S. Takahashi M. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 172-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, signaling mechanisms that regulate SSH activity and cofilin dephosphorylation have remained to be elucidated. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a key mediator of intracellular signaling pathways that regulate metabolism, growth, apoptosis, actin cytoskeletal reorganization, and polarized cell migration (16Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 17Chung C.Y. Funamoto S. Firtel R.A. Trends Biochem.

Activated PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). Production of PI(3,4,5)P3 is followed by activation of downstream effectors, such as Rac and a serine/threonine kinase Akt (also called protein kinase B) (16Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 17Chung C.Y. Funamoto S. Firtel R.A. Trends Biochem.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 466-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A tumor suppressor protein PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10), which is frequently mutated or deleted in various human cancers, antagonizes PI3K signaling by dephosphorylating PI(3,4,5)P3 to PI(4,5)P2 (19Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 125-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). PTEN deficiency results in the accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 in cells and an increase in cell motility in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (20Higuchi M. Masuyama N. Fukui Y. Suzuki A. Gotoh Y. Curr.

Activation of Rac downstream of PI3K has been shown to be essential for the formation of membrane protrusions (23Srinivasan S. Wang F. Glavas S. Ott A. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Kalman D. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest the critical roles of PI3K in membrane protrusion and cell migration, it has remained to be determined how PI3K regulates actin filament dynamics, membrane protrusion formation, and polarized cell migration. We now provide evidence that PI3K regulates cofilin dephosphorylation through activation of SSH1L and that PI3K-mediated SSH1L activation is essential for insulin-induced membrane protrusion. Our results suggest a novel signaling mechanism by which PI3K controls actin filament dynamics and membrane protrusion. Materials—Insulin, wortmannin, and monoclonal antibodies against Akt were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Ser-473-phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against PTEN were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

The plasmid for cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged SSH1L (CFP-SSH1L) was constructed by subcloning SSH1L cDNA into pECFP-C1 (Clontech). Plasmid for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged PH domain of Akt (PHAKT) was constructed by subcloning cDNA for the PH domain of rat Akt1 (25Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C.

The pSUPER vector for RNA interference (RNAi) was kindly provided by R. Agami (The Netherlands Cancer Institute) (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). An SSH1L RNAi plasmid (pSUPER-SSH1L) that targets human SSH1L mRNA sequence (5′-TCGTCACCCAAGAAAGATA-3′) was constructed as described (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.

Cells were transfected with expression plasmids by using the FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RNAi, pSUPER-SSH1L was electroporated into MCF-7 cells; about 2 × 106 cells were mixed with plasmid (20 μg) in 400 μl of medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and electroporated at 250 V and 975 microfarads, using Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Cells were used for assays after a 60-h of culture. Phosphatase Assay—Cofilin-His6 expressed in Vero cells was purified and used as a substrate for in vitro phosphatase reaction. 293T cells were lysed in phosphatase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). SSH1L was immunoprecipitated with anti-SSH1L antibody and incubated with purified cofilin-His6 for2hat30 °C. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies specific to cofilin, P-cofilin, and SSH1L. Kinase Assay—MCF-7 cells were lysed in lysis/kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). LIMK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-LIMK1 antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase reaction as described (9Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Cell Staining—MCF-7 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. For staining with antibodies, fixed cells were incubated with 100% methanol. After blocking with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody to P-Akt and rabbit polyclonal antibody to either cofilin or P-cofilin. Rhodamine-phalloidin and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were used to stain F-actin and DNA, respectively. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope or a Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope. Insulin Induces Cofilin Dephosphorylation and SSH1L Activation—Insulin stimulates actin cytoskeletal reorganization and induces changes in cell morphology and motility in a variety of cell types (16Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 27Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Kadowaki T. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate signaling pathways that regulate cofilin activity, we first determined whether insulin stimulation would alter the level of cofilin phosphorylation in cultured cells. Immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific to P-cofilin revealed that exposure of 293T cells with insulin significantly decreased the level of P-cofilin in a time-dependent manner without affecting the total cofilin level (Fig. 1A), a finding which indicates that insulin induces cofilin dephosphorylation in 293T cells. Since insulin was shown to lead to activation of LIMK1 (6Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 5B), this finding raises the possibility that insulin induces activation of cofilin-phosphatases, such as SSH1L, over the activation of LIMK1 to decrease the total P-cofilin level. To test this possibility, we analyzed changes in phosphatase activity of endogenous SSH1L after insulin stimulation. SSH1L was immunoprecipitated with anti-SSH1L antibody and incubated with recombinant cofilin-His6 substrates that contain P-cofilin. As shown in Fig. 1B, insulin exposure induced activation of SSH1L in a time course similar to that of cofilin dephosphorylation. These observations suggest that insulin induces cofilin dephosphorylation through activation of SSH1L.Fig. 5RNAi knockdown of SSH1L inhibits insulin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. A, suppression of SSH1L expression by RNAi. MCF-7 cells were electroporated with control or SSH1L RNAi plasmids, cultured for 44 h, and serum-starved for 16 h. Expression of endogenous SSH1L and LIMK1 was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SSH1L and anti-LIMK1 antibodies. As shown in B, SSH1L RNAi abolishes insulin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. MCF-7 cells transfected with RNAi plasmids were serum-starved and stimulated with insulin for the indicated periods, and cell lysates were immunoblotted for P-cofilin, cofilin, P-Akt, and Akt, as indicated. For kinase activity of LIMK1, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-LIMK1 antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase reaction, using cofilin-His6 as a substrate. Reaction mixtures were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography (32P-cofilin) and Amido Black staining (cofilin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Insulin-induced Cofilin Dephosphorylation and SSH1L Activation Depend on PI3K Activity—PI3K is implicated in many cellular responses, including metabolism, growth, apoptosis, actin reorganization, and polarized cell migration (16Saltiel A.R.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 466-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This kinase plays a major role in insulin signaling pathways, but the role of PI3K in insulin-induced actin reorganization has remained unclear (16Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 28Tobe K. Asai S. Matuoka K. Yamamoto T. Chida K. Kaburagi Y. Akanuma Y. Kuroki T. Takenawa T. Kimura S. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When we examined effects of wortmannin and LY294002, specific inhibitors for PI3K, on insulin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and SSH1L activation, we found that preincubation of 293T cells with wortmannin or LY294002 inhibited both (Fig. 1, C and D, top panel). By monitoring the level of P-Akt, an active form of Akt that is produced following PI3K activation (29Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), we confirmed the efficient inhibition of PI3K activity by these inhibitors (Fig. 1C, third panel). These results strongly suggest that PI3K mediates insulin-induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation. In addition, the level of P-cofilin was decreased by ectopic expression of SSH1L, and it was reverted to the control level by treatment of cells with wortmannin for 1 h (Fig. 1E), which suggests that PI3K activity is critical for SSH1L to elicit cofilin-dephosphorylating activity in cultured cells. PTEN Negatively Regulates Cofilin Dephosphorylation—PTEN antagonizes PI3K signaling by dephosphorylating PI(3,4,5)P3 (19Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 125-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). To further examine the involvement of PI3K and its product PI(3,4,5)P3 in the regulation of cofilin dephosphorylation, we overexpressed either WT or CS PTEN in 293T cells and analyzed the P-cofilin level. Expression of PTEN(WT) led to a significant increase in the P-cofilin level, whereas PTEN(CS) slightly reduced it (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of PTEN(WT) with SSH1L suppressed the cofilin dephosphorylation induced by SSH1L, whereas PTEN(CS) did not do so (Fig. 2B), which further supports the notion that cofilin-phosphatase activity of SSH1L depends on the level of PI(3,4,5)P3. We next compared cellular P-cofilin levels in PTEN+/- and PTEN-/- MEFs (22Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). As Stambolic et al. reported (22Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar), the level of P-Akt was elevated in PTEN-/- MEFs, as compared with that in PTEN+/- MEFs (Fig. 2C, third panel). Cofilin and ADF were phosphorylated to a lesser extent in PTEN-/- MEF cells (Fig. 2C, top panel). These results suggest that PTEN negatively regulates cofilin dephosphorylation, probably by decreasing the cellular content of PI(3,4,5)P3. Contrarily, PI3K and its product PI(3,4,5)P3 seem to play a role in promoting cofilin dephosphorylation and reactivation. Accumulation of SSH1L and PI(3,4,5)P3 in Insulin-induced Membrane Protrusions—To examine the subcellular localization of SSH1L and PI(3,4,5)P3 before and after insulin stimulation, we used CFP-tagged SSH1L and YFP-tagged PHAKT (a PH domain of Akt), which specifically binds to PI(3,4,5)P3 and was utilized to assign the spatial distribution of PI(3,4,5)P3 (30Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). To avoid the inhibitory effect on downstream signaling of PI3K by high expression of PHAKT (31Wang Q. Liu L. Pei L. Ju W. Ahmadian G. Lu J. Wang Y. Liu F. Wang Y.T. Neuron. 2003; 38: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), MCF-7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for CFP-SSH1L and YFP-PHAKT with a molar ratio of 5:1. In the absence of insulin, cells had a flat shape, and both CFP-SSH1L and YFP-PHAKT were diffusely localized in the cytoplasm and cell periphery (Fig. 3A, upper panels). In contrast, after exposure to insulin, the cells altered their shapes with several F-actin-rich membrane protrusions (Fig. 3A, lower panels). In insulin-stimulated cells, both CFP-SSH1L and YFP-PHAKT co-localized with F-actin and accumulated together onto membrane protrusions (Fig. 3A, lower panels). These observations suggest that insulin stimulation leads to accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and SSH1L onto membrane protrusions. Inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin almost completely blocked insulin-induced cell shape changes and accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and SSH1L in membrane protrusions (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that accumulation of SSH1L to membrane protrusions depends on PI3K activity and that local accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 is critical for recruitment of SSH1L to membrane protrusions. Accumulation of Cofilin, but Not P-cofilin, in Insulin-induced Membrane Protrusions—Accumulation of CFP-SSH1L in membrane protrusions of insulin-stimulated cells suggests that cofilin dephosphorylation preferentially occurs at the protrusions after insulin stimulation. We examined the localization of cofilin and P-cofilin, together with P-Akt (as a marker for activation of PI3K-Akt pathway), in MCF-7 cells before and after insulin stimulation. In non-stimulated cells, both cofilin and P-cofilin distributed uniformly throughout the cell, and the P-Akt signal was barely detectable (Fig. 4, A and B, upper panels). Interestingly, insulin stimulation induced a significant accumulation of cofilin and P-Akt at membrane protrusions (Fig. 4A, lower panels). In contrast, P-cofilin was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and was not concentrated in the regions of membrane protrusions where P-Akt was concentrated; therefore, P-cofilin signals poorly overlapped with P-Akt signals (Fig. 4B, lower panels). Thus, non-phosphorylated (active) cofilin is the major component of cofilin signals that accumulated in membrane protrusions. Because SSH1L accumulates in insulin-induced membrane protrusions, it probably functions to stimulate cofilin dephosphorylation. Similar to our observations, Dawe et al. (32Dawe H.R. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. Cramer L.P. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 252-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) recently showed that cofilin exists at the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts but P-cofilin was depleted from it. Accordingly, enhancement of cofilin dephosphorylation by SSH1L may generally occur at membrane protrusions where rapid actin turnover is required. SSH1L Is Essential for Insulin-induced Cofilin Dephosphorylation and Morphological Changes—To further examine the cellular function of SSH1L in insulin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation and cell morphological changes, SSH1L expression in MCF-7 cells was suppressed by RNAi. We transfected by electroporation control or SSH1L RNAi plasmids (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) that direct the synthesis of short interfering RNAs, into MCF-7 cells. Transfection efficiency exceeded 90%. Immunoblot analysis revealed that transfection of SSH1L RNAi plasmids efficiently suppressed expression of endogenous SSH1L protein but had no apparent effect on LIMK1 expression (Fig. 5A). Suppression of SSH1L expression led to an increase in the basal level of P-cofilin in non-stimulated cells (Fig. 5B, top panel, 0 min). In cells transfected with a control RNAi vector, insulin stimulation induced rapid dephosphorylation of cofilin (Fig. 5B, top panel). In contrast, in cells transfected with SSH1L RNAi plasmids, the levels of P-cofilin did not change (or slightly increased) after insulin treatment for 5-30 min (Fig. 5B, top panel), which suggests that SSH1L plays an essential role in insulin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation. In parallel experiments, RNAi of SSH1L did not affect the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 5B, third panel) and activation of LIMK1 (Fig. 5B, fifth panel). We then examined the effects of SSH1L RNAi on insulin-induced actin reorganization and cell morphological changes in MCF-7 cells. SSH1L RNAi had no apparent effect in the absence of insulin (Fig. 6A, upper panels), but it remarkably suppressed insulin-induced cell shape changes, including cell dissemination and membrane protrusion formation (Fig. 6A, lower panels). Quantitative analyses of the percentages of cells with extended membrane protrusions before and after insulin treatment further indicate that SSH1L RNAi suppressed the membrane protrusion formation (Fig. 6B). Pretreatment with wortmannin also inhibited insulin-induced morphological changes (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that SSH1L as well as PI3K play a critical role in insulin-induced cell shape alterations. On the other hand, phalloidin staining revealed that SSH1L RNAi did not suppress insulin-induced F-actin assembly, whereas wortmannin did do so (Fig. 6A, arrows). Thus, PI3K, but not SSH1L, seems to be involved in insulin-induced actin filament assembly. Cofilin activity is reversibly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser-3. Phosphorylation of cofilin by LIMK or TESK hinders the interaction between cofilin and actin, thereby inhibiting actin-depolymerizing and -severing activity of cofilin. Phosphorylated cofilin is dephosphorylated and reactivated by SSH (11Niwa R. Nagata-Ohashi K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Although LIMK1 is known to be activated in response to various extracellular stimuli, including lysophosphatidic acid, stromal cell-derived factor-1α, and insulin, through Rho family small GTPases (6Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 9Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 10Nishita M. Aizawa H. Mizuno K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it remained to be determined whether the activity of SSH is regulated in response to extracellular stimuli, and if so, what signaling components are involved in such regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that the phosphatase activity of SSH1L is stimulated by insulin. Using specific inhibitors for PI3K, we also provided evidence that PI3K mediates insulin-induced SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation. Consistent with these results, loss of PTEN gene in MEFs led to reduction of P-cofilin levels, and overexpression of PTEN increased P-cofilin levels. Since PTEN antagonizes PI3K activity by dephosphorylating PI(3,4,5)P3, the intracellular level of PI(3,4,5)P3 seems to play a critical role in determining the level of cofilin phosphorylation and SSH1L activity. Since PTEN-/- MEFs migrate faster than PTEN+/- or wild-type MEFs (20Higuchi M. Masuyama N. Fukui Y. Suzuki A. Gotoh Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1958-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Liliental J. Moon S.Y. Lesche R. Mamillapalli R. Li D. Zheng Y. Sun H. Wu H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 401-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), an intriguing possibility is that an increase in the content of the non-phosphorylated (active) form of cofilin in PTEN-/- MEFs contributes, at least in part, to their higher migrating activity. It has been unknown whether other SSH family members (i.e. SSH2L and SSH3L) are also activated in response to insulin stimulation. However, because SSH1L RNAi almost completely suppressed the insulin-induced cofilin dephosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, SSH1L seems to be a major cofilin phosphatase that functions in response to insulin in MCF-7 cells. Actin filament assembly occurs as an initial step in membrane protrusion. Since SSH1L RNAi did not block insulin-induced actin filament assembly, SSH1L might not be essential for this step of membrane protrusion. In the later stages of membrane protrusion, rapid turnover of actin filaments is critical, composed of continuous assembly at the barbed ends and concomitant disassembly at the pointed ends. As cofilin plays an essential role in actin filament turnover by depolymerizing and severing actin filaments (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar, 2Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 3Bailly M. Jones G.E. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R128-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), our results suggest that SSH1L accumulating in membrane protrusions plays a critical role in the later stages of membrane protrusion by dephosphorylating and reactivating cofilin. In support of this idea, overexpression of active LIMK1 that causes aberrant phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin suppressed membrane protrusion and cell motility (4Zebda N. Bernard O. Bailly M. Welti S. Lawrence D.S. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 5Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, insulin activates LIMK1, and insulin-induced membrane ruffling is inhibited by kinase-dead LIMK1 (6Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Thus, spatially and temporarily coordinated activation of both LIMK1 and SSH1L seems to be important for insulin-induced membrane protrusion. Well controlled activation of LIMK1 induced by insulin may play a role in the initial step of membrane protrusion by stabilizing actin filaments. Otherwise, LIMK1 may contribute to rapid actin turnover in cooperation with SSH1L by accelerating the recycling of cofilin and actin by releasing free actin and cofilin from an actin-cofilin complex, which is generated from the pointed end of actin filaments by the depolymerizing action of cofilin (33Rosenblatt J. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1998; 393: 739-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that SSH1L is activated and recruited to membrane protrusions downstream of PI3K activity and that it plays a critical role in insulin-induced membrane protrusion and cell shape changes. Although this study focused on insulin action, we have data demonstrating that cell stimulation with other growth factors and chemokines that stimulate cell motility also induces SSH1L activation and cofilin dephosphorylation through PI3K activation. Given the essential roles of cofilin and PI3K in actin cytoskeletal reorganization and polarized cell movement (3Bailly M. Jones G.E. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R128-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Weiner O.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), further studies on signaling pathways linking PI3K activity to SSH1L activation will be important to elucidate mechanisms governing how cells establish and maintain actin filament dynamics at the leading edge of migrating cells for directed cell movement.

Recent structural studies on the bacterial K(v)AP potassium channel have led to a new model of voltage sensing in which S4 lies in the lipid at the channel periphery and moves through the membrane as a unit with a portion of S3. Here we describe accessibility probing and disulfide scanning experiments aimed at determining how well the K(v)AP model describes the Drosophila Shaker potassium channel. We find that the S1-S3 helices have one end that is externally exposed, S3 does not undergo a transmembrane motion, and S4 lies in close apposition to the pore domain in the resting and activated state."

In the yeast PDC, convincing evidence has been presented that the E3BP component is bound by its I domain binding inside the dodecahedron formed completely by the I domain of E2 (21Stoops J.K.

A 60/12 addition model has been proposed for mammalian E2·E3BP (16Sanderson S.J. Miller C.M. Lindsay G.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In part, this model was favored based on the results with the yeast system, and the fact that the smallest symmetry element in the dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal faces. In contrast to the yeast system, resolved bovine E3BP, which retained the capacity to bind E3 and had a functional lipoyl domain, failed to bind back to assembled E2 under non-chaotropic conditions or after a rapid transition to less chaotropic conditions (8Rahmatullah M.

The sequence alignments of the human and yeast E2 and E3BP components (see Supplemental Material Fig. 1S) show that mammalian E3BP is closely related to mammalian E2 (18Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Wu P. Jeng J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19746-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The alignment shows that both lipoyl domains in human E2 are equally related to the L3 domain of human E3BP, that there is little basis for aligning linker regions, and that the linker regions are very different in yeast components. Of particular importance for assembly of the E2·E3BP complex, the I and I′ domains of mammalian E2 and E3BP, respectively, are closely related in sequence and size. In marked contrast, the inner domain of yeast E3BP has no clear relationship to the inner domain of human or yeast E2 or to human E3BP based on its amino acid sequence and size (Supplemental Material, Fig. 1S). Although it is clear that the I domain of human E2 and I′ domain of human E3BP are homologs, it is interesting to note that there is a large increase in the number of charged residues in the I′ domain of E3BP and a decrease in histidine residues (Fig. 1), including one required for catalysis of the transacetylation reaction (18Harris R.A.

Differences in the Stokes radii, apparent density, and non-ideality in equilibrium sedimentation between human E2 and E2·E3BP, uncovered in this work, may be related to these differences in the electrostatic properties of E2 and E3BP (Fig. 1) and amino acid composition of the linker regions (Supplemental Material Fig. 1S) (see “Discussion”). Given these structural relationships, the previously proposed 60/12 addition model (16Sanderson S.J. Miller C.M. Lindsay G.J. Eur. J.

The E2-binding I′ domain of mammalian E3BP might take advantage of structural properties that derive from its close structural relationship to the I domain of E2. Here we provide evidence from a combination of studies that association of E3BP in the mammalian complex involves a substitution process rather than addition of E3BP to the E2 60-mer. Materials and Methods—The construction of vectors for preparation of His tag free E1 (tag removed by PreScission protease) and the vectors for expressing E2, E2 plus E3BP, sc-E2 that contains a PreScission site in the third linker region and a series of modified constructs will be described elsewhere. 2Y.

C. Baker, M. Sadler, and T. E. Roche, manuscript in preparation. We have developed extensively revised conditions for the preparation of human E2 and E2·E3BP (see Supplemental Material, Experimental Procedures). Slab Gel Electrophoresis and Densitometric Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed with the standard Laemmli system (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) with 10% acrylamide in the separating gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 14 mA and 4 °C. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Band intensities were quantified with a Hewlett-Packard scanner, and the area density was analyzed by ImageQuant version 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) Studies of E2 and E2·E3BP and Their Complexes—Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted at 20 °C by using an Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge using the 4-hole An-60 Ti rotor with loading of 370-400 μl of sample and 400-450 μl of matching buffer into 12-mm charcoal-filled double sector cells. Following an initial scan at 3,000 rpm to check the total absorbance and detect very large aggregates, sedimentation velocity runs were conducted at the desired speed with scans continuously collected at a 2-7-min interval with absorption optics (usually at 280 nm but also at 450 nm) and/or interference optics that are analyzed by time derivative procedures (37Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 38Stafford W.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 303-325Google Scholar, 39Philo J.S. Anal.

Sedimentation profiles, including a consecutive set of at least four scans, were analyzed to obtain the apparent distribution of sedimentation coefficient g(s*) by using DCDT+ software version 1.16 provided by J. S. Philo (www.jphilo.mailway.com) (39Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient was calculated by using g(s*) fitting function in DCDT+ software (39Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 40Stafford W.F. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Acquisition and Interpretation of Data for Biological and Synthetic Polymer Systems. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 119-137Crossref Google Scholar). Buffer density and viscosity were calculated by Sednterp version 1.08 (www.jphilo.mailway.com). Partial specific volumes for E1, E3, E2, t-E2, E248·E3BP12, and E260·E3BP12, calculated based on their amino acid compositions using Sednterp, are 0.7339, 0.7414, 0.7462, 0.7485, 0.7459, and 0.7459 ml/g at 20 °C, respectively. In the calculation of the translational frictional coefficient ratios, f/f0, and Stokes radii, Rs, of protein components and their complexes, masses based on the amino acid sequence of constructs (below) and the above partial specific volumes of protein components were used to calculate R0 (i.e. Stokes radii for the unhydrated sphere of the same mass and density). Two different procedures (42Hiromasa Y. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33681-33693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were used to analyze sedimentation velocity results in order to estimate the fraction of E1 or E3 component bound to the E2 or E2·E3BP. When a significant portion of a component was both bound and free, the level of free component was estimated by determining the change in concentration of trailing component in the presence versus the absence of E2 oligomer using absorption optics. The base line was determined by over-speed methods at the end of the run. The bound component was also estimated from the increase in the rapidly sedimenting complex due to bound component (fringe ratio method). The g(s*) analysis in DCDT+ software gave the g(s*) distribution and extrapolated to the initial fringe. The initial fringe of complex fraction (i.e. E1-E260) was calculated above the 20 S region of the g(s*) distribution. The initial fringe of the complex fraction was then compared with that of E2 or E2·E3BP alone determined in the same manner. Refractive increments (fringe) are nearly constant for proteins (43Babul J. Stellwagen E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 28: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 44Schachman H.K. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 3-15Google Scholar, and 59Laue T.M. Beckman Application Information A-1821A. 1996; : 1-17Google Scholar). The fringe ratio between E2 or E2·E3BP complex to E1 or E3 and E2 or E2·E3BP alone provides a weight concentration ratio. The number of bound E1 per E2 60-mer is as follows: ((fringe of E1-E2/ fringe of E2)-1) × M of E2 60-mer/M of E1 tetramer, where M is the calculated molecular mass. In the case of E1 or E3 binding to E2·E3BP, a model-dependent molecular mass for E2·E3BP is substituted for the M of E2 in this equation. Sedimentation equilibrium studies on E2 and E2·E3BP were conducted using three charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces with 6-sector cells. Normally, 50-μl samples were overlaid over 25 μl of Fluorinert® FC-43 silicon oil (3M Industrial Chemical Products Division), and 100 μl of matched solvent was introduced in the reference position. Each protein was evaluated at three concentrations, and equilibrium was attained at six rotor speeds. Following equilibration at the lowest speed during the 30-h period, at least an 8-h equilibration time was used for the transition to a higher speed. The stability of the concentration gradient established was confirmed over at least a 4-h period before making final measurements. The equilibrated protein gradients and their solvent controls were scanned 10 times at 0.001-cm intervals; the difference between the averaged sample and solvent boundaries yielded the equilibrium boundary of the solute protein. Sedimentation equilibrium data were evaluated with Beckman software (version 4) that was provided with the Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge. Additional analyses were required because there was a decrease in mass with increasing concentration of sample. This indicates a non-ideality (molecular crowding) that is characteristic of a large solvent-filled or asymmetric molecule with substantial electrostatic repulsion (see “Discussion”). For the different speeds and concentrations, the apparent molecular weight, Mapp, was plotted against the concentration (A280 nm); these Mapp values were based on 20 points (0.02 cm) and were recalculated at each 0.001-cm interval. Mapp estimates within a 0.01 A280 nm interval were averaged for all the above. From plots of these average Mapp and of 1/Mapp versus concentration in mg/ml, the molecular weight, M, was estimated by extrapolation to zero concentration (45Chatelier R.C. Minton A.P. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 46Cole N. Ralston G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 47Minton A.P.

Academic Press, New York1962: 119-129Google Scholar). For conversion of A280 nm values to mg/ml, 1.34 mg/ml has a A280 nm of 1 for 1-cm light path (or 0.75 A280 nm per mg/ml). With 1.2-cm light path in the centrifuge, this was 1.154 mg/ml E2 per/1 A at 280 nm. The concentration dependence of Mapp, for a single solute is described by Equation 1, Mapp=M/(1+c(dlnγ/dc)) where c is the concentration of protein solute (w/v, g/liter), and γ is its activity coefficient (45Chatelier R.C. Minton A.P. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The estimated d lnγ/dc, the slope of the 1/Mapp versus c plot, was evaluated by using a simple model in which the excluded volume of the solute was estimated using the first virial coefficient (B2) for an equivalent hard sphere (45Chatelier R.C. Minton A.P. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), so that M(d lnγ/dc) = B2 = 8 Ve, where Ve, like B2, has units of liter/g and is an approximation of the effective excluded volume occupied by 1 g of solute. We applied a linear fit to the change in 1/Mapp with concentration, so that we did not fit our results with higher order virial coefficients that have a higher order dependence on concentration. We used Ve to calculate the excluded volume radius, Re. Calculated Subunit, Component, and E2 Oligomer Masses—Masses of components and complexes were calculated from the amino acid sequence of our constructs using the PeptideMass program at the ExPASy site (us.expasy.org/) with cofactors (lipoyl groups on E2 and E3BP and FAD on E3) added for masses used in evaluating AUC data.

It has long been recognized that members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of signal transduction molecules undergo down-regulation in response to activation. Previous reports have indicated that key steps in PKCα desensitization include caveolar internalization, priming site dephosphorylation, ubiquitination of the dephosphorylated protein, and degradation by the proteasome. In the current study, comparative analysis of PKCα processing induced by the PKC agonists phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and bryostatin 1 in IEC-18 rat intestinal epithelial cells demonstrates that: (a) at least two pathways of PKCα down-regulation can co-exist within cells, and (b) a single PKC agonist can activate both pathways at the same time. Using a combined biochemical and morphological approach, we identify a novel pathway of PKCα desensitization that involves ubiquitination of mature, fully phosphorylated activated enzyme at the plasma membrane and subsequent down-regulation by the proteasome. The phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A accelerated PKCα down-regulation and inhibitors of vesicular trafficking did not prevent degradation of the protein, indicating that neither internalization nor priming site dephosphorylation are requisite intermediate steps in this ubiquitin/proteasome dependent pathway of PKCα down-regulation. Instead, caveolar trafficking and dephosphorylation are involved in a second, proteasome-independent mechanism of PKCα desensitization in this system.

Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D406-D423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), differentiation (2Clemens M.J. Trayner I. Menaya J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 881-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), apoptosis (3Deacon E.M. Pongracz J. Griffiths G. Lord J.M. Mol. Pathol. 1997; 50: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and survival (4Whelan R.D. Parker P.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The tumor promoting properties of PKC agonists such as phorbol esters, together with evidence for changes in the expression and/or activity of PKC isozymes in a variety of malignancies, point to a role for altered PKC signaling in neoplastic transformation (e.g. Ref. 5Black J.D. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1868-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Strict control of PKC function is achieved by two coordinated mechanisms: consecutive phosphorylation on three “priming sites” (activation loop, turn motif, and hydrophobic motif), which is required for catalytic competence (6Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and binding of second messengers (diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine), which promotes membrane targeting required for conformational activation (7Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Membrane compartmentalization of PKC is stabilized by binding of the enzyme to anchoring proteins that interact exclusively with the active kinase (8Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). As a consequence of such spatial control, PKC is sequestered in the vicinity of its substrates and performs its biological function(s) through substrate phosphorylation. The active species of PKC shows markedly enhanced sensitivity to priming site dephosphorylation (i.e. inactivation) by cellular phosphatases, indicating that phosphorylated residues are more exposed in the membrane-bound active conformation of the enzyme (9Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Notably, recent studies identified a regulatory role of molecular chaperones, such as heat-shock proteins (e.g. Hsp70), in sustaining the signaling lifetime of the active kinase by allowing it to become rephosphorylated and cycle back into the pool of functional enzyme (12Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31585-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). protein kinase C N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO bisindolylmaleimide I bryostatin 1 calyculin A cycloheximide lactacystin okadaic acid phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate immunoprecipitation phosphate-buffered saline tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. PKC signaling is also controlled by desensitization mechanisms. The transduction of signals triggered by external stimuli such as growth/differentiation factors can be terminated through desensitization of membrane receptors and/or down-regulation of downstream signal transducers. Despite their importance, however, desensitization pathways are less understood than the steps involved in signal generation and transduction. It has long been recognized that activation of PKC isozymes by physiological (e.g. hormones and growth factors (13Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or nonphysiological agonists (e.g. phorbol esters, bryostatin 1 (Bryo)) ultimately leads to enzyme inactivation and down-regulation through a post-transcriptional mechanism (14Parker P.J. Bosca L. Dekker L. Goode N.T. Hajibagheri N. Hansra G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that the tumor promoting properties of phorbol esters, and of the PKC enzyme system itself, are critically tied to PKC isozyme desensitization. Intestinal tumorigenesis, for example, is associated with a marked reduction in levels of PKC isozyme expression and activity that appears to provide a growth advantage to these cells (5Black J.D. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1868-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Scaglione-Sewell B. Abraham C. Bissonnette M. Skarosi S.F. Hart J. Davidson N.O. Wali R.K. Davis B.H. Sitrin M. Brasitus T.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1074-1081PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of the desensitization pathways for these molecules is, therefore, of key importance. Although understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying inactivation of PKC signaling is limited, studies with PKCα and ϵ have indicated that a key step in the process is dephosphorylation of the priming sites on the enzyme (16Lee H.W.

The dephosphorylated species is then thought to undergo ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation by the 26 S proteasome, a large multicatalytic protease complex (17Lee H.W. Smith L. Pettit G.R.

Studies using exogenously expressed protein have further suggested that down-regulation of PKCα involves internalization of the active enzyme through a caveolae-dependent mechanism, followed by multisite dephosphorylation and down-regulation in a perinuclear compartment (22Prevostel C. Alice V. Joubert D. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2575-2584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, recent studies have indicated that, in contrast to PKCα and ϵ, PKCδ requires phosphorylation for ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation in response to phorbol esters and serum in NIH 3T3 cells (23Srivastava J. Procyk K.J. Iturrioz X. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), pointing to the existence of isozyme-specific mechanisms of PKC down-regulation. In the current study, comparison of the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and Bryo on PKCα expression/activity in intestinal epithelial cells unveiled a previously undescribed mechanism of PKCα down-regulation and distinguished at least two pathways of PKCα desensitization. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that a major pathway for PKCα down-regulation involves ubiquitination of the fully phosphorylated, mature enzyme at the plasma membrane and subsequent degradation through a proteasome-dependent mechanism. Phosphatase inhibitors accelerated PKCα processing and inhibitors of vesicular trafficking did not prevent degradation of the enzyme; thus, neither dephosphorylation of priming sites nor internalization are required for this pathway of PKCα down-regulation. We also provide evidence for the existence of a second pathway of PKCα desensitization that involves caveolae-dependent trafficking of the active enzyme to a perinuclear compartment, removal of priming phosphates, and degradation of the dephosphorylated species through a proteasome-independent mechanism. These studies indicate that PKC agonists can activate more than one pathway of PKCα down-regulation and that the localization and phosphorylation state of the enzyme induced by a particular agonist may be critical determinant(s) of PKC isozyme desensitization mechanisms. Antibodies—PKCα-specific antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (UBI; mouse monoclonal anti-catalytic domain), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (H-7 and C-20) and BD Transduction Laboratories (mouse monoclonal; BD anti-PKCα antibody). Rabbit anti-phospho-Thr638 PKCα (P638) and anti-phospho-Ser657 PKCα (P657) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology and UBI, respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) IgG1-agarose conjugate, anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) antibody, and anti-PP2Ac antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and BD Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and rat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from Chemicon International and Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, respectively. TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs. Cell Culture and Drug Treatment Protocols—The IEC-18 cell line (ATCC CRL-1589), a nontransformed intestinal crypt cell line derived from rat ileal epithelium, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 5% fetal bovine serum (Intergen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. PKC isozymes were activated in IEC-18 cells by treatment with 100 nm PMA (Sigma) or 100 nm Bryo (Biomol or LC Laboratories) for various times. Control cells were treated with appropriate vehicle (see below). PKCα kinase activity was inhibited using 5 μm bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM). Proteasome and/or calpain activity was inhibited with 25 μm lactacystin (Lacta; Dr. E. J. Corey, Harvard University or Biomol), 150 μmN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN; Calbiochem), 50 μm E-64 (Biomol), or a combination of Lacta and E-64. Caveolar trafficking was inhibited using the cholesterol-binding drug nystatin (50 μg/ml; Calbiochem) and protein synthesis was inhibited with 200 μm cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma). With the exception of nystatin, which was added 1 h prior to PMA or Bryo, all inhibitory treatments were initiated 30 min before PKC agonist exposure. The activity of cellular phosphatases was inhibited by preincubation with various concentrations of okadaic acid, sodium salt (OA; Calbiochem or LC Laboratories) or calyculin A (Cal A; Sigma or LC Laboratories) for 1 h or 30 min, respectively. The following solvents were used to prepare drug stock solutions: ethanol for PMA, Bryo, and CHX; Me2SO for BIM, OA, Cal A, ALLN, and E-64, and double distilled water for Lacta. Nystatin was freshly prepared as a 2.5 mg/ml suspension in double distilled water. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates and Subcellular Fractions—For preparation of whole cell lysates, cells were harvested in boiling SDS lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS), boiled for 5 min, and sheared by 5–10 passes through a 27-gauge needle. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation (10 min; 10,000 × g, room temperature). Cytosolic and membrane subcellular fractions were prepared as we have described (24Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The cytoskeletal/Triton X-100-insoluble (Triton-insoluble) fraction was isolated from the Triton-insoluble pellet as described (25Sonnenburg E.D. Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45289-45297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined in quadruplicate by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) and lysates and subcellular fractions were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min before being subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation (IP)—To immunoprecipitate PKCα, cells were lysed in boiling 1% SDS lysis buffer as described above. Lysates containing 500 μg of protein were diluted in IP buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide and protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixtures). A two-step IP protocol (Protocol A) using a mixture of PKCα-specific antibodies was used to maximize immunoprecipitation of PKCα species (i.e. phosphorylated, nonphosphorylated, and ubiquitinated forms of the enzyme). Step 1 involved overnight incubation of diluted lysates with 2.5 μg of BD anti-PKCα antibody, followed by a 1-h incubation with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocomplexes were then pelleted, washed 6 times in IP buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. In Step 2, the remaining supernatant was further incubated (3 h) with a mixture of anti-PKCα antibodies including H-7, C-20, and P657 (2 μg each). Immunocomplexes were collected with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (2 h) and processed as described in Step 1. Immunoprecipitates from Steps 1 and 2 were combined and subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-PKCα and anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting. To specifically immunoprecipitate phosphorylated PKCα (Protocol B), diluted lysates were incubated overnight with 3 μl of P638 and 2 μg of P657 antibodies and immunocomplexes were collected with protein A/G-agarose beads as above. To immunoprecipitate ubiquitinated proteins, IEC-18 cell lysates containing 600 μg of protein were first precleared as follows: samples were incubated for 10 min with 2 μg of normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by addition of 30 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose for another 30 min; the pelleted beads were discarded. Precleared lysates were incubated with 20 μl of anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) IgG1-agarose conjugate overnight. Immunocomplexes were pelleted, processed as described above, and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-PKCα or P657 antibodies. [35S]Met/Cys-Metabolic Labeling of PKCα and Chase Analysis—Cell cultures grown in 10-cm plates were incubated in Met/Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, and 5 μg/ml insulin for 15 min to deplete endogenous Met and Cys. Cells were incubated with 200 μCi of EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 16 h. Radiolabeled cultures were rinsed with warm PBS and 35S was chased for various intervals in label-free complete growth medium containing various drugs as indicated. Following drug treatment, cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and lysed in boiling 1% SDS lysis buffer. Lysates were precleared as described above and PKCα was immunoprecipitated with BD anti-PKCα antibody and subjected to anti-PKCα immunoblotting and autoradiography; 35S was detected using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant Software (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates, subcellular fractions (20–30 μg of protein), and immunoprecipitates were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, which was generally blocked and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were routinely stained with 0.1% Fast green (Sigma) immediately after transfer to ensure equal loading and even transfer. Immunoblotting using P638 and P657 was performed according to protocols provided by the respective manufacturer. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: 1:3000 for PKCα and P638; 1:2000 for P657; 1:1000 for ubiquitin. Horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:2000 or 1:3000. Bound horseradish peroxidase was detected using the SuperSignal CL System (Pierce) and Kodak X-Omat AR film. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells grown on glass coverslips were treated as indicated and fixed in 2% formaldehyde/PBS (24Saxon M.L. Zhao X. Black J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 747-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Following washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBS/Triton) for 10 min and incubated in C-20 anti-PKCα antibody (1:50 in PBS/Triton) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed for 30 min in PBS/Triton and incubated in TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100) for 30 min. After washing in PBS/Triton for 30 min, coverslips were mounted with Aquamount (Polysciences) and viewed with a Zeiss Axioskop epifluorescence microscope, using a ×63 Plan Apochromat (1.4 NA) objective lens. The staining patterns observed with the C-20 antibody were confirmed with BD anti-PKCα antibody. A similar protocol was used for immunofluorescence analysis of PP2A in IEC-18 cells; data obtained with monoclonal anti-PP2Ac antibody from Transduction Laboratories were confirmed with polyclonal anti-PP2Ac antibody from UBI. TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100) was used for detection of mouse primary antibody. Images were obtained with a Hamamatsu C7780 digital camera and processed for presentation using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the degradation of activated PKC, the PKC agonists PMA and Bryo (at 100 nm) were compared for their ability to activate and down-regulate PKCα in IEC-18 intestinal epithelial cells. Translocation of the protein to the particulate subcellular fraction was used as a measure of enzyme activation (26Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, both agents promoted redistribution of PKCα from the cytosol to the membrane and Triton-insoluble fractions, although translocation was slightly slower in Bryo-treated cells (as seen at 15 min). Activation of PKCα by either agonist was followed by progressive disappearance of the enzyme (Fig. 1, A and B), an effect that required enzyme catalytic activity because it was blocked by the PKC inhibitor BIM (data not shown). Importantly, Bryo-induced down-regulation of PKCα was accompanied by significant accumulation of a faster migrating species of the enzyme (Fig. 1, A and B), detectable by 30–45 min of treatment (Fig. 1C). In contrast, a high mobility form of PKCα was not detected until later, if detected at all, in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 1, A and B). λ-Phosphatase treatment of PKCα immunoprecipitated from control, Bryo-, or PMA-treated cells confirmed that the high mobility species, which accumulated in both the membrane and Triton-insoluble subcellular fractions (Fig. 1A), corresponded to the nonphosphorylated enzyme (data not shown) (6Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 27Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, this species was not recognized by phosphorylation site-specific antibodies (P657 and P638) (Fig. 1D). Immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions (Fig. 1A) and whole cell lysates (Fig. 1B) revealed that disappearance of mature phosphorylated PKCα during the course of treatment with Bryo was accompanied by progressive accumulation of the nonphosphorylated enzyme, so that by 4 h of chronic exposure to this agent the ratio of the two forms was shifted toward a prevailing amount of the nonphosphorylated protein. In contrast, in PMA-treated samples, the phosphorylated species remained predominant throughout the course of treatment. To determine whether the nonphosphorylated species of PKCα that accumulated in response to PKC agonists in IEC-18 cells was produced by dephosphorylation of the activated mature enzyme, IEC-18 cells were metabolically labeled by 16 h incubation in [35S]Met/Cys-containing medium. The labeling medium was then replaced with complete medium without [35S]Met/Cys and the cells were treated with Bryo or PMA in the presence or absence of BIM for 6 h. PKCα was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates and analyzed by autoradiography and anti-PKCα immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, only mature PKCα was labeled with 35S in control cells (C; open arrowhead). Bryo chased 35S-labeled mature PKCα into a high mobility band (open arrow) that co-migrated with the high mobility nonphosphorylated protein detected by Western blotting (closed arrow). These data demonstrate that the faster migrating species of PKCα produced by Bryo derives from the activated mature enzyme, and confirms that Bryo induces dephosphorylation of PKCα in IEC-18 cells. The accumulation of the Bryo-induced 35S-labeled high mobility species was inhibited by BIM, indicating that PKCα activity is required for dephosphorylation of mature enzyme in Bryo-treated cells. Notably, PMA treatment did not chase 35S-labeled mature PKCα into a faster migrating species, pointing to a different source for the high mobility band sometimes detected in PMA-treated cells. Previous studies have indicated that PMA treatment can cause a delay in post-translational processing of PKCα, resulting in accumulation of nonphosphorylated protein (28Borner C. Filipuzzi I. Wartmann M. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13902-13909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pears C. Stabel S. Cazaubon S. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of de novo protein synthesis to production of the faster migrating form of PKCα by PMA, IEC-18 cells were exposed to this PKC agonist in the absence or presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX. As shown in Fig. 2B, CHX completely prevented accumulation of nonphosphorylated PKCα in PMA-treated cells. These data, together with the inability of PMA to chase 35S-labeled mature PKCα into a faster migrating species (see Fig. 2A), point to de novo protein synthesis as the only source for the nonphosphorylated PKCα observed in response to PMA treatment. Delayed maturation of newly synthesized PKCα protein also appears to contribute to the Bryo-produced high mobility form, because inhibition of protein synthesis reduced the amount of this species at each time point examined (Fig. 2C). Indeed, accumulation of the Bryo-induced faster migrating form of PKCα could only be completely abrogated by combined exposure to BIM (to inhibit dephosphorylation of active mature enzyme) and CHX (to prevent accumulation of newly synthesized protein) (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data indicate that the nonphosphorylated species of PKCα that accumulates in Bryo-treated cells consists of dephosphorylated activated mature enzyme (see 35S data in Fig. 2A) and nonphosphorylated newly synthesized protein (Fig. 2, C and D), whereas the PMA-induced high mobility species represents only nonphosphorylated newly synthesized enzyme (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, PMA does not promote PKCα dephosphorylation in IEC-18 cells, while still inducing down-regulation of the protein. To examine the involvement of calpain and the proteasome in Bryo- and PMA-induced down-regulation of PKCα, IEC-18 cells were treated with these agents for 4 or 16 h in the presence or absence of E-64 (calpain inhibitor), Lacta (a highly specific inhibitor of the proteasome), ALLN (which inhibits the proteasome and calpain), or Lacta + E-64. Western blot analysis revealed that at the 4-h time point, Lacta and ALLN, but not E-64, protected PKCα from Bryo- or PMA-induced down-regulation (Fig. 3A). These data excluded the involvement of calpain and implicated a proteasomal pathway in down-regulation of PKCα by PMA or Bryo in IEC-18 cells. Notably, the form of PKCα protected by proteasome inhibitors was the mature species phosphorylated on Thr638 and Ser657, as indicated by immunoblot analysis using phospho-specific antibodies (P638 and P657) (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of proteasome and/or calpain activity did not result in increased levels of the nonphosphorylated form of the enzyme (Fig. 3A). To exclude the possibility that proteasome inhibitors prevent the dephosphorylation of PKCα induced by Bryo, thus forcing accumulation of the mature species, 35S labeling experiments were performed. IEC-18 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys as described above, and then treated with Bryo in the presence or absence of ALLN in 35S-free medium for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 3B, a radiolabeled faster migrating species (arrows) accumulated in Bryo-treated cells in the presence of ALLN, indicating that inhibition of the proteasome does not block dephosphorylation of the enzyme. Together, these data demonstrate that, despite continued dephosphorylation of PKCα in Bryo-treated cells, proteasome inhibition resulted in selective protection of the mature species, pointing to this form as the substrate for proteasomal processing in IEC-18 cells. These findings further argue that PKC agonist-induced dephosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of PKCα are independent processes. Analysis of IEC-18 cells treated with PKC agonists for 16 h in the presence or absence of proteasome and/or calpain inhibitors yielded an unexpected result (Fig. 3C). Consistent with findings at 4 h of treatment (Fig. 3A), Lacta and ALLN protected PKCα from down-regulation by PMA at 16 h. In contrast, proteasome inhibitors failed to protect PKCα from Bryo-induced down-regulation at this time point. Taken together, the data indicate that PMA induces down-regulation of PKCα mainly through a proteasome-mediated mechanism, whereas down-regulation of the enzyme by Bryo involves both proteasome-dependent and -independent pathways. The data also suggest that the mature, fully phosphorylated form of PKCα is the target for degradation by the proteasome system.

https://openalex.org/W2101897226,"Crystal structures of the ferric and ferrous heme complexes of HmuO, a 24-kDa heme oxygenase of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, have been refined to 1.4 and 1.5 Å resolution, respectively. The HmuO structures show that the heme group is closely sandwiched between the proximal and distal helices. The imidazole group of His-20 is the proximal heme ligand, which closely eclipses the β- and δ-meso axis of the porphyrin ring. A long range hydrogen bonding network is present, connecting the iron-bound water ligand to the solvent water molecule. This enables proton transfer from the solvent to the catalytic site, where the oxygen activation occurs. In comparison to the ferric complex, the proximal and distal helices move closer to the heme plane in the ferrous complex. Together with the kinked distal helix, this movement leaves only the α-meso carbon atom accessible to the iron-bound dioxygen. The heme pocket architecture is responsible for stabilization of the ferric hydroperoxo-active intermediate by preventing premature heterolytic O-O bond cleavage. This allows the enzyme to oxygenate selectively at the α-meso carbon in HmuO catalysis.

Biological heme catabolism is conducted by a family of enzymes termed as heme oxygenase (HO), 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; r.m.s., root mean square; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance. 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; r.m.s., root mean square; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance. which catalyzes oxidative degradation of iron protoporphyrin IX (heme hereafter) to biliverdin IX, iron, and CO in the presence of reducing equivalents (1Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems where electrons are supplied by NADPH through NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (2Schacter B.A. Nelson E.B. Marver H.S. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3601-3607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HO is the enzyme responsible for excess heme excretion and iron recycling (3Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10919-10924Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The product CO has been implicated as a messenger molecule in various physiological functions (4Dioum E.J. Rutter J.

In pathogenic bacteria, HO is essential for heme-based iron acquisition from a host lacking in free extracellular iron (7Wandersman C. Stojilijkovic I. Curr. Opin.

Major advances have been made in understanding the structure and function of HO by using catalytically active, truncated, water-soluble forms of recombinant HO-1, an inducible isoform of mammalian HO (10Takahashi S.

Soc. 1999; 121: 10656-10657Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). HO is not a hemeprotein by itself but utilizes heme as both a prosthetic group and a substrate. In its catalytic cycle, HO first binds 1 eq of heme to form a ferric heme-HO complex (Fig. 1). The first electron donated from the reducing equivalent reduces the heme iron to the ferrous state. Then O2 binds to it to form a meta-stable oxy complex. One-electron reduction of the oxy form generates ferric hydroperoxo, which self-hydroxylates the α-meso carbon of the porphyrin ring to form the ferric α-meso-hydroxyheme intermediate (12Colas C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2305-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Davydov R.M. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10656-10657Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This is different from P450 enzymes, in which the O-O bond of the hydroperoxo is heterolytically cleaved to generate a ferryl (Fe4+=O) hydroxylating active intermediate (14Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). Ferric α-meso-hydroxyheme in HO exits as a ferric oxopholin resonance structure that includes a ferrous porphyrin π neutral radical (11Mansfield Matera K. Takahashi S. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshimura T. Rousseau D.L. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6618-6624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Upon reaction with O2 and one electron, ferric α-meso-hydroxyheme is converted to ferrous verdoheme. This conversion has been proposed to be initiated by the dioxygen reaction with the ferrous porphyrin π neutral radical rather than that with the heme iron (11Mansfield Matera K. Takahashi S.

The mechanism of the last oxygenation step, the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin, is least understood, although the verdoheme iron appears to participate in the oxygen activation process (15Zhang X.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7418-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in a manner similar to that described in the first oxygenation step. Three HO proteins from pathogenic bacteria have been purified: HmuO from Gram-positive Corynebacterium diphtheriae, HemO from Gram-negative Neisseria meningitides, and PigA from Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9Schmitt M.P.

In comparison to the mammalian HO, none of them is membrane-bound, rather they are soluble and have smaller molecular masses: HmuO, 24 kDa; HemO, 26 kDa; and PigA, 23 kDa. HmuO has the highest sequence identity with mammalian HO-1, 33% sequence identity to the first 221 amino acids of human HO-1. Because of the lack of detailed spectroscopic and mutagenesis characterization, the structure and function of HemO and PigA, in comparison to those of HO-1 and HmuO, are not well characterized. The heme-HmuO complex has an iron coordination structure and electronic state analogous to those found in the mammalian HO complexes. Ferric hydroperoxoheme, 2R. M. Davydov, G. C. Chu, M.

Although HmuO and HO-1 share the same molecular mechanism for heme degradation, HmuO is different from HO-1. HmuO has a higher pKa value for the heme-bound water, a less stable oxy form, a slower heme degradation rate, and a higher biliverdin affinity by HmuO (18Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T.

NMR studies on the cyanide-bound heme-HmuO complex show that the heme orientation disorder in HmuO is quite different from that in human HO-1 in solution (21Li Y. Syvitski R.T. Chu G.C. Ikeda-Saito M. La Mar G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6651-6663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Structural information is important to understand the molecular mechanisms of mammalian and bacterial HO catalysis. Crystal structures of the heme complexes of human and rat HO-1 and those of HemO have been determined for their ferric and ferrous derivatives (22Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Although they have provided insights into HO catalytic mechanisms, the following three issues remain to be elucidated. First is the ambiguity of how protons are delivered from the solvent water to the heme site so that the ferric hydroperoxo species and meso-hydroxyheme are formed. The crystal structures of the mammalian HO-1 heme complex indicate the presence of a water network in the distal heme pocket (22Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 23Lad L. Schuller D.J. Shimizu H. Friedman J. Li H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7834-7843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The protons required for ferric hydroperoxo and hydroxyheme formation come from a distal water anchored to the carboxyl group of Asp-140 in HO-1, as revealed by mutagenesis and EPR/ENDOR studies (29Fujii H. Zhang H. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Davydov R.M. Kofman V. Fujii H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) as well as the crystal structure of human HO-1 D140A (24Lad L. Wang J. Li H. Friedman J. Bhaskar B. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the exact route by which the protons are delivered from the water network to the dioxygen-bound heme site prior to the participation from Asp-140 has not been fully identified in the HO-1 crystal structures, although the presence of an extensive hydrogen bonding network has been pointed out in recent NMR studies on the ferric heme complex of human HO-1 (31Syvitski R.T. Li Y. Auclair K. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. La Mar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14296-14297Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whether a similar residue tethers a distal water molecule or a water network exists in the heme-HmuO system as to deliver protons for the first oxygenation step in HmuO catalysis is unknown. A second issue to be addressed is the role of the proximal His in HO catalysis. Spectroscopic studies show that both rat HO-1 and HmuO have a neutral imidazole of the proximal His as the heme axial ligand (10Takahashi S. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Host J.R. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1010-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chu G.C. Tomita T. Sonnichsen F.D. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24490-24496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Initial crystal structures of the human ferric heme-HO-1 complex have reported the presence of hydrogen bonding interaction between the proximal His imidazole group and nearby residues (22Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A strong proximal His hydrogen bonding would promote ionization of the imidazole group which would facilitate cleavage of the hydroperoxo O-O bond (14Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar), resulting in formation of the inactive ferryl species in the first oxygenation step of HO catalysis (12Colas C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2305-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The proximal His hydrogen bonding interaction needs to be reassessed. The crystal structures of human HO-1 have also shown that the proximal His imidazole plane closely eclipses the β- and δ-meso axis of the porphyrin ring (22Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although the implication for this proximal His orientation has never been discussed in the previous crystallographic studies, it would reduce the “push effect” of the proximal His imidazole (14Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar) and assist to stabilize the O-O bond of the iron-bound hydroperoxo (32Ikeda-Saito M. Fujii H. ACS Symp. Ser. 2003; 858: 97-112Crossref Google Scholar). Whether the proximal His of HmuO has such similar orientation remains to be determined. Crystal structure of the heme-HmuO complex would help to clarify these points. Third is how the proximal and distal heme pockets affect the binding of HO to heme and the release of biliverdin, the final product of the HO catalytic pathway. The human HO-1 crystal structures reveal the presence of two molecules in an asymmetric unit with 2 alternate conformations. In one case, the heme group is tightly sandwiched between the proximal and distal helices; in the other, the distal helix is away from the heme, resulting in less restrained heme-helix contact (22Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The latter suggests a more flexible distal helix and has been postulated to promote HO binding to heme and facilitate release of biliverdin (22Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 23Lad L. Schuller D.J. Shimizu H. Friedman J. Li H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7834-7843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because the rat HO-1 and bacterial HemO crystals used for high resolution structural determination have only one molecule per asymmetric unit (26Sugishima M. Sakamoto H. Higashimoto Y. Omata Y. Hayashi S. Noguchi M. Fukuyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45086-45090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Schuller D.J. Zhu W. Stijilijkovic I. Wilks A. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11552-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), this postulate remains to be proven. An HO crystal containing multiple molecules per asymmetric unit would not only elucidate the significance of a flexible distal heme pocket to HO substrate binding and product release but also provide structural factors responsible for the distal helix flexibility. Thus, crystal structure determination of HmuO, the spectroscopic and enzymatic properties of which have been thoroughly characterized (18Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Chu G.C. Tomita T. Sonnichsen F.D. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11686-11692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), will help to resolve the aforementioned issues. In addition, because of the strong sequence homology between the active sites of HO-1 and HmuO, crystal structures of HmuO would reveal structural features essential for HO catalysis. To this end, we have determined the crystal structures of the ferric and ferrous forms of the heme-HmuO complex to 1.4 and 1.5 Å resolution, respectively. Although the heme-HmuO complex has an overall protein fold similar to that of the HO-1 complexes (22Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), there are a number of significant structural differences. The crystal structures of the heme-HmuO complex reveal hydrogen bond network extending from the heme catalytic site to the surface of the molecule through which protons required for oxygen activation could be delivered. Compared with the ferric form, both the proximal and distal helices of the ferrous form are closer to the heme, sterically restricting the orientation of the heme ligand toward the α-meso carbon atom of the porphyrin. This finding reinforces our original proposal that the HO regioselective oxygenation is primarily under steric control (34Takahashi S. Ishikawa K. Takeuchi N. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6002-6006Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Expression and purification of the recombinant HmuO and its reconstitution with heme were carried out as described previously (18Chu G.C. Katakura K. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21319-21325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For crystallization, the purified heme-protein complex was concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml in 20 mm MES buffer, pH 7.0. Crystals suitable for high resolution x-ray structural analysis were obtained by a sitting drop vapor diffusion method from a solution mixed with an equal volume of the protein stock solution and a reservoir solution containing 50 mm MES, pH 5.8, 2.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 230 mm sodium iodide. These crystals belonged to the space group P21 with unit cell parameters of a = 53.8 Å, b = 61.8 Å, c = 108.8 Å, and β = 100.9° and contained three HmuO molecules per 1 asymmetric unit. The crystals of the ferrous form of the heme-HmuO complex were prepared by transferring the native ferric crystals into the reservoir solution containing 10 mm sodium dithionite. The unit cell parameters of the ferrous crystals are a = 53.9 Å, b = 62.9 Å, c = 107.0 Å, and β = 101.2°. For cryogenic data collection, crystals were soaked into the reservoir solution containing 25% sucrose and flash-frozen by cold nitrogen stream. The temperature around the crystals was maintained at 98 K throughout the data collection. The high resolution diffraction data sets were collected with a Rigaku JUPITER CCD (210 mm) for the ferric crystals and a Rigaku R-Axis V imaging plate for the ferrous form using 0.9-Å synchrotron radiation at BL45XU (RIKEN beam line) of SPring-8. Data were integrated, merged, and processed with HKL-2000 (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar), MOSFLM (36Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), and SCALA (36Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). For phase determination (see below), crystals belonging to the space group C2 (37Chu G.C. Park S.-Y. Shiro Y. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were obtained by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method from a solution mixed with equal volumes of a 40 mg/ml protein stock solution and a reservoir solution containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 21% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 200 mm calcium acetate, a condition similar to the one described previously (37Chu G.C. Park S.-Y. Shiro Y. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The C2 crystals had unit cell parameters of a = 122.2 Å, b = 43.6 Å, c = 99.3 Å, and β = 131.6° and contained two molecules per 1 asymmetric unit. The crystal was mounted on a capillary with its original mother liquid and flash-frozen for the cryogenic data collection at 98 K with a cold nitrogen stream. Only this method, otherwise known as “capillary-cryo” (38Yasutake Y. Watanabe S. Yao M. Tanaka Y. Fukunaga Y. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1682-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), provided diffraction data useful for phase determination. Full data set was collected to 2.7 Å resolution with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV2+ imaging plate using a CuKα radiation generated by a Rigaku Ultra-X rotating anode generator. Data processing and reduction were carried out with MOSFLM and SCALA (36Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Phase Determination, Refinement, and Structure Analysis—Initial attempt of phase determination with the 1.7 Å resolution diffraction data from the P21 crystals did not yield useful results. However, phases for the electron density of the C2 crystals were successfully calculated for the 2.7 Å resolution data by molecular replacement method with AMoRe from the CCP4 suites (36Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). A search model was constructed from the structure of human HO-1 (23Lad L. Schuller D.J. Shimizu H. Friedman J. Li H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7834-7843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank entry 1N45) by mutating residues not conserved between HmuO and human HO-1 to Ala. The rotation and translation searches were performed with the data in 10 to 3.5 Å resolution range. This led to a clear solution for two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The phases were calculated from the molecular replacement solutions up to 3.5 Å and then extended to 2.7 Å by density modification including solvent flattening, averaging between two molecules, and histogram matching with program DM from the CCP4 suites (36Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). In the end, an electron density map of sufficient quality for model fitting was obtained. An HmuO model was built into the electron density map by using the program O (39Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.E. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 100-119Google Scholar) and then refined to fit to the observed structure factors by using rigid body refinement and simulated annealing with a torsion angle by CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Reak R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) to an R factor of 0.324 and Rfree factor of 0.380. Throughout the refinement, noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied. This roughly refined model was then used as a search model for molecular replacement with the diffraction data from the P21 crystals. Molecular replacement solution was successfully obtained with the data in a range of 15 to 4 Å resolution using the program EPMR (41Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), a program implementing six-dimensional searches with evolutionary algorithm. The crystallographic refinements with simulated annealing and individual B factor refinement with CNS was performed to calculate unbiased model by using the data from 12 to 1.4 Å resolution range, which yielded an R factor of 0.220 and Rfree factor of 0.235. In the course of the refinement, water molecules were added to the model by manual inspection of their positions in both 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps. In addition, one sucrose molecule and six sulfate anions were assigned to the electron density. The model was further refined using the maximum likelihood target with the program REFMAC5 (42Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 50: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). After including additional water molecules, introducing alternative conformations for several residues, and modeling individual anisotropic thermal motions, the R and Rfree factors dropped to 0.165 and 0.192, respectively. The Fo - Fc omit electron density map calculated without the model around the heme pockets and the 2Fo - Fc map calculated after several cycles of unrestrained refinement were used to confirm the reliability of the structures around the heme pockets. The structure of the ferrous heme-HmuO complex was also refined by the same method using the data from 12 to 1.5 Å resolution range. R and Rfree factors for the ferrous complex are 0.177 of 0.202, respectively. Final refinement statistics for the ferric and ferrous heme-HmuO complex structures are summarized in Table I. Throughout the model building and refinement process, 10% of the reflections were excluded to monitor the Rfree value. Several residues located at the N- and C-terminal regions were not visible in the electron density map probably due to their disorder. Coordinates and structural factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession numbers of 1IW0 and 1IW1 for the ferric and ferrous forms, respectively.Table IStatistics of data collection and structure refinementFerricFerrousData collectionResolution range (Å)99−1.3 (1.34−1.30)44−1.5 (1.58−1.50)Total no. reflections542,325651,990No. unique reflections146,822110,939Mosaicity (°)0.460.86I/σ18.08 (0.87)11.7 (2.2)Completeness (%)85.0 (58.6)99.0 (98.7)Rsym (%)3.4 (29.7)6.4 (30.6)Structure refinementResolution range (Å)12−1.412−1.5No. non-hydrogen protein atoms58395793No. water molecules655584R factor0.1650.178Rfree0.1920.202Mean B values (Å2)15.816.1r.m.s. deviations from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.0140.015Bond angles (°)1.741.71 Open table in a new tab Drawings were made by MOLSCRIPT (43Kraulis P.J.

https://openalex.org/W2056865885,"α-Synuclein is a phosphoprotein that accumulates as a major component of Lewy bodies in the brains of patients with Parkinson disease. Synphilin-1, which is also present in Lewy bodies, binds with α-synuclein and forms cytoplasmic inclusions in transfected cells. Yet the molecular determinants of this protein-protein interaction are unknown. Here we report that casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylates synphilin-1 and that the β subunit of this enzyme complex binds to synphilin-1. Additionally, both CKII α and β subunits are present within cytoplasmic inclusions in cells that overexpress synphilin-1. Notably, the interaction between synphilin-1 and α-synuclein is markedly dependent on phosphorylation. Inhibition of CKII activity by 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole blocks the binding between these two proteins and significantly reduces the percentage of cells that contain eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. Mutation of the major CKII phosphorylation site in α-synuclein (S129A) has no significant impact on the binding between α-synuclein and synphilin-1 or on the formation of synphilin-1/α-synuclein-positive inclusions. These data suggest that the CKII-mediated phosphorylation of synphilin-1 rather than that of α-synuclein is critical in modulating their tendency to aggregate into inclusions. These observations collectively indicate that a ubiquitous post-translational modification such as phosphorylation can regulate inclusion body formation in the context of α-synuclein and synphilin-1 interaction. α-Synuclein is a phosphoprotein that accumulates as a major component of Lewy bodies in the brains of patients with Parkinson disease.

Another component of Lewy bodies is synphilin-1, which was discovered by screening for proteins that interact with α-synuclein (8Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Co-expression of these two proteins results in the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in a small percentage of cultured cells (8Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 9Chung K.K. Zhang Y.

But the molecular determinants that regulate this interaction and perhaps consequent inclusion body formation are unknown. Such factors would elucidate not only the genesis of these aggregates but could also provide clues about potential therapeutic targets if the inclusions or their precursors are pathogenic.Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification that regulates the function and other properties of many proteins. α-Synuclein itself is phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo by casein kinase (CK) I and II (10Okochi M.

Additionally, α-synuclein is extensively phosphorylated at serine 129 in synucleinopathy lesions and in overexpressing transgenic mice and flies (11Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A.

Kanuka H. Fujiwara H. Koyama A. Hasegawa M. Miura M. Iwatsubo T. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 336: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Yet, the physiological significance of this phosphorylation and its link to the pathogenesis of PD are unclear. Synphilin-1 also has consensus sequences for putative CKII recognition sites, but whether it is indeed phosphorylated has not been addressed. In this investigation we studied the phosphorylation of synphilin-1 by CKII and elucidated the critical role of this post-translational modification in the interaction between synphilin-1 and α-synuclein and in inclusion body formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Synphilin-1 and CKII Expression Vectors—pFLAG-synph expressing full-length synphilin-1 with an N-terminal FLAG tag was generated as described previously (14Lee G. Junn E. Tanaka M. Kim Y.M. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA library (Stratagene) and inserted into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) to generate pSyn-WT. To generate α-synuclein cDNA with a serine 129-alanine substitution, pSyn-WT was used as a template to introduce the T385G point mutation using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To generate an expression vector for myc-tagged casein kinase II β subunit, the entire open reading frame was amplified by PCR from a human brain cDNA library (Invitrogen) using primers 5′-cccgggCGTGAAGATGAGCA-3′ and 5′-agatctGGGAGGGAATCAG-C-3′ (SmaI and BglII sites in small characters were incorporated to facilitate cloning). The product was subcloned in pCMV-Tag3 (Stratagene) for generating pMyc-CKII β, which expresses CKII β with an N-terminal myc tag. The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Generation of Stable Cell Lines— 293T and PC-12 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. NS20Y cells were a kind gift from Dr. Marshall Nirenberg (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All cell lines except PC-12 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker) and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. PC-12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. The 293T cells were transfected with pFLAG-synphilin, selected, cloned, and maintained in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) to generate synph-293 cells. All transfections used the calcium phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions.In Vitro Phosphorylation—Synph-293 cells constitutively expressing FLAG-tagged synphilin-1 were harvested by scraping and were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate with a protease inhibitor mixture, Set III (Calbiochem). FLAG-tagged synphilin-1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG M2 agarose-affinity gel (Sigma) and incubated in 40 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2). The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of a mixture of 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 250 units of CKII (New England Biolabs), and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS gel-loading buffer (Invitrogen) and boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and synphilin-1 phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography.In Vivo Phosphorylation—Synph-293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged synphilin-1 and NS20Y cells transiently transfected with pFLAG-synphilin were grown to subconfluence and incubated in phosphate-free medium (Invitrogen) for 1 h. This medium was replaced with fresh phosphate-free medium containing 20-35 MBq of [32P]orthophosphate, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After removing the radioactive medium, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, immediately scraped off the plate, and lysed on ice with a lysis buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 6 h. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and synphilin-1 phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—For co-immunoprecipitation, synph-293 cells were transfected with pSyn-WT or pSyn-S129A. After 48 h, FLAG-tagged synphilin-1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG M2 agarose-affinity gel (Sigma) as described above. The precipitates or total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-α-synuclein polyclonal antibody (1:2000) (15Kanda S. Bishop J.F. Eglitis M.A. Yang Y. Mouradian M.M. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:5000) (Sigma).Immunocytochemistry and Quantification of Inclusions—The antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were α-synuclein monoclonal (1:400) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), FLAG Cy3-conjugated monoclonal (1:1000) (Sigma), casein kinase II α subunit (1:80) (Calbiochem), casein kinase II β subunit (1:100, Calbiochem), fluorescein isothiocyanate-secondary antibody (1:100) (Vector Laboratories), and Texas Red-secondary antibody (1:100) (Vector Laboratories). After being washed with PBS, the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Cells were then incubated at 4 °C for 24 h with the appropriate primary antibody and diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After the cells were washed three times with PBS, the secondary antibody, diluted in PBS and containing 1% bovine serum albumin, was added for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were visualized with a fluorescence confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss).For quantification of synphilin-1-positive inclusions, transfected cells were immunostained with anti-FLAG Cy3-conjugated antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 3 h at 4 °C and counted under a fluorescence microscope (Optiphot-2, Nikon). Two hundred transfected cells in randomly selected fields were counted for each condition in triplicate experiments. Inclusion-bearing cells were also quantified using hematoxylin-eosin staining (Fisher Scientific) for identifying eosinophilic inclusions. Cells were counted in three to five randomly selected fields of the chamber (Collagen I Cellware 4 Well CultureSlide, BD Biosciences) by blind investigation. A total of 12 wells and 1200 cells per condition were counted.RESULTSSynphilin-1 Is Phosphorylated by CKII Both in Vitro and in Vivo—The amino acid sequence of synphilin-1 includes 19 putative phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (S/T)XX(D/E) (16Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility that synphilin-1 is phosphorylated by CKII was tested. First, in vitro kination assays were performed using FLAG-tagged synphilin-1 immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody from stably transfected 293T (synph-293) cells as a substrate in the presence of human CKII and [γ-32P]ATP. Autoradiography of electrophoresed proteins revealed that synphilin-1 is strongly phosphorylated, whereas no phosphorylated synphilin-1 was observed in the absence of CKII (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4).Next, we investigated whether synphilin-1 is phosphorylated in synph-293 cells and in transiently transfected NS20Y cells. These cells were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence or absence of the CKII inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) or the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. FLAG-tagged synphilin-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and phosphorylated synphilin-1 was visualized by autoradiography. In the presence of DRB, synphilin-1 phosphorylation was strongly inhibited in synph-293 cells (Fig. 2A) and was diminished dose-dependently in NS20Y cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, synphilin-1 is phosphorylated by CKII in cells of neuronal and non-neuronal origin. Treatment of synph-293 cells with okadaic acid resulted in a substantial increase of phosphorylated synphilin-1 to a level much higher than its base line (Fig. 2A). These findings suggest that synphilin-1 is highly phosphorylated and rapidly dephosphorylated in vivo.Fig. 2In vivo phosphorylation of synphilin-1 by CKII. A, synphilin-1 is phosphorylated by CKII in 293T cells. Synph-293 cells stably overexpressing FLAG-tagged synphilin-1 were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate in the presence of 50 μm DRB or 0.2 μm okadaic acid (OK). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and phosphorylated FLAG-synphilin-1 was visualized by autoradiography. Native 293T cells are shown as control. The lower panel shows equal expression of total FLAG-synphilin-1 in all synph-293 cells by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody. B, synphilin-1 is phosphorylated by CKII in NS20Y cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged synphilin-1. 32P incorporation into synphilin-1 decreased dose dependently with different amounts of DRB. The lower panel shows total expression of FLAG-synphilin-1 by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regulatory β Subunit of CKII Interacts with Synphilin-1— CKII-mediated phosphorylation requires the association of its β subunit with substrate proteins (17Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To confirm that such an interaction also exists with synphilin-1, we examined the binding between synphilin-1 and the CKII β subunit. We transfected synph-293 cells with myc-tagged CKII β subunits and subjected lysates to immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody followed by anti-FLAG immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). The CKII β subunit co-immunoprecipitated with synphilin-1 in a specific manner, suggesting that the two molecules did bind. To exclude the possibility that this finding was simply the result of CKII β overexpression, we checked for binding between endogenous CKII β and synphilin-1 in PC-12 cells transiently transfected only with pFLAG-synphilin. FLAG-tagged synphilin-1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody, and the electrophoresed proteins were subjected to Western blotting with antibodies to CKII α and β. As expected, a specific interaction was observed between synphilin-1 and endogenous CKII β (Fig. 3B), whereas no such interaction was detected with the catalytic subunit CKII α (data not shown). We conclude that CKII β first recognizes synphilin-1, and then CKII α phosphorylates this substrate.Fig. 3The β subunit of CKII interacts with synphilin-1. A, synph-293 cells were transiently transfected with pMyc-CKII β. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-myc 9E10 antibody followed by anti-FLAG immunoblotting (lower panel). The upper two panels show total expression of FLAG-synphilin-1 and myc-CKII β in the lysate. B, endogenous CKII β interacts with synphilin-1 in PC-12 cells. These cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged synphilin-1.

Immunocytochemical staining of synph-293 cells revealed CKII β immunoreactivity (visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody), which was co-localized with anti-α-synuclein (visualized by Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody) within cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the CKII α subunit co-localized with α-synuclein in these inclusions (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4CKII subunits co-localize with α-synuclein in cytoplasmic inclusions.

Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and were immunoblotted with anti-α-synuclein antibody. Inhibition of CKII by DRB resulted in a marked reduction of the binding between α-synuclein and synphilin-1 (Fig. 5), indicating that CKII-mediated phosphorylation is a potent regulator of this interaction. Inhibition of phosphorylation did not have a significant impact on total intracellular levels of synphilin-1 or α-synuclein (Fig. 5, upper two panels).Fig. 5CKII-mediated phosphorylation regulates the interaction between synphilin-1 and α-synuclein.

Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). To test the effect of phosphorylation by CKII on the formation of such cytoplasmic inclusions, synph-293 cells were transiently transfected with α-synuclein followed by treatment with 50 μm DRB and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Fig. 6). Analysis of synph-293 cells overexpressing only synphilin-1 revealed that 4.3% of total cells had eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 6, A and C). As expected, co-expression of both synphilin-1 and α-synuclein increased the number of cells with inclusions to 7.6%. Notably, treatment of cells co-expressing both proteins with DRB significantly reduced the percentage of inclusion-bearing cells to 4.6% (Fig. 6C). The latter finding is consistent with the inhibition of the synphilin-1/α-synuclein interaction by DRB on Western blot analysis (Fig. 5). The number of inclusions in synph-293 cells in the absence of ectopic α-synuclein overexpression did not change significantly after DRB treatment. These observations led us to conclude that the inhibition of CKII activity suppresses the co-aggregation of synphilin-1 and α-synuclein into inclusion bodies.Fig. 6Cytoplasmic inclusions formed by synphilin-1 and α-synuclein are subject to regulation by phosphorylation.

However, whether the phosphorylation of synphilin-1 or α-synuclein, or both, is important for inclusion body formation is not clear. Serine 129 is a major CKII phosphorylation site within the C-terminal domain of α-synuclein (10Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), whereas the functional phosphorylated residue(s) in synphilin-1 is not determined. To investigate the importance of α-synuclein phosphorylation in this protein-protein interaction, we generated an α-synuclein mutant cDNA that harbors a serine-to-alanine substitution at position 129 (S129A), rendering this major CKII phosphorylation site nonfunctional. When synph-293 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or S129A mutant α-synuclein, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting revealed that the interaction of the mutant α-synuclein isoform with synphilin-1 is not compromised (Fig. 7). This finding indicates that α-synuclein phosphorylation by CKII has no significant effect on its binding with synphilin-1. A similar result was obtained in yeast with two hybrid experiments (data not shown). Based on these observations we conclude that it is the CKII-mediated phosphorylation of synphilin-1 rather than the phosphorylation of α-synuclein that is critical for the interaction between these two protein partners.Fig. 7Phosphorylation of synphilin-1 regulates the interaction between synphilin-1 and α-synuclein.

In these experiments, approximately 10% of synph-293 cells transfected with wild-type α-synuclein contained cytoplasmic inclusions based on immunoreactivity for FLAG-tagged synphilin-1. Synphilin-293 cells transfected with S129A mutant α-synuclein showed a comparable percentage of inclusion formation, confirming that the phosphorylation of α-synuclein at serine 129 is not critical for its tendency to form inclusions with synphilin-1.Fig. 8Phosphorylation of α-synuclein at serine 129 does not influence the formation of synphilin-1/α-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions.

Surprisingly, Nox1-derived H2O2 activated the reporter gene 15-fold with no effect on the redox state of the major thiol antioxidant substances, glutathione and thioredoxin.

ROS are byproducts of mitochondrial aerobic metabolism and can be produced from certain redox-active drugs and toxins, supporting the “nonspecific” view of ROS generation. Consistent with more specificity, ROS are produced in response to growth factors and cytokines (8Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

The phenotype was reversed by coexpression of catalase, implicating H2O2 generated from Nox1 as a mediator of growth and angiogenesis. Two hypotheses apply to signaling roles for ROS. The prevailing view is that ROS induce a broad change in the intracellular redox environment, which should be reflected in oxidation of the major intracellular thiol buffering systems, glutathione and thioredoxin. Consistent with this, added H2O2, as well as redox-cycling drugs, oxidize glutathione and thioredoxin and create a generalized oxidative stress. An alternate hypothesis is that low level of ROS target specific signaling pathways and need not involve a generalized oxidative environment. Among the possible signaling pathways that might be regulated by ROS are the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways (15De Keulenaer G.W. Ushio-Fukai M. Yin Q. Chung A.B. Lyons P.R.

In mammalian cells, these include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase. The MAP kinase cascades are key signaling pathways that transduce and integrate numerous signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. MAP kinases can be activated by various external stimuli such as growth factors, ligands acting on GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors, and various stresses (heat-shock, radiation, etc.). The activated MAP kinases phosphorylate specific molecular targets such as transcription factors that can then regulate the expression of specific genes. Antioxidant response elements (AREs; a.k.a. electrophile response element) are found in the promoters of many of antioxidant and other detoxifying enzyme genes including GCLC (glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit), glutathione S-transferase (GST), heme oxygenase-1, and NAD(P)H-quinol oxidoreductase (19Jaiswal A.K.

The ARE core sequence (GTGACNNNGC) contains an embedded sequence that shows similarity with the AP-1 binding site (T(G/T)ACTCA) (23Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14683-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The NF-E2-related factor, Nrf2, can bind to and activate ARE by complexing with AP-1-related proteins such as c-Jun, Jun-B, Jun-D, or c-Fos, while small Maf proteins (MafG and MafK) inhibit gene expression by complexing with Nrf2 (24Dhakshinamoorthy S.

Constitutive and β-naphthoflavone-induced expression of human GCLC gene is mediated by a distal ARE sequence, ARE4, in which an embedded AP-1 site is well conserved (28Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized ARE4 from the GCLC gene as a model system to investigate signal transduction systems that can mediate gene expression induced by ROS. We used NIH 3T3 cells with stable overexpression of Nox1 to provide increased H2O2 generation. We found that the low level of H2O2 generated by Nox1 expression in HG (H2O2-generating) cells did not result in detectable oxidation of either glutathione or thioredoxin. However, H2O2 activated transcription by triggering kinase cascades that lie upstream of transcription factors rather than by acting distally on ARE4-specific transcription factors themselves. Activation of ARE4 was signaled by both the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways modulated by H2O2-dependent Ras pathway. Therefore, these results show that H2O2-induced signaling occurs by mechanisms that are not associated with global oxidative stress as indicated by GSH and thioredoxin-1. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatments—NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with either vector control (Cont1, Cont2), Nox1 (HG1, HG2, HG3), or Nox1 plus catalase (Cat1, Cat2) were maintained (37oC, 5% CO2) in a growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum). The plasmids used in this study are as follows: ARE4-Luc (the ARE4 region of GCLC inserted into a pT81 luciferase vector) (29Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), pcDNA3.1 containing the lacZ gene (Invitrogen), human catalase, dominant negative mutant of H-Ras (N17-H-Ras), or dominant positive mutant of H-Ras (V12-H-Ras). Plasmids encoding hemagglutinin-tagged ERK2 (HA-ERK2) and HA-JNK1 were described (30Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Dominant negative mutants of JNKK1 (JNKK1K179M) and MEK1 (MEK1K79M) were gifts of A. Lin (University of Chicago, IL) and K. L. Guan (University of Michigan), respectively. Endotoxin-free plasmids were prepared using a maxiprep kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). For transient transfections, cells (4-5 × 105 cells/plate) were grown overnight in the growth medium and transfected using FuGENE 6 (Promega). The inhibitors U0126 and JNK inhibitor II were from Calbiochem. Glucose oxidase and N-acetylcysteine were from Sigma. Enzyme Activities and Protein Content—Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing by β-galactosidase activity. To initiate luciferase activity, cell lysate (20 μl) was added to 100 μl of reaction buffer (Promega) and luminescence recorded at 30 °C using a luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified by monitoring cleavage of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (31Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Protein was measured using the Bio-Rad DC kit. MAP Kinase Assays—ERK phosphorylation was examined by Western blotting using an antibody specific to the phosphorylated form of ERK (Cell Signaling Technology) and was quantified by densitometry of the autoradiogram. For immune complex assays, antibodies to JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or to p38 kinase were incubated with the soluble lysates (100 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by 1-h incubation with protein G-agarose beads. The precipitate was washed four times in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm sodium vanadate, 1.0% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and once in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm vanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The immune complexes were incubated (20 min, 30 °C) in 20 μl of buffer A containing either GST-cJun (5 μg each) or ATF2 (5 μg each) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, exposed to obtain an autoradiogram, and counted by scintillation counting to obtain amount of radioactivity in each band. Glutathione Analysis and Redox Potential (Eh) Calculation—GSH and GSSG were quantified as the S-carboxymethyl-N-dansyl derivatives by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, expressed as concentrations based on cell volume. GSH and GSSG concentrations were used to calculate the steady-state redox potential values using the Nernst equation (32Jones D.P. Carlson J.L. Samiec P.S. Sternberg Jr., P. Mody Jr., V.C. Reed R.L.

Redox State of Trx Using Redox Western Blot Analysis—Cells were treated for 1 h with H2O2, washed twice by phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and carboxymethylated (10 mm iodoacetic acid, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 3 mm EDTA, 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 min at 37 °C in the dark). As controls, cell lysate or purified thioredoxin was treated with H2O2 (0.5 mm, 5 min) or the reductant dithiothreitol (0.5 mm, 10 min) and then carboxymethylated. Excess reagents were removed using a Sephadex G-25 spin column. The redox state of Trx1 was determined by a Western blot method as described previously (34Fernando M.R. Nanri H. Yoshitake S. Nagata-Kuno K. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 35Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M.

Briefly, the electrophoresis was performed under native conditions to facilitate separation of the differently charged forms of Trx1. Derivatized proteins were separated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Gels were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with an antibody to Trx1 (American Diagnostica). Bands corresponding to Trx1 were visualized using chemiluminescent detection. The use of this method the redox forms of Trx1 can be separated as three different bands including a band with fully reduced Trx1, a band with the active site in the disulfide form (Cys-32 and Cys-35), and a band in which the protein has two disulfides, one at the active site and the other involving Cys-62 and Cys-69 (36Watson W.H.

Measurement of H2O2—Relative concentrations of intracellular H2O2 were determined as described previously (14Arnold R.S. Shi J. Murad E. Whalen A.M. Sun C.Q. Polavarapu R. Parthasarathy S. Petros J.A. Lambeth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Confluent cells in 100-mm dishes (5-6 × 106 cells) were washed with 6 ml of HBSS and released by using 0.25% trypsin (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, followed by the addition of 5% fetal bovine serum in HBSS. After pelleting, cells were resuspended in 5% fetal bovine serum in HBSS and counted. Dichlorofluorescin diacetate was added to a final concentration of 2 μm, and incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. Dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur BD Biosciences (excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission wavelength, 515-545 nm) with 0.5 × 106 cells per 3 ml 5% fetal bovine serum in HBSS. Extracellular H2O2 was measured as described previously (14Arnold R.S. Shi J. Murad E. Whalen A.M. Sun C.Q. Polavarapu R. Parthasarathy S. Petros J.A. Lambeth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 50 mm lysine for 30 min, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 10% goat serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Cells were incubated with a polyclonal antibody against Nrf2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or c-Jun (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C and with Cy3 conjugated goat anti-rabbit for 30 min. Washed cells were mounted with slow-Fade, and fluorescence was visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60). H2O2Generated by Nox1 Overexpression Stimulates ARE4 Reporter Activation—DCF fluorescence as an indicator for H2O2 production was examined (Fig. 1A). NIH 3T3 cells stably overexpressing Nox1 (HG1) have DCF fluorescence that is elevated 5-fold relative to control cells (Cont1) indicating that HG1 cells have continuously stimulated H2O2 production. Glucose/glucose oxidase, which continuously generate H2O2 without superoxide production, also elevated DCF fluorescence (Fig. 1A, 2-fold increases at 3 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase) in control cells. To explore H2O2 signaling, we used luciferase under the regulation of ARE4, the antioxidant response element from GCLC, which is known to respond to ROS (28Wild A.C. Gipp J.J. Mulcahy T. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Mulcahy R.T. Wartman M.A. Bailey H.H. Gipp J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7445-7454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was increased 8-fold in HG1 cells and 15-fold in another H2O2-generating cell line, HG2. Coexpression of the H2O2 scavenger, catalase (Fig. 1B), or addition of the chemical antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (Fig. 1C) significantly inhibited activation of luciferase, indicating that ARE4 activation in HG cells is H2O2-dependent. H2O2 production by glucose/glucose oxidase stimulated ARE4 activation in control (Cont1) cells as shown in Fig. 1D. Therefore, these results suggest that the ARE4 element is activated in response to continuously generated H2O2 and can be used to explore H2O2 signaling. Redox States of Glutathione Were Not Changed in Cells Generating H2O2by Overexpressing Nox1 or in Control Cells Generating H2O2by Glucose/Glucose Oxidase—To evaluate cellular redox states under conditions of H2O2-mediated signaling, we examined amounts of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione and the calculated redox potential of the GSH/GSSG couple. HG1 cells had elevated H2O2 as shown in Fig. 1A; however, these cells showed no differences in the level of GSSG and GSH compared with control cells (Cont1) (Fig. 2A, bottom). The calculated glutathione redox potentials were not changed significantly (Fig. 2A, top). In contrast, exposure of control cells to a single dose of H2O2 (a concentration used in published experiments to induce oxidative stress, growth arrest, and apoptosis) increased glutathione disulfide, GSSG, with a corresponding 20 mV oxidation in redox potential (Cont1*). In addition, control cells generating H2O2 continuously by glucose/glucose oxidase as shown in Fig. 1D were also tested to examine redox states of glutathione. However, there was no detectable increase in glutathione redox states (Fig. 2B, top) and levels of GSH and GSSG (Fig. 2B, bottom) even at 5 milliunits of glucose oxidase per ml, which was the condition that stimulated ARE4 activation due to H2O2 production. Thus, H2O2-mediated signaling occurred without global oxidation as indicated by the GSH/GSSG system in cells. Redox State of Thioredoxin in H2O2-generating Cells—To further test the effect of H2O2 generation on global cellular redox state under conditions of redox signaling, we examined redox state of another major cellular thiol component, thioredoxin-1 (Trx1). Oxidation of human Trx1 can be measured using Redox Western blot analysis (36Watson W.H. Pohl J. Montfort W.R. Stuchlik O. Reed M.S. Powis G. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33408-33415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) in which the mobility of Trx1 under native gel conditions is modified as a function of redox state (Fig. 3, as purified h-Trx1 ± H2O2). Changes in the redox state of Trx1 were not detected in cells generating H2O2 (HG1) compared with control (Cont1) (Fig. 3, top panel and bottom graph). Control and HG cells with mouse-derived thioredoxin were mostly in the reduced form (34Fernando M.R. Nanri H. Yoshitake S. Nagata-Kuno K. Minakami S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 37Watson W.H. Jones D.P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and only the reduced (but not the oxidized) form of mouse Trx was visualized immunochemically. In both control (Cont1) and HG1 cells, addition of H2O2 to lysates resulted in loss of the reduced band (Fig. 3, top panel, lanes for lysates with 0.5 mm H2O2). Both control and HG cells contained reduced Trx (Fig. 3, top panel and bottom graph, lanes for cells with none), which decreased upon exposure of cells to 2 mm H2O2. The amount of reduced Trx visualized in each cell line was the same as that seen in an equivalent volume of cell lysate treated with reducing reagent, dithiothreitol (DTT). Thus, most or all of the Trx is in the reduced form regardless of H2O2 generation. As expected, however, HG1 compared with Cont1 showed a significant loss of reduced Trx when cells were treated with 2 mm of H2O2 (top panel and bottom graph). As a control for protein loading, cell lysates were analyzed to determine total amount of ERK1/2 using Western blot (Fig. 3, bottom panel). ERK1/2 expression was observed without any change in HG1 compared with control (Cont1) cells. Also, there was no detectable change in ERK1/2 level by treating cells with H2O2 or DTT as shown in Fig. 3 (bottom panel). These results together with the results of glutathione redox show that H2O2-dependent signaling mechanisms can occur without affecting glutathione and thioredoxin oxidation or redox potential. H2O2-induced Translocation of c-Jun but Not Nrf2 to the Nucleus—ARE4 activation is known to be regulated by transcription factor systems including Nrf2, KEAP1, c-Jun, and other binding proteins. Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus in response to oxidant stress and xenobiotics, and this is mediated by release from binding proteins in the cytosol (38Sekhar K.R. Spitz D.R. Harris S. Nguyen T.T. Meredith M.J. Holt J.T. Gius D. Marnett L.J. Summar M.L. Freeman M.L. Guis D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When H2O2-generating cells (HG1) were compared with control cells (Cont1) using immunofluorescence, there was no increase in translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus, whereas that of c-Jun was observed (Fig. 4). Nrf2 was partially excluded from the nucleus in HG cells. Notably, H2O2 has been previously shown to induce translocation of c-Jun in oligodendrocytes (39Vollgraf U. Wegner M. Richter-Landsberg C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2501-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with regulation of ARE4 by H2O2 being mediated in part by nuclear translocation of c-Jun. H2O2-dependent Activation of ARE4 Is Regulated by AP-1—To further examine the possible mechanisms for H2O2 signaling of ARE4, experiments were performed with ARE4 mutants. The ARE4 response element containing a consensus antioxidant response element also includes a binding region for the transcription factor, AP-1, which is a multimer containing c-Jun, c-Fos, and additional proteins. In general, activation of JNK results in activation of c-Jun, following by translocation of c-Jun to the nucleus. We tested whether H2O2-dependent ARE4 activation is associated with a transcription factor, AP-1. ARE4 consensus includes the AP1 binding region; thus, the effects of mutants were examined comparing with that of wild type ARE4 (Fig. 5). HG1 cells were transiently transfected with either empty vector, wild type of ARE4 (WT), or mutant (m1, m2, or m3) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Wild type of ARE4 activation was stimulated in HG1 compared with control cells (Cont1); however, its activation was significantly blocked by mutation obtained in the AP1 specific region (m1, m2) but not in non-AP1 site (m3) (Fig. 5). Together with the above results on Nrf2 translocation, these results indicate that ARE4 activation by H2O2 in HG cells is associated with the AP-1 transcription factor and not with Nrf2. H2O2Production in HG Cells Stimulates the Activation of ERK1/2 and JNK but Not p38 Kinase—To explore the mechanisms of H2O2-dependent ARE4 activation, we examined MAP kinase pathway as upstream signaling pathways in NIH 3T3 cells generating H2O2 (HG1, HG2) or control (Cont1, Cont2). ERK1/2 activity was stimulated ∼8-fold in H2O2-generating cells (Fig. 6A). Likewise, JNK activity was stimulated ∼2-3-fold, based on its ability to phosphorylate c-Jun (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, p38 kinase activity, which is readily activated ∼4-fold by anisomycine, was unaffected by H2O2 generation. Using Western blotting, there were no changes in the levels of protein expression of the MAP kinases in H2O2-generating compared with control cells (Fig. 6, A-C). The ERK1/2 Pathway Mediates H2O2-dependent Regulation of ARE4—ERK1/2 is activated by the upstream kinases MEK1/2. Using an in vitro kinase assay, H2O2-stimulated ERK1/2 activity was completely inhibited upon transfection with a dominant negative mutant of MEK1, MEK1K79M (Fig. 7A, upper panel, bar graph). Similarly, treatment with the MEK inhibitor, U0126, inhibited H2O2-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7B, upper panel, bar graph). H2O2-dependent ARE4 activation was partially inhibited in parallel with inhibition of H2O2-dependent ERK1/2 activation by both these treatments. Thus, H2O2 regulates ARE4-dependent transcription partly via activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. H2O2-dependent Regulation of ARE4 Is Mediated in Part by the JNK Pathway—Because H2O2 stimulates JNK activation, we examined whether ARE4 is also coregulated by JNK activation. A dominant negative mutant of JNKK1, JNKK1K179M, transfected into HG1 cells resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in JNK activity (Fig. 8A, top panel, middle bar graph), with p"

However, the in vivo function of δENaC is not known. To gain insight into the function of δENaC, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library was carried out using the C- and N-terminal domains of δENaC. A novel δENaC-interacting protein called Murr1 (mouse U2af1-rs1 region) was isolated in the C-terminal domain screen. Murr1 is a 21-kDa protein mutated in Bedlington terriers suffering from copper toxicosis. The interaction of Murr1 and δENaC was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay and coimmunoprecipitation. To test the functional significance of the interaction, Murr1 was coexpressed with δβγENaC in Xenopus oocytes. Murr1 inhibited amiloride-sensitive sodium current in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, deletion of the last 59 amino acids of δENaC abolished the inhibition. Murr1 also bound to the β- and γENaC subunits and inhibited αβγENaC sodium current. Therefore, these results suggest that Murr1 is a novel regulator of ENaC. The human δ epithelial sodium channel (δENaC) subunit is related to the α-, β-, and γENaC subunits that control salt homeostasis. δENaC forms an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel with the β and γ subunits.

An additional human sodium channel subunit, δENaC, was reported in 1995 (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F.V.N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Among ENaC family members δENaC has the highest amino acid identity (∼37%) to αENaC and to a recently described ϵ-subunit from Xenopus laevis (10Babini E. Geisler H.S. Siba M. Grunder S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28418-28426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A δENaC gene appears to be present in chimpanzee (GenBank™ accession number O46547) and in rabbit (11Brockway L.M. Zhou Z.H. Bubien J.K. Jovov B. Benos D.J. Keyser K.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C126-C134Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but there is no evidence for a rat or mouse δENaC gene. Similar to αENaC, when δENaC is expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes a small, amiloride-sensitive Na+ current is induced (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F.V.N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This current is increased 50-fold by coexpression with the β- and γENaC subunits, and the properties of the δ and δβγ channels were identical (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F.V.N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The highest expression levels of δENaC mRNA were detected in brain, testis, ovary, and pancreas, indicating that the primary function of δENaC may not be in epithelia (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F.V.N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). ENaC subunits are members of the degenerin/ENaC gene family. Other family members such as brain Na+ channel 1, acid-sensing ion channel, and dorsal root acid-sensing ion channel are expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems (12Bianchi L. Driscoll M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These channels are stimulated by acidic pH and have been implicated in touch sensation, synaptic plasticity, and pain perception (12Bianchi L. Driscoll M. Neuron. 2002; 34: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A brain channel matching the properties of the δENaC channel has not been reported. δENaC shares a common predicted topology to the α-, β-, and γENaC subunits: a large extracellular loop separated by two membrane-spanning domains leaving the short N- and C-terminal domains located inside the cell (13Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of the αβγENaC subunits provide binding sites for the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases. Nedd4 decreases the surface expression of ENaC, probably by mediating ubiquitination and internalization of the channel, thus controlling sodium movement across epithelia (14Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Nedd4 binding to the αβγENaC subunits is mediated by WW domains in Nedd4 and a conserved PY motif (PPPXY) in the C-terminal domain of the αβγENaC subunits. However, this motif is not conserved in δENaC (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F.V.N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), suggesting that the δENaC subunit may be regulated by binding proteins other than Nedd4 family members. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the C- and N-terminal domains of δENaC shows that the N-terminal domain is particularly proline-rich (Fig. 1A, bottom). Short proline-rich sequences are known to bind interaction domains such as the WW or SH3 domains (16Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain also contains prolines that might provide a binding site for these domains. Alternatively, δENaC may contain novel binding motifs, and identification of proteins binding to novel motifs might provide information on δENaC function. Therefore, we screened a human brain cDNA library with the N- and C-terminal domains of δENaC to identify interacting proteins. Here we report that Murr1, a protein implicated in copper transport (17van de Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), interacts with the C-terminal domain of δENaC. In addition, we found that Murr1 binds to β- and γENaC but not to αENaC. Coexpression of Murr1 with either the δβγ or αβγENaC subunits in Xenopus oocytes resulted in sodium current inhibition, and the inhibition of δβγENaC was abolished by C-terminal truncation of δENaC. DNA Constructs—Full-length and truncated δENaC constructs (all containing the FLAG epitope tag DYKDDDDK) were cloned into pMT3 after PCR using the primers described below (all primers from 5′ to 3′). For full-length δENaC: 5′ primer CCATCGATATGGCTGAGCACCGAAGC and 3′ primer GGAATTCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGTGTCCAGAGTCTCAAG. The C-terminal truncations were all constructed using the same 5′ primer, ACGCGTCGACGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGCTGAGCACCGAAGCATG, and the following 3′ primers, CGGAATTCTCATGGAAGCATCACCCGTGG for δC-23 (last 23 amino acids were deleted), CGGAATTCTCAATCTGACTGGCCTCTGG for δC-47, and CGGAATTCTCATGAGGCAGGGCTGGCTCT for δC-59 (δT). The N-terminal truncations were constructed using the same 3′ primer as for full-length δENaC and the 5′ primers ACGCGTCGACGCCACCATGGAGCCCCCCAGGCCGGGGCCA for δN-27 (first 27 amino acids deleted) and ACGCGTCGACGCCACCATGGAGAAGGAGGGGCACCAGGAG for δN-41. Full-length δENaC was also cloned into the vector pHM6 (Roche Applied Science) in-frame with the HA epitope tag using the 5′ primer GGAATTCGATGGCTGAGCACCGAAGC and the 3′ primer GGAATTCCGGTGTCCAGAGTCTCAAG. Because sequence analysis showed that the isolated Murr1 clones were missing the first 15 base pairs, these missing base pairs were added as part of a PCR primer in a subsequent PCR reaction. Murr1-FLAG was cloned by PCR from a yeast two-hybrid library plasmid using the 5′ primer CCATCGATGCCACCATGGAGGGCGAGCTTGAGGGTGGCAAACCCCTG and the 3′ primer CGGAATTCTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTTAGGCTGGCTGATCAG and ligated into the vector pMT3. For the production of Murr1·GST fusion protein, Murr1 was cloned in-frame with GST into the vector pGEX-KG (AP Biotech) using the 5′ primer CGGGATCCCACGAGGGCGAGCTTGAGGGTGGCAAACCCCTG and the 3′ primer GCTCTAGATCAGTTAGGCTGGCTGATC. Plasmids encoding α-, β-, and γENaC in pMT3 for oocyte expression were previously described (1McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding βENaCR566X (βT), γENaCK576X (γT), αENaC-FLAG, βENaC-HA, and γENaC-HA are described elsewhere (18Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were grown in low bicarbonate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The day before transfection, COS7 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells in 35-mm plates. Cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of each cDNA construct using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and the manufacturer's protocol. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—All materials used for the screen were derived from the MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech). A pretransformed human brain cDNA library (Clontech) was screened with the C- and N-terminal cytosolic regions of δENaC. The baits were constructed by cloning the δENaC C-terminal (amino acids 562–638) and N-terminal (amino acids 1–88) cytosolic domains inframe with the GAL4 binding domain into the EcoRI-SalI sites of pGBKT7. Correct insertion of the cytosolic domains was verified by DNA sequencing (Centre for Gene Research, University of Otago). The inability of the baits to autonomously activate the reporter genes in yeast strain AH109 was confirmed prior to the library screen. Also, untransformed and mated AH109- and Y187-strain cells did not activate the reporter genes. The cDNA library and the bait were grown overnight, and 5 × 108 cells of each strain were mixed and plated on YPDA (yeast peptone dextrose adenine media; 20 g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 2% dextrose, 0.003% adenine) medium to allow mating for 6 h. The cells were then resuspended in sterile water and plated onto SC (synthetic complete medium)-His-Leu-Trp. Colonies were picked 3–6 days after plating and regrown on SC-His-Leu-Trp. Regrown colonies were replica-plated on SC-Ade-Leu-Trp to check for expression of a second reporter gene, on S.D. (synthetic-deficient medium) to check for wild-type yeast, and on SC-His-Leu-Trp to show regrowth after replica plating. Colonies growing on both selection media, but not on S.D., were further cultivated and analyzed for β-galactosidase activity by performing filter assays. For further analysis, cDNA inserts were isolated from histidine and adenine prototrophic and β-galactosidase-expressing clones by PCR using the 5′ primer CTATTCGATGATGAAGATACCCCACCAAACCC and the 3′ primer GTGAACTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACGAT. Plasmids were restored by gap repair cloning (19Oldenburg K.R. Vo K.T. Michaelis S. Paddon C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 451-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) into the vector pGADT7, transformation into AH109, and selection on SC-Leu plates. False positives were excluded by performing autoactivation screens (on SC-Leu-Ade and SC-Leu-His) and retesting the interaction with the original (δN/C-terminal domain) and an unrelated bait (lamininC). All remaining clones were again amplified by PCR and digested with HaeIII to determine the cDNA size and to exclude identical clones. Selected clones were further analyzed by DNA sequencing. GST Pulldown Assay—pGEX-KG containing the cDNA for Murr1 or the empty vector were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21, and expression of the Murr1·GST fusion protein or GST alone was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were lysed using Bugbuster® (Novagen), and the GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (AP Biotech). COS7 cells were transfected with different cDNA constructs. After 24 h cells were lysed in T-TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin + 1% Triton X-100). Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 16,000 × g), and the lysates were precleared with GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The precleared lysates were then incubated with Murr1·GST fusion protein or GST alone, attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C, washed extensively in T-TBS, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody (Sigma). Coimmunoprecipitation—COS7 cells were cotransfected with δENaC-HA and Murr1-FLAG in 35-mm dishes, and three plates were pooled for one experiment. Cells were lysed with T-TBS 24 h after transfection, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (5 min, 16,000 × g), and the supernatant was incubated with 25 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. Then 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads was added and incubation continued for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody (Sigma). Expression in Xenopus Oocytes and Immunoprecipitation—δβγENaC, δTFLAGβγENaC, δβTγTENaC, δTFLAGβTγTENaC, or αβγENaC (237 pg of each) together with secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP, 237 pg) as a negative control or Murr1-FLAG (35 or 70 pg) were injected into the nuclei of manually defolliculated stage V-VI oocytes. Injected oocytes were incubated in low Na+ MBS (5 mm NaCl, 83 mm NMDG, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 50 mg/l gentamycin, pH 7.6) at 18 °C and studied 2 or 3 days after injection. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ current was measured by the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Oocytes were bathed in Ringer's solution (116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and inward currents were recorded at a holding potential of –60 mV using the oocyte clamp 725C (Warner Instruments) and pCLAMP 8.2 software (Axon instruments). Amiloride-sensitive current was determined by subtracting the current obtained at –60 mV in the presence of 100 μm amiloride from the current obtained without amiloride. Data were sampled at 1 kHz. Data were collected and pooled from at least two preparations of oocytes isolated on different days from different animals and are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was calculated using analysis of variance and MS Excel software. Expressing eggs were collected and lysed with T-TBS by rotating for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatants were incubated with 25 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody overnight to precipitate Murr1-FLAG or δTFLAG. Immunocomplexes were isolated with protein G-Sepharose (1 h, 4 °C) and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To identify proteins binding to δENaC, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the intracellular C- and N-terminal domains of δENaC. Because of the high expression of δENaC in brain (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F.V.N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we chose to screen a human brain cDNA library. The δENaC C-terminal domain screen yielded 40 putative positive clones showing histidine and adenine prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity; however, the N-terminal domain screen did not yield any positive clones. The δENaC C-terminal domain-interacting clones that activated the reporter genes with the original bait (δENaC C-terminal domain) were not capable of inducing expression of any reporter gene by themselves and did not interact with an unrelated bait (lamininC) (data not shown). Interacting clones were sequenced and subjected to a BLAST search. Three of the clones were identified as the human Murr1 gene. The Murr1 gene was first described by Nabetani et al. (20Nabetani A. Hatada I. Morisaki H. Oshimura M. Mukai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), who discovered that the imprinted gene U2af1-rs1 lies in an intron of the Murr1 gene, although the Murr1 gene itself does not appear to be imprinted. Thus, Murr1 was named as a gene that locates in the mouse U2af1-rs1 region. Murr1 has recently been implicated in copper metabolism because a mutated form of Murr1 is associated with copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers (17van de Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the function of Murr1 in copper metabolism is not known. Murr1 appears to be widely expressed in human tissues, including tissues that express δENaC (17van de Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated the possibility of an interaction between δENaC and Murr1. The Murr1 gene codes for a 21-kDa protein that does not contain any known interaction domains, suggesting the interaction with δENaC might involve novel binding motifs. Murr1 Interacts Specifically with the C-terminal Domain of δENaC—Expression of δENaC and its truncations in COS7 cells resulted in the appearance of two or more specific bands, most likely because of glycosylation of the extracellular domain. This observation is consistent with the multiple bands, observed upon expression of wild type and epitope-tagged αENaC, βENaC, and γENaC subunits (1McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); some of these bands represent glycosylated subunits. The interaction between Murr1 and δENaC was confirmed by GST pulldown assay (Fig. 2). Initially, δENaC-FLAG expressed in COS7 cells was bound with a Murr1·GST fusion protein. Fig. 2 shows that Murr1·GST bound δENaC, but GST alone did not. To confirm that Murr1 binds to the C- and not to the N-terminal domain of δENaC as predicted by the yeast two-hybrid screen, we used a series of N- and C-terminal δENaC truncations (Fig. 1A) in a subsequent GST pulldown assay. Truncations from the N terminus had no effect on the interaction between Murr1 and δENaC (Fig. 2). A series of δENaC C-terminal truncations showed that removal of the last 23 amino acids from δENaC had no effect on binding to Murr1 (Fig. 2). However, deletion of either the last 47 or the last 59 amino acids abolished the interaction between Murr1 and δENaC. These results show that Murr1 specifically binds to the C-terminal domain of δENaC and that the probable binding site for Murr1 is located between amino acids 592 and 615 of δENaC (Fig. 1A). To investigate an interaction between Murr1 and δENaC in intact cells we used coimmunoprecipitation. COS7 cells were cotransfected with constructs encoding Murr1-FLAG and δENaC-HA. Complexes between Murr1-FLAG and δENaC-HA were purified with anti-FLAG antibody followed by protein G-Sepharose beads and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. Fig. 3 (lane 1) shows that Murr1 and δENaC interact when coexpressed in mammalian cells. Murr1 Inhibits Na+Channel Current in Xenopus Oocytes— Because Murr1 and δENaC interact when coexpressed in intact cells, we investigated whether the interaction between δENaC and Murr1 is functionally significant. Initially the δ-, β-, and γENaC subunits were coexpressed with an equimolar amount of Murr1 in Xenopus oocytes. Murr1 significantly decreased the Na+ current by 88 ± 3% (n = 17) compared with the control (Fig. 4). To test whether the decrease in current was dose-dependent, oocytes were injected with δβγENaC and half the amount of Murr1 used in the initial experiment. The Na+ current was decreased by 52 ± 6%, (n = 26) and differed significantly from both the control and currents recorded using an equimolar amount of Murr1. Thus, Murr1 inhibits δβγENaC current in a dose-dependent manner. The results of the in vitro interaction experiments suggested that Murr1 interacts specifically with the C-terminal domain of δENaC. To test this hypothesis in Xenopus oocytes and to investigate whether the β and γ subunits contribute to the inhibition of sodium current via Murr1, C-terminal truncation construct combinations were coexpressed with Murr1. First, full-length δENaC was coexpressed with β and γ subunits missing their C-terminal domains (βT and γT) in the presence or absence of Murr1 (Fig. 5A). When Murr1 was expressed with δβTγ theT Na+ current was reduced by 78 ± 3%, (n = 23) compared with the control (δβTγT + SEAP), showing Murr1 could still inhibit the channel when the β- and γENaC C-terminal domains were removed. However, the inhibition was significantly less than that observed with δβγENaC + Murr1, suggesting that Murr1 may exert its inhibition in part via the β- and/or γENaC C-terminal domains. Next, we coexpressed a truncated δENaC subunit missing the last 59 amino acids (δT, which did not bind to Murr1 in vitro, Fig. 2) with full-length β- and γENaC. Coexpression of Murr1 with the δTβγENaC channel did not result in significant down-regulation of the sodium channel (96 ± 12%, n = 27 of δTβγ + SEAP). This result suggests that Murr1 binds to the C-terminal domain of δENaC to inhibit channel activity and that the contribution of the β and γ subunits to Murr1 inhibition is minimal. To confirm that both δTENaC and Murr1 were expressed in this experiment, sodium channel-expressing oocytes were collected and pooled after current measurement. Murr1 and δTENaC were isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody. Fig. 5B shows that both proteins were expressed in the oocytes. Therefore, Murr1 binds to the C-terminal region of δENaC to inhibit sodium current. Murr1 Interacts with β- and γENaC in Vitro—Although Murr1 still inhibited current when the C-terminal domains of the β- and γENaC subunits were removed, (Fig. 5, δβTγTENaC + Murr1), the decrease was significantly less than that observed with Murr1 inhibition of δβγENaC. Therefore, we investigated whether the α-, β-or γENaC subunits also interact with Murr1, using a GST pulldown assay. α-, β-, or γENaC, either HA- or FLAG-tagged, were expressed in COS7 cells for 24 h, and the lysates were incubated with Murr1·GST or GST alone. Fig. 6A shows that β- and γENaC, but not αENaC, bind to Murr1·GST in vitro. Because the β- and γENaC subunits bind Murr1, we tested whether Murr1 could regulate a channel formed by the α-, β-, and γENaC subunits. Fig. 6B shows that Murr1 inhibited αβγENaC current by 53 ± 7% (n = 18). Therefore, Murr1 is able to regulate sodium channels formed by either δβγ or αβγ ENaC subunits. In contrast to the relatively well-characterized αβγENaC subunits, the δENaC subunit has been poorly investigated. The most apparent difference between δENaC and αβγENaC is tissue distribution. Whereas the α, β, and γ subunits are predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues such as kidney, colon, or lung (1McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), δENaC expression is highest in brain, testis, ovary, and pancreas (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F.V.N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although δENaC is expressed at low levels in kidney tissue (9Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F.V.N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that δENaC can compensate for αENaC, because loss of function mutations in αENaC cause the salt-wasting disorder, pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (3Chang S.S. Grunder S. Hanukoglu A. Rosler A. Mathew P.M. Hanukoglu I. Schild L. Lu Y. Shimkets R.A. Nelson-Williams C. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that in the kidney, δENaC is not expressed at a high enough level to compensate for αENaC, that αENaC and δENaC are expressed in different cell types, or that channels formed by αENaC and δENaC are functionally unique and perhaps regulated by different cellular pathways. To begin to investigate the function and regulation of δENaC we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the N- and C-terminal domains of δENaC to isolate δENaC binding partners. Such binding partners might represent novel regulators or subunits of a δENaC channel. Murr1, a gene implicated in copper metabolism (17van de Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), was identified as a novel δENaC binding protein. The Murr1 gene is mutated in inherited autosomal recessive copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers. Affected dogs showed a homozygous deletion of exon 2 of the Murr1 gene (17van de Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Copper toxicosis is characterized by inefficient excretion of copper into the bile, resulting in accumulation of copper in the liver (21Mercer J.F. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In affected dogs excess copper remains in the lysosomes (22Johnson G.F. Morell A.G. Stockert R.J. Sternlieb I. Hepatology. 1981; 1: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), perhaps because of a defect in lysosomal vesicle trafficking to the bile canalicular membrane. These findings suggest that Murr1 might be involved in ion transport and/or in vesicle trafficking. In humans, the majority of copper toxicosis patients have Wilson's disease. The genetic defect for this disease has been localized to the ATP7B gene, which encodes a P-type ATPase (21Mercer J.F. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Recently Tao et al. (23Tao T.Y. Liu F. Klomp L. Wijmenga C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41593-41596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Murr1 interacts directly with the intracellular N-terminal domain of the Wilson disease gene ATP7B, indicating a link between Murr1 and ATP7B. However, investigation of 23 patients with non-Wilsonian hepatic copper toxicosis did not identify any mutations or polymorphisms in the Murr1 gene (24Muller T. van de Sluis B. Zhernakova A. van Binsbergen E. Janecke A.R. Bavdekar A. Pandit A. Weirich-Schwaiger H. Witt H. Ellemunter H. Deutsch J. Denk H. Muller W. Sternlieb I. Tanner M.S. Wijmenga C. J. Hepatol. 2003; 38: 164-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The function of Murr1 remains unknown because the protein shows no homology to other proteins and does not contain any identifiable amino acid motifs or domains. Using immunoprecipitation and pulldown data, we have demonstrated that Murr1 interacts with the C-terminal domain of δENaC. Using N- and C-terminal truncations of δENaC, the binding site for Murr1 was located between amino acids 592 and 615 of δENaC. The C-terminal domain of δENaC is only 25% identical to that of αENaC (Fig. 1B), and the PY motif found in the αβγENaC subunits that mediates interaction with Nedd4 family members is not conserved in δENaC. Murr1 does not contain any recognizable protein interaction motifs; thus further work will be required to identify the exact amino acids involved in the interaction of δENaC and Murr1. Two-electrode voltage-clamp studies in Xenopus oocytes revealed that Murr1 is a potent inhibitor of δβγENaC sodium current. This effect might be because Murr1 alters the trafficking of subunits to or from the plasma membrane, it might have a direct effect on channel gating, or it might be an adaptor linking the channel to another regulatory protein. ENaC subunit trafficking is known to be influenced by syntaxins (25Qi J. Peters K.W. Liu C. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and Nedd4 family members, which facilitate ubiquitination and internalization of ENaC (28Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). When the C-terminal domains of β- and γENaC were deleted, Murr1 still inhibited the current produced by the δβTγTENaC channel, though this current was significantly larger than currents obtained with δβγENaC + Murr1. These results suggest that Murr1 exerts its inhibitory effect primarily via the δENaC subunit. This hypothesis was confirmed by deleting the C-terminal domain of δENaC; Murr1 was unable to inhibit δTβγ channel function. However, the β- and γENaC subunits might also be involved in Murr1-meditated δβγENaC channel regulation because Murr1 bound both subunits in a pulldown assay. Murr1 also reduced αβγENaC sodium current. The effect of Murr1 on the αβγENaC current was less than that observed for δβγENaC, possibly because Murr1 does not bind to αENaC. These results suggest that Murr1 may be a general regulator of ENaC family members and potentially of other channels or transporters. A link between sodium and copper transport has been demonstrated in fish gill and intestinal epithelia, including evidence for copper leak through ENaC (29Handy R.D. Eddy F.B. Baines H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1566: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although neither Murr1 nor δENaC appears to contain consensus copper binding sites (30Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 31Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it is possible that Murr1 links the transport of sodium and copper across epithelia. Alternatively, Murr1 might be important for correct trafficking of both sodium channels and copper transporters. Both the ATP7A and ATP7B copper-transporting proteins are localized to the trans-Golgi network in low copper concentrations. Increasing the copper concentration causes a shift in the location of ATP7A and ATP7B to the plasma membrane or a vesicular population (1McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Roelofsen H. Wolters H. Van Luyn M.J. Miura N. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J.

Further experiments such as cellular colocalization, effect on δENaC trafficking, and single-channel patch clamp analysis will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism by which Murr1 inhibits both δβγENaC and αβγENaC channel function.

Herein we demonstrate that Rip2, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing serine/threonine kinase, plays an important role in this cascade and is required for optimal TCR signaling and NF-κB activation. Following TCR engagement, Rip2 associated with Bcl10, a CARD-containing signaling component of the TCR-induced NF-κB pathway, and induced its phosphorylation. Rip2-deficient mice were defective in TCR-induced NF-κB activation, interleukin-2 production, and proliferation in vitro and exhibited defective T-cell-dependent responses in vivo. The defect in Rip2-/- T-cells correlated with a lack of TCR-induced Bcl10 phosphorylation. Furthermore, deficiency in Bcl10-dependent NF-κB activation could be rescued in Rip2-/- embryonic fibroblasts by exogenous wild-type Rip2 but not a kinase-dead mutant. Together these data define an important role for Rip2 in TCR-induced NF-κB activation and T-cell function and highlight the significance of post-translational modification of Bcl10 by Rip2 in T-cell signaling.

Many diverse stimuli activate NF-κB by inducing the phosphorylation and destruction of inhibitory molecules known as the IκBs that retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm (1.Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar). The IκB kinase (IKK) 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; TCR, T-cell receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccaride; HA, hemagglutinin; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; IL-2, interleukin-2; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. complex, composed of two kinase subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a non-catalytic subunit, NEMO/IKKγ, is responsible for the phosphorylation of the IκBs. The association of Bcl10 and CARMA1 (CARD11), two caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing proteins, has been shown to be essential to the transduction of the signal from the T-cell receptor (TCR) to the IKK complex (2.Thome M.

Mice deficient for either Bcl10 or CARMA1 display profound defects in T-cell proliferation and cytokine production due to a lack of NF-κB activation (3.Ruland J. Duncan G.S.

In vitro experiments have indicated that Bcl10 undergoes phosphorylation when over expressed with its viral homologue, E10 or CARMA1 (8.Thome M. Gaide O. Micheau O. Martinon F. Bonnet D. Gonzalez M.

In these studies, Bcl10 phosphorylation correlated with its ability to activate NF-κB, suggesting that this modification was required for NF-κB activation. Indeed, the COOH-terminal domain of Bcl10 is rich in serine and threonine residues and has been proposed as the site of CARMA1-mediated phosphorylation (10.Bertin J. Wang L. Guo Y. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Merriam S. DiStefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11877-11882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Since CARMA1 itself is not a kinase, the kinase responsible for Bcl10 phosphorylation has remained an open question. Rip2 is a serine/threonine kinase that contains a CARD domain at its carboxyl terminus and has been shown to induce NF-κB activation in over expression systems (11.McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J.

Rip2 has also been shown to associate in vitro with members of the TRAF family, such as TRAF6, that plays an essential role in the innate immune response downstream of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (14.Mak T.W.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). In addition, Rip2 has been implicated in regulating both the innate and adaptive immune responses (16.Kobayashi K.

Interestingly, CD4+ T-cells from Rip2-deficient mice were unable to proliferate efficiently in response to antigen-induced T-cell activation, but no mechanism was provided for this striking observation (16.Kobayashi K.

Generation of Rip2-/- Mice—A targeting vector that removed exon I of Rip2 was electroporated into ES cells. Homologous recombinants were used to generate chimeric founder mice by microinjection into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Germ line transmission was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of genomic tail DNA. Two independent ES clone lines resulted in mice with identical phenotypes. All mice used in experiments were backcrossed onto C57BL/6 five to seven generations and were confirmed to be >95% C57BL/6 by PCR analysis of genomic tail DNA. Immunoprecipitations—293 T-cells were transfected with expression vectors for NH2-terminal HA- or Myc/His-tagged Rip2, Rip2 311-541(ΔKinase) and Rip2 1-454 (ΔCARD) (11.McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M.

Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies to Rip2 (Genentech, Inc.), V5 (Invitrogen), HA and Myc (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and actin (ICN). Jurkat cells (4 × 107) were stimulated with cross-linking antibodies to the Jurkat TCR clone C305 (a gift from A. Chan, Genentech, Inc.). Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (10.Bertin J. Wang L. Guo Y. Jacobson M.D. Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Merriam S. DiStefano P.S. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Endogenous proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Bcl10 clone 331.3 (Santa Cruz) or anti-Rip2 and protein A/G beads (Pierce) and analyzed by Western blots using antibodies to Bcl10 (H-197) or Bcl10 (331.3) (Santa Cruz) and phospho-Zap-70 (Cell Signaling Technology). In some cases, immunoprecipitates were treated with λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Proliferation Assays—Splenic B and T-cells and CD4+ T were purified by negative selection using magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech) to >95% purity. Purified T-cells were activated with plate bound anti-CD3 (0-10 μg/ml) (BD Biosciences) with or without irradiated CD4-depleted APCs or plate-bound anti-CD28 (0-10 μg/ml) (BD Biosciences), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (2 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (0.1 μg/ml) (Sigma) in the presence or absence of IL-2 (50 ng/ml) (R & D Systems). B-cells were stimulated with anti-IgM (20 μg/ml) (Jackson Laboratories), LPS (20 μg/ml) (Sigma), or PMA (2 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (0.1 μg/ml). Cells were harvested at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after an 8-h pulse with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well), and incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured using a Matrix 96 direct β counter system (Hewlett-Packard). Data represent triplicate samples and are representative of at least three separate experiments. Neonatal Heart Allograft—Neonatal hearts from BALB/c (H-2d) mice were surgically implanted behind the dorsum of the ear pinna of 12-week-old male Rip2-/- and wild-type mice (Both H-2b). Heart grafts were examined with a stereomicroscope at 10-20-fold magnification every other day until rejection. Western Blots—Purified T-cells (2 × 106) were stimulated with 10 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 for 0-30 min. Western blots were performed using phospho-specific antibodies for IκBα, ERK1/2, and JNK (Cell Signaling Technology). Blots were stripped and re-probed with antibodies to IκBα and p44 (Cell Signaling Technology). NF-κB Luciferase Assays—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen) with 2-μg expression vectors (V5-Bcl10, HA-Rip2, Myc/His-K47ARip2 (11.McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Data represent triplicate samples and are representative of at least three separate experiments. Isolation of Phosphorylated Proteins—Splenic T-cells from Rip2-/- and wild-type mice (4 × 107) cells/ml) were stimulated with 10 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 for 0, 15, and 30 min. Cells were lysed under denaturing conditions to disrupt protein-protein interactions and diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in phospho-lysis buffer (Qiagen). Phosphorylated proteins were separated using the phospho-protein purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rip2 Associates with Bcl10 and Induces Its Phosphorylation—We investigated whether Rip2 could associate with molecules known to play essential roles in the TCR-induced signaling cascade. Initially, we tested whether Rip2 and Bcl10 could associate by overexpressing tagged versions of both proteins in 293 T-cells. V5-tagged Bcl10 could be co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged Rip2 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, two bands representing Bcl10 were observed. The upper band was determined to be a hyperphosphorylated form of Bcl10, since it could be collapsed to the lower band by λ phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1A). Hyperphosphorylation of Bcl10 was also apparent by mobility shift in whole cell lysates from 293T-cells co-transfected with Rip2 and Bcl10, compared with the very low levels of phosphorylation seen with Bcl10 alone (Fig. 1B). To establish the domains of Rip2 responsible for hyperphosphorylation of Bcl10, mutants with deletions of either the kinase domain or the CARD domain were used in co-expression studies. Bcl10 hyperphosphorylation required both a functional kinase domain and CARD domain of Rip2 as neither mutant induced phosphorylation of Bcl10 (Fig. 1B). Moreover, phosphorylation of Bcl10 was specific for Rip2, as overexpression of RIP or Rip3 did not induce Bcl10 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). To determine whether Rip2 was involved in Bcl10-dependent signaling pathways, we studied the interaction of endogenous proteins in Jurkat cells stimulated with cross-linking antibodies to CD3-TCR. Rip2 and Bcl10 consistently associated in a transient and time-dependent manner after TCR engagement (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). Induction of phosphorylated Zap-70 confirmed TCR activation (Fig. 1E). We next examined the phosphorylation status of Bcl10 using phosphoserine-specific antibodies. Lysates from anti-CD3 treated and untreated Jurkats were immunoprecipitated using antibodies to Bcl10 and Western blots were performed using antibodies for phosphoserine and Bcl10. Serine phosphorylated Bcl10 was detected after 15-min treatment with anti-CD3 (Fig. 1F, top panel) and treatment of immunoprecipitates with λ phosphatase (λPPase) significantly diminished levels of serine-phosphorylated Bcl10. Phosphorylation of endogenous Bcl10 was also apparent after treatment with anti-CD3, as evidenced by a slower migrating band that could be collapsed by treatment with λ phosphatase (Fig. 1F, bottom panel). Taken together, these results were consistent with Rip2 binding Bcl10 upon TCR engagement and inducing its phosphorylation. Defective T-cell Proliferation and Function in Rip2-/- Mice—To examine the effects of Rip2 on T cell activation in an in vivo setting, we generated Rip2-deficient mice by homologous recombination. Rip2-/- T-cells were deficient in anti-CD3 induced proliferation (Fig. 2, A and B). This defect could not be rescued by co-stimulation with anti-CD28 or activation using PMA in combination with calcium ionophore (ion) (Fig. 2C). The levels of IL-2 produced after treatment with anti-CD3 alone, anti-CD3 with anti-CD28, or with PMA and ionomycin were drastically reduced compared with wild-type T-cells (data not shown). Moreover, addition of exogenous IL-2 was not able to rescue the defect in proliferation in Rip2-/- T-cells after stimulation (Fig. 2D). Consistent with previous reports, B-cell proliferation in response to PMA/ionomycin, IgM, and LPS was comparable between Rip2-deficient and wild-type B-cells (data not shown) (16.Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggested that the defect in proliferation in Rip2-/- mice was confined to T-cells and likely due to impairment upstream of IL-2 gene transcription and NF-κB activation. Previous in vivo experiments on Rip2-/- mice tested T-cell responsiveness using models such as Listeria challenge and T-cell-dependent antibody responses (16.Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 17.Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), which also involve participation of TLRs and other innate signaling cascades through adjuvant and bacterial components. Therefore, to test T-cell responsiveness in vivo, we designed a high bar functional test, the ability to participate in a graft rejection response, which does not require major driver co-signals from pathways of the innate immune system. Hearts from allogeneic neonate BALB/c (H-2d) mice were transplanted into the ear pinna of wild-type and Rip2-deficient mice (H-2b) and allograft survival monitored. While all hearts were rejected by wild-type mice by day 15, over 50% of the neonate hearts were still beating in Rip2-deficient mice and continued to function for an additional 5 days (Fig. 2E). Therefore, Rip2-deficient mice rejected heart allografts much less readily than wild-type mice, consistent with our in vitro data and a defect in normal T-cell activation and function. Defective NF-κB Activation in Rip2-deficient Cells—To determine the molecular basis of the impairment in T-cell receptor signaling in the absence of Rip2, we analyzed pathways activated by TCR engagement in wild-type and Rip2-/- T-cells. T-cells from wild-type and Rip2-/- mice were treated with plate-bound anti-CD3 or TNFα, and lysates were assessed by Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies to IκBα. IκBα was rapidly phosphorylated and degraded in wild-type T-cells but not in Rip2-/- cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, treatment of both wild-type and Rip2-/- T-cells with TNFα promoted equivalent phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (Fig. 3B). Hence, NF-κB signaling downstream of other surface receptors remained intact in Rip2-/- mice. TCR engagement also elicits activation of the RAS/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway. Western blotting using phospho-specific anti-ERK1/2 antibodies demonstrated that ERK-1 and ERK-2 were phosphorylated with similar kinetics in wild-type and Rip2-/- T-cells after TCR engagement (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Similarly, activation of the JNK signaling pathway post-TCR engagement was equivalent in both wild-type and Rip2-deficient T-cells (Fig. 3C, lower panel). These results confirmed that the defect was specific for NF-κB signaling downstream of the TCR and that parallel pathways activated by TCR engagement remained intact. To address the role of Rip2 kinase activity in Bcl10-dependent NF-κB activation, we transfected MEFs from wild-type and Rip2-/- mice with Bcl10 and a luciferase reporter for NF-κB. While Bcl10 could induce NF-κB activation in wild-type MEFs, NF-κB activation by Bcl10 was significantly decreased in Rip2-/- MEFS (Fig. 3D). Transfection of exogenous wild-type Rip2, but not a kinase-dead mutant, K47A, could rescue Bcl10-induced NF-κB reporter activity in Rip2-/- MEFs (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the kinase activity of Rip2 is required for optimal Bcl10-induced NF-κB activation. Bcl10 Is Phosphorylated after TCR Engagement in Wild-type but Not Rip2-/- Mice—Taken together, our data suggested that Rip2 functions to regulate T-cell activation by phosphorylating Bcl10. Therefore, we wished to establish whether the lack of NF-κB activation observed in Rip2-/- T-cells correlated with a lack of Bcl10 phosphorylation after TCR engagement. Wild-type and Rip2-deficient T-cells were treated with α-CD3, and cell lysates were fractionated using a phosphoserine/threonine column. Under these lysis conditions, all protein-protein interactions are disrupted, and only phosphorylated proteins bind the column, while unphosphorylated proteins flow through. Western blotting of the phosphorylated protein fractions using antibodies to phospho-ERK and Bcl10 revealed that while phosphorylated ERK1/2 could easily be detected in the purified phosphorylated fractions of both wild-type and Rip2-/- T-cells (Fig. 3E, middle panel), Bcl10 was only present in the purified phosphorylated fractions of α-CD3 treated wild-type T-cells (Fig. 3E, top panel). By contrast, similar levels of Bcl10 were detected in the non-phosphorylated fractions from wild-type and knock-out T-cells (Fig. 3E, bottom panel). To confirm that no unphosphorylated proteins contaminated the phosphorylated protein fraction, lysates from both fractions were Western blotted using antibodies for Hsp60. Hsp60 was abundant in the non-phosphorylated fraction but undetectable in the phosphorylated protein fraction (Fig. 3F). These data demonstrate that Bcl10 is phosphorylated in mouse primary T cells after TCR stimulation, and deficiency of Rip2 precludes phosphorylation of Bcl10. Herein we provide evidence for the importance of Rip2 in TCR-mediated NF-κB activation and Bcl10-dependent signaling. Phosphorylation of Bcl10 occurs after TCR engagement, and lack of phosphorylation correlates with a defect in NF-κB activation and T-cell proliferation. Earlier studies have shown that Bcl10 is phosphorylated upon over expression of CARMA1; however, the importance of phosphorylation in T-cell signaling was unclear. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of Bcl10 by Rip2 plays a key role in signaling between the TCR and the IKK complex. Recent reports (4.Newton K. Dixit V.M. Curr.

It remains unclear whether Bcl10 phosphorylation is required for its association with CARMA1. The kinetics of the association between Rip2 and Bcl10 and subsequent Bcl10 phosphorylation in Jurkat cells correlates with the kinetics of the published interaction between CARMA1 and Bcl10 in Jurkat T-cells (19.Gaide O.

Phosphorylation of Bcl10 may either facilitate its recruitment to lipid rafts or serve to activate other key molecules in downstream signaling events that ultimately activate the IKK complex. For example, MALT1/paracaspase, a death domain-containing caspase-like molecule, has also been shown to associate with Bcl10 and enhance NF-κB activation (22.Uren A.G. O'Rourke K. Aravind L.A.

French D.M. Dixit V.M. Science. 2003; 302: 1581-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with previous reports that Rip2-deficient mice suffer from defects in the adaptive immune response due to lack of antigen-induced T-cell proliferation and NF-κB activation (16.Kobayashi K.

Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Similar to published results, we also observed a defect in cytokine production in macrophages stimulated with LPS and other Toll-like receptors, demonstrating an additional defect in innate immunity (data not shown) (16.Kobayashi K.

Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G. Nature. 2002; 416: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Since Rip2 associates with key signaling molecules in both the adaptive and innate immune responses, such as Bcl10 and TRAF6 respectively, it is reasonable that the absence of this promiscuous kinase would impinge on multiple signaling pathways and result in broad ranging deficits in immune system function.

Structural studies indicate that the HLH dimer forms a compact four-helical bundle that positions the basic region to facilitate interaction with the DNA recognition sequence (1Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). There are two subclasses of bHLH proteins in which formation of protein dimers is additionally regulated by an adjacent secondary dimerization domain, either a leucine zipper (Zip) or a Per/Arnt/Sim (PAS) homology domain (2Massari M.E.

The PAS region in bHLH.PAS proteins consists of two adjacent PAS domains, degenerate repeats of ∼130 amino acids, termed PAS A and PAS B (3Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAS domains are not restricted to bHLH DNA-binding proteins and are a widely observed protein-protein interaction and signaling module forming a highly conserved structure, despite having low primary sequence homology (3Taylor B.L.

The minimal PAS domain structure consists of a 5-stranded β-sheet with a central α-helical PAS core region, often containing a binding site for small ligands, and a helical connector spanning the two halves of the β-scaffold (5Crews S.T. Fan C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Amezcua C.A. Harper S.M. Rutter J. Gardner K.H. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1349-1361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Some PAS domains also appear to include a highly variable N-terminal α-helical cap, although the function of this structure is not clear (7Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 8Vreede J. van der Horst M.A. Hellingwerf K.J. Crielaard W. van Aalten D.M. J. Biol.

In vivo, the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (Arnt) is the common obligate dimerization partner for a number of bHLH.PAS proteins, including the dioxin (or aryl hydrocarbon) receptor (DR), the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF) 1α and 2α, and the Sim proteins (9Ema M. Morita M. Ikawa S. Tanaka M. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Hamada H. Kikuchi Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5865-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic DR, on binding an activating ligand such as dioxin or structurally related halogenated hydrocarbons within the PAS B domain (10Whitelaw M.L. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), translocates to the nucleus and heterodimerizes with Arnt to form a functional DNA binding complex (11Lees M.J. Whitelaw M.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The DR/Arnt dimer recognizes the xenobiotic response element (XRE) in enhancers of target genes and promotes transcription of a battery of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. The HIFα proteins mediate cellular responses to oxygen. They are rapidly turned over at normoxia whereas under hypoxic stress, HIFα is stabilized in a form competent to recruit coactivators (12Lando D. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Peet D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Under hypoxia, HIFα heterodimerizes with Arnt in the nucleus and binds to the hypoxic response element (HRE) in the enhancer regions of target genes involved in glycolysis, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis (12Lando D. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Peet D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Whereas the bHLH and bHLH.Zip proteins recognize the classic E-box core enhancer sequence (CANNTG) (2Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), both the XRE (TNGCGTG) and HRE (TACGTG) recognized by the DR and HIFα heterodimers, respectively, are atypical E-box sequences. Furthermore, residues N-terminal of the basic DNA binding region in the DR appear critical for DNA binding, suggesting that the DR has a more complex mode of DNA binding (13Bacsi S.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8843-8850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to heterodimerizing with a range of bHLH.PAS proteins, Arnt is able to homodimerize and bind DNA, although the in vivo relevance of this is not clear. The Arnt homodimer preferentially binds the symmetrical CACGTG canonical E-box element in vitro (14Swanson H.I. Chan W.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1936-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A number of studies, primarily of the DR-Arnt interaction, indicate that the PAS domain of bHLH.PAS proteins functions as a dimerization interface, which defines partner choice (16Antonsson C.

Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The isolated bHLH domain of the DR is able to both homodimerize and form heterodimers with the unrelated bHLH.Zip protein, USF. Addition of the N-terminal region of the adjacent PAS domain restricts dimerization to the appropriate partner, Arnt (18Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the absence of the bHLH domain, the DR/Arnt PAS domain interaction can be detected using a mammalian two-hybrid assay (19Lindebro M.C. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and deletion of the entire PAS region of Arnt markedly reduces dimerization with the DR (20Reisz-Porszasz S. Probst M.R. Fukunaga B.N. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 6075-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although both the bHLH and PAS domains of the DR contribute to dimerization with Arnt, a dimer comprising only the DR bHLH/Arnt bHLH regions is sufficient for XRE recognition (18Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, several observations suggest that the PAS interaction may contribute to the affinity of the complex for the XRE target DNA. Deletion of the entire PAS region of the DR results in constituitive dimerization with Arnt through the bHLH domain, with the resulting heterodimer having a reduced level of XRE binding (16Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. McGuire J Gustafsson J.A Poellinger L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 756-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced affinity for XRE target DNA is also observed for a dimer formed between Arnt and a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal bHLH domain of the DR fused to the C-terminal PAS-containing portion of Arnt (16Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. McGuire J Gustafsson J.A Poellinger L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 756-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, distinct point mutations within the PAS region of either the DR or Arnt abolish XRE binding, apparently without significantly disrupting DR/Arnt dimerization (21Sun W. Zhang J. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31845-31854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Numayama-Tsuruta K. Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There is at present little structural or mechanistic information about the protein/DNA interactions underlying transcriptional regulation by the bHLH.PAS proteins, and our molecular understanding is derived from largely qualitative data. Here, we have analyzed purified bacterially expressed proteins encompassing the bHLH.PAS regions of Arnt, the DR and HIF-1α and quantitated binding to their respective target DNA in vitro. Recovery of functional DNA binding proteins from bacteria was dramatically enhanced by coexpression of the bHLH.PAS regions of DR or HIF-1α with the corresponding region of Arnt. Formation of stable protein/DNA binding complexes of DR/Arnt and HIF/Arnt heterodimers was dependent on the presence of the PAS A domain, whereas the PAS A and B domains of Arnt had little effect on binding of Arnt homodimers to the E-box sequence. Plasmids—Expression plasmids were constructed using standard methods and verified by sequencing. Fusion proteins containing an N-terminal thioredoxin 6-histidine (TrxH6) tag were expressed from pET32a (Novagen). TrxH6 Arnt sequences from the pET32a Arnt vectors were subcloned into pAC28 (23Kholod N. Mustelin T. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (326–328): 322-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which has an origin of replication compatible with pET32a. This allowed transformation of expression strains with both a pAC28 TrxH6 Arnt construct and a pET32a-based DR or HIF-1α construct for coexpression of two proteins. DR with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag was expressed from pEGST (23Kholod N. Mustelin T. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (326–328): 322-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with coexpression of TrxH6 Arnt from pAC28. All DR constructs contained substitutions of S2G and D83A resulting from the cloning strategy, both of which have been shown to have no effect on activity (16Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. McGuire J Gustafsson J.A Poellinger L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 756-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arnt constructs were derived from an original cDNA from human hepatoma cells having Arg at position 313 rather than the more common Lys, which did not alter DNA binding (data not shown). Protein Expression and Purification—Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(λDE3) essentially as described in Chapman-Smith et al. (24Chapman-Smith A. Mulhern T.D. Whelan F. Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C.

Nickel affinity chromatography was carried out using HiTrap chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein eluting from the nickel resin with 250 mm imidazole was desalted by dialysis against Storage Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5–10% glycerol, 0.2 mm DTT) at 4 °C. Alternatively, the sample was further purified immediately by size exclusion chromatography on a 2.6 × 70 cm Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Storage Buffer. For purification of protein expressed in the insoluble fraction, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 8 m urea, 0.1 mm DTT, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography in the presence of 8 m urea. Proteins were refolded by dialysis at 4 °C, first against 8 m urea in 20 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT to remove imidazole, then successively against 4 m, 2 m, or no urea in the same buffer and finally against Storage Buffer. Protein Analysis and Quantitation—SDS-PAGE analysis of protein samples was carried out using standard techniques. Total protein was quantitated with the BioRad Protein Assay against a BSA standard. Individual proteins in coexpressed samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie or Sypro Ruby protein gel stain (BioRad) and quantitated using NIH Image and Quantity One (BioRad) software, against a BSA standard. Trypsin digestion was carried out at a protein/enzyme ratio of 100:1 (w/w) as described in Chapman-Smith et al. (25Chapman-Smith A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Total protein concentration was 6 μg/ml, the reaction contained 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT from the protein Storage Buffer, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 50 mm EDTA, SDS/DTT gel loading buffer and boiling for 5min. Digestion products were separated by SDS-PAGE, detected by Western blotting with chemiluminescent substrates, and bands on x-ray film were quantitated using Quantity One software. Rabbit anti-thioredoxin IgG was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the mouse monoclonal antibody to the basic region of the DR, RPT1, was purchased from Affinity BioReagents, CO. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized by GeneWorks (Adelaide, SA, Australia) with fluorescein conjugated at the 5′-end of each strand and annealed to produce double-stranded fluorescently labeled probes for EMSA. Probes spanned either the CACGTG E-box motif from the adenovirus major late promoter (26Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), the XRE sequence from the cytochrome P4501A1 promoter (18Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol.

DNA binding reactions were carried out at pH 7–7.5 with 50 mm NaCl for the E-box probe, pH 7.9 with 100 mm NaCl for the XRE probe and pH 7.5 with 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl for the HRE probes. Reactions contained 20 mm HEPES, 40 mm Tris-HCl and 3 mm MgCl2, (E-box and XRE) or 20 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm MgCl2, (HRE) and 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 12–15% glycerol (v/v), 1 μg of BSA, 0.1μg of denatured salmon sperm, and 1–4 nm DNA probe in a final volume of 25–50 μl. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, protein/DNA complexes were resolved on 7% native polyacrylamide gels containing 5–10% glycerol (v/v) that had been precooled overnight at 4 °C with 25 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EDTA for XRE and HRE binding, or 25 mm Tris, 25 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA for E-box binding. Preimmune serum or a polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of Arnt (29Mason G. Witte A. Whitelaw M. Antonsson C. McGuire J. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J. J. Biol.

Initial experiments were carried out according to standard protocols in the literature for preparing protein/DNA complexes for EMSA, i.e. with a preliminary incubation of the proteins prior to addition of DNA. Binding curves generated in this way showed marked sigmoidicity, which was not seen when the protein samples were added directly to the DNA binding reaction mixture. This suggested that at the lowest concentrations of protein, dilution in the absence of DNA resulted in dissociation of preformed protein dimers, which were not able to reassociate to form a functional complex in the presence of DNA. Therefore, the preincubation in the absence of DNA was omitted. After separation, DNA was visualized with an FX molecular imager (BioRad), and bands were quantitated using Quantity One software. KD values were determined from binding curves by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) after correction for ligand depletion at low protein concentrations where necessary, as recommended in the GraphPad Prism manual. Expression and Purification of Functional DNA-binding Proteins—Proteins comprising either the bHLH or bHLH.PAS domains of Arnt, the DR and HIF-1α were expressed in E. coli as fusions to TrxH6 or GST. To maximize the production of soluble, functional proteins, our truncations were designed based on homology to the known PAS domain structures (3Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The bHLH.PAS A constructs included both the linker region C-terminal to the homology-defined end of the PAS A domain, and the sequence proposed to form an N-terminal cap structure on the PAS B domain ((7Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) Fig. 1a), since in the DR, this intervening region (residues 230–287) has been shown to be important for the interaction with Arnt (19Lindebro M.C. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 30McGuire J. Okamoto K. Whitelaw M.L. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41841-41849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The bHLH.PAS A.B constructs were truncated after the end of the proposed PAS B structured domain. We did not include the DR PAS B ligand binding domain in any of our constructs, since previous work has shown that proteins containing this region when produced in bacteria are insoluble and incompetent to bind ligand, presumably due to the absolute requirement for eukaryotic chaperones (31Coumailleau P. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25291-25300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 2M. Lees and M. L. Whitelaw, unpublished data. The Arnt TrxH6-bHLH.PAS A(.B) proteins could be readily purified from the E. coli lysate by nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography, and a significant proportion of the expressed protein was soluble (Fig. 1b). Both Arnt PAS-containing constructs and the Arnt TrxH6-bHLH domain alone formed a complex with E-box DNA in EMSAs, which could be depleted with anti-Arnt antibody (Fig. 2a), and this DNA binding activity was specific for the E-box sequence as no DNA binding was observed when these proteins were incubated with the XRE (Fig. 2c, lanes 1–3) or the HRE (Fig. 2d, lane 3) probes. The Arnt TrxH6-bHLH.PAS proteins showed a tendency to aggregate during purification and the high molecular weight material recovered after size exclusion chromatography did not bind DNA (data not shown). Arnt TrxH6-bHLH protein obtained after nickel affinity chromatography bound DNA as a single species (Fig. 2a, lane 2), although the preparation contained a number of lower molecular weight bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1b, lane 10), most of which cross-reacted with anti-Arnt antibody on Western blots. Expression levels were very low relative to the Arnt bHLH.PAS constructs and attempts to further purify the Arnt bHLH DNA binding species by standard chromatographic methods resulted in loss of activity (data not shown). The same species were detected when Arnt bHLH was prepared from whole cell extracts under denaturing conditions, suggesting that the protein was subject to degradation during expression, possibly as a consequence of toxicity resulting from nonspecific DNA binding by the Arnt bHLH domain in bacteria. Expression of the DR bHLH.PAS A construct fused to either TrxH6 or GST produced proteins that were predominantly insoluble. The low levels of soluble protein recovered after affinity purification, when combined with Arnt TrxH6-bHLH.PAS A protein in vitro, produced a very weak DNA binding complex with the XRE target DNA (Fig. 2b, lane 6). Similarly, the purified HIF-1α TrxH6-bHLH.PAS A (. B) proteins combined in vitro with the corresponding Arnt TrxH6-bHLH.PAS protein showed poor HRE binding activity (Fig. 2d, lane 6), although the proportion of soluble protein recovered was somewhat higher for HIF-1α than the DR (data not shown). However, coexpression from compatible vectors (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 23Kholod N. Mustelin T. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (326–328): 322-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) of constructs encoding the DR or HIF-1α bHLH.PAS, fused to TrxH6, with the corresponding region of TrxH6-Arnt markedly increased the yield of soluble DR or HIF-1α protein and the material recovered after nickel affinity chromatography had significantly higher affinity for target DNA in EMSA experiments (DR/Arnt: Fig. 2b, lanes 2 and 3; HIF/Arnt: Fig. 2d, lanes 4 and 5). Depletion of bands in EMSA upon addition of anti-Arnt antibodies to the binding reactions showed that these DNA binding complexes contained Arnt (Fig. 2c, lane 11; Fig. 2e, lanes 7 and 10). Their formation was specific to the appropriate target DNA sequence since the DR/Arnt bands were competed away by wild type but not mutant XRE DNA sequences (Fig. 2c, lanes 5–10) and the HIF/Arnt bands were seen with wild type but not mutant HRE DNA probes (Fig. 2e, lanes 1–4). A fraction containing approximately equal amounts of Arnt and the partner protein, and having strong DNA binding activity, could be recovered in each case after further purification by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1c, DR/Arnt: lane 3; HIF/Arnt: lanes 8 and 11) and was the material used for the DNA binding analyses described subsequently. As with the Arnt bHLH.PAS proteins, the DR/Arnt and HIF-1α/Arnt proteins showed a tendency to aggregate. However, in contrast to Arnt expressed alone, this process appeared to be reversible to some extent for the heterodimers, since the apparently high molecular weight DR/Arnt and HIF-1α/Arnt complexes recovered after size exclusion chromatography were each able to bind DNA with a mobility in EMSAs consistent with a DNA binding dimer. Interestingly, when the DR GST-bHLH.PAS A construct was coexpressed with Arnt TrxH6-bHLH.PAS A, the resulting heterodimer recovered from the nickel column had a dramatically lower affinity for the XRE than the corresponding DR TrxH6-bHLH.PAS A heterodimer (Fig. 2b, lanes 4 and 5). Therefore, our subsequent experiments used only the TrxH6 fusion proteins. Here, we have shown that coexpression of partner proteins in bacteria has enabled the recovery of proteins competent to bind DNA, encompassing the bHLH and PAS domains, that can be readily purified in functional form with good yield. The purified proteins specifically bind their cognate DNA sequences in vitro in EMSAs, thus enabling quantitative analysis of DNA binding. The PAS Domains of Arnt Do Not Contribute to DNA Binding Affinity or Stability—The equilibrium binding affinity of purified proteins encompassing the Arnt bHLH and PAS A ± PAS B domains for DNA containing the E-box sequence was analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 3a). The apparent equilibrium binding constant, KD, calculated from the resulting binding curves gave values for Arnt bHLH.PAS A and bHLH.PAS A .B of 45 ± 4 nm and 46 ± 5nm respectively (Fig. 3b), clearly demonstrating that the PAS B domain of Arnt had no effect on the affinity of the Arnt/DNA binding complex. Since we were unable to purify the bHLH domain, in the absence of the PAS domain, to a degree sufficient to allow reliable determination of protein concentration, similar quantitative experiments could not be carried out for the bHLH domain of Arnt. However, the apparent KD for DNA of both the Arnt bHLH.PAS A and B proteins was similar to the value of ∼30 nm determined by Huffman et al. (15H"

By employing RNA arbitrarily primed-PCR to search for novel phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-regulated genes in response to insulin in isolated rat adipocytes, we identified fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), a key component of the detoxification pathway of aldehydes arising from lipid peroxidation events. Among these latter events are oxidative stresses associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. Upon insulin injection, FALDH mRNA expression increased in rat liver and white adipose tissue and was impaired in two models of insulin-resistant mice, db/db and high fat diet mice. FALDH mRNA levels were 4-fold decreased in streptozotocin-treated rats, suggesting that FALDH deregulation occurs both in hyperinsulinemic insulin-resistant state and hypoinsulinemic type 1 diabetes models. Moreover, insulin treatment increases FALDH activity in hepatocytes, and expression of FALDH was augmented during adipocyte differentiation. Considering the detoxifying role of FALDH, its deregulation in insulin-resistant and type 1 diabetic models may contribute to the lipid-derived oxidative stress. To assess the role of FALDH in the detoxification of oxidized lipid species, we evaluated the production of reactive oxygen species in normal versus FALDH-overexpressing adipocytes. Ectopic expression of FALDH significantly decreased reactive oxygen species production in cells treated by 4-hydroxynonenal, the major lipid peroxidation product, suggesting that FALDH protects against oxidative stress associated with lipid peroxidation. Taken together, our observations illustrate the importance of FALDH in insulin action and its deregulation in states associated with altered insulin signaling.

PI3K activation occurs after binding of the Src homology 2 domains of its p85 regulatory subunit to specific tyrosine-phosphorylated sites of the insulin receptor substrates (1Van Obberghen E.

By activating these kinases, PI3K generates several insulin-dependent actions on metabolism such as glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and lipogenesis.

We hypothesized that defects in the regulation of gene expression controlled by PI3K may participate in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. To identify genes involved in glucose homeostasis, which are specifically controlled by PI3K in response to insulin, we performed RNA arbitrarily primed (RAP)-PCR on freshly isolated rat adipocytes in the presence or absence of insulin and wortmannin, a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K. By using this approach, we isolated several clones corresponding to both previously identified and novel genes. One RAP-PCR product corresponds to fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family that oxidizes aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to the corresponding carboxylic acids (20Miyauchi K. Masaki R. Taketani S. Yamamoto A. Akayama M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19536-19542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes are considered to be important for the detoxification of both exogenous and endogenous aldehydes such as those derived from lipid peroxidation of membrane phospholipids (21Vasiliou V. Pappa A. Petersen D.R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). FALDH is a microsomal NAD/NADP-dependent enzyme that acts on long chain aliphatic substrates. The cDNA for FALDH encodes a protein of 485 amino acids (22Rizzo W.B. Lin Z. Carney G. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130-132: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This protein has a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence that is necessary for microsomal membrane anchoring (23Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present work, we characterized the regulation of FALDH gene expression by insulin, and we addressed the role of FALDH in insulin action in normal, insulin-resistant, and type 1 diabetes conditions. Materials—Recombinant human insulin was from Novo-Nordisk (Copenhagen, Denmark). Recombinant human epidermal growth factor was from Strathmann Biotec AG (Hamburg, Germany). LY294002 was from Calbiochem. Wortmannin and methylglyoxal (MGO) were from Sigma. Chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (CM-DCFDA) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) was from Merck. Antibodies to phospho-Ser-473 PKB were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and anti-Myc was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Jackson Immuno-Research (Copenhagen, Denmark). Animal Treatment and Protocols—Care of animals was performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. Male Wistar rats (150-200 g), 8-10 weeks of age, were purchased from Janvier Laboratory (Laval-LeGenest, France). Male C57BL/6J and db/db mice were obtained at 6 weeks of age from Janvier Laboratory. Animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled facility (22 °C) on a 12-h light/dark cycle and were given free access to food (standard laboratory chow diet from UAR, Epinay-S/Orge, France) unless otherwise indicated. In some experiments, rats or mice were deprived of food for 20 h. Fasted animals were given an intraperitoneal injection with insulin at 1 IU/kg (Actrapid 100 IU/ml, Novo-Nordisk, Denmark) for 6 h or refed with chow diet for 8 h. Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tissues were rapidly harvested, weighed, and processed for preparation of total RNA or cell culture. High fat diet male C57BL/6J mice were generated by giving high fat and high sucrose diets (D12327, Research Diet, New Brunswick, NJ) over 15 weeks. To generate type 1 diabetic animals, Sprague-Dawley rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (65-70 mg/kg) as described previously (24Hauguel-de Mouzon S. Peraldi P. Alengrin F. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adipose Tissue Culture—Epididymal fat pads from Wistar rats were dissected, minced finely, and digested with Liberase Blendzyme 3 (Roche Applied Science) by shaking at 37 °C for 45 min. Isolated adipocytes were separated from stromal-vascular cells (S-V) by filtration through a 30-μm nylon mesh. The cells were then washed twice with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate Hepes pH 7.4 (KRBH) buffer and processed for RNA preparation. For primary adipocyte culture, isolated adipocytes were placed in Falcon 2059 tubes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin for primary culture. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were depleted overnight in DMEM supplemented with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) before insulin treatment. The samples were collected, and total RNA was isolated and was analyzed by RT-PCR. For adenoviral infection, isolated adipocytes in culture were infected for 12 h, and the medium was then replaced for 12 h before starvation. Isolation and Culturing of Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats by collagenase dissociation of the liver as described by Fehlmann et al. (25Fehlmann M. Le Cam A. Freychet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10431-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated hepatocytes were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRb) buffer, pH 7.4, containing defatted BSA (10 mg/ml), gentamycin (0.05 mg/ml) and were gassed with a mixture of 5% CO2, 95% O2. Primary cultures of hepatocytes were performed essentially as described by Morin et al. (26Morin O. Fehlmann M. Freychet P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 25: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a final concentration of 106 cells/ml in Waymouth's medium supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal calf serum. After 4 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with serum-free Waymouth's medium containing defatted BSA (2 mg/ml), penicillin, and streptomycin, and cells were incubated overnight before insulin treatment. For adenoviral infection, hepatocytes were infected with adenovirus for 12 h, and culture medium was replaced, and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. RAP-PCR—RAP-PCR was performed with the RAP-PCR kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), according to the method of Welsh et al. (27Welsh J. Chada K. Dalal S.S. Cheng R. Ralph D. McClelland M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4965-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Isolated adipocytes were treated or not with insulin (10-7m) or cotreated with insulin and wortmannin (100 nm) for 6 h. After extraction of total RNA, poly(A+) RNA was purified using a Poly(A) Tract mRNA Isolation System (Promega, Charbonnières, France). The RT reaction was performed using 100 ng of RNA poly(A+) and different arbitrary primers (1.25 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C by adding to the First Strand Buffer 125 μm of each dNTP, 40 units of RNase (Stratagene), and 25 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). The reaction was stopped by heating to 90 °C for 5 min. To perform RAP-PCRs, 1× Taq Reaction Buffer, 1 μm arbitrary primers, 50 μm of each dNTP, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, and 0.2 μCi/ml of [α-33P]ATP were added to 1 μl of the cDNA. The PCR was started by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min and 72 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. To visualize the RAP-PCR products, 5 μl from each reaction was mixed with 10 μl of stop buffer containing 80% (v/v) formamide, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and heated at 80 °C for 2 min. 4 μl of each reaction was loaded on a 4% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 55 watts in 1× TBE buffer, and the gel was autoradiographed. The RAP-PCR gel and the autoradiogram were aligned, and individual bands representing differentially expressed products were cut and removed from the gel. Each isolated band was incubated in 70 μl of elution buffer at 60 °C for 1 h and at room temperature for 12 h. Eluted samples were collected and reamplified by PCR with the same primer used for the RAP-PCR. The RAP-PCR products were then sub-cloned in pCR 2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced using M13 reverse and forward primers. FALDH Assay—Hepatocytes were washed with PBS and homogenized in 2 ml of homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm sucrose) with a Teflon glass Potter homogenizer. Final protein concentration was assayed by bicinchoninic acid technique (BCA protein assay kit, Interchim, Montluçon, France). FALDH assay was performed as described previously by Kelson et al. (28Kelson T.L. Secor McVoy J.R. Rizzo W.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) using 100 μg of crude homogenate with a mixture containing 193 μl of deionized water, 100 μl of 200 mm glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.5, 0.4% v/v Triton X-100, 40 μl of 100 mm pyrazole, 20 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free), 24 μl of 25 mm NAD+. Each sample was incubated at 37 °C, and the reaction was initiated by adding 3 μl of 160 μm dodecanol. FALDH activity was monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm at different times. Control reactions were run for each sample by substituting 3 μl of 100% v/v ethanol for the aldehyde solution and running the reaction as above. FALDH-dependent enzyme activity was calculated by subtracting the absorbance measured in the absence of aldehyde from that seen in its presence and dividing by 60 min to express the final result as units/min. Adipocyte Differentiation—3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin and allowed to reach confluence as described previously. At 2 days post-confluence (day 0), differentiation was initiated by the addition of 100 nm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.25 mm isobutylmethylxanthine in DMEM with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Three days later (day 3), the induction medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and insulin only and was changed every 2 days. Adipogenesis was assessed by analysis of the expression of adipocyte-specific genes (aP2 or PPARγ) and by lipid accumulation using microscopic analysis. Total RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA from tissues (liver, muscle, or white adipose tissue) or cells was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was denatured in formamide and formaldehyde at 60 °C and separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% w/v agarose gels. RNA was then transferred to positively charged Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and cross-linked to the membrane by heating to 80 °C. Specific cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Biosciences) and purified with the Probequant kit (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were hybridized with labeled cDNA probes overnight at 42 °C in NorthernMax hybridization buffer (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Membranes were then washed in 1× SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and exposed to PhosphorImager for 4-24 h. The signals were scanned (Storm 840) and quantified using ImageQuant 5.0 software (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were stripped and rehybridized with a 5′-32P-labeled 18 S oligonucleotide probe in order to normalize the signal. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was treated with DNase (Ambion), and 1 μg was reverse-transcribed for 60 min at 42 °C using the Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega) in the presence of random primers and oligo(dT)15. Quantitative PCR was performed by monitoring in real time the increase in fluorescence of the SYBR Green dye on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers for each gene were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France), with a melting temperature at 58-60 °C and a resulting product of ∼100 bp. Each PCR was carried out in triplicate in a 20-μl volume using SYBR Green I Master Mix Plus (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) for 15 min at 95 °C for initial denaturing, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s in the ABI Prism 7000 sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems). To exclude the contamination of nonspecific PCR products such as primer dimers, melting curve analysis was applied to all final PCR products after the cycling protocols. Values for each gene were normalized to expression levels of HPRT mRNA in rat tissue and 36B4 mRNA in mouse tissue. Each RT-PCR quantification experiment was performed in triplicate. Relative quantification of FALDH gene was calculated by using 2-ΔCt formula, as recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Results were expressed relative to the control condition, which was arbitrary assigned a value of 1. Primers sequences used to quantify FALDH mRNA by real time RT-PCR were designed by using the Primer Express software from Applied Biosystems. Oligonucleotides used were as follows: rat FALDH sense, 5′-AGCCCAGCTACATTGACAGAGA-3′, and antisense, 5′-ACACAGGATATAGTCAGAGCAATACA-3′; mouse FALDH sense, 5′-CAGCATTTCCTGGAGCAATG-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGCTTGGAATTACCCTTTCGTTCT-3′; HPRT sense, 5′-AGCCTGGTCATGTTGCCTTT-3′, and antisense, 5′-AAAGAACTTATAGCCCCCCTTGA-3′; and 36B4 sense, 5′-CTTTATCAGCTGCACATCACTCAGA, and antisense, 5′-TCCAGGCTTTGGGCATCA-3′. Western Blot—Western blotting was performed on whole cell lysates from isolated adipocytes. Protein extracts were obtained by mixing 200 μl of fat cell suspension with 200 μl of Laemmli buffer (3% (w/v) SDS, 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 11% (v/v) glycerol). The samples were incubated for 5 min at 90 °C, and protein concentration was assayed with the bicinchoninic acid technique (BCA protein assay kit, Interchim, Monluçon, France). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham Biosciences), and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Adenoviruses expressing FALDH were generated by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli BJ 5183 as described previously (29Pirola L. Bonnafous S. Johnston A.M. Chaussade C. Portis F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15641-15651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, co-transformation of E. coli BJ 5183 led to recombination between FALDH (cloned in pCDNA3) and a viral vector recombinogenic with the pCDNA3 cytomegalovirus promoter and poly(A) sequence (VmcDNA, provided by S. Rusconi, University of Fribourg, Switzerland) (29Pirola L. Bonnafous S. Johnston A.M. Chaussade C. Portis F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15641-15651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recombinants were screened by PCR analysis using a pair of primers that annealed to the viral vector and to the cytomegalovirus promoter sequence, respectively. A positive clone harboring FALDH was further amplified in E. coli DH5-α, digested with PacI, and transfected by the calcium phosphate method into helper 293 cells to produce viral particles. Adenoviruses were stored in 0.1 m Tris, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, 50% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5, at -20 °C. Adenoviruses expressing p110α CAAX (Ad p110α CAAX, where AA is aliphatic amino acid) and GFP (Ad-GFP) were described previously (29Pirola L. Bonnafous S. Johnston A.M. Chaussade C. Portis F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15641-15651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Viral titer of stocks was >108 plaque-forming units/ml. Assay for Reactive Oxygen Species Production—The intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species was detected using the fluorescent probe CM-DCFDA (30Maziere C. Floret S. Santus R. Morliere P. Marcheux V. Maziere J.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Starved cells were treated with MGO or 4-HNE at times and concentrations indicated below. The cells were washed two times in PBS and exposed to 5 × 10-5m CM-DCFDA in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed two times in PBS, solubilized in water, and sonicated. The fluorescence was determined at 488/525 nm, normalized on a protein basis, and expressed as percentage of control. Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes by Insulin-induced PI3K Activation in Isolated Rat Adipocytes—To identify novel genes controlled specifically by PI3K in response to insulin, we performed RAP-PCR on freshly isolated rat adipocytes treated or not with insulin (10-7m) and with or without exposure to wortmannin (100 nm), an inhibitor of PI3K. Briefly, poly(A) RNA was extracted for each condition and reverse-transcribed. RAP-PCR was performed using several combinations of arbitrary primers. RAP-PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis. We found 27 clones showing PI3K-dependent modulation in mRNA expression. Subsequent Northern blot analysis identified and confirmed 10 differentially expressed genes in isolated adipocytes, corresponding to both previously identified and unidentified genes. Among these clones, we isolated a RAP-PCR product corresponding to FAS cDNA. The transcriptional control of this gene by insulin via PI3K activation has been described previously (11Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25420-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), thus validating our approach. Characterization of FALDH mRNA Expression in Isolated Adipocytes—Another RAP-PCR product, recognizing a 4-kb mRNA by Northern blot analysis, corresponds to the FALDH gene. By using real time quantitative PCR, we observed a 4-fold increase in FALDH gene expression after stimulation of isolated adipocytes with insulin (10-7m, 6 h) (Fig. 1A). When adipocytes were incubated simultaneously with insulin and wortmannin (100 nm), the increase in expression was abolished, suggesting a PI3K-specific control on the FALDH gene. In parallel, we tested another growth factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF), which also activates the PI3K pathway in adipocytes (Fig. 1B). As expected, we observed the same increase in FALDH gene expression in cells stimulated with EGF and insulin, suggesting that both factors are able to control FALDH expression via a PI3K-dependent pathway. To confirm PI3K activation, a phosphoserine PKB Western blot was performed (Fig. 1B, bottom). Both insulin and EGF increase the phosphorylation of PKB on serine 473, which is compatible with PI3K-dependent PKB activation. Finally, to confirm the role of PI3K in the control of FALDH expression, we performed an adenovirus infection experiment (Fig. 1C) in which isolated adipocytes were infected with Ad-GFP as negative control or with Ad-p110α CAAX, a constitutively active form of PI3K (31Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). As expected, FALDH expression was increased upon insulin stimulation of adipocytes expressing GFP (4.19-fold). When cells were infected with Ad-p110α CAAX, we observed an insulin-independent increase in FALDH mRNA expression (3.32-fold). Moreover, FALDH expression was not modified in adipocytes ectopically expressing p110α CAAX and treated with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. These results confirm th"

Such intermolecular interactions contribute not only to the passive buffering of sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+, but also to the active Ca2+ release process during excitation-contraction coupling. Here we tested the hypothesis that specific charged amino acids within the luminal portion of RyR mediate its direct interaction with triadin. Using in vitro binding assay and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that the second intraluminal loop of the skeletal muscle RyR1 (amino acids 4860-4917), but not the first intraluminal loop of RyR1 (amino acids 4581-4640) could bind triadin. Specifically, three negatively charged residues Asp4878, Asp4907, and Glu4908 appear to be critical for the association with triadin. Using deletional approaches, we showed that a KEKE motif of triadin (amino acids 200-232) is essential for the binding to RyR1. Because the second intraluminal loop of RyR has been previously shown to contain the ion-conducting pore as well as the selectivity filter of the Ca2+ release channel, and Asp4878, Asp4907, and Glu4908 residues are predicted to locate at the periphery of the pore assembly of the channel, our data suggest that a physical interaction between RyR1 and triadin could play an active role in the overall Ca2+ release process of excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells.

These include the ryanodine receptor (RyR), triadin, junctin, and calsequestrin, which may associate into a stable complex at the junctional membrane (5Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The RyR contains a large cytoplasmic foot region plus a transmembrane domain at the carboxyl-terminal end. The transmembrane domain of RyR has been shown to contain the conduction pore of the Ca2+ release channel (6Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). According to the hydropathy plot of Takeshima et al. (7Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K.

Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), four putative transmembrane segments (TM1 to TM4) are predicted to span the SR membrane, with residues connecting TM1 and TM2 forming the first intraluminal loop (aa 4581-4640) and residues connecting TM3 and TM4 contributing to the second intraluminal loop (aa 4860-4917). Elegant studies from other investigators have shown that the second intraluminal loop of RyR participates in the overall ion conduction and selectivity process of the Ca2+ release channel (8Lynch P.J.

Campbell K.P. Reithmeier R.A.F. Cheung W.Y. Calcium and Cell Function. Academic Press, New York1983: 151-173Google Scholar). In striated muscles, calsequestrins are largely tethered to the terminal cisternae of SR, leading to the suggestion that they could sequester Ca2+ to sites of Ca2+ release (12Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Triadin and junctin are structurally similar integral membrane proteins having a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a long stretch exposed to the luminal side of the SR (13Guo W.

The luminal region is especially enriched in multiple clusters of alternating lysine and glutamic acid residues, named as the KEKE motif (14Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J.

Previous studies show that triadin could directly modulate the activity of the RyR1 channel in a reconstitutional system (17Ohkura M. Furukawa K. Fujimori H. Kuruma A. Kawano S. Hiraoka M.

Calsequestrin has been proposed to indirectly regulate the RyR function presumably through its interaction with triadin and junctin (5Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J.

Recently, the binding regions of calsequestrin and the histidine-rich Ca2+-binding protein to triadin were identified in our group (20Shin D.W. Ma J. Kim D.H.

However, the nature of interaction between triadin and RyR, and the amino acids involved in such interaction have not been elucidated. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the highly conserved and charged residues within the intraluminal loop of RyR1 contain the binding sites for triadin. Using in vitro binding assay, we showed that the second intraluminal loop, but not the first intraluminal loop of RyR1 could interact with triadin. Furthermore, we identified specific amino acid residues within the second intraluminal loop that are critical for the binding to triadin. This identification of interaction sites between RyR1 and triadin will help to understand the contribution of the quaternary complex formation in the process of Ca2+ release. Isolation of Heavy SR Vesicles—Heavy SR vesicles were isolated from skeletal muscle of male New Zealand White rabbits according to the procedure described previously (22Kim D.H. Sreter F.A.

These heavy SR vesicles were solubilized at a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml in a buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 4 °C. Solubilized proteins were obtained by centrifugation (a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor) at 60,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR of Triadin from Skeletal Muscle—Total RNA was isolated from the rabbit skeletal muscle using the Invitek-Invisorb Spin Tissue RNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's manual. The cDNA encoding triadin was obtained through reverse transcriptase-PCR using the Qiagen-Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit. Oligo(dT) primer and random hexamer primer were purchased from Promega. The forward and reverse primers including EcoRI or XhoI site, respectively, were designed according to the published rabbit skeletal triadin gene sequence (23Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Moomaw C.R.

The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and subcloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of pGEX 4T-1, which contain the sequence for GST at the 5′ end (Amersham Biosciences). Reverse transcriptase-PCR products of triadin deletion mutants (Triadin-A to G) were also cloned behind the GST sequence in the pGEX 4T-1 plasmid. See Table I for details for the primer design. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations (D4877A, D4878A, D4907A, and E4908A) within intraluminal loop II of RyR1 were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotide primer sets for each mutant constructs are listed in Table I. The presence of all mutations was confirmed by direct sequencing (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). Fusion Proteins-Sepharose Affinity Binding Assay—GST fusion constructs were induced in Escherichia coli DH5α (A600 = 0.3) with 1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in STE buffer, incubated in 10% lysozyme (10 mg/ml) for 30 min, and then lysed by sonication on ice. The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The fusion proteins were immobilized by incubating 10 ml of the soluble E. coli fraction with a 250-μl bead volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature and washed 5 times with 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The solubilized heavy SR proteins obtained by centrifugation were diluted 1:10 with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protein inhibitor mixture, and incubated with GST fusion protein affinity beads for 4 h at 4 °C. After the incubation, the fusion protein-Sepharose complexes were washed 3 times with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins separated by 6 or 10% SDS-PAGE were electophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer (130 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris base, 0.037% SDS). The blots were rinsed briefly with TBS-T (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T and incubated in primary antibody containing 0.5% skim milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. The blots were washed with 3 changes of TBS-T for 15 min each. Secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) containing 0.5% skim milk in TBS-T was treated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The blots were washed 3-4 times with TBS-T for 10 min each, and detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against rabbit skeletal triadin and ryanodine receptor were purchased from Affinity BioReagents. Localization of the Triadin Binding Region in RyR1—To examine the potential intraluminal triadin binding sites in RyR1, the most outstanding two intraluminal loops, Loop I (4581-4640 residues) and Loop II (4860-4917 residues) (7Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) were generated by PCR using the DNA template of the carboxyl-terminal region of rabbit skeletal RyR. As shown in Fig. 1A, abundant amounts of GST fusion protein containing Loop I and Loop II of RyR1 could be expressed in E. coli. The GST-Loop I and GST-Loop II proteins exhibit differential interaction with the endogenous triadin in skeletal muscle. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-Loop II coupled to an affinity column can specifically pull-down triadin from the detergent-solubilized SR vesicle obtained from rabbit skeletal muscle (Fig. 1B, lane 5), whereas GST-Loop I was ineffective (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Loop II of RyR1 has two clusters of negatively charged residues that could potentially participate in the binding to triadin. To test the contribution of these negatively charged residues to the interaction with triadin, GST fusion proteins containing the proximal (aa 4860-4889, GST-P-Loop II) and the distal regions (aa 4890-4917, GST-D-Loop II) of Loop II of RyR1 were generated (Fig. 1C). Surprisingly, neither GST-P-Loop II nor GST-D-Loop II could pull-down triadin from the SR vesicle (see Fig. 1D). This result suggests that both parts of the negatively charged residues are required for the binding to triadin. To further identify the triadin-binding amino acid residues within the Loop II region, two additional approaches were used. First, serial deletions from either amino- or carboxyl-terminal ends were introduced in the Loop II sequence (Fig. 2A). These various fragments of Loop II peptides were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2B), and used for the in vitro binding assay. Immunoblot analysis showed that the intrinsic association with triadin disappeared when residue Asp4877-Asp4878 at the NH2 terminus and residues Asp4907-Glu4908 at the COOH terminus were deleted from the GST-Loop II fusion protein (Fig. 2C). Such results demonstrate that the specific negatively charged residues Asp4877-Asp4878 at the proximal Loop II, and Asp4907-Glu4908 at the distal Loop II are critical for binding to triadin. Second, to investigate which of these negatively charged residues (Asp4877, Asp4878, Asp4907, and Glu4908) constitute the putative binding site for triadin, site-specific mutagenesis was used to convert them into alanines (Fig. 3A). The GST-Loop II protein containing the specific mutations, D4877A, D4878A, D4907A, and E4908A, were expressed in E. coli (Fig. 3B), and assayed for their ability to specifically pull-down triadin from the skeletal muscle SR membrane. As shown in Fig. 3C, the specific triadin-Loop II interaction was maintained in the D4877A mutant (lanes 5 and 6). However, mutation of the other three residues, D4878A, D4907A, or E4908A, led to a remarkable loss of association with triadin (lanes 7-9). These results provide evidence that the three negatively charged residues Asp4878, Asp4907, and Glu4908 likely constitute the critical binding sites for interaction with triadin. Identification of the RyR1 Binding Region in Triadin—All triadin isoforms in a given species have identical amino acid sequences over the first 260 residues (23Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Moomaw C.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This common region contains a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a membrane-spanning region, and negatively charged luminal domains. The luminal domain (aa 68-264) of triadin in skeletal muscle is highly conserved among different species. Within the luminal domain of triadin, there exists a stretch of KEKE motifs that have been speculated to participate in the interaction with calsequestrin, junctin, or RyR (5Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 19Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To probe the domains within triadin that are involved in association with RyR1, several GST-triadin fusion constructs representing the different deletion mutants of triadin were generated (see Fig. 4A, Tri-A: aa 75-263; Tri-B: aa 75-160; Tri-C: aa 152-260; Tri-D: aa 152-199; Tri-E: aa 200-260; Tri-F: aa 200-232; Tri-G: aa 233-260), and expressed in E. coli. (Fig. 4B). The purified GST control and GST-triadin fusion protein affinity beads were incubated with the detergent-solubilized SR vesicle to probe their differential interactions with RyR1 (Fig. 4C). Western blot analysis showed that triadin-A, triadin-C, triadin-E, and triadin-F GST fusion proteins were able to pull-down the endogenous RyR1 (lanes 4, 6, 8, and 9), whereas triadin-B, triadin-D, and triadin-G did not appear to interact with RyR1 (lane 5, 7, and 10). Interestingly, the GST-triadin fusion proteins that exhibit positive interaction with RyR1 all share a common KEKE motif, especially with the triadin-F construct (as indicated by the star in Fig. 4A). Based on this, we speculate that the KEKE motif of triadin (aa 200-232) likely participates in the interaction with RyR1. It is now generally accepted that RyR forms a stable quaternary structure with calsequestrin, triadin, and junctin at the luminal surface of the junctional SR membrane (5Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Growing evidence supports that calsequestrin may actively participate in regulating the amounts of Ca2+ release through the RyR (12Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V.

The regulatory effect of calsequestrin has been suggested to involve calsequestrin-anchoring proteins such as triadin and junctin (5Zhang L. Kelley J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 19Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which are integral membrane proteins with a short amino-terminal segment located in the cytoplasm and a largely charged carboxyl-terminal segment in the luminal side of the SR (13Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28359-28365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The luminal domains of triadin and junctin mainly serve as scaffold structures that bring calsequestrin into the proximity of the RyR Ca2+ release channel. This anchoring mechanism presumably results in concentration of Ca2+ near the inner surface of the junctional SR membrane, and thus would facilitate the rapid Ca2+ release process in excitation-contraction coupling. On the other hand, triadin and several other accessory proteins of RyR (such as FKBP12) have been shown to have direct inhibitory effects on the Ca2+ release channel (17Ohkura M. Furukawa K.

Therefore understanding the nature of protein-protein interaction within the quaternary complex of RyR should provide important insights into the cellular mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in muscle cells. In the present study, we demonstrated a direct physical interaction between triadin and RyR1, consistent with previous studies of Guo and Campbell (19Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Using in vitro binding assay and mutagenesis analyses, we showed that the association between RyR1 and triadin: (a) involves the negatively charged residues located in the second intraluminal loop of RyR; and (b) requires the presence of the KEKE motif in triadin. Our data suggest that charge-charge interactions probably play a major role in determining the affinity of interaction between triadin and RyR1. Previous structure-function studies of RyR have shown that the second intraluminal loop of RyR plays a major role in the overall function of the Ca2+ release channel (8Lynch P.J. Tong J. Lehane M.

In RyR1, the removal of a negative charge by mutating Asp4878, Asp4907, or Glu4908 to alanine disrupted the interaction with triadin. It is intriguing that, among 15 acidic residues on the loop between transmembrane helix TM3 and TM4 (TM8 and TM10 according to the model of Zorzato et al., Ref. 31Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only three are found to be important for the binding to triadin. Tu et al. (32Tu Q. Velez P. Brodwick M. Fill M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2280-2285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that the RyR channel likely contains a negatively charged vestibule in the luminal side of the Ca2+ release channel, which serves to concentrate the permeating Ca2+ ions near the conduction pore of the channel. Recent studies with the recombinant RyRs have provided clues to the nature of the ion conduction pore as well as the vestibular structure of the Ca2+ release channel. According to the models of Williams et al. (33Williams A.J. West D.J. Sitsapesan R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 61-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Chen et al. (34Chen S.R. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the amino acid sequence extending from TM3, intraluminal loop II, to TM4 would form part of the backbone for the pore structure and the selectivity filter of the Ca2+ release channel (see Fig. 5). This arrangement is similar to the known crystal structure of the voltage-gated KcsA channel, with motifs corresponding to the outer helix, the pore helix, the signature sequence, and the inner helix of the KcsA channel (35Doyle D.A. Morais C.J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the predicted pore helix of RyR1 is longer than that of the KcsA structure by two helix turns, and this extra structure might constitute the putative binding pockets for RyR accessory proteins. Because Asp4878 is located at the amino-terminal end of the pore helix, the extended pore helix in RyR1 will bring the location of Asp4878 away from the ion conduction pathway. Also Asp4907 and Glu4908 are located right before the amino-terminal end of transmembrane helix TM4 that is apparently at the periphery of the pore assembly. Thus Asp4878, Asp4907, and Glu4908 are easily accessible by triadin, whereas the other acidic residues are not. Presumably, the interaction of triadin with RyR1 would alter the dielectric property near the pore region of the Ca2+ release channel, leading to the inhibition of the channel activity as observed in previous studies (17Ohkura M.

Another important consequence of the RyR1-triadin interaction is the anchoring of calsequestrin. Our previous study has shown that the aspartate-rich region of calsequestrin, also known as the Ca2+ binding motif, is directly involved in the association of calsequestrin with triadin. Our data presented here show that the KEKE motif of triadin (aa 200-232) consisting of a cluster of positively and negatively charged residues is critical for the interaction of triadin with RyR1. It is interesting to note that the KEKE motif has been suggested to promote association of various membrane proteins (36Perutz M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 37West Jr., R.W. Kruger B. Thomas S. Ma J. Milgrom E. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 243: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and previous results have shown that the KEKE motif of triadin could also be involved in the association with the aspartate-rich region of calsequestrin (16Kobayashi Y.M.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39533-39538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because of the competitive nature of the KEKE motif of triadin in the dual interaction with RyR1 and calsequestrin, and because of the close proximity of these interaction sites to the pore region of the Ca2+ release channel, a dynamic association and dissociation of triadin and calsequestrin from RyR1 would have significant impact on the overall Ca2+ release process in muscle cells. When muscle is at the resting state, the majority of calsequestrin will be occupied with luminal Ca2+ forming oligomer or polymer (38He Z. Dunker A.K. Wesson C.R. Trumble W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24635-24641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Maguire P.B. Briggs F.N. Lennon N.J. Ohlendieck K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 1998; 5: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Triadin is free to interact with RyR that could have an inhibitory role on the Ca2+ release channel activity (17Ohkura M.

In response to an excitation signal from the transverse-tubule membrane, opening of the RyR/Ca2+ release channels might cause a dissociation of triadin from RyR. Opening of RyR leads to efflux of Ca2+ from the SR and dissociation of Ca2+ ions from calsequestrin (20Shin D.W. Ma J. Kim D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), resulting in a temporal decrease of the local Ca2+ concentration in the junctional region. This transient decrease in local Ca2+ might cause association of calsequestrin with triadin, which could trigger more Ca2+ ions to be dissociated from calsequestrin. In principle, this cascade of interaction could serve as a positive feedback signal enabling rapid and efficient release of Ca2+ into the myoplasm in the event of excitation-contraction coupling."

Here we report that GRIP1 and β-catenin can bind strongly to each other through the AD2 domain of GRIP1. Furthermore, GRIP1 and β-catenin can synergistically enhance the activity of both AR and Lef1, and both coactivators are recruited specifically to AR-driven and Lef1-driven promoters. However, the mechanism of β-catenin-GRIP1 coactivator function and synergy is different with AR and Lef1. While β-catenin can bind directly to both AR and Lef1, GRIP1 can only bind directly to AR; the ability of GRIP1 to associate with and function as a coactivator for Lef1 is entirely dependent on the presence of β-catenin. Thus, whereas GRIP1 coactivator function involves direct binding to nuclear receptors and most other classes of DNA-binding transcriptional activator proteins, the coactivator function of GRIP1 with Lef1 follows a novel paradigm where GRIP1 is recruited indirectly to Lef1 through their mutual association with β-catenin.

Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the natural steroid hormones testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to AR causes the protein to translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus where it binds to the promoters of androgen target genes and recruits specific coactivators to activate transcription. Among the many coactivators that contribute to the transcriptional activation process (2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McKenna N.J.

The three members of the p160 family are SRC-1, GRIP1/TIF-2, and p/CIP/AIB1/ACTR/RAC3/TRAM1 (2Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McKenna N.J.

All have a highly conserved N terminus, three nuclear receptor interaction motifs (LXXLL, where L is leucine and X is any amino acid) in the middle of the polypeptide chain, and two activation domains (AD1 and AD2) near the C terminus. AD1 and AD2 transmit the activating signal to the transcription machinery by binding to secondary coactivators: AD1 binds the histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300, while AD2 recruits the arginine-specific histone methyltransferase CARM1 (5Stallcup M.R.

The multifunctional protein CBP/p300 serves as a coactivator for numerous transcriptional activators, including nuclear receptors such as hormone-activated AR (6Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X.

The AR signaling pathway is critical in the progression of prostate cancers, even in the androgen-independent stage in which androgen deprivation is no longer effective in blocking the transcription of AR target genes such as PSA (1Jenster G.

Androgen independence can be caused by amplification of the AR gene, the emergence of AR mutants with a broadened spectrum of ligand agonists, or overexpression of p160 coactivators (1Jenster G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 407-421PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ross R.K. Pike M.C. Coetzee G.A. Reichardt J.K. Yu M.C. Feigelson H. Stanczyk F.Z. Kolonel L.N. Henderson B.E.

In addition, altered regulation of other signaling pathways can contribute to androgen-independent proliferation of prostate cancer; for example, mutant β-catenin was found in one study in 5% of primary prostate cancers and thus may also contribute to unregulated cell growth in prostate cancer (16Chesire D.R. Ewing C.M. Sauvageot J. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Prostate. 2000; 45: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, in which it serves as a coactivator for LEF/TCF transcriptional activator proteins (17Barker N. Clevers H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but β-catenin also binds to and serves as a coactivator for AR (18Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P.

Clevers H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). β-Catenin protein levels are usually maintained at a low level through active degradation mediated by the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) complex that contains adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and axin. Upon the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, GSK kinase activity is inhibited as the GSK complex is dissociated; this allows β-catenin to bypass the destruction pathway. Increased accumulation allows some β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to LEF/TCF proteins and enhances transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes, including c-Myc, cyclin D1, and ITF-2. Similarly, nuclear β-catenin also interacts with hormone activated AR (18Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar) and retinoic acid receptor (23Easwaran V. Pishvaian M. Salimuddin Byers S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1415-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activates the transcription of their specific target genes. Binding of β-catenin to LEF/TCF causes displacement of corepressor complexes containing histone deacetylases (24Billin A.N. Thirlwell H. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and recruitment of CBP and p300, which act synergistically with β-catenin as coactivators (7Sun Y. Kolligs F.T. Hottiger M.O.

In addition, β-catenin can associate directly or indirectly with the TATA box-binding protein (27Bauer A. Chauvet S. Huber O. Usseglio F. Rothbacher U. Aragnol D. Kemler R. Pradel J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6121-6130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the chromatin-remodeling protein Brg-1 (28Barker N. Hurlstone A. Musisi H. Miles A. Bienz M. Clevers H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), suggesting that β-catenin may help to recruit these transcription components to the promoter. Recently, it was also shown that CARM1 interacts with β-catenin in vivo, and can function in synergy with β-catenin as a coactivator for AR and LEF/TCF (29Koh S.S. Li H. Lee Y.H. Widelitz R.B. Chuong C.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26031-26035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whether there are other downstream coactivators that mediate the coactivator activity of β-catenin, and whether there are specific coactivator requirements for different enhancer element-binding transcriptional activators are important questions that remain to be addressed. β-Catenin binds in an agonist-dependent manner to the AF-2 activation function within the hormone binding domain of AR; the AF-2 region of AR also contains another distinct binding site for GRIP1 (19Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). VP16-fused β-catenin was shown to modulate the ability of GRIP1 to enhance transcriptional activation by GAL4-DBD fused to the AR hormone binding domain (19Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether the intrinsic activation function of β-catenin cooperates with p160 coactivators in AR-mediated transcriptional activation. Here we demonstrate that the p160 coactivator GRIP1 binds strongly to β-catenin in vitro and in vivo, independent of AR, through the GRIP1 AD2 domain. We also show that the β-catenin-GRIP1 binding is important for their synergistic coactivator function with AR and Lef1. However, the manner in which these two coactivators are recruited to the AR and Lef1 transcription initiation complexes is different, since GRIP1 does not interact directly with Lef1. The β-catenin-GRIP1 interaction represents another potential point of cross-talk between the AR and Wnt signaling pathways. Cell Culture—CV-1 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), and LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI1640. Both media were supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum.

For expression of Lef1 and β-catenin in mammalian cells, the following mammalian expression vectors were used: pSG5.HA for expressing N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged proteins; pM (Clontech) for expressing N-terminal Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) fusion proteins. The PCR-amplified Lef1 coding region from pM18Lef1 was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into EcoRI and BglII sites of pSG5.HA and EcoRI and BamHI sites of pM; for bacterial expression, the EcoRI-NotI Lef1 cDNA fragment was inserted into homologous restriction sites of pGEX-5X1 (Amersham Biosciences). A PCR-amplified cDNA fragment encoding β-catenin was inserted as an EcoRI-BamHI fragment into homologous restriction sites of pSG5.HA and pM vectors; for bacterial expression, an EcoRI-XhoI β-catenin cDNA fragment was inserted into the homologous sites of pGEX-4T1. Transfection—For co-immunoprecipitation assay, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected in 100-mm dishes as described previously (34Li H. Park S. Kilburn B. Jelinek M.A. Henschen-Edman A. Aswad D.W.

For reporter co-immunoprecipitation assays, COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of each protein expression vector and 2 μg of reporter plasmids. After 48 h, a soluble chromatin fraction was prepared according to chromatin immunoprecipitation assay protocol (see below). For reporter gene assays, CV-1 cells were transiently transfected in 12-well dishes as previously described (35Kim J. Li H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1537-1549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Protein-Protein Interaction in Vitro—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays were performed as described previously (29Koh S.S. Li H. Lee Y.H. Widelitz R.B. Chuong C.M. Stallcup M.R. J.

Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot—Cell lysates were cleared with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. 1 μg rabbit anti-GRIP1 (Bethyl Laboratories) or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. 30 μl protein A/G beads were added and incubated for another 3 h. Beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with rabbit anti-β-catenin (Upstate Biotechnology) at 1 μg/20 ml blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk in TBST: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% Tween-20). The blot was stripped with stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and re-probed with anti-GRIP1 antibody at 1 μg/20 ml blocking buffer to check the efficiency of immunoprecipitation. 5% of cell extracts were also subjected to SDS-PAGE as input and probed with either rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) or anti-β-catenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1 μg/20 ml blocking buffer. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used at 1 μg/10 ml blocking buffer and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Reporter Co-immunoprecipitation (Reporter Co-IP)—ChIP assays were performed largely as described previously (11Ma H. Baumann C.T. Li H. Strahl B.D. Rice R.

LNCaP cells were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dextran charcoal-stripped serum in 150 mm dishes for 3 days. Cells were then treated with or without 100 nm DHT for 45 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 μg of anti-AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GRIP1, anti-Lef1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-β-catenin antibodies. PCR amplification was performed with DNA extracted from the immunoprecipitates, using 35–42 cycles and primers flanking the PSA promoter (–170/+19) (37Kang Z. Pirskanen A. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48366-48371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For all ChIP and reporter co-IP experiments, varying amounts of input and precipitated DNA samples were tested in PCR reactions to determine the linear range of the reaction, and the data shown are from PCR reactions performed with a DNA amount from the linear range. In the reporter co-IP assay, to test the recruitment of proteins to transiently transfected plasmids with AR or Lef1 response elements, COS-7 cells were transfected with reporter plasmids and expression vectors as indicated. The soluble chromatin fraction was prepared and immunoprecipitated. PCR was performed on the extracted DNA from the immunoprecipitates as described above: for AR, primers spanning the nucleosome B region of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter were used, 5′-ATTAGCCTTTATTTGCCCAACCTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGCACTCTTTTATATTATGGTTTAC-3′ (reverse); for Lef1, primers representing backbone elements of reporter plasmids pGL3OT and pGL3SV40 and spanning the promoter regions were used, 5′-CAAGTGCAGGTGCCAGAACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCAGGGCGTATCTCTTCAT-3′ (reverse). GRIP1 Binds β-Catenin, and Both Act Synergistically as Coactivators for AR—β-Catenin and GRIP1 bind to distinct sites in the AR AF-2 activation domain in a ligand-dependent manner (19Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, each protein can enhance transcriptional activation by AR (18Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether GRIP1 and β-catenin can act synergistically as coactivators for AR in transient transfection assays with a luciferase reporter plasmid controlled by the MMTV promoter. β-Catenin enhanced DHT-activated AR activity 2.5-fold, and GRIP1 increased activity 4.4-fold in CV-1 cells (Fig. 1). When these two coactivators were co-expressed, a synergistic 25-fold activation was observed. The synergy suggests that the functions of GRIP1 and β-catenin are not redundant, and thus that they have different downstream targets or contribute to transcriptional activation in different ways. Since GRIP1 and β-catenin were shown to bind to distinct sites in the AR AF-2 domain, it was previously assumed that the association between GRIP1 and β-catenin was through the androgen receptor (19Song L.N. Herrell R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, we tested whether GRIP1 and β-catenin might bind to each other even in the absence of AR. To test for binding in vitro GRIP1 was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and incubated with agarose beads containing bound GST or GST-βcatenin. GRIP1 bound strongly to GST-β-catenin (lane 3), but only background binding was observed with GST (lane 2). Since no AR or DHT was present, these results suggest a direct interaction between GRIP1 and β-catenin. β-Catenin also bound to the two other members of the p160 family, SRC-1 and ACTR, in similar GST pull-down assays (data not shown), indicating that binding to β-catenin is a conserved function of p160 coactivators. We next tested for binding in vivo by co-expressing GRIP1 and β-catenin proteins in COS-7 cells, monkey kidney cells with no endogenous AR. Both HA-tagged GRIP1 and HA-tagged β-catenin were expressed well in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2B, top panel), and anti-GRIP1 antibodies effectively precipitated HA-GRIP1 (bottom panel). In the absence of exogenously expressed HA-GRIP1, anti-GRIP1 antibody co-immunoprecipited a low level of β-catenin (middle panel, lane 2), which might be mediated by endogenous GRIP1. No β-catenin was detected in the immunoprecipitates when the β-catenin expression vector was omitted from the transfection (middle panel, lane 1). However, a strong co-immunoprecipitated β-catenin band was observed when both proteins were overexpressed (middle panel, lane 3), which indicates a β-catenin-GRIP1 complex that is independent of AR and DHT. Binding of endogenous GRIP1 and β-catenin was examined in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, which also express endogenous AR. While no GRIP1 or β-catenin was immunoprecipitated by normal rabbit IgG (Fig. 2C, lane 2), anti-GRIP1 antibody coimmunoprecipitated β-catenin with GRIP1 from LNCaP cells that were grown in charcoal-stripped serum without DHT (Fig. 2C, lane 3). When similar experiments were performed using lysates from LNCaP cells treated with DHT, no enhancement of the β-catenin-GRIP1 interaction was observed (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that there is a physiological, AR-independent interaction between GRIP1 and β-catenin. The AD2 Domain of GRIP1 Is Required For Its Interaction with β-Catenin and For Their Synergistic Activation of AR— Although GRIP1 and β-catenin can each bind directly to AR, we asked whether their synergistic effect on AR function requires the binding between GRIP1 and β-catenin. We first defined the region of GRIP1 that binds β-catenin, by testing the ability of in vitro-translated β-catenin to bind to each of three different GRIP1 fragments fused to GST. Concentrations of these GST fusion proteins were checked by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown), and similar amounts of each protein bound to beads were mixed with 35S-labeled β-catenin. While GST, GST-GRIP1-(5–765), and GST-GRIP1-(730–1121) did not bind to β-catenin (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4), a strong interaction between the C-terminal GRIP1 AD2 domain (amino acids 1122–1462) and β-catenin was observed (lane 5). To test whether the β-catenin-GRIP1AD2 interaction also occurs in vivo, a mammalian two-hybrid assay was used. Gal4DBD-β-catenin activated a transiently transfected reporter plasmid containing Gal4 response elements, confirming the transcriptional activation function of β-catenin (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 5). This activity was enhanced by co-expression of VP16 fused to either full-length GRIP1 or GRIP1-(1122–1462) (AD2) (lanes 6 and 7), but not by VP16 fused to GRIP1 AD1 (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between GRIP1 and β-catenin is specifically through the AD2 region in GRIP1. Based on these results, we then tested whether the GRIP1 AD2 region is important for synergistic coactivator function of GRIP1 and β-catenin in AR-mediated transcriptional activation. GRIP1 enhanced AR activity by 5-fold, β-catenin enhanced AR activity by 3-fold, and together they caused a synergistic 15-fold enhancement (Fig. 3C, lanes 3–6). GRIP1ΔAD2 (lacking AD2) alone enhanced AR activity 3-fold, but the effect of GRIP1ΔAD2 and β-catenin together was 7-fold, which is additive rather than synergistic (lanes 7 and 8). Thus, while GRIP1ΔAD2 was still able to bind AR (30Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and enhance AR function, its inability to function synergistically with β-catenin as a coactivator correlated with its inability to bind β-catenin. These data suggest that the binding of β-catenin to GRIP1 through the GRIP1 AD2 domain is required for the synergistic coactivator function between GRIP1 and β-catenin. β-Catenin Is Recruited by AR to Promoters of Transiently Transfected MMTV-LUC Reporter Gene and Endogenous PSA Gene in a Hormone-dependent Manner—To test whether the coactivator function of β-catenin involves recruitment of β-catenin to the promoter by AR, we employed a reporter co-immunoprecipitation (reporter co-IP) assay. AR and β-catenin were co-expressed in COS-7 cells in the presence of MMTV-LUC reporter gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were then performed with untreated or DHT-treated cells. Primers flanking the hormone response elements (AR binding sites) in the MMTV promoter were used in PCR reactions to detect this promoter in the chromatin and reporter gene fragments immunoprecipitated by antibodies against AR or β-catenin. Both AR (used as a positive control) and β-catenin were found to be associated with the transiently transfected MMTV promoter in a DHT-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In contrast, equal, low background levels of PC"

SNARE protein syntaxin 1A (Syn-1A) is known to mediate exocytic fusion, and more recently, to also bind and modulate membrane-repolarizing voltage-gated K+ channels. Here we show that Syn-1A acts as an endogenous regulator of KATP channels capable of closing these channels when cytosolic ATP concentrations were lowered. Botulinum neurotoxin C1 cleavage of endogenous Syn-1A in insulinoma HIT-T15 cells resulted in the increase in KATP currents, which could be subsequently inhibited by recombinant Syn-1A. Whereas Syn-1A binds both nucleotide-binding folds (NBF-1 and NBF-2) of SUR1, the functional inhibition of KATP channels in rat islet β-cells by Syn-1A seems to be mediated primarily by its interactions with NBF-1. These inhibitory actions of Syn-1A can be reversed by physiologic concentrations of ADP and by diazoxide. Syn-1A therefore acts to fine-tune the regulation of KATP channels during dynamic changes in cytosolic ATP and ADP concentrations. These actions of Syn-1A on KATP channels contribute to the role of Syn-1A in coordinating the sequence of ionic and exocytic events leading to secretion.

Insulin: Molecular Biology to Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1992Google Scholar). This leads to membrane depolarization, which opens voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (CaV), allowing Ca2+ to enter the cell and interact with Ca2+-sensitive proteins, which eventually leads the SNARE proteins to effect exocytosis (10Sudhof T.C.

Here, we have used the neuroendocrine β-cell models to examine whether SNARE proteins could regulate KATP channel closure, which would trigger the sequence of ionic events leading to exocytosis.

Since NBF-1 and NBF-2 are nucleotide-regulated domains, this Syn-1A binding would likely influence ATP and ADP regulation of this channel. Cell Culture and Transfection—HIT-T15 cells (P. Robertson, Seattle, WA), passages 75–85, grown in Petri dishes (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin) were transfected with plasmids (in pcDNA3, Clontech) containing cDNAs of full-length Syn-1A, or with the light chain of BoNT/C1 (H.

Thin-walled (1.5 mm) borosilicate glass tubes were pulled with a two-stage Narishige (Tokyo, Japan) micropipette puller and heat-polished. The typical tip resistance was 2–4 megaohms.

Briefly, the GST (control), GST-NBF-1 or GST-NBF-2, or GST-Syn-1A were bound to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with thrombin-cleaved Syn-1A, GST-NBF-1, or GST-NBF-2 (500 pmol) in 200 μl of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, (pH 7.4)), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol) or with solubilized rat brain synaptic membranes (25 μg of protein) in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation assay buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 2 h (or as indicated) with constant agitation. The beads were then washed twice with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm KOAC, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100).

The immunoprecipitated Syn-1A was incubated with GST (negative control), GST-NBF-1, or GST-NBF-2 (500 pmol) in 200 μl of IP buffer at 4 °C for 2 h, and then washed three times. The co-precipitated proteins were separated on 15% PAGE, and GST-NBF proteins were identified on the gel by Coomassie Blue staining. Confocal Microscopy—As described previously (18Kang H.Y.

Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), HIT-T15 cells were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips, transfected as described above, and then fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 0.5 h at room temperature followed by blocking with 5% normal goat serum (0.1% saponin, 0.5 h, room temperature) and then immunolabeled with primary antibodies (1:50, overnight, 4 °C) against Syn-1 (Sigma) or SNAP-25 (Sternberger Monoclonal, Lutherville, MD). After rinsing with 0.1% saponin/phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were incubated with the appropriate rhodamine-labeled secondary antiserum for 1 h, mounted on slides in a fading retarder (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in glycerol), and then examined by a laser scanning confocal imaging system (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

Holz H. Wheeler M.B. Tsushima R. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we first identified the KATP channels in the insulinoma HIT-T15 cells by using glybenclamide (Glyb), the sulfonylurea KATP channel inhibitor. Glyb (0.1 μm) greatly inhibited the HIT-T15 KATP currents (Fig. 1, A and B) recorded at low ATP (0.3 mm) concentration (n = 3). Dialysis of GST-Syn-1A (1 μm) into the HIT-T15 cells also greatly inhibited the KATP currents (Fig. 1, A and B; n = 10). As a control, we used HIT-T15 cells dialyzed with GST (1 μm), which had no effect on KATP currents when compared with the pipette solution (data not shown). Fig. 1C shows the time course of GST-Syn-1A inhibitory effect on the KATP currents under the low ATP (0.3 mm) concentration. Just after the formation of the whole-cell configuration (t = 0 min), the KATP currents remained low for ∼2 min (asterisk) for both control and GST-Syn-1A-treated cells. After 2 min, control currents increased steadily as the cell interior equilibrated with the low ATP pipette solution so that the KATP channels would open. At t = 10 min, the control KATP current amplitude exhibited a vigorous increase to 169.0 ± 15.9 pA (n = 5), whereas the current amplitude of the cells dialyzed with GST-Syn-1A showed only a small increase to 65.4 ± 9.7 pA (n = 5). Fig. 1D shows the summary bar graph in which the KATP currents were normalized to cell capacitance (pA/pF) to eliminate the variations in cell size. Glyb (0.1 μm) inhibited KATP current amplitude by ∼85% (n = 3), whereas GST-Syn-1A (1 μm) reduced KATP currents by ∼65% (n = 5) of the control current (61.9 ± 8.8 pA/pF; n = 5). To determine whether the effect of Syn-1A is at the plasma membrane or cytosolic level, we examined HIT-T15 cells overexpressing the full-length Syn-1A (aa 1–288) (20Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), which included the transmembrane domain, thereby specifically targeting Syn-1A to the plasma membrane (18Kang H.Y. Huang X.H. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Holz H. Wheeler M.B. Tsushima R. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This Syn-1A overexpression (>3-fold by Western blot) exhibited very similar inhibition of the KATP whole-cell currents (data not shown) as the dialysis of cytosolic Syn-1A (aa 1–266) shown in Fig. 1. These results indicate that the active Syn-1A domain that inhibits this KATP channel involves only the cytoplasmic domain (aa 1–266) and not the transmembrane domain (aa 267–288) of Syn-1A. We have postulated that the closed state of this KATP channel is attributed not only to cytosolic ATP levels but possibly also to the levels of endogenous Syn-1A. To examine whether Syn-1A acts as an endogenous inhibitor of the KATP channel, we expressed botulinum neurotoxin C1 (BoNT/C1) in HIT-T15 cells, which would specifically cleave the endogenous Syn-1A (21Schiavo G.

Since HIT-T15 cells very reliably pick up multiple plasmids (>90%), we co-expressed GFP to identify the BoNT/C1-expressing cells (18Kang H.Y. Huang X.H. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Holz H. Wheeler M.B. Tsushima R. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy showed that the membrane Syn-1A signal in the BoNT/C1-expressing cells (GFP-containing, indicated by arrows) was greatly reduced (Fig. 1E, lower panels) when compared with the endogenous Syn-1A levels of the adjacent cells that did not express BoNT/C1. As the BoNT/C1-expressing cells did not show an increase in the cytoslic Syn-1A signal, this suggests that the cleaved Syn-1A fragments likely undergo cytosolic proteolysis since the Syn-1A monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was generated against the full-length protein and would have recognized either the membrane-bound or the cytosolic fragments of Syn-1A. Since BoNT/C1 could also cleave SNAP-25 in some cell types (22Foran P. Lawrence G.W. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we also labeled these cells with anti-SNAP-25 antibody (Fig. 1E, upper panels) but saw no difference in the membrane SNAP-25 signals between the BoNT/C1-expressing cells (GFP-containing, indicated by arrows) and the cells that did not express GFP. This result indicates specific proteolysis of endogenous Syn-1A by BoNT/C1. Next, we examined the whole-cell KATP currents of these BoNT/C1-expressing cells (Fig. 1, A and B), which was ∼155% (n = 5) of the control cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that the KATP currents were indeed being inhibited by the endogenous Syn-1A. Dialysis of GST-Syn-1A (1 μm) into these BoNT/C1-expressing cells (Fig. 1A, BoNT/C1+Syn-1A) reduced the KATP current by ∼70% (n = 8) as compared with the BoNT/C1-expressing cells, a reduction similar to the one observed with GST-Syn-1A in the control cells. The cytosolic ATP concentration in these cells was lowered to 0.3 mm ATP to reduce ATP blockade of the KATP channel. The observed Syn-1A inhibition of the KATP channels may be due to an increase in the sensitivity to ATP-mediated inhibition, or it may be independent of ATP inhibition. More studies would be required to distinguish these possibilities. Syntaxin 1A Binds SUR1 at its NBF-1 and NBF-2—Syn-1A actions on these KATP channels could be mediated by binding to the SUR1 or Kir6.2 subunits. GST-Syn-1A bound to agarose beads pulled down SUR1 from solubilized rat brain synaptic membranes, which was identified with a specific antibody generated against the SUR1 C terminus (19Hernandez-Sanchez C. Ito Y. Ferrer J. Reitman M. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18261-18279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The major cytoplasmic domains of SUR1 are NBF-1 (aa 696–893) and C-terminal NBF-2 (aa 1358–1544) (3Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that GST-NBF-1 and GST-NBF-2 bound to agarose beads pulled down native Syn-1A from rat brain synaptic membranes. To negate the possibility of a coprecipitation of unknown ternary proteins present in the brain, we demonstrated that GST-NBF-1 and GST-NBF-2 pulled down recombinant Syn-1A but not control GST or recombinant SNAP-25 (data not shown). Fig. 2C shows the reciprocal study of immunoprecipitation of Syn-1A (GST cleaved off by thrombin), which pulled down GST-NBF-1 (lane 3) and GST-NBF-2 (lane 5) and not GST (lane 1). The coprecipitated NBFs were identified by Coomassie Blue staining as the only proteins eluting at the same sizes as the control proteins (lanes 4 and 6). Fig. 2D examines the time course of binding (4 °C), showing similar rapid binding kinetics of both NBFs to Syn-1A, in which Syn-1A binding was detectable at 2 min (first time point, ∼20% of maximal binding), reaching maximal binding at 1–2 h. Half time (t½) was ∼15.2 and ∼9.3 min for NBF-1 and NBF-2, respectively. Fig. 2E examines (i) the concentration dependence of GST-NBF-1 and (ii) GST-NBF-2 binding to Syn-1A (500 pmol, 4 °C, 2 h) at saturating concentrations. NBF-1 and NBF-2 binds Syn-1A at an ∼1:1 ratio, with IC50 of 141.9 ± 12.5 and 93.4 ± 6.6 pmol, respectively. Syn-1A could inhibit the KATP channels by acting directly on the cytoplasmic N or C termini of the Kir6.2 subunit on which the ATP acts (8Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Aschroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 9Vanoye C.G. MacGregor G.G. Dong K. Tan L. Buschmann A.S. Hall A.E. Lu M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23260-23270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This is not the case since neither recombinant cytoplasmic N- (aa 1–70) nor C-terminal (aa 263–390) domains of Kir6.2 bound to agarose beads pulled down recombinant Syn-1A (data not shown). Furthermore, dialysis of these Kir6.2 domain proteins into rat islet β-cells did not influence GST-Syn-1A effects on KATP activity (data not shown). Since SNAP-25 partners with Syn-1A to bind and regulate Ca2+ channels (23Wiser O. Bennet M.K. Atlas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4100-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), SNAP-25 might also directly modulate KATP channels. However, GST-SNAP-25 (1 μm) dialyzed into HIT-T15 cells (and rat islet β-cells) had no effect on KATP activity (data not shown), and neither GST-NBF-1 nor GST-NBF-2 pulled down recombinant SNAP-25 (data not shown). Syntaxin-1A Inhibition of the KATP Channel Is Mediated by Its Binding to NBF-1—The binding of Syn-1A to NBF-1 and NBF-2 of SUR1 suggests that Syn-1A inhibition of the HIT-T15 KATP channels may be mediated by its interactions with either one of the NBFs. Therefore, we examined the functional interactions of Syn-1A with each NBF using rat islet β-cells, which would be a better physiologic model. The rat islet β-cell KATP channels (Fig. 3, A–C) behaved very similarly as the HIT-T15 cell KATP channels (Fig. 1, A–D). Specifically, under low ATP (0.3 mm ATP) concentrations, the external application of Glyb (0.1 μm) and dialysis of GST-Syn-1A (1 μm) into islet β-cell inhibited the KATP currents (Fig. 3A). The time course of GST-Syn-1A inhibition of rat islet β-cell KATP channels (Fig. 3B) was in fact very similar in pattern to those observed in the HIT cell study (Fig. 1C). When normalized to cell capacitance (pA/pF; Fig. 3C), Glyb (0.1 μm) and GST-Syn-1A (1 μm) inhibited rat islet β-cell KATP control currents (65.4 ± 9.7 pA/pF; n = 12) by 85% (9.7 ± 1.7 pA/pF, n = 3) and 61% (25.6 ± 5.7 pA/pF, n = 10), respectively. These values are remarkably similar to the HIT cell studies (Fig. 1). Next we examined the effects of GST-NBF-1 and GST-NBF-2 on the inhibitory actions of Syn-1A (Fig. 3, A and C). GST-NBFs would be expected to bind the endogenous Syn-1A, which would either prevent the formation of or disrupt the complex already formed by endogenous Syn-1A with the β-cell SUR1, both of which would increase KATP currents. Since GST-NBF-1 (1 μm) and GST-NBF-2 (1 μm) alone only slightly but not significantly increased β-cell KATP currents to 77.8 ± 14.6 pA/pF (n = 6) and 72.6 ± 16.3 pA/pF (n = 8), respectively, this supports the latter possibility, that the pre-existing endogenous Syn-1A may have formed stable complexes with the NBFs of many of the endogenous SUR1 proteins, and these complexes may be resistant to disruption by the exogenous GST-NBFs. BoNT/C1 (Fig. 1) would disrupt such complexes upon cleavage of the endogenous Syn-1A. The exogenous NBFs could still pull down Syn-1A from the rat brain (as in Fig. 2A) since Syn-1A is more abundant and generally distributed in the brain than SUR1, and hence, an excess of brain Syn-1A would be available to bind the exogenous NBF proteins. More importantly, when dialyzed together with GST-Syn-1A (1 μm), GST-NBF-1 (NBF-1+Syn-1A) completely blocked the in"

Structural studies with recombinantly expressed PrP revealed a large flexibly disordered N-terminal region and a structured C-terminal domain. This autonomously folding domain contains three α-helical regions and a short, two-stranded β-sheet (1Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E.

Two signal sequences, located at the N- and the C terminus, respectively, direct the import of PrP into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mediate the attachment of a GPI anchor at Ser230 (4Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal domain of PrPC is modified with two N-linked complex carbohydrate moieties (Asn180 and Asn196) (5Stimson E. Hope J. Chong A. Burlingame A.L.

Similarly, modifying folding of PrPC by destabilizing or deleting helix 1 interferes with the GPI anchor attachment and the conversion of core glycans into complex structures (9Winklhofer K.F.

In the same study we found that several PrP mutants adopted a misfolded conformation in the ER, yet were transported through the secretory pathway and secreted. Of note, the N-terminal domain is dispensable for the maturation of PrPC; PrPΔN is complex glycosylated and localized at the plasma membrane via the GPI anchor.Prion diseases in humans and animals are characterized by the appearance of abnormal isoforms of PrPC. A diagnostic marker is the accumulation of PrPSc, a detergent-insoluble and partially proteinase K-resistant PrP isoform, which is the major component of infectious prions (13Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R.

Two other PrP species have been described to induce neurodegeneration in transgenic mice in the absence of PrPSc: an unusual transmembrane topology designated CtmPrP as well as PrP aggregates in the cytosol (17Hegde R.S.

Science. 2002; 298: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Increased synthesis of CtmPrP is also linked to an inherited prion disease in humans (19Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A. Scott M.R. DeFea K.A. Tremblay P. Torchia M. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Science. 1998; 279: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). A possible pathogenic role of misfolded PrP conformers at or in the ER membrane was emphasized by a recent study using a yeast model. We could show that PrP misfolding occurred during post-translational targeting to the ER membrane. As a consequence, PrP bearing an uncleaved N-terminal signal peptide associated with ER membranes and interfered with cell growth (20Heller U. Winklhofer K.F. Heske H. Reintjes A. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36139-36147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Targeting of secretory proteins to the ER is mediated by a N-terminal signal peptide. In yeast, targeting may occur co- or post-translationally, dependent on the hydrophobicity of the signal peptide (21Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) (reviewed in 22–26). Co-translational import, the main pathway in mammalian cells, involves binding of the signal recognition particle (SRP) to the emerging N-terminal signal peptide, pausing of elongation and targeting of the ribosome-polypeptide complex to the Sec61 translocon. In addition to its targeting role the signal sequence can modulate the translocation process and influence the topology of the polypeptide chain (27Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Kim S.J. Rahbar R. Hegde R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26132-26140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).PrPC has the unusual potential to adopt three distinct topological forms during import into the ER. The GPI-anchored version SecPrP, which is fully translocated, predominates under physiological conditions. In addition to the pathogenic CtmPrP (C terminus facing the ER lumen), a second transmembrane topology, designated NtmPrP (N terminus facing the ER lumen), can be formed. The relative ratio between these three topological isoforms is under the control of the N-terminal signal peptide and an internal putative transmembrane (TM) domain (19Hegde R.S. Mastrianni J.A.

Interestingly, increased synthesis of CtmPrP has also been described in scrapie-infected mice (17Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).In this study we have analyzed the ER import of PrP in vivo and identified a new regulatory element within the C-terminal domain of PrP. Complete or partial deletions of this domain abolished or reduced import of PrP into the ER and gave rise to a N-terminally unprocessed PrP species, which was degraded by the proteasome. As a consequence, ER import of two pathogenic PrP mutants linked to inherited prion diseases in humans, W145Stop and Q160Stop, was compromised; only a fraction was fully translocated into the ER, the other fraction containing an uncleaved signal peptide was present in the cytosol.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of PrP Mutants—For expression of wild-type PrP pcDNA3.1–3F4 was generated by cloning the open reading frame of the mouse PRNP gene into the pcDNA3.1 vector; Leu108 and Val111 were replaced by Met to allow detection by the 3F4 monoclonal antibody (29Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Nunziante M. Lucassen R. Spielhaupter C. Muranyi W. Groschup M.H. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schätzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1–3F4 was used as a template to introduce the following deletions by PCR cloning techniques: S230Stop, aa 230–254; Q159Stop, aa 159–254; W144Stop, aa 144–254; A115Stop, aa 115–254; P101Stop, aa 101–254. For the generation of the corresponding cytosolic PrP mutants the ER signal sequence (aa 2–22) was deleted. ΔN/S230Stop was constructed by deleting the N-terminal domain (aa 27–89) of S230Stop and Δ27–156/S230Stop by deleting aa 27–156 of S230Stop. For the generation of A115 containing the growth hormone signal sequence, the signal sequence of PrP (aa 2–22) was replaced by the rat growth hormone signal sequence (MAADSQTPWLLTFSLLCLLWPQEAGA). N115-GFP was constructed by fusing the coding sequence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C terminus of A115Stop. All amino acid numbers refer to the mouse PrP sequence (GenBank™ accession number M18070).Antibodies and Reagents—PrP was detected by the monoclonal anti-PrP antibody 3F4 (30Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J.

The mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4 was purchased from Signet Pathology Systems, the rat monoclonal antibody against grp94 (clone 9G10) was purchased from StressGen. Renografin 76 was prepared by adjusting TE (pH 7.6) to 66% meglumine diatrizoate (Sigma) and 10% sodium diatrizoate (Sigma).Cell Culture and Transfections—N2a cells were cultivated as described earlier (32Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by a liposome-mediated method using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer′s instructions (Invitrogen).Detergent Solubility Assay and Secretion Analysis—As previously described (9Winklhofer K.F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), N2a cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped off the plate, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed in cold buffer A (0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C; after boiling in Laemmli sample buffer supernatants and pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting. To examine the secretion of PrP into the cell culture supernatant, cells were cultivated in cell culture medium without supplements for 3 h at 37 °C. The medium was collected, and PrP was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then analyzed by Western blotting.Western Blot Analysis—Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed as previously described (33Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation and Proteasomal Inhibitor Treatment—For metabolic labeling cells were starved for 30 min in methionine-free modified Eagle's medium (MEM, Invitrogen) and subsequently labeled for 30 min with 0.3 μCi of Promix L-[35S]cell labeling mix (Amersham Biosciences; > 37 TBq/mmol) in methionine-free MEM. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as previously described (32Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When indicated, the proteasomal inhibitor MG 132 (Calbiochem) was present during the starving and the labeling periods (50 μm, dissolved in Me2SO). For the chase, the labeling medium was removed, the cells were washed twice and then incubated in complete medium for the time indicated. To detect secreted proteins, the labeling medium was collected and further analyzed by immunoprecipitation. For endoH digestion immunoprecipitation products were adjusted to 0.5% SDS, boiled for 10 min, and digested with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C as specified by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were impregnated with Amplify (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film. For quantification, signals were detected by autoradiography and quantified using a phosphorimager (FLA-2000, Fuji; software AIDA, Raytest). The amount of each protein in the presence of MG 132 was set as 100%. The amount of protein in the absence of MG132 was calculated as a percentage of the initial value and subtracted from 100% to give the value for proteasomal degradation. For the ER constructs the two forms (signal sequence cleaved and uncleaved) were analyzed separately. All quantifications were based on at least three independent experiments.In Vitro Translation and Proteinase K Digestion—The in vitro translation was carried out by using the TnT T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) by following the manufacturer's instructions. When indicated, Canine Pancreatic Microsomal Membranes (Promega) were added. After translation for 70 min at 30 °C the samples were split; one half was left untreated and the other half was incubated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h on ice. To stop the reaction, 2 mmol of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Serva) was added. After immunoprecipitation of PrP using the monoclonal antibody 3F4, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed as described in the previous section.Membrane Fractionation and Proteinase K Digestion of Cell Lysates—The cellular localization of the PrP mutants was analyzed by Renografin density gradient centrifugation (20Heller U.

Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the plate, and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in TE and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. A postnuclear supernatant (cell lysate) was prepared by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was mixed with 76% Renografin (0.5 ml each) and successively overlaid with 1 ml of 34, 30, 26, and 22% Renografin, respectively. Gradients were then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C. 13 fractions were removed from the top of the gradient. Membrane fractions were diluted 10-fold with TE, pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. For the proteolysis experiment, cells were lysed as described above, mixed with 76% Renografin (final concentration 22%) and incubated with proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) (1:250) for 1 h on ice. The reaction was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Serva) and boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Residual PrP was detected by Western blotting.RESULTSC-terminal Truncations Interfere with N-terminal Processing of PrP—In a previous study we analyzed the biogenesis of several PrP mutants with deletions in the N-terminal domain including the putative transmembrane (TM) domain and helix 1. It turned out that all these mutants were efficiently imported into the ER, even though maturation of PrPC was impaired by deletion or destabilization of helix 1 (9Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To analyze the impact of the highly ordered helix 2-loop-helix 3 motif on the biogenesis of PrPC we constructed several successively larger C-terminal deletion mutants. Two versions were generated for each construct, one version with the authentic N-terminal signal sequence to direct PrP into the ER (ER form) and another version for cytosolic expression of PrP by deleting the ER signal sequence (cyto form) (Fig. 1A). For the inclusion of the two pathogenic human PrP mutants W145Stop and Q160Stop in our analysis, we cloned the mouse equivalents W144Stop and Q159Stop. As a control, we decided to use S230Stop, a mutant lacking the C-terminal GPI signal sequence (previously designated PrPΔGPI) instead of full-length PrP for the following reasons. All of our C-terminal truncation mutants are devoid of the two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation as well as the GPI anchor attachment signal. Similarly, S230Stop lacks the GPI anchor and is mainly unglycosylated, however, it is efficiently imported into the ER and secreted (9Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W.

Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Therefore, by using S230Stop as a control instead of complex glycosylated and GPI-anchored wild-type (wt) PrP we can exclude possible effects of the post-translational modifications.For the initial biochemical analysis these PrP mutants were transiently expressed in N2a cells and screened by Western blotting using the monoclonal anti-PrP antibody 3F4. Of note, 3F4 does not recognize endogenous mouse PrPC (30Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Corroborating earlier results (9Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), endoH and PNGaseF digestion revealed that S230Stop was mainly unglycosylated (data not shown); however, the N-terminal signal sequence of S230Stop was cleaved, as indicated by the size of the ER form in comparison to that of the respective cytosolic form on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B, S230Stop). For both Q159Stop and W144Stop we observed two distinct bands of the ER forms, with the faster migrating species showing the same relative size as the cytosolic form (Fig. 1B, Q159Stop, W144Stop). These findings indicate that only a fraction of Q159Stop and W144Stop was N-terminally processed. The shorter PrP mutants A115Stop and P101Stop were not detectable by Western blotting. The analysis of the cell culture supernatant of PrP-expressing cells revealed that the ER forms of S230Stop, Q159Stop, and W144Stop were secreted (Fig. 1B).PrP Species with an Uncleaved N-terminal Signal Peptide Are Rapidly Degraded by the Proteasome—For a more detailed analysis transfected N2a cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and then PrP was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. To address a possible role of proteasomal degradation, this analysis was also performed in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (36Tsubuki S. Kawasaki H. Saito Y. Miyashita N. Inomata M. Kawashima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several findings emerged from this approach. Firstly, it became evident that the ER form and the cyto form of A115Stop were synthesized, however, they were rapidly degraded by the proteasome (Fig. 2, A, B, C, A115Stop). Secondly, the ER form of A115Stop appeared larger by SDS-PAGE compared with the cyto form, indicating that the N-terminal ER targeting signal peptide of A115Stop has not been processed. Thirdly, for both Q159Stop and W144Stop the proteasomal inhibitor specifically increased the relative amount of the N-terminally unprocessed ER form (Fig. 2, A, B, Q159Stop, and W144Stop). Stabilization by MG132 was also observed for all the cyto forms of the PrP mutants. It appeared that the size of the C-terminal truncations inversely correlates with the stability of cytosolic PrP; S230Stop was the most stable and A115Stop the least stable mutant (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2N-terminally unprocessed PrP is rapidly degraded by the proteasome.A, transiently transfected N2a cells were labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine in the presence (MG132 +) or absence (MG132 –) of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (50 μm) and PrP was then analyzed by immunoprecipitation. White arrowheads, N-terminally processed forms; black arrowheads, N-terminally unprocessed forms; CHO, glycosylated S230Stop. B and C, quantitative analysis of the experiments shown under A. To quantify the degradation of PrP by the proteasome the relative amount of PrP present in MG132-treated cells was set as 100%. For the ER constructs the two species (signal sequence cleaved and uncleaved) were analyzed separately. The quantification of the species indicated by white and black arrowheads in panel A is representated by white (signal sequence cleaved) and black (signal sequence uncleaved) bars in panel B. Degradation was calculated from three independent experiments. Please note that the entire fraction of S230Stop is N-terminally processed, while A115Stop is only present with an uncleaved signal peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In conjunction with the Western blot analysis these data indicate that an intact C-terminal globular domain is necessary and sufficient to allow efficient ER import of PrP to occur. In contrast to N-terminally processed PrP, PrP species with an uncleaved signal peptide are subjected to proteasomal degradation, similarly to PrP expressed in the cytosol.N-terminally Unprocessed PrP Is Not Imported into the ER— Our experiments revealed that the A115Stop mutant as well as a fraction of the Q159Stop and the W144Stop mutant contained an uncleaved ER signal peptide, raising the possibility that these PrP mutants were not imported into the ER.To address this question in more detail, we first performed in vitro import experiments in rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with dog pancreas microsomes. In the presence of microsomes the ER forms of S230Stop, Q159Stop, and W144Stop were N-terminally processed, partially glycosylated (only S230Stop) and protected against proteolytic digestion, revealing import into the microsomes (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no import was seen for the ER form of the A115Stop mutant. Moreover, the N-terminally unprocessed forms of Q159Stop and W144Stop were not protected against proteolytic digestion, i.e. were not present in the lumen of the microsomes.Fig. 3N-terminally unprocessed PrP is not imported into the ER.A, the indicated constructs (ER form) were translated in vitro using the TnT Quick System. Microsomal membranes (+ microsomes) were included to analyze cotranslational import. Imported proteins were identified by a protease protection assay; the samples were incubated in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h on ice (PK +). As a control, proteins were translated in the absence of microsomal membranes (– microsomes). Radioactively labeled proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE. CHO, glycosylated form of S230Stop and Δ27–156/S230Stop. B, N2 cells were transiently transfected with the PrP constructs indicated on the left. Subcellular localization of the proteins was analyzed by a Renografin density gradient centrifugation of cell extracts. Fractions were removed from the top of the gradient and analyzed by Western blotting using the antibodies indicated on the right side of the figure. C, protease protection assay of membrane vesicles prepared from transfected N2a cells. Cell lysates were mixed with 76% Renographin (final concentration 22%) and incubated with proteinase K (1:250) for 1 h on ice. Residual PrP was detected by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we performed a Renografin density gradient centrifugation with cell extracts prepared from transiently transfected N2a cells in order to analyze the cellular localization of different PrP mutants. As expected, the secretory form of S230Stop colocalized with the chaperone Grp94, a marker for the ER fractions, while the cytosolic form remained in the bottom fractions (Fig. 3B). The secretory form of W144Stop was present in the ER fraction as well, however, only the N-terminally processed fraction. Unprocessed W144Stop remained in the bottom fractions, colocalizing with the cytosolically expressed W144Stop. Due to its instability, A115Stop could not be analyzed by this method.The C-terminal Globular Domain Is Sufficient for Import into ER—Based on these experiments two different mechanisms could explain the defective import of PrP mutants with C-terminal truncations. Either the decreasing length of the polypeptide chain impairs the ER import, or information present in the C-terminal globular domain is required for efficient import.To address a possible role of the polypeptide chain length, we generated two N-terminal deletion mutants, ΔN/S230Stop, which lacks the unstructured N-terminal domain, and Δ27–156/S230Stop with a larger N-terminal deletion including the putative TM domain and helix 1 (Fig. 4A). Transiently transfected N2a cells were metabolically labeled and PrP was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. ΔN/S230Stop was efficiently transported in the ER and secreted, similarly to S230Stop (Fig. 4B). The mainly unglycosylated phenotype of ΔN/S230Stop adds to the notion that helix 1 interferes with the core glycosylation of PrP devoid of a membrane anchor (9Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi I. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14961-14970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Δ27–156/S230Stop was glycosylated (Fig. 4C), indicating efficient ER import, and was not subjected to proteasomal degradation (data not shown). We have previously shown that deletion or destabilization of helix 1 restores core glycosylation of S230Stop (9Winklhofer K.F. Heske J. Heller U. Reintjes A. Muranji W. Moarefi"
https://openalex.org/W2032009590,"The heme biosynthetic pathway of the malaria parasite is a drug target and the import of host δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD), the second enzyme of the pathway, from the red cell cytoplasm by the intra erythrocytic malaria parasite has been demonstrated earlier in this laboratory. In this study, ALAD encoded by the Plasmodium falciparum genome (PfALAD) has been cloned, the protein overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and then characterized. The mature recombinant enzyme (rPfALAD) is enzymatically active and behaves as an octamer with a subunit Mr of 46,000. The enzyme has an alkaline pH optimum of 8.0 to 9.0. rPfALAD does not require any metal ion for activity, although it is stimulated by 20-30% upon addition of Mg2+. The enzyme is inhibited by Zn2+ and succinylacetone. The presence of PfALAD in P. falciparum can be demonstrated by Western blot analysis and immunoelectron microscopy. The enzyme has been localized to the apicoplast of the malaria parasite. Homology modeling studies reveal that PfALAD is very similar to the enzyme species from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but manifests features that are unique and different from plant ALADs as well as from those of the bacterium. It is concluded that PfALAD, while resembling plant ALADs in terms of its alkaline pH optimum and apicoplast localization, differs in its Mg2+ independence for catalytic activity or octamer stabilization. Expression levels of PfALAD in P. falciparum, based on Western blot analysis, immunoelectron microscopy, and EDTA-resistant enzyme activity assay reveals that it may account for about 10% of the total ALAD activity in the parasite, the rest being accounted for by the host enzyme imported by the parasite. It is proposed that the role of PfALAD may be confined to heme synthesis in the apicoplast that may not account for the total de novo heme biosynthesis in the parasite.

It is proposed that the role of PfALAD may be confined to heme synthesis in the apicoplast that may not account for the total de novo heme biosynthesis in the parasite. Studies in this laboratory had demonstrated that the malaria parasites (Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei) are capable of heme biosynthesis de novo, despite acquiring large amounts of heme from the host red cell hemoglobin in the intraerythrocytic stage (1Surolia N.

Inhibition of the de novo heme biosynthetic pathway leads to death of the parasite and the pathway is therefore a drug target (1Surolia N. Padmanaban G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Studies on the enzymes of the heme-biosynthetic pathway have revealed that the first enzyme, δ-aminolevulinate synthase, is coded for by the parasite genome and is localized in the parasite mitochondrion (4Wilson C.M.

Padmanaban G. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At the same time genome sequence data available for P. falciparum indicates that the parasite genome codes for ALAD (PfALAD) and other enzymes of the heme-biosynthetic pathway. Sato et al. (6Sato S. Tews I. Wilson R.J. Intl. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown by phylogenetic amino acid sequence analysis derived from truncated cDNA, including the metal-cofactor binding region and the active site, that PfALAD is more closely related to the Mg2+-binding enzyme species from plant and algal plastids than the Zn2+-binding species from animals and fungi. Subsequently, Sato and Wilson (7Sato S. Wilson R.J. Curr. Genet. 2002; 40: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have shown that the full-length PfALAD cDNA can complement a hemB mutant (ALAD-/-) of Escherichia coli, indicating that the cDNA codes for a functional enzyme. These workers have also predicted the following. 1) PfALAD probably requires Mg2+ as a cofactor, although the metal ion may not serve as an allosteric activator. 2) It is possible that the intrinsic PfALAD is responsible for de novo heme synthesis in the parasite rather than the imported host enzyme. It is therefore of interest to study the PfALAD in detail experimentally. In the present study, parasite gene-coded PfALAD-cDNA has been cloned and expressed in E. coli. The properties of the purified recombinant enzyme have been studied in detail, especially its metal ion requirement for activity. The enzyme has been modeled to explain some of its unique properties. It has been possible to raise antibodies that specifically interact with PfALAD and with these antibodies the localization of the enzyme in P. falciparum in culture has been studied by Western blot analysis and immunoelectron microscopy. Finally, based on studies on catalytic activity, inhibitor sensitivity, and localization of PfALAD, an assessment of the contribution of PfALAD to the total ALAD activity of the parasite in relation to the contribution of the imported host enzyme has been made. Materials—Full-length mouse erythroid ALAD-cDNA clone was a kind gift from Dr. Terry Bishop, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen (ALP conjugates) or Pelco International (gold conjugates). All other chemicals were obtained from either Sigma or Invitrogen. Parasite Maintenance and Isolation—P. falciparum culture was maintained on human O+ red blood cells by the candle jar method (8Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). The cells were pelleted down and the parasites, essentially at the trophozoite stage, were isolated by treatment with 0.15% (w/v) saponin (9Fitch C.D. Chevli R. Banyal H. Phillips G. Pfaller M.A. Krogstad D.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 819-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or osmotic lysis (10Sirawaraporn W. Panyim S. Wilairat P. Yuthavong Y. Genetic Engineering Techniques in Tropical Diseases Research. Mahidol University, Bangakok1985: 407-412Google Scholar) with slight modifications. For the latter procedure, packed infected erythrocytes were treated with 40 volumes of cold 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, mixed thoroughly and allowed to stand on ice for 10 min. The released parasites following lysis of the red cells were pelleted down and washed once again with the same buffer. The parasite pellet was subsequently washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. With both procedures, the final washes were tested for possible hemoglobin or erythroid ALAD presence and were found to be undetectable. Cloning of PfALAD cDNA—The full-length cDNA (cDNA-1) sequence of PfALAD was obtained from the genome data base and the sequence provided by Sato and Wilson (7Sato S. Wilson R.J. Curr. Genet. 2002; 40: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification was carried out using the primer pair, PfALAD-1 (5′-ATGTTAAAATCAGATGTAGTGC-3′) and PfALAD-5 (5′-TCATAGAGTTAATTCAATATTTAAA-3′) to give a 1356-bp fragment (1-451 amino acids). A second cDNA (cDNA-2) was obtained using the primer pair, PfALAD-2 (5′-AATTCACAAATATTAAGTAAAATGAA-3′) and PfALAD-5 to give a 1191-bp fragment (56-451 amino acids). A third cDNA (cDNA-3) was obtained using the primer pair PfALAD-3 (5′-CACAAATATAAAGACATCGAAACTT-3′) and PfALAD-4 (5′-TCATCCCCCTCTATAATATGTTTATCCA-3′) to give a 675-bp product (115-340 amino acids) (Fig. 1, A-C). Because the primers were designed with EcoRI/BamHI linkers, all cDNAs (cDNA-1, -2, and -3) were cloned into pRSET vectors (Invitrogen, CA) at the BamHI-EcoRI site and proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Whereas the expression of cDNA-1 was very poor, cDNA-2 (56-451 aa) and cDNA-3 (115-340 aa) could be expressed in pRSET A vector. cDNA-2 was also cloned into PGEX4T1 vector to express the protein as GST fusion. In both cases, the E. coli cells were initially grown to an A600 of 1 at 30 °C with constant shaking at 200 rpm. The culture was then shifted to 18 °C and shaken at 150 rpm for 30 min before isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) addition. Induction was carried out for 15 h. These conditions resulted in cDNA-2 being expressed in the soluble phase. In the case of His-tagged protein the frozen E. coli cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5) by sonication. The supernatant after centrifugation (20,000 rpm for 30 min) was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation (0-35%). The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 300 mm KCl and bound to nickel-agarose (Qiagen). After washing the column with equilibration buffer and the buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (w/v) and 30 mm imidazole, the bound protein was eluted with a 30-300 mm imidazole gradient in the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The peak fractions containing the protein were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 20% glycerol, and stored at -20 °C. In the case of the GST fusion protein, the recombinant E. coli lysate obtained with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 was centrifuged and the supernatant was directly loaded onto GST-agarose (Sigma) and washed with the same buffer containing 300 mm KCl. The protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 30 mm GSH. The peak fractions were pooled and incubated with thrombin for 15 h at 4 °C to cleave the GST. The protein was purified on a Superdex-200 gel filtration column and equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, containing 300 mm KCl using AKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a 50-kDa cut-off membrane (VivaScience). cDNA-3 (115-340 aa) was also expressed with histidine tag, but the protein was present in inclusion bodies. It was solubilized using 8 m urea and purified using the nickel-agarose column. The urea was dialyzed out after the protein was eluted from the column. cDNA-2 (56-451 aa) expressed with histidine tag or as a GST fusion protein (before and after removal of GST) was enzymatically active and was used as the source of the recombinant PfALAD (rPfALAD) in this study. The product of cDNA-3 (115-340 aa) expression is referred to as rPfΔALAD in this study and was used to obtain PfALAD-specific antibodies. Native human ALAD was purified from human red blood cells by a slight modification of the known procedure (11Anderson P.M. Desnik R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6924-6930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the soluble red cell supernatant was subjected to DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation (0-45%), octyl-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. The last two chromatography steps were repeated to obtain a pure preparation and this was used to raise antibodies to the host ALAD. Recombinant mouse ALAD (rmALAD) was purified as a protein with histidine tag from the clone (gift) and used to study the properties in comparison with rPfALAD. The mammalian enzyme species are highly conserved (12Jaffe E.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the properties of the mouse and human enzymes are very similar. Enzyme Assay—ALAD enzyme activity was assayed in a total volume of 0.1 ml in a mixture containing 25 mm Trizma (Tris base) (to cover the pH range 7 to 9). Routine assays were carried out at pH 7.5 (25 mm PIPES) and 8.5 (25 mm Tris), in the presence of 5 mm ALA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme (0.5 to 2.0 μg of recombinant proteins or 150-200 μg of protein of parasite extract). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and the porphobilinogen (PBG) formed was estimated using modified Ehrlich reagent (13Mauzerall D. Granick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 435-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No buffer ion effect as such on enzyme activity was seen. While studying the effects of EDTA or o-phenanthroline, the enzymes were first incubated with the chelator for 20-30 min before the addition of metal ions and ALA. A molar extinction coefficient for PBG of 60,200 m-1 cm-1 was used to quantitate PBG concentration. The specific activity of rmALAD ranged mostly between 22 and 26 μmol of PBG/mg of protein/h at pH 7.5. The corresponding values for rPfALAD ranged between 3 and 4 μmol of PBG/mg of protein/h at pH 8.5 and 2-2.5 μmol of PBG/mg of protein/h at pH 7.5. Determination of Mg2+ Binding by Atomic Absorption—Metal ion stoichiometry was determined by atomic absorption using a Thermo Jarrell Ash Video 11E aa/ae spectrometer. Purified rPfALAD (5 ml, 400 μg of protein/ml), isolated with a histidine tag, was dialyzed against 500 ml of Tris buffer (100 mm, pH 8.5) containing 20% glycerol with three changes at 4-h intervals. The enzymatically active preparation was used to measure the intrinsic Mg2+ content.

The alignment with the template, when carefully verified by examining additional pairwise (18Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol.

The model of the mature polypeptide of a subunit was built using Insight-II (Accelrys Inc.) using homology modeling protocols. The few insertions in the PfALAD were built using the distance matrix-based loop searching method available in Insight-II. The model was then soaked in a 5-Å layer of water molecules and energy was minimized initially using a steepest descent algorithm and then with a conjugate gradient minimizer. The octamer of PfALAD was built based on the octamer in PsALAD and the components were energy minimized individually as dimers and tetramers. PfALAD model was also compared with the structure of human erythrocyte ALAD (hALAD, Protein Data Bank code 1E51). Structural comparisons were carried out through a DALI (20Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) analysis. Various manipulations and analyses were carried out using Insight-II. Localization of ALAD in P. falciparum—The parasite in culture was used to analyze for host and PfALAD by Western blot analysis and immunoelectron microscopy. For Western blot analysis, purified rPfALAD, partially purified native human ALAD, as well as parasite extracts were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. Duplicate blots were screened with antibodies to the human red cell enzyme and rPfΔALAD with antibody dilutions in the range of 1:1000 to 1:2000 followed by goat anti-rabbit (human ALAD) or goat anti-mouse (rPfΔALAD) antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. For immunoelectron microscopic studies, the parasite-infected red blood cell pellet was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, for 3-4 h. Immunostaining was then carried out by the protocol supplied by PELCO International using the LR White resin. Ultrathin sections from the embedded block were mounted on nickel grids. All incubations with antibodies were carried out in blocking buffers containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Anti-human ALAD antibodies (rabbit) or anti-rPfΔALAD antibodies (mouse) were used at 1:200 dilution and incubated for 2-3 h. Goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to 10- or 20-nm gold particles were used as secondary antibodies at 1:50 dilution and incubated for 1 h. The grids were then post-fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed with distilled water, subjected to silver enhancement, and then counterstained with uranyl acetate in 50% (w/v) ethanol. Sections were viewed using a JOEL CX100 transmission electron microscope. Other Procedures—RNA was isolated from the parasite using Trizol (Invitrogen, CA). Antibodies were raised to purified native human ALAD in rabbits and to rPfΔALAD in mice. The parasite lysate was prepared by resuspending the parasite pellet in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, followed by freeze-thawing and sonication. The sonicate was then incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min in ice to obtain the total ALAD activity in the soluble phase. Partially purified hALAD and rPfALAD were used as controls. The assays were done in the presence or absence of 25 mm EDTA. Human red blood cell lysate was fractionated on a DEAE column to remove hemoglobin and partially purify hALAD. The full-length cDNA (cDNA-1) for PfALAD was cloned into E. coli but the expression was very poor. This could be because of the hydrophobic signal sequence at the N terminus. Therefore cDNA-2 (56 to 451 aa) that permitted good growth of the E. coli hemB mutant in the complementation assay (7Sato S. Wilson R.J. Curr. Genet. 2002; 40: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was cloned into E. coli and expressed as a protein with the histidine tag or as a GST fusion protein (Fig. 2, A and B). Application of PlasmoAP (21Foth B.J. Ralph S.A. Tonkin C.J. Struck N.S. Fraunholz M. Roos D.S. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Science. 2003; 299: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), a rule-based predictor for apicoplast targeting peptides within P. falciparum, revealed that the N-terminal 70 amino acids would encompass the signal and transit peptides necessary to target ALAD to the apicoplast. Therefore, the removal of the N-terminal stretch (1-55 amino acids) should not affect enzyme activity. All the purified rPfALAD preparations, with histidine tag and with or without GST, were enzymatically active. Because, the histidine-tagged protein yields were higher than the GST-cleaved preparation, the former was used in most of the experiments. The purified rPfΔALAD (Fig. 2C) was used to raise PfALAD-specific antibodies. Because most ALADs purified so far are octamers (22Jaffe E.K. J. Bioeng. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Boese Q.F. Spano A.J. Li J.M. Timko M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17060-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an assessment of the oligomeric state of rPfALAD was made based on the gel filtration profile on a Superdex 200 analytical FPLC column. The results presented in Fig. 3A indicate that the rPfALAD elutes from the column with an Mr of 345,000 compared with the value of 335,000 obtained for rmALAD. The subunit Mr values for rPfALAD and rmALAD are 46,000 and 38,000 on the basis of mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). Thus, both ALAD species are octamers. Because ALADs from plant sources have an alkaline pH optimum (23Boese Q.F. Spano A.J. Li J.M. Timko M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17060-17066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to assess the same with rPfALAD. The results presented in Fig. 4 reveal that rPfALAD indeed has a pH optimum between 8 and 9, whereas rmALAD has a pH optimum between 7.5 and 8.5. The Km value for ALA with rPfALAD is 0.208 mm at pH 8.5, whereas for rmALAD at pH 7.5 the value is 0.294 mm. A considerable amount of literature exists on the metal cofactor requirement of ALAD from different sources (22Jaffe E.K. J. Bioeng. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Boese Q.F. Spano A.J. Li J.M. Timko M.P. J. Biol.

The enzyme species are classified into five different types based on whether they require Zn2+ (mammalian and yeast), Mg2+ (plant, algae, and bacteria), or both (some bacteria). All the reported enzymes are inhibited by EDTA (26Frankenberg N. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13968-13975Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or o-phenanthroline (24Senior N.M. Brocklehurst K. Cooper J.B. Wood S.P. Erskine P. Shoolingin-Jordan P.M. Thomas P.G. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the inhibition can be overcome by the addition of Mg2+ or Zn2+, depending on the enzyme species. Interesting results are obtained with rPfALAD in this regard. First of all, rPfALAD purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and dialyzed extensively against 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5, in the presence of 20% glycerol is active without addition of any metal ion. However, addition of Mg2+ stimulates enzyme activity by 20-30% at pH 8.5. As expected, the activity of rmALAD is not stimulated by Mg2+ (Fig. 5A). The unique features of rPfALAD are manifest in experiments studying the effects of EDTA and o-phenanthroline. EDTA does not inhibit rPfALAD enzyme activity even at 25 mm concentration and overnight treatment. Treatment of the enzyme with Chelex 100 resin does not lead to loss of enzyme activity (data not presented). RmALAD is inhibited to an extent of 90% at 5 mm EDTA concentration (Fig. 5B). Whereas EDTA does not inhibit the basal activity of rPfALAD, it inhibits the stimulation brought about by added Mg2+. o-Phenanthroline inhibits rmALAD activity by more than 90% at 0.5 mm concentration and this inhibition is substantially reversed in the presence of 20-40 μm Zn2+. rPfALAD activity is inhibited to 70% by o-phenanthroline at 5-10 mm concentration and this inhibition is not reversed in the presence of 10-250 μm Zn2+, either at pH 7.5 or 8.5. Interestingly, Mg2+ stimulation of rPfALAD is seen with the untreated or o-phenanthroline-treated enzyme. It is concluded that the inhibitory effects of o-phenanthroline on PfALAD are not related to removal of any metal ion such as zinc. In fact, Zn2+ as such is very inhibitory to rPfALAD activity. At pH 8.5, the enzyme activity is inhibited by 50% at 75 μm Zn2+, and at pH 7.5 the metal is even more inhibitory, 50% inhibition being brought about by less than 20 μm Zn2+. The 50% inhibitory value for rmALAD at pH 7.5 is around 120 μm Zn2+ (data not presented). rPfALAD activity is also stimulated by K+ and this activation is pH-dependent. Between pH 6.5 and 7.0, K+ is as stimulatory as Mg2+ and the stimulation is almost 2-fold. However, while the stimulatory effect of Mg2+ (around 20-30%) is seen at all pH values tested (6.5-10) the effect of K+ wanes at pH values above 7 and is actually slightly inhibitory at pH 8.5 (Fig. 6). It thus appears that K+ and Mg2+ act at different sites on the enzyme. Atomic absorption spectrometric analysis of purified, enzymatically active rPfALAD that was dialyzed extensively against 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.5, containing 20% glycerol reveals that the enzyme contains 2 atoms of Mg2+ per octamer of the enzyme. ALAD asymmetrically condenses two molecules of ALA to produce PBG. The two ALA substrate molecules are distinguished as A- and P-site ALA because of the acetic acid and propionic acid side chains that they contribute to the product. The corresponding binding sites on ALAD are termed A-site and P-site, respectively. The sequence of PfALAD is structurally compatible with the TIM barrel-fold exhibited by all the other known structures of ALAD including the human enzyme (16Frankenberg N. Erskine P.T. Cooper J.B.

It also contains the additional strands and helices located in a long extended N-terminal arm, as seen in other ALAD structures. The structure-based alignment of the amino acid sequence of PfALAD with PsALAD was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 7A). A model of the octamer was constructed for PfALAD based on the arrangement seen in the PsALAD. Despite overall similarities in sequence, subunit, and quaternary structures between PfALAD and PsALAD, several fine differences exist. The sequence alignment of PfALAD with PsALAD reveals 3 single residue deletions and 6 short insertions spanning 1-4 residues distributed across the PfALAD primary structure. It is interesting to observe that 2 of the deletions and 3 of the insertions occur at the dimer-dimer interface such that the corresponding residues of the A subunit can interact with those of the E subunit. The insertion corresponding to residues 362-365 in PfALAD is an extended loop that projects toward the tetrameric axis stabilized by a salt-bridge formed by Lys363 and Asp365 present within the loop of each subunit.

Here we show that SIAH-1/2 binds and targets for proteasome-mediated degradation the putative tumor suppressor and tripartite motif (TRIM) family member PML, leading to the loss of its transcriptional co-activating properties and a reduction in the number of endogenous PML nuclear bodies. Association with PML requires the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of SIAH-1/2 through an interacting surface apparently distinct from those predicted by the structural studies, or shown experimentally to mediate binding to SIAH-associated factors. Within PML, the coiled-coil domain is required for Siah- and proteasome-mediated degradation, and deletions of regions critical for the integrity of this region impair the ability of Siah to trigger PML-RAR degradation. Fusion of the coiled-coil domain to heterologous proteins resulted in the capacity of mSiah-2 to target their degradation. All of the TRIM proteins tested were degraded upon mSiah-2 overexpression. Finally, we show that the fusion protein PML-RAR (that retains the coiled-coil domain), which causes acute promyelocytic leukemias, is also a potential substrate of mSiah-2. As a result of mSiah-2 overexpression and subsequent degradation of the fusion protein, the arrest in hematopoietic differentiation because of expression of PML-RAR is partially rescued.

SIAH-1 is a transcriptional target of p53 in human cells in vitro, suggesting that targeted degradation of SIAH substrates may be relevant to modulate p53 response to stress (growth arrest and/or apoptosis).

Briefly, Phoenix packaging cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate with the indicated PINCO-based vectors. The supernatant from the transfections that contained the viral particles was collected, filtered, and then used to perform the infection of target cells (27Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A.

Two days after infection, cells were left untreated or placed in the presence of vitamin D-TGF-β to induce differentiation. Immunophenotypical analysis of differentiation markers was performed as described (29Gelmetti V. Zhang J. Fanelli M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell.

Transient Transfections, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting Assays—293T cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate as indicated. For the trans-activation assays, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity. Transfection efficiency was evaluated by co-transfecting 50 ng of CMV-βGal plasmid (Promega) in each sample. For the immunoprecipitation assays, transfected cells were washed in PBS, and then lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml N-ethylmaleimide). 1 mg of proteins was incubated with the primary antibody for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by an additional incubation of 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed in Nonidet P-40 buffer, denatured in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed for Western blotting as described (30Grignani F. Testa U. Rogaia D. Ferrucci P.F. Samoggia P.

Immunofluorescence—Transduced U937 cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (2% bovine serum albumin) for 10 min. The anti-PML antibodies used for the immunostaining were dissolved in PBS (2% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing in PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min with the rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. Pull-down Assays—Maltose-binding protein (MBP) and maltose-binding protein-PML fusion (MBP-PML) were expressed in bacteria and purified by amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Equal amounts (2 μg) of MBP and MBP-PML proteins conjugated to amylose beads were incubated with in vitro-translated mSiah-2 or PML in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 h at 37 °C. Beads were washed in the same buffer, denatured in Laemmli buffer, and then analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Siah-1/2 Induces Degradation of PML and PML/RAR via the Proteasome—Intracellular levels of both PML and PML-RAR are regulated through pathways that are not yet fully characterized (24Fanelli M.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2945-2948PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether SIAH proteins are involved in their degradation, we performed transient transfection experiments in 293T cells. This approach has been used previously to demonstrate SIAH-mediated proteasomal degradation of several other proteins (4Zhang J. Guenther M.G. Carthew R.W.

Western blot analysis of protein extracts from transfected cells showed marked down-regulation of PML (Fig. 1, A and B) and PML-RAR, but not of RAR (Fig. 1A). Incubation of transfected cells prior to harvesting with the proteasome inhibitor LLnL prevented PML and PML-RAR down-regulation, suggesting the involvement of proteasome-mediated degradation (Fig. 1A). Notably, overexpressed mSiah-2 (or hSiah-1) induced proteasome-dependent degradation of the portion of PML retained in the PML-RAR fusion protein (PML-P/R), indicating that SIAH-targeted degradation of PML-RAR depends on PML sequences (Fig. 1A, and data not shown). As observed previously (4Zhang J. Guenther M.G. Carthew R.W. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 37Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the N-terminal RING domain of SIAH-1/2 is essential for proteasome-mediated degradation of target proteins: hSIAH-1 or mSIAH-2 ΔRING failed to induce PML degradation (Fig. 1C, and see Fig. 3).Fig. 3Functional analysis of the substrate-binding domain of SIAH-1: the known substrate-binding surfaces are not required for PML degradation. 293T cells were transfected with PML and Siah-1 wild-type or mutant myc-tagged cDNAs.

Whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-PML, anti-tubulin, and/or anti-myc antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then analyzed the effects of overexpressed mSIAH-2 on endogenous PML proteins. The lack of an efficient anti-PML antibody to use in Western blot assays led us to perform immunofluorescence studies. U937 promonocytic cells were infected with a retrovirus expressing the mSiah-2 cDNA fused in frame with the GFP, or expressing only GFP as control, and stained with a monoclonal anti-PML antibody to detect the endogenous PML NBies. As shown in Fig. 1D, the number of NBies is significantly decreased in GFP/mSiah-2-expressing cells with respect to control cells: we counted an average of 5.6 NBies/cell in GFP-mSiah-2-infected cells against 13.1 NBies/cell in control cells not transduced or expressing GFP (Fig. 1C, p < 0.05). mSIAH-2 ΔRING failed to induce changes in NBies staining (not shown). Similar results were obtained by micro-injection of mSiah-2 (not fused to GFP) or Siah-1 in WI38 cells (data not shown). PML inhibits transcription when tethered to DNA through fusion to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (16Vallian S. Gaken J.A. Trayner I.D. Gingold E.B. Kouzarides T. Chang K.S. Farzaneh F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We used the Gal4-PML fusion protein to repress transcription driven by the TK minimal promoter (G5-TK-Luc reporter plasmid) in transient transfection assays performed in 293T cells. Increasing amounts of mSiah-2 expression vector did not affect the TK-driven transcription (Fig. 1E, bars 2 and 3), whereas Gal4-PML-mediated repression of transcription was almost completely relieved (Fig. 1E, bars 5 and 6). Taken together, these results suggest that SIAH proteins induce proteasome-mediated degradation of PML and PML-RAR in a RING-dependent fashion, resulting in a loss of PML co-activating properties. PML Associates with SIAH Proteins—To investigate whether PML forms a stable complex with SIAH proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays upon co-transfection of mSiah-2 (or mSiah-2 ΔRING) and PML in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, we detected anti-PML immunoreactive polypeptides in anti-SIAH-2 immunoprecipitates (lane 12), although we did not detect mSIAH-2 in anti-PML immunoprecipitates (lane 11). Interestingly, we could detect mSIAH-2 ΔRING protein, observed by anti-HA immunoblotting, in anti-PML immunoprecipitates, suggesting that the lack of a PML-mSiah2 association detectable by immunoprecipitation using anti-PML antibodies derives from the reduction in PML levels upon mSiah2, but not mSiah-2 ΔRING, overexpression. To investigate whether PML and mSIAH-2 associate directly, we performed in vitro binding experiments using a recombinant purified MBP-PML attached to amylose beads and in vitro translated, 35S-labeled, mSIAH-2. As shown in Fig. 2B, MBP-PML, but not the control MBP protein, bound specifically mSIAH-2. Taken together, these results suggest that mSIAH-2 associates with PML through its C-terminal region and requires the N-terminal RING domain to target PML for proteasome-mediated degradation. The region responsible for binding of Siah-2 (or Siah-1, data not shown) to PML corresponds to the so-called substrate-binding domain of Siah. Recently, the structure of this domain has been solved (36Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the structure and other studies (25Matsuzawa S. Li C. Ni C.-Z. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1837-1840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) indicate that Siah may bind to different Siah substrates through distinct surfaces. We evaluated whether hSiah-1, carrying mutations known to impair the association with other substrates, was able to trigger PML degradation. Interestingly, hSiah-1 mutant A (with alanine substituted for Glu-161, Asp-162, Glu-226, and Glu-237), which is mutated in a concave-negative surface required for binding to the SIAH interactor SIP (25Matsuzawa S. Li C. Ni C.-Z. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1837-1840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), continued to trigger PML degradation (Fig. 3). Likewise, mutations lying in a positively charged region (Siah-1 mutant D, carrying alanine substitution for Arg-214, Arg-215, Arg-231, Arg-124, and Arg-232) proposed as a second site of protein-protein interaction (36Polekhina G.

Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and required, for the Drosophila homologue Sina, to mediate association with substrates such as Phyllopod (38Li S. Xu C. Carthew R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6854-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), did not impair the capacity of Siah to degrade PML (Fig. 3). At least another SIAH-associating protein, BAG1, does not bind Siah through either surface, suggesting that additional interaction surfaces are contained within the substrate-binding domain (25Matsuzawa S. Li C. Ni C.-Z. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1837-1840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). BAG1, however, is not triggered for degradation by Siah (25Matsuzawa S. Li C. Ni C.-Z. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1837-1840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); PML, therefore, apparently defines a new class of Siah substrates, which are targeted to the proteasome but do not require the two previously described SIAH surfaces required for association with interactors/substrates. The Coiled-coil Region of PML and other TRIM Proteins Is the Structural Determinant for mSiah-2-mediated Degradation—We performed additional co-transfection studies in 293T cells to elucidate which domain(s) of PML is required for mSIAH-2-mediated proteasomal degradation. From the preliminary analysis shown in Fig. 1, we hypothesized that the region required for mSIAH-2 binding and degradation lies in the portion of PML retained in the fusion protein. This region contains the conserved tripartite motif; therefore, we transfected PML constructs devoid of either the RING+B boxes region, or the coiled-coil region, and examined their sensitivity to mSIAH-2-mediated degradation. ΔH-PML (lacking the coiled-coil region) was not degraded by mSIAH-2 (Fig. 4A) and did not associate with mSiah-2 (Fig. 2A), whereas ΔC-PML (lacking the RING+B boxes) expression levels were drastically decreased in an LLnL-sensitive way. To establish whether the coiled-coil region was the sole element required for mSIAH-2 degradation, we used a chimeric construct where the CC domain is fused to full-length RAR (CC-RAR) (that does not behave as an mSIAH-2 substrate as shown in Fig. 1A). Strikingly, the CC-RAR chimera was markedly down-regulated by mSIAH-2 in a proteasome-dependent manner, whereas RAR levels were not affected or even enhanced by co-transfecting mSIAH-2 (Fig. 4B). These results show that the coiled-coil region of PML is necessary and sufficient for mSIAH-2 recruitment and proteasome-mediated degradation. The coiled-coil region of PML has been further subdivided into four distinct subdomains (Fig. 4C, heptads I–IV); the biochemical mapping of these subdomains (in the context of the fusion protein PML-RAR) has shown that all four heptads contribute to the functionality of the coiled-coil domain (26Perez A.

Whereas deletion of each individual heptad leads to selective impairment of specific biochemical properties (formation of homodimers and hetero-oligomers with PML, binding to a DNA-response element) (26Perez A. Kastner P. Sethi S. Lutz Y. Reibel C. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3171-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 30Grignani F. Testa U. Rogaia D. Ferrucci P.F. Samoggia P. Pinto A.

Lo Bello M. Sette M. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 29: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), heptad 2 seems critical for the integrity of the coiled-coil domain, because all of the properties analyzed are impaired in constructs carrying the deletion of this region (26Perez A.

Lo Bello M. Sette M. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 29: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We analyzed the sensitivity of PML-RAR and deletion constructs in each individual heptad to Siah-mediated degradation (Fig. 4D). Deletion of heptad 1, 3, or 4 had no or minimal effect, and all of these proteins continued to be degraded by mSIAH-2 (Fig. 4D). In contrast, deletion of heptad 2 completely abrogated degradation by mSIAH-2. These results suggest that the integrity of the coiled-coil domain is critical for the sensitivity to SIAH. PML (TRIM19) belongs to a conserved family of proteins, all sharing the tripartite motif, including the presence of a coiled-coil region (10Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). We checked whether other TRIMs may behave as mSIAH-2 substrates: co-transfection of mSiah-2 with several TRIM family members led, in all cases, to down-regulation of protein levels, showing that all TRIM proteins are potential substrates for proteasomal degradation by mSIAH-2 (Fig. 5). mSiah-2 Partially Rescues PML/RAR-induced Differentiation Block—One of the features of PML/RAR is the capacity to block the differentiation of hematopoietic cells (42Grignani F. Ferrucci P.F. Testa U. Talamo G. Fagioli M. Alcalay M. Mencarelli A. Grignani F. Peschle C. Nicoletti I. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1993; 74: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Because mSIAH-2 induces PML-RAR degradation (Fig. 1), we investigated whether mSIAH-2 can interfere with PML/RAR biological activity. As a model system, we used hematopoietic progenitor U937-PR9 cells, expressing PML-RAR under a zinc-inducible promoter (43Grignani F. De Matteis S. Nervi C. Tomassoni L. Gelmetti V. Cioce M. Fanelli M. Ruthardt M. Ferrara F.F. Zamir I. Seiser C. Grignani F. Lazar M.A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1998; 391: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). In these cells, induction of PML-RAR expression leads to the blocking of differentiation induced by vitamin D/TGF-β treatment (43Grignani F. De Matteis S. Nervi C. Tomassoni L. Gelmetti V. Cioce M. Fanelli M. Ruthardt M. Ferrara F.F. Zamir I. Seiser C. Grignani F. Lazar M.A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1998; 391: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). PR9 cells were infected with retroviral vectors encoding GFP only (as control) or the GFP-mSiah-2 chimeric cDNA. PML/RAR expression was drastically reduced by mSiah-2 infection (Fig. 6A). To induce differentiation, cells were treated with vitamin D/TGF-β. Analysis of surface differentiation markers (cd14) showed that PML-RAR strongly inhibited differentiation in GFP-expressing cells (from >90% to <20%; Fig. 5B). mSiah-2 partially rescued the differentiation block induced by PML-RAR: >50% cells were differentiated in the presence of the fusion protein and of mSIAH-2, showing that mSIAH-2 is a negative modulator of PML-RAR function (Fig. 6B). Here, we report SIAH-1/2 as a novel interactor for PML and suggest a potential role for SIAHs in the regulation of PML stability. A structural signature present in PML and in all of the other TRIM family members (the coiled-coil region) represents the critical requirement for SIAH-mediated proteasomal degradation. This region mediates self-association and the ensuing formation of oligomers in PML/TRIMs (10Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis by dedicated programs (MULTICOIL) (44Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) of the amino-acidic sequences of several characterized mSiah-2 substrates (e.g. tramtrack; N-CoR) shows in these proteins stretches with a high propensity to form a coiled-coil, suggesting that this may be a more widespread structural requirement for SIAH-mediated degradation. Recently, a potential SIAH recognition motif has been described for certain SIAH substrates (45House C.M. Frew I.J. Huang H.-L. Wiche G. Traficante N. Nice E. Catimel B. Bowtell D.D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have failed to detect in the coiled-coil region of the TRIM proteins a conserved motif reminiscent of this sequence, suggesting that these proteins belong to a distinct class of SIAH interactors. This possibility is strengthened by the analysis of SIAH mutants unable to associate with different categories of substrates/interactors: the finding that none of the mutations abrogates the capacity of Siah to target PML for degradation implies a novel mode of interaction. Structural studies are in progress to define precisely the PML-SIAH molecular complex. SIAH expression (leading to both PML-RAR and N-CoR degradation) should directly target two critical leukemogenic stimuli. The differentiation block imposed by the fusion protein, however, was only partially rescued. There are several explanations for this result: (i) residual levels of PML-RAR/N-CoR may be sufficient to maintain the block, or (ii) targeting by SIAH of additional substrates is required for differentiation. Although these phenomena may both contribute to the observed resistance, we favor the hypothesis that PML-RAR may induce epigenetic alterations of the chromatin structure of its target genes (through DNA methylation and other histone modifications); once established, these modifications would no longer require PML-RAR expression to maintain a repressive pattern of gene expression stably inherited through successive cell divisions and, therefore, maintain the differentiation block even in the absence of PML-RAR or N-CoR (46Di Croce L. Raker V.A. Corsaro M. Fazi F. Fanelli M. Faretta M. Fuks F. Lo Coco F. Kouzarides T. Nervi C. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Science. 2002; 295: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). SIAH-1 is transcriptionally induced by p53 in human cell lines and apparently plays a positive role in the p53 stress response (8Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Froesch B.A. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Recent results from Siah-1/2 knock out mice suggest that this regulation might differ in murine cells or does not play a major role in vivo, leaving the discussion open on the significance of the Siah/p53 network (9Frew I.J. Dickins R.A. Cuddihy A.R. Del Rosario M. Reinhard C. O'Connell M.J. Bowtell D.D.L. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8155-8164Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the fact that SIAH may then contribute to the down-regulation of PML (which is itself a p53 regulator) (14Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W.

This loop would reinforce the well described mdm2-p53 feed-back loop, where mdm2 is transcriptionally induced by p53, and then provokes p53 degradation through the proteasome (39Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The two transcriptional p53 targets, SIAH and mdm2, might trigger degradation of two critical components of the p53 pathway (p53 itself and PML), therefore modulating its overall degree of activity. The cross-talk among mdm2 and SIAH in the p53 network is being currently investigated and may give useful insights on the cellular responses to stress and oncogenic stimuli. We thank John C.

Wild-type neuroglobin has been shown to have six-coordinate heme in both ferric and ferrous states. Substitution of His96 by alanine leads to complete loss of heme, indicating that His96 is the proximal ligand. The resonance Raman spectra of M69L and K67T mutants were similar to those of wild-type (WT) neuroglobin in both ferric and ferrous states. By contrast, H64V was six-coordinate high-spin and five-coordinate high-spin in the ferric and ferrous states, respectively, at acidic pH. The spectra were pH-dependent and six-coordinate with the low-spin component dominating at alkaline pH. In a double mutant H64V/K67T, the high-spin component alone was detected in the both ferric and the ferrous states. This implies that His64 is the endogenous ligand and that Lys67 is situated nearby in the distal pocket. In the ferrous H64V and H64V/K67T mutants, the ν(Fe-His) stretching frequency appears at 221 cm-1, which is similar to that of deoxymyoglobin. In the ferrous CO-bound state, the ν(Fe-CO) stretching frequency was detected at 521 and 494 cm-1 in WT, M69L, and K67T, while only the 494 cm-1 component was detected in the H64V and H64V/K67T mutants. Thus, the 521 cm-1 component is attributed to the presence of polar His64. The CO binding kinetics were biphasic for WT, H64V, and K67T and monophasic for H64V/K67T.

Neuroglobin (Ngb) 1The abbreviations used are: NgbneuroglobinMbmyoglobinHbhemoglobinWTwild-typeWwatts.1The abbreviations used are: NgbneuroglobinMbmyoglobinHbhemoglobinWTwild-typeWwatts. is a new member of the vertebrate globin family, which is expressed predominantly in the brain and nerve tissues (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Although Ngb displays the structural determinants of the globin fold (2Bashford D. Chothia C.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The function of Ngb is a matter of debate. Ngb is up-regulated in response to hypoxia, and this protects neurons against hypoxic damage (7Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). High concentrations (∼100 μm) of Ngb are observed in the retina and its subcellular distribution correlates with the localization of the mitochondria (8Schmidt M. Giessl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These observations point to a role for Ngb in intracellular O2 supply (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T.

However, the low concentration of Ngb in non-pathological brain tissue (in the micromolar range; Ref. 1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T.

Indeed, the Hbs of the nervous tissue of several invertebrates (11Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M.L. Vanfleteren J. Esmans E.L. Marden M. Griffon N. Moens L. J. Biol.

Ngb could be an O2 sensor protein activating other proteins with regulatory functions (17Kriegl J.M. Bhattacharyya A.J. Nienhaus K. Deng P. Minkow O. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1999; 401: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Whatever its precise role, the function of Ngb is linked to the binding of gaseous ligands.A key feature of Ngb is its six-coordinate heme structure, both in the ferrous and ferric states, with the distal histidine (His64) forming an endogenous ligand (3Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B.S. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 10Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C.

Lett. 2002; 361: 355-361Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments with other globins indicate that the other iron-coordinating ligand is His96 (Fig. 1), and this feature in the ferric state has been confirmed recently by x-ray crystallography (27Pesce A. Dewilde S. Nardini M. Moens L. Ascenzi P. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Bolognesi M. Structure (Lond.). 2003; 11: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Ngb exhibits high ligand recombination rate constants (kon) and slow dissociation rate constants (koff) for O2 and CO binding, giving rise to a high intrinsic affinity for these exogenous ligands. These ligands must, however, displace the endogenous sixth ligand, resulting in an observed O2 affinity similar to that of Mb (9Trent III, J.T. Watts R.A. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30106-30110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 19538-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In this context, six-coordination is a means of fine-tuning the O2 affinity (10Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Studies of ligand binding over a wide range of temperatures reveal the presence of multiple, intrinsically heterogeneous distal heme pocket conformations in Ngb-CO (17Kriegl J.M. Bhattacharyya A.J. Nienhaus K. Deng P. Minkow O. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7992-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity has been attributed to the dissociated His64, which is expected to be situated close to the bound gaseous ligand. However, it has been suggested (17Kriegl J.M. Bhattacharyya A.J. Nienhaus K. Deng P. Minkow O. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7992-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that other distal residues compete with His64 for the sixth coordination site.Here we present an extensive resonance Raman analysis of recombinant wild-type (WT) and a series of mutant human Ngbs in their ferric, ferrous, and ferrous-CO bound forms. Through the analysis of various mutants, the endogenous axial ligands have been assigned unequivocally as His64 and His96 in both ferric and ferrous states, as suggested previously. Surprisingly, ligation in the H64V mutant Ngb was found to be pH-dependent, and a further distal residue, Lys67, appears to be situated close to the heme, giving rise to a six-coordinate low-spin structure in both the ferric and ferrous states at alkaline pH. Flash photolysis studies on the CO-bound mutants revealed that both His64 and Lys67 contribute equally to CO binding in the slower phase. Thus, Ngb is revealed to have a distal environment unique among the globins. The role of these residues is discussed in the light of the possible biological functions of Ngb.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning and Purification of Ngb—To achieve high expression, a gene encoding WT Ngb was synthesized using a modification of the recursive PCR strategy (29Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Casimiro D.R. Toy-Palmer A. Blake II, R.C. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6640-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Based on the known amino acid sequence of human Ngb (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), six forward (f1-f6) and six reverse (r1-r6) primers with lengths ranging from 55 to 60 bases were designed (Fig. 2) and custom-synthesized. Two termination codons (TAA and TGA) were placed in tandem. Each pair of forward and reverse primers overlaps by about 20 bases, enabling chain extension by KOD-Plus-DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The high fidelity of this enzyme enabled perfect match of the synthesized and designed DNA sequences. The full-length PCR product was selectively amplified in a second PCR with a forward primer F which creates tandem XhoI and NdeI sites and a reverse primer R, which generates a BamHI site (Fig. 2). The resultant product was inserted at the XhoI/BamHI site of the plasmid pBluescriptII KS(+) (Stratagene), and the ligation products were used to transform Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue MRF′ (Stratagene). The DNA sequence of the recombinant plasmid product was confirmed with a Li-Cor model 4200S2 DNA sequencer. The QuikChange system (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into the Ngb coding sequence, which directed the expression of Ngbs with H64V, K67T, M69L, H96A, and H64V/K67T mutations. The NdeI/BamHI insert was excised from the pBluescript derivatives and ligated into a pET3a-based expression vector (pBEX). The ligation products were introduced into E. coli strain BL21Gold(DE3) (Stratagene). Cell growth and protein purification were performed as described previously (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified to homogeneity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) criteria (Fig. 3). Ngb concentrations were evaluated from the heme content which was measured by a pyridine hemochrome assay.Fig. 2Designed gene for human Ngb. Forward (f1-f6, cyan) and reverse (r1-r6, green) primers were custom synthesized. The full-length PCR product was further amplified by the two flanking primers (F and R). Unique restriction sites used for subsequent manipulation of the coding sequence are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3SDS-PAGE (left) and absorption spectra (right) of purified H96A and WT Ngb.

Aliquots of HCl or NaOH were added to solutions containing ∼10 μm protein. The pH in the cuvette was monitored directly using a microelectrode (Hitachi). The ferrous proteins were also titrated with CO saturated in 10 mm sodium phosphate and 0.1 m NaCl (pH 7.0).Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded using a double monochromator (Jasco R-800) with a slit width of 6 cm-1, following excitation by a krypton ion laser (406.7-nm line, Coherent I-302) or by a He-Cd laser (441.6-nm line, Kimmon IK4121R-G). A photomultiplier detector was used (Hamamatsu Photonics, R595), and the frequencies were calibrated with indene. A spinning Raman cell was used throughout the measurements. The samples contained 100 μm protein in the buffers specified in the respective figure legends. Ferrous proteins were prepared by the addition of sodium dithionite, after purging extensively with nitrogen gas. The carbonmonoxy forms were prepared by the addition of sodium dithionite under 1 atm CO. The spectra of the CO forms were obtained with a defocused laser beam.Flash Photolysis—CO rebinding kinetics were monitored at 25 °C using a laser flash photolysis system (Unisoku, Osaka, Japan). After photolysis of ferrous CO-bound Ngb with a 5-ns pulse at 532 nm from a Continuum Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, ligand recombination was followed by monitoring absorbance changes at 420 nm. These experiments were performed with 10 μm Ngbs in 10 mm sodium phosphate and 0.1 m NaCl (pH 7.0) under 1 atm of CO. Selected proteins were photolyzed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) under 1 atm of CO.RESULTSHis96—In Fig. 1, the amino acid sequences of selected human globins are compared. Residues identical to those of Ngb are marked in green. The conserved histidines at positions 64 and 96 in Ngb (red) correspond to the distal (E7) and proximal (F8) histidines in Hb and Mb, respectively. The F8 histidine is the sole endogenous axial ligand of the heme iron in the ferric and ferrous states of Hb and Mb, and it is assumed that His96 is the proximal ligand in Ngb. To test this hypothesis, we replaced histidine 96 with alanine (H96A) whose side chain cannot coordinate the iron. This H96A mutant was purified and its mobility in SDS-PAGE was compared with that of WT Ngb (Fig. 3). The absorption spectrum of the ferric WT Ngb is shown (Fig. 3, right) and is essentially the same as that reported previously (10Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In contrast the H96A mutant is colorless, and the spectrum indicates the complete absence of heme in this mutant. It is concluded that the His96 is essential for heme retention in Ngb, consistent with this residue forming an axial ligand.Lys67 and Met69—It has been proposed that His64 (E7) constitutes the second axial ligand of the heme. In support of this suggestion, the absorption spectrum of the H64L mutant reveals loss of His/His coordination (10Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, the Soret peak associated with the ferrous H64L mutant at 423 nm is blue-shifted relative to most five-coordinate Hbs and Mbs (430 nm), and the observed shoulder to this band suggests the presence of two forms, perhaps indicating the presence of an alternative distally coordinated ligand (10Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To clarify the identity of the distal ligand in WT Ngb, we prepared further mutant Ngbs. Three residues, His64, Lys67, and Met69, are expected to be capable of iron coordination on the distal side of heme (Fig. 1, marked with +). These three residues were mutated to Val, Thr, and Leu, respectively. Thr67 and Leu69 occur in Mb, and the H64V mutant of Mb has been studied extensively (31Quillin M.L. Arduini R.M. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 32Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar).In Fig. 4, resonance Raman spectra of ferric WT, M69L, and K67T Ngbs are shown. Resonance Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for revealing the oxidation states, spin states, and coordination numbers of heme iron (33Spiro T.G. Li X.-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Vol. 3. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988: 1-38Google Scholar, 34Kincaid J.R. Kadish K.M. Smith K.M. Guilard R. The Porphyrin Handbook. Vol. 7. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000: 227-291Google Scholar). In the higher frequency region, the ν2, ν38, ν3, and ν4 lines are observed at 1579, 1547, 1504, and 1374 cm-1, respectively. These frequencies are typical of six-coordinate ferric low-spin hemes and similar to those reported previously for the WT Ngb (25Couture M. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36377-36382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the lower frequency region, the broad line around 420 cm-1 appears to be slightly affected by the mutation. This line can be assigned to the in-plane bending vibration of the porphyrin vinyl groups (35Hu S. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and the slight perturbations upon mutation indicate that Met69 and Lys67 are situated close to the heme, though these are not the Fe-coordinating ligands.Fig. 4Resonance Raman spectra of the ferric WT, M69L, and K67T Ngb.

In the spectrum of WT Ngb, the ν2, ν38, ν3, and ν4 lines at 1580, 1557, 1493, and 1360 cm-1, respectively, indicate the presence of a six-coordinate ferrous low-spin heme (25Couture M. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36377-36382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since these frequencies in the spectra of M69L and K67T are identical with those of WT Ngb, Met69 and Lys67 cannot be Fe-coordinating ligands even in the ferrous state. However, the line around 420 cm-1 is again affected by the mutation, suggesting that Met69 and Lys67 are close to the heme in both ferric and ferrous states.Fig. 5Resonance Raman spectra of the ferrous WT, M69L, and K67T Ngb.

In Table I, the absorption maxima of the ferric mutants are summarized. The wavelengths of these maxima are identical in WT, M69L, and K67T Ngbs, but quite different to those exhibited by the H64V mutant whose Soret maximum occurs at 406 nm at pH 6.0. The spectral features of the H64V Ngb mutant are similar to those of WT Mb at neutral pH. Mb contains a six-coordinate high-spin heme in the ferric state with a water molecule as the sixth ligand of the iron (36Oldfield T.J. Smerdon S.J. Dauter Z. Petratos K. Wilson K.S. Wilkinson A.J.

This transition has been investigated in mammalian Mbs where it is established that the dissociation of one proton equivalent converts a water ligand to a hydroxide ligand at alkaline pH (37Iizuka T. Yonetani T. Adv. Biophys. 1970; 1: 157-182PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 6 (upper panel), the absorption spectrum of the ferric H64V Ngb mutant is pH-sensitive in the range pH 6-10. Since one set of isosbestic points was observed, the titration curve was analyzed in terms of a simple equilibrium between the acidic and alkaline forms of the protein. The absorbance changes at the Soret maxima of the two forms were normalized and the molar fraction of the alkaline form was calculated and plotted against pH in Fig. 6 (lower panel). Theoretical curves drawn assuming that the alkaline transition involves one proton equivalent provide a satisfactory fit to the titration data. The apparent pKa value of the alkaline transition in H64V was calculated to be 7.57. This pH-dependent behavior of the H64V is not observed in the WT, K67T, and M69L Ngbs, indicating unequivocally that replacement of His64 is the origin of the alkaline transition. The spectral similarity between the H64V mutant of Ngb and WT Mb and their common pH behavior suggest strongly that each contains an iron-coordinated water in the ferric state at acidic pH.Fig. 6pH titration of ferric H64V Ngb.Upper panel, absorption spectra of the H64V at pH 6.36 (spectrum 1), 7.11 (spectrum 2), 7.57 (spectrum 3), 8.05 (spectrum 4), and 9.13 (spectrum 5).

At acidic pH, ferric H64V Ngb has a six-coordinate high-spin heme, showing Raman lines at 1561, 1518, 1484, and 1374 cm-1 (Fig. 7). The profile is very similar to that of WT porcine Mb at pH 6.0 (1564, 1514, 1482, and 1372 cm-1) as reported previously (38Uno T. Sakamoto R. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Wilkinson A.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10191-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). At alkaline pH, the spectra changed drastically, showing lines at 1573, 1540, 1503, and 1374 cm-1, which indicate that H64V contains a six-coordinate low-spin heme at alkaline pH. These frequencies are distinct from those exhibited by Mb at alkaline pH (1587, 1565, 1482, and 1375 cm-1) (38Uno T. Sakamoto R. Tomisugi Y. Ishikawa Y. Wilkinson A.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10191-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and rather closer to those in WT Ngb (Fig. 4). This suggests that the sixth heme ligand of ferric alkaline H64V is not a hydroxide but instead is an endogenous group that is pH-labile.Fig. 7Resonance Raman spectra of the ferric H64V and H64V/K67T Ngb. From the top: H64V at pH 9.5 and at pH 6.4, H64V/K67T at pH 9.5, and at pH 6.4. The samples contained 100 μm proteins in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.4) or 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5).

The two single mutants (S528A; S1173A) each impaired ATPase activity mildly, and showed generally symmetrical effects on function, consistent with equivalent mechanistic roles of the two nucleotide sites. Synergy between the two mutations when combined was remarkable and resulted in strong catalytic impairment. The Ser residues are not involved significantly in MgATP- or MgADP-binding or in interdomain communication between catalytic sites and drug binding sites. Retention of product MgADP is not the cause of reduced turnover. Mutation of Ser to Ala reduced the strength of interaction with the chemical transition state specifically, as shown by vanadate-ADP and beryllium fluoride-ADP trapping experiments. Therefore, the two conserved ABC signature motif Ser residues of P-glycoprotein cooperatively accelerate ATP hydrolysis via chemical transition state interaction. Because the transition state complex is currently believed to form in the dimerized state of the nucleotide binding domains, one may also conclude that both Ser-OH are necessary for correct formation of the dimer state.

In recent years it has been recognized as a general mechanism for protecting the body from hydrophobic toxins, playing a particularly important role in specific tissues such as the central nervous system. Its impact on therapy for other diseases, e.g. AIDS, and its potential impact on novel drug therapies in general, have generated significant interest in studies of its structure and mechanism, with the underlying aims of understanding its physiological function and development of new strategies for circumventing or disabling the protein (1Ambudkar S.V.

Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and consists of two six-helix membrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) contained in one continuous ∼1280-residue polypeptide. The two NBDs are ∼60% identical in sequence and each contain Walker A and B consensus sequences, both of which are known to be intimately involved in and required for the ATP hydrolysis reaction (6Azzaria M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13887-13889Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the ATP hydrolysis reaction by mutations in these sequences leads, as one would predict, to commensurate loss of ATP-driven drug efflux from cells. Between the Walker A and B sequences is found a third conserved sequence (“LSGGQ”) which is named the ABC signature sequence, because it is the hallmark of the ABC transporter superfamily (5Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 12Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). The very strong conservation of this sequence in evolution implies an important role, but what that role is has not yet been determined. New ideas about the role of the ABC signature sequence have come from x-ray crystallography studies and from photocleavage and cross-linking studies. At the time of writing no high-resolution structure of Pgp is available, but structures of the dimeric NBD-containing subunits of Rad50, MalK, and thermophilic MJ0796 (13Hopfner K.P. Karcher A.

Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) have been published, and show a most interesting feature, which is that in the dimeric NBD arrangement seen in these structures, the ABC signature sequence of NBD2 lies juxtaposed to the Walker A sequence of NBD1, and vice versa. The two bound nucleotides (where present) are sandwiched between the Walker A and ABC signature sequences, with the hydroxyl side-chain group of the Ser residue of the ABC signature sequence coming close enough to the γ-phosphate of ATP to possibly form an H-bond with a γ-phosphate oxygen (13Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 14Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L.

Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition, substantial conformational movement of the LSGGQ region is hypothesized in several of these reports. Earlier photocleavage studies in MalK had determined that the Walker A and ABC signature sequences of different NBD-containing subunits must lie close to the vanadate (Vi) trapped in the Vi-ADP transition state analog complex (17Fetsch E.E. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies in Pgp established that the Walker A sequence of NBD1 must lie within disulfide-bridging distance of the ABC signature sequence in NBD2 and vice versa (18Loo T.W Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus there is strong evidence that the ABC signature sequence is potentially positioned to play an important role in catalysis. One idea that comes immediately to mind is that it facilitates correct dimer interface formation between the NBDs. Our work on Pgp has indicated that correct NBD dimer formation is an integral requirement of the catalytic pathway, necessary to form the transition state after binding of drug and nucleotides (10Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25031-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Urbatsch I.L. Tyndall G.A. Tombline G. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23171-23179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that the Ser-OH affects the chemistry of ATP hydrolysis directly by interacting with the ATP γ-phosphate. Previous reports described mutations of this Ser residue. It is known that cystic fibrosis patients show mutations Ser to Asn, Ile, or Arg, and that the analogous mutations, produced in the yeast ABC transporter STE6, caused substantial defects in transport function (20Browne B.L. McClendon V. Bedwell D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Proff C. Kölling R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the bacterial transporter HisP, mutation of Ser to Phe also caused substantial defect in transport, although photolabeling of the catalytic sites was reduced by only 50% (22Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these previously reported mutations significantly alter the bulk and chemical nature at the Ser residue position. In Pgp, it was reported briefly that single Ser to Cys mutations in NBD1 or NBD2 of human MDR1 caused partial loss of ATPase activity (18Loo T.W Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In mouse MDR3 Pgp the two relevant Ser residues are Ser528 and Ser1173, in the N- and C-terminal ABC signature sequences, respectively. Mouse MDR3 Pgp is 87% identical in sequence to human MDR1 Pgp, and has the advantage that it can be prepared in very pure form on relatively large scale (23Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A further advantage of using pure protein is that for many assays the natural ligands ATP and ADP can be used to study the catalytic mechanism, thus the stoichiometry of bound intermediates, and absolute rate constants can be derived. In this study we mutated both Ser528 and Ser1173 to Ala, singly and in combination, to determine the importance of the ABC signature Ser hydroxyl in reaction chemistry and the importance of NBD integration into a complete dimer structure for catalysis. Generation of Mutant Pgp; Expression of Mutant Pgp in Pichia pastoris; Purification of Pgp—Mutations S528A and S1173A were generated by PCR mutagenesis of pAlt-mdr3N and pAlt-mdr3.6C (10Urbatsch I.L.

The initial PCR products were blunt-end-ligated into SmaI-cut pUC118, and the clones obtained were tested for presence of the mutations by DNA sequencing. Correct sequence of the whole fragment to be transferred was further validated by DNA sequencing. The mutations were then transferred into pHIL-mdr3.6-His6 (24Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S.

Activation of Pgp by Lipids and DTT; Centrifuge Column Elution of Pgp—For activation, Pgp was incubated with DTT (8 mm) and Escherichia coli lipid (Avanti, acetone/ether precipitated) at a final ratio of 50:1 (for ATPase measurement) or 2:1 (for trapping and photolabeling experiments) lipid/protein (w/w) for 20 min at room temperature followed by sonication for 30 s at 4 °C in a bath sonicator.

Briefly, elution was at 4 °C, using 1-ml Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 and 0.001% DM. As noted in Ref. 19Urbatsch I.L. Tyndall G.A. Tombline G. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

However, in order to reduce the amount of experimental manipulation to manageable proportions we routinely assumed a protein recovery of 80%. Assay of ATPase Activity; Determination of Km (MgATP) and Ki (MgADP)— Assays of wild-type, S528A, and S1173A Pgp were carried out using 2–5 μg of protein by the linked-enzyme assay (26Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or the malachite-green based colorimetric assay (27Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal.

Where a more sensitive assay was required (e.g. with S528A/S1173A Pgp) usually 1 μg of protein was assayed by the charcoal adsorption method in combination with [γ-32P]ATP (19Urbatsch I.L. Tyndall G.A. Tombline G. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23171-23179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5 and 37 °C with 2 mm excess of MgSO4 over ATP. Specific ATPase activities were determined at 10 mm MgATP concentration (except in the charcoal adsorption assay where 3 mm MgATP was the highest technically feasible radioactive MgATP concentration). Km (MgATP) values were determined by assaying at increasing concentration of MgATP and fitting the curves to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Ki (MgADP) values were determined similarly. Inhibition of ATPase, Trapping of MgADP by Vanadate (Vi) and Beryllium Fluoride (BeFx), Release of Trapped MgADP, and Reactivation of ATPase—These procedures followed essentially our previous work (29Urbatsch I.L.

Briefly, for inhibition studies, Pgp was preincubated with Vi or BeFx at varied concentration in presence of 150 μm verapamil, 200 μM ATP, 4 mm MgSO4, for 20 min at 37 °C, then passed through centrifuge columns, and residual ATPase activity in the eluates was assayed. For MgADP-trapping experiments, routinely Vi was present at 200 μm concentration or BeFx was present at nominal 100 μm concentration (5 mm NaF plus 100 μm BeSO4) (see figure legends for variation of these conditions). [α-32P]MgATP or [8-14C]MgADP were present at 200 or 100 μm, respectively with 2 mm excess MgSO4. After preincubation (usually 20 min at 37 °C) Pgp samples were passed through centrifuge columns at 4 °C to remove unbound ligands, and bound nucleotide was assayed by radioactivity counting. Stoichiometry of trapped nucleotide was calculated using a molecular mass of 142 kDa for Pgp (see also “Protein Determination” below). Release of trapped MgADP was followed by allowing the centrifuge column eluates to incubate for varied times at 37 °C, before passing through a second centrifuge column to determine residual bound nucleotide. Reactivation of ATPase was followed in centrifuge column eluates after trapping in the presence of nonradioactive nucleotide by incubating at 37 °C and following the increase in activity continuously in the linked enzyme assay. We have previously shown that rate of release of trapped MgADP or reactivation of ATPase is not affected by presence of verapamil or MgATP in the medium. Protein Determination—Accurate Pgp concentration was calculated by reference to a standard pure wild-type preparation, which had been subjected to amino acid analysis. A range of amounts of pure wild-type or mutant proteins were run on 10% SDS-gels alongside this reference standard, stained with Coomassie Blue, and scanned. (The DTT concentration in the denaturing buffer was increased 4-fold to minimize presence of disulfide cross-linked Pgp, Ref. 33Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M.E.

For rapid analysis during purification of Pgp the Bradford assay was used with bovine serum albumin as standard normalized to the reference Pgp standard. Photolabeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP—Activated Pgp was passed through a centrifuge column (above) then 2.5-μg samples were incubated with indicated concentrations of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP with 1 mm MgSO4 and 150 μm verapamil in a 50-μl volume for 5 min on ice. Next, samples were irradiated for 5 min on ice at a distance of 1 cm with a short wave (254 nm) UV lamp (model UVG-11 Mineralight lamp; Ultraviolet Products; San Gabriel, CA). They were then dissolved in SDS-gel denaturing buffer and applied to SDS-gels. Routine Procedures—When present verapamil concentration was 150 μm, added in Me2SO4 (final solvent concentration < 2% v/v). Samples without drug had Me2SO4 alone. SDS gel electrophoresis on 10% gels was done as previously described (10Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25031-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Materials—NaADP was from Sigma (cat. A-2754). [8-14C]ADP and [α-32P]ATP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. E. coli lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids. 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was from Affinity Labeling Technologies. Acid-washed charcoal was from Sigma (cat. C-5510). General—To investigate the role(s) of the conserved Ser residues in the ABC signature sequences of NBD1 and NBD2 of mouse MDR3 P-glycoprotein (Ser528 and Ser1173) we mutated each to Ala, and then expressed the two single mutant (S528A and S1173A) and the double mutant protein (S528A/S1173A) in P. pastoris (25Beaudet L. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Proteins were obtained in high purity (>95%) from microsomes by a previously established procedure involving detergent solubilzation, Ni-chelate chromatography, and passage through an anion exchange column (23Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.U. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Yields of mutant proteins were the same as for wild-type mouse MDR3 Pgp. Fig. 1 shows the pure mutant proteins on SDS-gels. In order to ensure that the mutant proteins assumed a properly folded native conformation we performed a photolabeling experiment with increasing concentrations of 8-azido-[α-32P]-MgATP, shown in Fig. 2. The data show that all three mutant proteins did bind and covalently react with 8-azido-MgATP to approximately the same extent as wild type. Our previous work has shown that 8-azido-MgATP is a good analog of MgATP for hydrolysis at Pgp catalytic sites (34Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8986-8992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Covalent labeling of mutant Pgp by Mg-8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. Wild-type and mutant Pgp were incubated with increasing concentrations of Mg-8-azido-[α-32P]ATP as shown, subjected to UV illumination, and run on SDS gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure that equal amounts of wild-type and mutant proteins were run on the gel then dried and subjected to autoradiography.

As shown in Table I, and in confirmation of much earlier work, wild-type Pgp ATPase activity was strongly stimulated by verapamil and the Km (MgATP) measured here was 0.34 mm. Specific ATPase activities of S528A and S1173A Pgp were both 74% of wild-type activity in presence of verapamil (Table I). ATPase of both mutant proteins was stimulated by verapamil, and respective Km (MgATP) values were 0.30 and 0.25 mm. MgADP is a competitive inhibitor of Pgp ATPase activity (35Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1995; 27: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We carried out assays to determine Ki (MgADP) values for the mutant proteins (see Fig. 3) and, as Table I shows, the resultant Ki values for S528A and S1173A mutants (0.11 and 0.12 mm) were not significantly different from wild type (0.15 mm).Table IATPase activity, Km(MgATP) values, and Ki(MgADP) values for wild-type, S528A, S1173A, and S528A/S1173A mutant PgpPgpATPase without added drugaATPase activities were determined at 37°C by the linked enzyme assay and malachite green assays (wild-type, S528A, S1173A) or the charcoal adsorption assay (S528A/S1173A).

Open table in a new tab When we assayed the double mutant (S528A/S1173A) Pgp it was immediately apparent that the specific ATPase activity was very low and that a very sensitive assay would be required, therefore we used radioactive ATP (γ -32P-labeled) and the charcoal adsorption assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 4 shows the data for evaluation of specific activity and Km (MgATP). As the upper panel (Fig. 4A) shows, the reaction was linear with time and the activity was strongly increased by verapamil. Specific ATPase activity of the double mutant in presence of verapamil was only 3.6% of wild type (Table I). Km (MgATP) in the double mutant had risen to 0.80 mm (Fig. 4B and Table I). Therefore kcat/Km was reduced to 2.0 × 102m–1 s–1 in the double mutant compared with 1.3 × 104m–1 s–1 in wild type, a 100-fold reduction. Ki (M-gADP) rose slightly to 0.24 mm in the double mutant (Fig. 3C and Table I). Because for technical reasons the maximal MgATP concentration that could be used was 3 mm, the Km (MgATP) of the double mutant enzyme might be somewhat underestimated. Summarizing the ATPase data, each single mutation impaired ATPase activity mildly, without affecting apparent affinity for either MgATP or MgADP, and without affecting functional communication between the NBDs and the drug (verapamil) binding sites. In striking contrast, when the single mutations were combined to generate the double mutant, a remarkable synergy between them emerged. ATPase activity was now strongly impaired. Apparent affinity for MgATP was decreased somewhat, as indicated by increased Km (MgATP) but functional communication between the drug binding sites and the NBDs was preserved. Use of Vanadate to Examine Effects of the Ser to Ala Mutations—Vanadate (Vi) inhibits many ATPase enzymes by forming a tenaciously-bound complex with MgADP in the catalytic site(s) that resembles the pentacovalent phosphorus of the chemical transition state. Examples such as the inhibited state of myosin (36Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and a natural pentacovalent phosphorus transition state (37Lahiri S.D. Zhang G. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Science. 2003; 299: 2067-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) have been documented by x-ray crystallography. In Pgp, Vi inhibits ATPase activity potently by trapping MgADP tenaciously at a stoichiometry of one mol/mol Pgp, and it was mainly the early work with Vi (29Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J.

https://openalex.org/W2124100794,"The pol (for polymerase) gene of the murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) is expressed in the form of a large Gag-Pol precursor protein by the suppression of translational termination, or enhanced readthrough, of a UAG stop codon at the end of gag. A search for cellular proteins that interact with the reverse transcriptase of Moloney MuLV resulted in the identification of eRF1, the eukaryotic translation release factor 1. The proteins bound strongly in vitro, and the overexpression of eRF1 resulted in the RT-dependent incorporation of the protein into assembling virion particles. The overexpression of RT in trans enhanced the translational readthrough of a reporter construct containing the Gag-Pol boundary region. Noninteracting mutants of RT failed to synthesize adequate levels of Gag-Pol and could not replicate. These results suggest that RT enhances suppression of termination and that the interaction of RT with eRF1 is required for an appropriate level of translational readthrough."

In this study, we have identified S100A1, but not calmodulin or other S100 proteins, as a potent molecular chaperone and a new member of the multichaperone complex. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated the formation of stable complexes between S100A1 and Hsp90, Hsp70, FKBP52, and CyP40 both in vitro and in mammalian cells. S100A1 potently protected citrate synthase, aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and rhodanese from heat-induced aggregation and suppressed the aggregation of chemically denatured rhodanese and citrate synthase during the refolding pathway. In addition, S100A1 suppressed the heat-induced inactivation of citrate synthase activity, similar to that for Hsp90 and p23. The chaperone activity of S100A1 was antagonized by calmodulin antagonists, such as fluphenazine and prenylamine, that is, indeed an intrinsic function of the protein.

Hsp90 alone can act to prevent protein aggregation and promote refolding in vitro, but in vivo it operates as part of the multichaperone machinery in the cytosol, which includes Hsp70, peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, and other cochaperone proteins (2Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Several Hsp90-associated cochaperones contain multiple copies of the tetratricopeptide repeat motif that mediates protein-protein interactions in diverse cellular pathways (3Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The tetratricopeptide repeat domains of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases such as FKBP52, CyP40, and phosphoprotein phosphatase 5 mediate the binding of these proteins to Hsp90 (4Radanyi C. Chambraud B.

Ca2+ signal plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular responses including cell metabolism, cytoskeletal dynamics, cell cycle, gene expression, neurotransmission, and intracellular signal transduction processes (11Bennett M.K.

The signal-induced change in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration has been portrayed as a switch through a class of Ca2+-binding proteins (13Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Over the years, many Ca2+-binding proteins have been identified, reflecting the biological importance of Ca2+ and its regulative function in the cell. Among such proteins, it is well known that calmodulin (CaM) is involved in many aspects of the Ca2+ regulating system in various cell types (14Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Although several reports indicate that CaM binds to Hsp90 (15Minami Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K.

The overlapping specificity of CaM and S100 proteins for the interaction with target proteins has been reported (19Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). It has also been known that CaM and S100 proteins can have differential effects on a common target protein (20Heierhorst J.

To establish whether CaM or S100 proteins exhibited properties of molecular chaperones, we examined their interaction with the components of the chaperone complex and activities in the refolding of substrate proteins in vivo and in vitro. In the present report, we have identified S100A1 to be a potent molecular chaperone and a new member of the multichaperone complex. Materials—Fluphenazine (4-[3-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-10H-phenothiazin-10-yl]propyl]-1-piperazineethanol) and prenylamine (N-(1-methyl-2-phenylethyl)-γ-phenylbenzenepropanamine) were purchased from Wako.

CS and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were obtained from Roche Diagnostics and rhodanese and aldolase from Sigma. Anti-Hsp90 monoclonal antibody (AC88) and anti-Hsp40 polyclonal antibody were purchased from StressGen Biotech. Anti-Hsp70 polyclonal antibody, anti-FKBP52 polyclonal antibody, and anti-CyP40 (C-terminal) polyclonal antibody were purchased from Medical and Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and BIOMOL Research Labs, respectively. Anti-S100A1 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from QED Bioscience and Dako Cytomation.

Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased form Amersham Biosciences. Anti-sheep and anti-goat peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Southern Biotechnology and Chemicon International, respectively. The β-galactosidase expressing plasmid pMH-LacZ6 was obtained from Roche Diagnostics and the luciferase-expressing plasmid pGL3-Promoter vector from Promega. Bovine brain Hsp90, Hsp70, and CaM were purified as described previously (22Itoh H. Toyoshima I. Mizunuma H. Kobayashi R. Tashima Y. Arch. Biochem.

Expression and Purification of S100 Proteins, Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-truncated Hsp90, GST-truncated Hsp70, GST-FKBP52, Wild-type FKBP52, GST-CyP40, and Wild-type CyP40 —S100A1 was expressed and purified as described previously (24Okada M. Tokumitsu H. Kubota Y. Kobayashi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression plasmids for the production of other S100 proteins were prepared by PCR using bovine brain and the human lung cDNA library (Clontech) as templates and specific primers. PCR products were subcloned into pET11a vector (Novagen). S100 proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) and purified by Q-Sepharose followed by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography (25Yamashita K. Oyama Y. Shishibori T. Matsushita O. Okabe A. Kobayashi R. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Truncated Hsp90-(237–628) and truncated Hsp70-(1–382) were prepared by PCR using human Hsp90α and Hsp70 cDNAs (kindly provided by Dr. Kazunari Yokoyama, Department of Biological Systems, Gene Engineering Division, RIKEN Tsukuba Institute Bioresource Center) as templates and specific primers. Human FKBP52 and bovine CyP40 were prepared by PCR using human testis and bovine brain cDNA library (Clontech) as templates and specific primers. PCR products were subcloned into pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some case, GST was removed from fusion proteins by thrombin digestion. The GST-FKBP52 or GST-CyP40 containing fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Then the GST fusion proteins were incubated with 50 units of thrombin/mg of protein at 37 °C for 3 h. To separate the FKBP52 and CyP40 proteins from free GST, the protein samples were loaded again onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (2 ml bed volume). The flow-through fraction containing recombinant FKBP52 or CyP40 was collected. Finally, to remove residual thrombin, the flow-through fractions were applied to a benzamidine-Sepharose column (2-ml bed volume) and eluted with the same buffer. As judged from SDS-PAGE, this method yielded the FKBP52 and CyP40 proteins with greater than 95% purity. In Vitro Protein Binding Studies—Ca2+-binding protein (S100 proteins or CaM: 25 μg each) and GST fusion protein (25 μg each) were mixed in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m KCl). The reaction mixtures in a total volume of 150 μl were incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min at 25 °C. After pelleting by microcentrifugation, the gels were subjected to replicate washes (4 × 1 ml), boiled in SDS sample buffer, and examined for protein retention by SDS-PAGE. Estimation of equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was performed by incubating a fixed concentration of GST-truncated Hsp90 (7.18 μm), GST-truncated Hsp70 (1.99 μm), GST-FKBP52 (1.08 μm), GST-CyP40 (1.26 μm) beads or, alternatively, GST beads alone (3.2 μm) with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant S100A1 (0–109.44 μm) in 150 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 with 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA. The beads were washed 4 times with the buffer and then eluted and used for gel electrophoresis. Coomassie-stained gels were scanned by an image analyzer (LAS-100plus; Fuji Film), and arbitrary densitometric values for S100A1 bound to GST-truncated Hsp90, GST-truncated Hsp70, GST-FKBP52, or GST-CyP40 were obtained. These values were converted to micromolar equivalents by normalizing them against the value for 2 μg of S100A1 run on the same gel. To obtain the values for free S100A1, the amount of bound protein was subtracted from the initial amount added to the samples. KD was calculated by Scatchard plot analysis of bound and free levels of S100A1. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Antibody resin was prepared by incubating anti-Hsp90, anti-Hsp70, anti-FKBP52, or anti-CyP40 antibody (1 μg each) with a slurry of Protein G-Sepharose (20 μl) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 25 °C. The antibody-conjugated resins were washed three times in an incubation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.1 m KCl with 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA). The resins (20 μl) were suspended in 60 μl of the incubation buffer and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with purified Hsp90, purified Hsp70, recombinant FKBP52, and recombinant CyP40 proteins (2 μg each). After washing with the incubation buffer, the resin (20 μl) was individually incubated in 60 μl of the incubation buffer containing 20 μg of recombinant S100A1 for 3 h at 25 °C and washed three times with the incubation buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for S100A1, Hsp90, Hsp70, FKBP52, or CyP40. Binding of anti-sheep and anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blotting was made visible by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-S100A1 antibody-coupled resin were performed as described above except anti-S100 antibody and recombinant S100A1 were used for the first step and then the S100A1-coupled resin was incubated with Hsp90, Hsp70, FKBP52, or CyP40. Bovine brain (1 g) was homogenized in 5 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride with 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA and was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The extract (100 μl) was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with 1 μg of anti-Hsp90 antibody (AC88), anti-Hsp70 antibody, anti-FKBP52 antibody, or anti-CyP40 antibody. Protein G-Sepharose (20 μl) was added to the sample, which was then rotated for 3 h. Sepharose beads were washed 4 times and processed for SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies specific for S100A1, Hsp90, Hsp70, FKBP52, CyP40, or CaM (a gift from Dr. Yasuo Watanabe, Kagawa University Faculty of Medicine). Where noted, the brain extracts (100 μl) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of the anti-S100A1 antibody and Protein G-Sepharose as described above. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with the respective antibodies as indicated. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—BIAcore 2000, CM5 chip, N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide, and ethanolamine-HCl (Biacore, Inc.) were used for amine coupling of S100A1 to the dextran surface of the CM5 chip. Recombinant S100A1 (100 μg/ml, 140 μl) was immobilized in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.2, until 2600 response units (0.3 pmol) were bound and a stable base line was obtained. For all procedures, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20 with 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA were used at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Purified Hsp90, purified Hsp70, recombinant FKBP52, and recombinant CyP40 were injected at various concentrations (50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 nm). S100A1-coupled sensor chip was regenerated between protein injections with a brief (60-s) wash with 2 m NaCl followed with 0.5% SDS, 5% Nonidet P-40 until the response unit base line returned to its pre-injection level. Response curves were prepared for fitting by subtraction of the signal generated simultaneously on the control flow cell. Biacore sensorgram curves were evaluated in BIAevaluation 3.0 using numerical integration algorithms. Thermal-induced Aggregation of CS, Aldolase, GAPDH, and Rhodanese—The effects of S100 proteins and CaM on the thermal aggregation of mitochondrial CS at 43 °C were monitored as described previously (26Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To monitor thermal aggregation, the CS concentration used was 0.19 μm in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of S100 proteins and CaM. Light scattering of CS was monitored over 20 min at an optical density of 500 nm in a Amersham Biosciences Ultrospec 3000 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature control unit using semi-microcuvettes (1 ml) with a path length of 10 mm. The thermal-induced aggregation of aldolase, GAPDH, and rhodanese was performed according to the established protocols (27Kim T.D. Paik S.R. Yang C.H. Kim J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2489-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Protein solutions (3 μm each) with or without S100A1 (5 μm) were mixed at room temperature and then heated at 65 °C for 5 min in a thermal cycler. The light scattering of the solution at 488 or 360 nm was measured in a spectrophotometer (model UV-1600; Shimadzu). Thermal Inactivation and Reactivation of CS—CS (1.9 μm) was incubated in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at 43 °C in the presence of S100A1 or bovine serum albumin. Through incubation, aliquots were withdrawn at intervals of 2–10 min, and the enzyme activity was determined as described (26Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To initiate reactivation of CS, 100 mm oxaloacetic acid (OAA) (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm EDTA) was diluted 1:100 into the incubation mixture, to a final concentration of 1 mm. After starting the reactivation reaction, incubation was continued at 43 °C (Fig. 7B) or the temperature was lowered to 25 °C (Fig. 7C). Rhodanese and CS Aggregation Assays—The ability of CaM and S100 proteins to inhibit rhodanese and CS aggregation was assayed essentially as described previously (28Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). CaM and S100 proteins were equilibrated for 5 min at 25 °C in 95 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. After adding 5 μl of 37.5 μm rhodanese or 35.6 μm CS in 6 m guanidine-HCl and 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, the rate of the aggregation of these proteins was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 320 nm. Aggregation was essentially completed after 15 min. Effects of fluphenazine and prenylamine on the chaperone activity of S100A1 were measured by the CS aggregation assay as described above. Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase II (CaM KII) Assay—Rat CaM KII holoenzyme was purified from rat forebrain as described previously (30Tokumitsu H. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mizutani A. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4315-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM KII was incubated with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μm syntide-2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm CaM in the presence or absence of fluphenazine and prenylamine. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6500 cpm/pmol) (Amersham Biosciences) and terminated by spotting aliquots (15 μl) onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman, P-81) followed by washing with 75 mm phosphoric acid. Phosphate incorporation into syntide-2 was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting of the filters. CaM KII activity was measured for 5 min at 30 °C under the linear condition. Cloning of pME18S-S100A1, Cell Culture, Transfection, Heat Shock, and Cell Lysis—The S100A1-expressing plasmid pME18S-S100A1 was prepared by PCR using pET11a-S100A1 as a template (24Okada M. Tokumitsu H. Kubota Y. Kobayashi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and SpeI and subcloned into the EcoRI and SpeI sites in pME18S (DNAX Research Institute, Inc). COS-7 monkey fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences). 2 × 105 cells were seeded in a 60-mm culture dish and grown until 90% confluent. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid pMH-LacZ6 (Roche Diagnostics) with 2.5 or 5 μg of either empty vector or pME18S-S100A1. In some case, cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of the luciferase-expressing plasmid pGL3-Promoter (Promega) with 2.5 μg of either empty vector or pME18S-S100A1. Transient transfections were performed by using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). In co-transfection experiments, the total amount of plasmid DNA was kept constant by the addition of pME18S. After 2 days of transfection, the dishes were sealed with parafilm and heat shocked at the appropriate temperatures in an incubator. Immediately after heat treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of 25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. β-Galactosidase and Luciferase Assays—β-Galactosidase assays were performed in triplicate samples using the β-Galactosidase Reporter Gene Assay, chemiluminescent kit (Roche Diagnostics). β-Galactosidase activity was measured for 20 s with Luminoskan (Labsystems) with a 100:2.5-μl ratio mixture of the β-galactosidase assay reagents and cell lysate. Luciferase assays were performed in triplicate samples using the luciferase assay kit (PicaGene LT7.5 Luminescence kit; Toyo Inki Co., Japan). The intensity of light emission from the assay was determined for 20 s with Luminoskan with a 100:50-μl ratio mixture of the luciferase assay reagents and cell lysate. S100A1 but Not CaM Interacts with Hsp90, Hsp70, FKBP52, and CyP40 in Vitro—Previous studies have provided evidence that CaM-binding motifs are localized in: the middle domain of Hsp90 (500KDQVANSAFVERLRKHGLEVI520); N-terminal half of Hsp70 (257KRAVRRLRTACERAKRTLSSS277); and C-terminal domains of FKBP52 (399RIRRQLAREKKLYANMF415) and CyP40 (353KIKAQKDKEKAAYAKMFA370) (15Minami Y.

Truncated Hsp90-(237–628), truncated Hsp70-(1–382), full-length FKBP52, and full-length CyP40 were expressed as fusion proteins with GST. Selective adsorption of the GST fusion proteins onto glutathione-Sepharose allowed the resin to be used in affinity chromatography to screen for proteins, which would target the chaperone and cochaperone proteins. We performed in vitro binding assays using GST-truncated Hsp90, GST-truncated Hsp70, GST-FKBP52, and GST-CyP40 fusion proteins to confirm the interactions between CaM and the chaperone and cochaperone proteins described in previous reports (15Minami Y.

Commun. 1995; 209: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and exclude the possibility that these interactions were indirect or nonspecific. We also analyzed binding of S100 proteins to the chaperone and cochaperone proteins, because the binding properties of CaM and S100 proteins often overlap (19Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, S100A1, but not CaM or other S100 proteins, exclusively bound to GST-truncated Hsp90, GST-truncated Hsp70, GST-FKBP52, and GST-CyP40 in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1, B--E). Some other S100 proteins, such as S100B, S100A2, S100A4, and S100A6 were also bound weakly to GST-truncated Hsp90 (Fig. 1B). Previous biochemical studies have identified many potential S100 target enzymes such as glycogen phosphorylase (31Zimmer D.B. Dubuisson J.G. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), twitchin kinase (20Heierhorst J. Kobe B. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. Benians G.M. Weiss K.R. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1996; 380: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), aldolase (32Zimmer D.B. van Eldik L.J. J. Biol.

Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), phosphoglucomutase (33Landar A. Caddell G. Chessher J. Zimmer D.B. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and GAPDH (34Filipek A. Wojda U. Lesniak W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), some exhibiting Ca2+-dependent whereas others Ca2+-independent modulation. Next, we examined the effects of Ca2+ on the binding of S100A1 to the chaperone and cochaperone proteins. Neither Ca2+ nor EGTA influenced the affinity of S100A1 for Hsp70, FKBP52, and CyP40 (Fig. 2A, 2–4). Although S100A1 tightly bound to GST-truncated Hsp90 in the presence of Ca2+, S100A1 binding to the protein was only slightly reduced in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2A, 1). Although, CaM did not interact with GST-truncated Hsp90, GST-truncated Hsp70, GST-FKBP52, and GST-CyP40 in this assay, wild-type Hsp90, Hsp70, FKBP52, and CyP40 bound weakly to CaM-Sepharose in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). All Ca2+-binding proteins studied did not interact with GST either in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that S100A1 exclusively interacts with the chaperone and cochaperone proteins in a Ca2+-independent fashion. We next sought to quantify the binding affinity between S100A1 and the chaperone and cochaperone proteins in vitro using the GST pull-down method followed by Scatchard analysis of binding data. GST-truncated Hsp90, GST-truncated Hsp70, GST-FKBP52, or GST-CyP40 were incubated with a logarithmic range of concentrations of recombinant S100A1 protein. Bound protein amounts were measured by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometric analysis. In Fig. 2B, 1, the Scatchard analysis of S100A1 binding to GST-truncated Hsp90, in the presence of Ca2+, indicates two"
https://openalex.org/W2086011570,"The restriction of immunoglobulin variable region promoter activity to B lymphocytes is a well known paradigm of promoter specificity. Recently, a cis-element, located downstream of the transcription initiation site of murine heavy chain variable promoters, was shown to be critical for B cell activity and specificity. Here we show that mutation of this element, termed DICE (Downstream Immunoglobulin Control Element), reduces in vivo activity in B cells. Gel mobility shift assays show that DICE forms B cell-specific complexes that were also sensitive to DICE mutation. DICE mutation strongly reduces the ability of a distal immunoglobulin heavy chain intronic enhancer to stimulate transcription. We also identify a DICE-interacting factor: a TFII-I-related protein known as BEN (also termed Mus-TRD1 and WBSCR11). Dominant-negative and RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments indicate that BEN can both positively and negatively regulate IgH promoter activity, depending on the cell line.

During development, an organism must exclusively express some genes in particular tissues or cell types. A number of genes and their promoters have been studied in detail in order to obtain general principles from their mechanism of regulation. Among the most intensely studied are the immunoglobulin variable (V) 1The abbreviations used are: VVH and V1/2, variable, heavy, and κ chainJjoiningDdiversityDICEDownstream Immunoglobulin Control ElementEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayMALDITOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometryGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseppmparts per millionEGFepidermal growth factorsiRNAsmall interfering RNAHIVhuman immunodeficiency virus.1The abbreviations used are: VVH and V1/2, variable, heavy, and κ chainJjoiningDdiversityDICEDownstream Immunoglobulin Control ElementEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayMALDITOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometryGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseppmparts per millionEGFepidermal growth factorsiRNAsmall interfering RNAHIVhuman immunodeficiency virus. region promoters. Ig heavy chain (IgH) and κ light chain (Igκ) genes are selectively expressed in B lymphocytes, and their respective V region (VH and Vκ) promoters are normally inactive in all other tissues (reviewed in Ref. 1Henderson A. Calame K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 163-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The IgH and Igκ loci are sequentially activated during B lymphocyte maturation. Activation includes three principal events. Transcription initiates at various positions within each locus, including the VH and Vκ promoters (2Lennon G.G. Perry R.P. Nature. 1985; 318: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Yancopoulos G.D. Alt F.W. Cell. 1985; 40: 271-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Recombination of a V region gene segment with a joining (J) gene segment, in the case of the κ chain, and a diversity (D) and J segment, in the case of the heavy chain, forms an Ig variable region exon of a given specificity (4Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3099) Google Scholar). Hyperacetylation of chromatin within the Ig loci also makes it less compact and more accessible to trans-acting factors (5Kwon J. Morshead K.B. Guyon J.R. Kingston R.E. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1037-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 6Stanhope-Baker P. Hudson K.M. Shaffer A.L. Constantinescu A. Schlissel M.S. Cell. 1996; 85: 887-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The relative timing of these three events is unclear; however, it has been shown that non-coding (germ line) transcription precedes recombination for some VH segments (3Yancopoulos G.D. Alt F.W. Cell. 1985; 40: 271-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 7Corcoran A.E. Riddell A. Krooshoop D. Venkitaraman A.R. Nature. 1998; 391: 904-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The direct relationship between these events is also unclear; however, in the heavy chain locus, V-DJ recombination brings a downstream intronic enhancer into proximity with the VH promoter. The relocation of the enhancer greatly stimulates expression of the recombined IgH (reviewed in Ref. 8Henderson A.J. Calame K.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 255-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These multiple interdependent layers of regulation serve to tightly control Ig expression and prevent activation outside of the normal B cell maturation pathway.

Studies from a number of laboratories have determined that in isolation, VH and Vκ promoters are preferentially active in B lymphocytes (9Mason J.O. Williams G.T. Neuberger M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 479-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Bergman Y. Rice D. Grosschedl R. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7041-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A feature of most VH and Vκ promoters is the octamer motif (5′-ATGCAAAT-3′), located 10-25 nucleotides upstream of the TATA box (and inverted in the case of Vκ) (9Mason J.O. Williams G.T. Neuberger M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 479-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Parslow T.G. Blair D.L. Murphy W.J. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). By using model constructs, the octamer motif appears to be a mediator of Ig promoter B cell specificity (15Wirth T. Staudt L. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 329: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); however, the same sequence occurs in numerous other genes, most of which are not B cell-specific. For example, the U1 small nuclear RNA and histone H2B genes both contain functional octamer sequences and are ubiquitously expressed (16Murphy J.T. Burgess R.R. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Cell. 1982; 29: 265-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Sive H.L. Heintz N. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17603-17610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the contribution of the octamer toward B cell specificity is dictated by other determinants within the promoter, otherwise octamer-containing genes such as U1 and H2B would also be expressed in a B cell-specific manner. In B cells, the octamer motif interacts with two POU domain transcription factors termed Oct-1 and Oct-2. Oct-1 (19Staudt L.M. Singh H. Sen R. Wirth T. Sharp P.A. Baltimore D.

Genetic analyses have shown that Oct-2 is dispensable for B cell development and Ig transcription (24Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J. Ye Z.S. Jacks T. Baltimore D.

Chen, and P. A. Sharp, submitted. A co-activator of Oct-1 and Oct-2, principally expressed in B cells, has also been described (26Luo Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

This protein, termed OCA-B/Bob-1/OBF-1, is also dispensable for Ig gene expression (29Kim U. Qin X.F. Gong S. Stevens S. Luo Y. Nussensweig M. Roeder R.G.

Nature. 1996; 383: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that a widespread DNA sequence, located downstream of the transcription initiation site, is an important determinant of IgH promoter activity and B lymphoid selectivity (32Tantin D.

Here we further characterize the properties of this element (termed DICE), and we show that DICE can interact with a protein known as BEN/MusTRD1. The prototypic member of this family, TFII-I (also known as BAP-135), can also bind DICE with high affinity in vitro. Surprisingly, dominant-negative and RNAi knockdown experiments reveal negative as well as positive roles for BEN. We also report that DICE helps mediate the activity of the IgH intronic enhancer, as mutation of the DICE sequence reduces enhancer activity. Plasmid Constructs—The DICE sequences from the 186.2 promoter GenBank™ accession number J00530 were used in these experiments. The plasmid pGL3IgH-154+1 chim has been described (32Tantin D. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1460-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The corresponding point mutated plasmids were made by introducing mutated 186.2 DICE sequences into the plasmid pGL3IgH-154+1 that had been digested with HindIII and treated with alkaline phosphatase. Complimentary oligonucleotides with HindIII overhangs and phosphate groups at their 5′ ends were annealed and ligated into the digested pGL3IgH+1 plasmid, yielding the plasmids pGL3VH17.2.25/mut1 chimera and pGL3VH17.2.25/186.2mut2 chimera. The 4 oligonucleotides used are shown 5′ to 3′ as follows: Hin186.2mut1 TOP, AGCTTGATCATCGGGATCTTTACAGTTAGGAAGCACACAGGA; Hin186.2mut1BOT, AGCTTCCTGTGTGCTTCCTAACTGTAAAGATCCCAGTGATCA; Hin186.2mut2TOP, AGCTTGATCACTGTTCTCTTTTTTGTTACTGAGCACTTTGGA; and Hin186.2mut2BOT, AGCTTCCAAAGTGCTCAGTAAAAAAAAGAGAACAGTGATCA. The boldface sequence indicates the positions of the mutations. Orientation and sequence were verified by DNA sequencing. The IgH intronic enhancer was introduced into a distal XbaI site using the method described (32Tantin D. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1460-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The orientation of the enhancer was checked using the asymmetric BamHI site. All constructs used the same orientation. For siRNA knockdown of BEN, an siRNA (siRNA 2) that recognizes nucleotides 1244-1265 of the β isoform of mouse BEN (relative to the start codon) was used. These residues are in exon 9 and correspond to amino acids 414-422, within the second helix-loop-helix repeat of the protein. The sequence of the transcribed and cleaved siRNA is predicted to be CGACACAGCAUUCACUUCAUU. Cell Culture and Transfections—Cell lines were cultured, and transfections were performed using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described (32Tantin D. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1460-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRL-TK (Promega), containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter, was used as an internal transfection control. Activity was scored by the dual luciferase assay (Promega). Nuclear Extract—B cell nuclear extracts were prepared from cells growing in suspension in 8-liter batches according to the method of Dignam et al. (33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). 3T3 extracts were prepared from batches of 16 15-cm plates. EMSA—The double-stranded oligonucleotides described above were also used as probes in gel mobility shift assays. The HindIII overhangs were filled in with Klenow fragment using radiolabeled [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dTTP. All probes were gel-purified. Gel mobility shift experiments were performed as described (34Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 20-μl binding reactions were assembled on ice and contained 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6× binding buffer (1× binding buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol), either 400 ng of poly(dA·dT) or 700 ng of poly(dI·dC), ∼200 cpm (∼10 μmol) of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe, and the indicated amount of nuclear extract or purified protein. Subsequent to the addition of labeled probe, the samples were placed at room temperature for 20 min, after which 10 μl of sample were electrophoresed through a 0.75-mm thick 5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide: bis-acrylamide) containing 1% glycerol and 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) for 2.5 h at room temperature at 100 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager from Amersham Biosciences and visualized using imaging software provided by the vendor. Latex Microspheres and Mass Spectroscopy—DNA-coated latex beads were obtained from the laboratory of Hiroshi Handa (Frontier Collaborative Research Center, Japan). The methods for coupling the beads with DNA have been described (35Handa H. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Millner P. High Resolution Chromatography: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 283-302Google Scholar). BEN was purified and identified from a 70Z/3 nuclear extract as follows: 250 μg of nuclear extract were incubated in a 1.7-ml Eppendorf tube with 17.5 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 10 μl of packed beads in a final volume of 500 μl containing 16 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 16% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature, after which the mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the beads. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were sequentially washed in buffer containing 200, 300, and 300 mm KCl. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated to 90 °C for 2 min, and 10 μl were electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following silver staining and excision of the bands of interest, the silver grains were removed by treatment with 15 mm potassium ferricyanide and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate. The gel slice was digested with trypsin in 25 mm NH4HCO3 overnight (36Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 37Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7735) Google Scholar). Peptides were eluted with two extractions of CH3CN and combined. The tryptic peptides were dried, reconstituted with 8 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, desalted on a C18 Zip Tip (Millipore), and eluted with 4 μl of 50% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate was dried and reconstituted in 1 μl of re-crystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix, and 0.5 μl was applied to separate matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF; Applied Biosystems model Voyager DESTR). Samples were analyzed in reflector mode, and the resulting spectra were screened against the NCBI data base (released June 6, 2002) using the Protein Prospector search engine (University of California, San Francisco). Purification of BEN, BEN L38/45P, and TFII-I—10 μg of plasmids encoding His6 and GST-tagged recombinant human BEN and TFII-I were transiently transfected into 293T cells. Parallel transfections with the green fluorescent protein under the control of a constitutive mammalian promoter showed a transfection efficiency of greater than 90%. The proteins were purified as described (38Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—40 h post-transfection, COS7 cells were harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing antiprotease mixture without EDTA (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 250 μg of the lysate was used with the anti-GFP IP and 800 μg with the anti-TFII-I immunoprecipitation. The lysates were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h of rocking at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were then washed three times in 1 ml of lysis buffer lacking the Nonidet P-40 detergent. The beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 2 min, and Western-blotted using antibodies to GFP GST-2 (Sigma) and GFP JL-8 (Clontech). The proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Characteristics of DICE—In transient transfection experiments, luciferase reporter constructs containing VH promoters are preferentially expressed in B cell lines. Promoter deletion and mutagenesis of the murine 7183 family 17.2.25 promoter revealed a DNA sequence downstream of the transcription initiation site that was critical for the high promoter activity in B cells. A Gibbs motif sampler (39Lawrence C.E. Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Liu J.S. Neuwald A.F. Wootton J.C. Science. 1993; 262: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar) was used to show that this element is a feature of most VH and some Vκ downstream promoter regions (32Tantin D. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1460-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here we term this element DICE for Downstream Immunoglobulin Control Element. DICE is composed of a 5′ end rich in pyrimidine residues and a 3′ end with a strong preference for ACAG. Interestingly, the best DICE matches were found in J558-class promoters, the most distal VH family with the most intrinsically active promoters. For example, the J558-class VH186.2 (B1-8) core promoter region contains three consensus sequences, two of which are downstream of the transcription initiation site. The first of these downstream sites is a perfect match (Fig. 1A). Searching the eukaryotic promoter data base (residues -499 to +100 relative to the transcription initiation site) for DICE did not reveal any strong non-immunoglobulin matches to the consensus (not shown). Deletion of DICE from the VH17.2.25 promoter results in a significant loss of promoter activity, which can be restored by introducing the downstream sequences from the VH186.2 promoter (32Tantin D. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1460-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To extend and expand upon these results, point mutations were introduced into the VH186.2 DICE consensus sequences. These mutant sequences were placed into the VH17.2.25 promoter and tested by transient transfection. In parallel, the same sequences were radiolabeled and used in EMSA to determine whether sequence- and B cell-specific nucleoprotein complexes could be identified. Fig. 1A shows the two DICE mutations used. Mutant 1 changes residues 3-5 in the 5′ end of the consensus to GGA, whereas mutant 2 changes residues 11-13 in the 3′ end to TTT. Fig. 1B depicts the averaged results from three parallel transfections by using the human B cell line BJA-B. Insertion of VH17.2.25 promoter DNA (residues -154 to +35 relative to the transcription initiation site) into the backbone vector pGL3 strongly increases reporter expression. Removal of sequences downstream of the transcription initiation site from +2 to +35 resulted in significant downregulation of promoter activity. As reported previously, replacing these residues with the corresponding sequences from the VH 186.2 promoter (IgH chimera) restores activity and results in a significant increase in activity over wild-type levels. This increase in activity may be explained by the fact that the VH186.2 downstream region contains two DICE sequences, one of which is a better match to the consensus than the DICE sequence present in 17.2.25. When mutant sequences replaced the wild-type DICE, promoter activity was reduced. In the case of mutant 1, promoter activity was markedly attenuated and approximated the activity of a construct containing no downstream promoter residues. Mutant 2 was less severe. In the gel mobility shift experiment shown in Fig. 1C, DNA segments containing the wild-type and point-mutated 186.2 residues were labeled and incubated with fibroblast (3T3) or BJA-B B cell nuclear extracts. The 3T3 extracts formed limited complexes with the 186.2 DICE sequence, which were unaffected by point mutation (lanes 2 and 3, 7 and 8, and 12 and 13). B cell extracts formed more robust nucleoprotein complexes (lanes 4 and 5) composed of two bands: a major slower mobility band (asterisk) and a minor band of faster mobility (arrow). The major band was strongly reduced with mutant 1 (lanes 9 and 10), whereas the minor band was ablated using mutant 2 (lanes 14 and 15). Similar results were obtained with extracts from murine 70Z/3 B cells (not shown). Therefore, the severity of the mutations for gene expression in vivo mirrors the degree to which complex formation is impaired with B cell extracts in vitro. The presence of two bands that can be independently affected by point mutation also suggests that DICE is composed of at least two binding sites. The complex formation observed with DICE also is highly non-linear, as a 2-fold increase in protein concentration yields a much more than linear increase in intensity (compare lanes 4 and 5). The complex could be efficiently competed by a 20-fold excess of unlabeled DNA containing the wild-type 186.2 DICE sequence, much less well using the mutant 1 DICE sequence, but not with unrelated polylinker DNA of similar length, a sequence of 24 alternating A and T residues, or single-stranded DNA (not shown). The IgH intronic enhancer is a potent B cell-specific control element (40Mercola M. Wang X.F. Olsen J. Calame K. Science. 1983; 221: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Banerji J. Olson L. Schaffner W. Cell. 1983; 33: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 42Gillies S.D. Morrison S.L. Oi V.T. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1983; 33: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) that interacts with numerous transcription factors, including those of the Oct, Ets, and helix-loop-helix families (8Henderson A.J. Calame K.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 255-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 43Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). V-DJ recombination relocates the intronic enhancer from greater than 100 kb to less than 10 kb downstream from the selected V region. From this relatively proximal location, the enhancer strongly stimulates VH promoter activity. At least one report suggests that the intronic enhancer more effectively activates VH promoters than unrelated promoters (44Garcia J.V. Bich-Thuy L.T. Stafford J. Queen C. Nature. 1986; 322: 383-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To assess the role of DICE in this promoter-enhancer interaction, the 700-bp core enhancer element was placed into an XbaI site 1.7 kb downstream of the reporter gene in plasmids containing wild-type and point mutant DICE sequences. These new constructs (termed EIgH chimera and EIgH mutant 1) were used in transient transfection assays with the BJA-B cells. As expected, addition of the intronic enhancer (EIg chimera) greatly stimulated reporter activity beyond that observed with the chimeric V promoter alone (IgH chimera; see Fig. 2). More importantly, the DICE point mutation eliminated the ability of a distal enhancer element to stimulate promoter expression, as the reporter activity from the promoter containing DICE mutant 1 (Ig mutant 1) displayed no increase in activity in the presence of the enhancer (EIg mutant 1). BEN/MusTRD1 Interacts with DICE—To isolate factors that interact with DICE, latex microspheres coupled to the wild-type VH186.2 segment (”DICE WT”) were incubated with 70Z/3 B cell nuclear extracts and carrier DNA (35Handa H. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Millner P. High Resolution Chromatography: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 283-302Google Scholar, 45Inomata Y. Kawaguchi H. Hiramoto M. Wada T. Handa H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The beads were washed with 300 mm KCl, boiled in SDS loading buffer, electrophoresed through 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and silver-stained (Fig. 3A). In repeated experiments, a number of proteins were retained on the beads containing DNA. Most of these proteins were also retained using mutant 1 DNA sequences, but the degree of binding was much lower for an ∼110-kDa band (arrow). This band was excised from the gel for further analysis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy of tryptic fragments from the ∼110-kDa protein identified 24 peptides. The Protein Prospector search engine (University of California, San Francisco) matched 11 of these peptides to a protein known as BEN/MusTRD/GTF2IRD1/WBSCR11 (46Yan X. Zhao X. Qian M. Guo N. Gong X.

Re-calibration of the mass spectroscopy peak set using the masses of two matched BEN peptides improved the average Δppm of the remaining peptides to +0.42 (not shown). A non-overlapping set of peptides from the same band matched mMutS/MSH2, a 104-kDa protein involved in mismatch repair. This match was not studied further but may partially account for the background band seen in the mutant DNA sequence lane (lane 3).Table IMALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy peptide matches to GTF2IRD1/BEN (all isoforms) Research Engine: MS-Fit; database: NCBI (release June 6, 2002).PeptideMassΔppmModificationMissed cleavagesStart-endSequence11086.4917–7.81 Cys-am0229–238DCGLHGQASK21086.4917–4.70649–657EPVLDTQER31120.5928+260692–700EQVQDLFNK41351.7306+151 PO41681–691LSRIDIANTLR51379.7190+330739–750KPCTFGSQNLER61739.8243–37Cys-am0380–395IACDPEAVEIVGIPDK71780.8977–3.11Met-Ox, 1 PO4"
https://openalex.org/W2030929642,"Comparison of the architecture around the active site of soybean β-amylase and Bacillus cereus β-amylase showed that the hydrogen bond networks (Glu380- (Lys295-Met51) and Glu380-Asn340-Glu178) in soybean β-amylase around the base catalytic residue, Glu380, seem to contribute to the lower pH optimum of soybean β-amylase. To convert the pH optimum of soybean β-amylase (pH 5.4) to that of the bacterial type enzyme (pH 6.7), three mutants of soybean β-amylase, M51T, E178Y, and N340T, were constructed such that the hydrogen bond networks were removed by site-directed mutagenesis. The kinetic analysis showed that the pH optimum of all mutants shifted dramatically to a neutral pH (range, from 5.4 to 6.0-6.6). The Km values of the mutants were almost the same as that of soybean β-amylase except in the case of M51T, while the Vmax values of all mutants were low compared with that of soybean β-amylase. The crystal structure analysis of the wild type-maltose and mutant-maltose complexes showed that the direct hydrogen bond between Glu380 and Asn340 was completely disrupted in the mutants M51T, E178Y, and N340T. In the case of M51T, the hydrogen bond between Glu380 and Lys295 was also disrupted.

In the case of B. cereus β-amylase (BCB), Glu172 and Glu367 act as the general acid and base catalyst, respectively, corresponding to Glu186 and Glu380 in soybean β-amylase (20Mikami B. Adachi M.

Biol. Chem. 1974; 38: 1023-1029Google Scholar, 25Hoshino M. Hirose Y. Sano K. Mitsugi K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1975; 39: 2415-2416Google Scholar, 26Saha B.-C. Shen J.-G.

Staerke. 1980; 32: 122-125Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), an activity that has been ascribed to its C-terminal raw starch-binding domain (11Nanmori T. Nagai M. Shimizu Y. Shinke R. Mikami B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 623-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mikami B. Adachi M. Kage T. Sarikaya E. Nanmori T. Shinke R. Utsumi S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7050-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28Hye J.-Y. Hirata A. Adachi M. Sekine A. Utsumi S. Mikami B. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 9: 619-623Google Scholar). Except for the raw starch digestive ability, properties of higher plant β-amylases differ from those of bacterial enzymes in terms of optimum pH, specific activity, isoelectric points, and the number of sulfhydryl/disulfide groups (29Nomura K. Yoneda I. Nanmori T. Shinke R. Morita Y. Mikami B. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1124-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The optimum pH of higher plant β-amylases is around 5.4, whereas that of bacterial enzymes is ∼6.7. Fig. 1 shows the comparison of structures near Glu380 in both SBA and BCB. The hydrogen bond between the side chains of Glu380 and Lys295 (Glu367 and Lys287 in BCB), which is conserved in both enzymes, seems to be important for β-amylase catalysis. In SBA, the hydrogen bond networks (Glu380-(Lys295-Met51) and Gln87-Asp176- Glu178-Asn340-Glu380) stabilize the negatively charged form of Glu380, therefore Glu380 in SBA may have a pKa lower than that of Glu367 in BCB as this type of stabilization was not found in BCB (20Mikami B. Adachi M. Kage T. Sarikaya E. Nanmori T. Shinke R. Utsumi S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7050-7061Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Sδ of Met51 is located near Nζ of Lys295 (3.5 Å) and Oϵ-2 of Glu380 (3.7 Å), possibly forming a hydrogen bond with Nζ of Lys295. These hydrogen bond networks in SBA are not present in BCB except in the case of the isolated hydrogen bond between Tyr164 and Thr328. These five amino acid residues (Met51, Glu87, Asp176, Glu178, and Asn340 in SBA) that differ between SBA and BCB are conserved in each of the higher plants and in bacterial β-amylase, respectively (16Mikami B. Hehre J.A. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchattini J.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6836-6845Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This difference in architecture around the base catalyst between SBA and BCB is thought to contribute to the difference in the pH optimum of the respective enzymes. To explore the role played by these amino acid residues, we focused on the Met51, Glu178, and Asn340 of SBA. These three residues are located near Glu380 of the five residues and are considered as candidates for the control of the pKa of Glu380. In this study, we characterized three SBA mutants, M51T, E178Y, and N340T, based on their enzymatic activity and x-ray crystallography and examined the mechanism underlying their different pH optima. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant SBA genes were constructed by a double PCR method. The PCR was performed in a reaction volume totaling 50 μl and containing 2.5 units of TAKARA EX Taq polymerase, 10× buffer, 200 μm dNTP, two synthesized mutagenesis primers at 100 ng/ml, and 5 ng/μl pKSBA (pKK233-2 vector including the SBA gene), which had been constructed previously (6Adachi M. Mikami B. Katsube T. Utsumi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19859-19865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The following primers, with the desired changes indicated in bold, were used in the mutagenesis procedures (F and R denote the upstream and the downstream primers, respectively): M51T-F, 5′-GGTTACCGTTGATGTGTGGTGGGGG-3′; M51T-R, 5′-CCGTCAACACCTGCAGCTCGAAGCTG-3′; E178Y-F, 5′-GTTGGGCTTGGCCCTGCAGGAGAGC-3′; E178Y-R, 5′-GTAAATGTCTATAATAAGTCCAGAT-3′; N340T-F, 5′-GCCATTTTTGACCTTTACATGTCTTG-3′; N340T-R, 5′-ATGATGTCTAGACAGCATTCTTGCA-3′. The mutagenesis primers were extended using a thermal cycler (model 2400, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for the PCR (denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 20 s at 55 °C, and elongation for 5 min at 72 °C for 18 cycles). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel, and the products were purified using glass powder (Bio-Rad). The resulting (mutant) 1.5-kilobase pair fragments were blunted by a blunting kit, phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase at the 5′-segment, and self-ligated using a ligation kit, version 2 (Takara). The constructed mutant vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM105 using heat shock. The mutant DNA sequences were confirmed by a DNA sequencer. Preparation of Mutant Proteins—Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to reach a final concentration of 1.0 mm in E. coli strain JM105. The purification and activity assay of the mutant SBA were performed by a method described previously (6Adachi M. Mikami B. Katsube T. Utsumi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19859-19865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Enzyme Kinetics and pH Dependence of β-Amylase Activity—The values of kcat and Km for both SBA and the mutants were measured using potato amylopectin as a substrate (30Morita Y. Aibara S. Yamashita H. YaGi F. Suganuma T. Hiromi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 77: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the substrate were varied from 1/10 to 5 times the Km value. Calculations of Vmax and Km were performed using the Michaelis-Menten equation with KaleidaGraph Software (Synergy Software). The pH-dependent activities of SBA and the mutants were determined using potato amylopectin at 37 °C in 0.05 m Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 3.0-9.0. The ionic strength of the buffer solution at each pH was adjusted to be 0.2 with NaCl. The apparent pK1 and pK2 values were calculated with the KaleidaGraph nonlinear curve-fitting program using Equation 1 (31Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 161Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), v=V/(1+[H]/K1+K2/[H]) where v and V are specific activity (units/mg) at each pH and pH-independent activity, respectively. [H] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, and K1 and K2 are dissociation constants of catalytic groups of the enzyme. Estimation of Dissociation Constants of the Mutant-Maltose Complexes—The dissociation constants (Kd) of SBA and the mutants respectively complexed with maltose were estimated by the titration of emission spectra based on tryptophan residues (excitation = 295 nm, emission = 330 nm) in 0.1 m acetate buffer at pH 5.4 and 25 °C; observations were made with a Hitachi F-3000 fluorescence spectrometer. Crystallization and Data Collection—Based on the crystallized condition of the enzyme in a previous report (6Adachi M. Mikami B. Katsube T. Utsumi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19859-19865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), crystallization of wild-type and mutant SBA was performed at 4 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, i.e. mixing 5 μl of a 24 mg/ml protein solution in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.4) with 5 μl of reservoir liquid of 48% ammonium sulfate containing 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, 1 mm EDTA, and 18 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at pH 5.4. Crystals grew for 1 month. The wild-type and mutant crystals used for data collection were ∼1 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm. These crystals were all trigonal and belonged to P3121; the cell dimensions are shown in Table I. The wild-type and mutant crystals were soaked in the mother liquor in the presence of 200 mm maltose for 30 min at 20 °C, and then the samples were mounted in thin walled glass capillaries filled with the mother liquor and sealed with wax. We avoided crystal freezing to prevent unexpected changes, such as a shift in the pH, from occurring. X-ray data of the wild-type crystal was collected at up to 1.86-Å resolution at room temperature using CuKα radiation with a Rigaku RAXIS IIC detector coupled to a Rigaku rotating anode generator, and the data were processed with Rigaku software (Rigaku). X-ray data of the respective mutant SBA crystals were collected at up to 1.95-2.1-Å resolution at room temperature using CuKα radiation with a Bruker Hi-Star area detector coupled to a MAC Science M18XHF rotating anode generator, and the results were processed with the SADIE and SAINT software packages (Bruker).Table IData collection and refinement statistics of SBA mutantsMutantWild type, pH 5.4M51T, pH 5.4E178YN340T, pH 5.4pH 5.4pH 7.1Space groupP3121P3121P3121P3121P3121Maltose (mm)200200200200200Cell dimensions (Å)a,b86.286.486.786.886.2c144.6145.6145.4145.2145.8Data collectionResolution range (Å)43.07-1.86 (2.00-1.86)40.65-1.88 (1.94-1.88)24.04-1.87 (1.94-1.87)40.65-1.99 (2.06-1.99)43.10-1.94 (2.01-1.94)No. of measured reflections122,982 (7,856)220,571 (7,247)247,346 (6,847)203,117 (4,842)211,152 (5,138)No. of unique reflections39,604 (3,719)49,751 (3,349)49,640 (3,245)39,656 (2,499)43,753 (2,724)Rsym (%)9.6 (24.7)7.3 (48.3)6.6 (44.4)8.4 (59.3)8.4 (48.2)Completeness (%)86.1 (76.3)95.1 (65.2)95.6 (63.7)89.4 (55.9)92.3 (58.8)RefinementResolution range (Å)10-1.86 (1.93-1.86)15-2.0 (2.07-2.00)15-1.95 (2.02-1.95)15-2.1 (2.17-2.10)15-2.0 (2.07-2.00)No. of reflections39,261 (2,199)38,091 (3,176)39,375 (3,228)30,486 (2,290)36,693 (2,714)(σ(F) > 0)No. of residues/no. of waters490/401490/288490/312490/247490/294No. of maltoses22222No. of sulfates12222L3 loop 1 conformation (residues 96-103)ClosedClosedClosedClosedClosedMaltose-occupied sites−2 to −1, +1 to +2−2 to −1, +1 to +3−2 to −1α, +2 to +3−2 to −1, +1 to +3−2 to −1α, +2 to +3Alternate residues341-344, 379-381341-344341-344341-344Average B-factor (Å2)24.222.322.521.320.8r.m.s.aRoot mean square. deviationBond lengths (Å)0.0060.0060.0050.0060.005Bond angles (°)1.291.261.261.251.27Rfree (%)21.2 (40.0)21.6 (31.7)21.5 (29.0)20.9 (25.5)21.0 (29.8)R-factor (%)17.4 (37.4)17.8 (28.2)17.7 (27.0)17.2 (24.3)17.4 (27.5)a Root mean square.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) and the graphic program TURBO-FRODO (Architecture et Fonction des Macromolécules Biologiques-CNRS, Marseille, France) were used to refine and rebuild the SBA and the mutant models. The 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps were used to locate the correct models. Several rounds of minimization and B-factor refinement followed by manual model building were carried out to improve the model. The structures were refined against all reflections from 15.0 Å to the highest resolution available without any σ(F) cut-off (see Table I). The Rfree values of these mutants were calculated for randomly separated 10% data, respectively. The number of water molecules incorporated and the final refinement parameters are also indicated in Table I. The stereoquality of the model was assessed using the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The molecular models of SBA, the mutants, and BCB were superimposed using a fitting program implemented in TURBO-FRODO. Effect of pH on Mutant β-Amylase Activity—In the preset study, the three mutants, M51T, E178Y, and N340T, were all shown to have an increased pH optimum as indicated in Fig. 2. The specific activity for the hydrolysis of potato amylopectin at 37 °C in each optimum pH of the respective β-amylase mutants is given in Table II. M51T, E178Y, and N340T had decreased specific activities of 11, 43, and 32%, respectively, of the wild-type SBA. The relative pH activity profiles were bell-shaped except in the case of N340T (Fig. 2). Although we did not examine the pH dependence of the Vmax and Km values separately, the relative pH activity profiles appeared to be mainly due to the Vmax value; notably the Km value of the wild type was reported previously to be constant from pH 3.0 to 7.0 (34Nitta Y. Kunikata T. Watanabe T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 85: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed specific activities were fitted to Equation 1, assuming two pKa values. Based on this curve-fitting, the optimum pH and postulated pKa values of the catalytic residues were calculated (Table II). The optimum pH values of the three mutants were shifted from pH 5.4 (wild type) to 6.5 (M51T), 6.0 (E178Y), and 6.6 (N340T), all of which are close to that of BCB (pH 6.7). The relative pH activity profiles were explained by the two pKa values, pK1 and pK2, of the assumed basic and acidic catalysts, respectively. These values for the wild type were in agreement with values reported previously for β-amylases from soybean (34Nitta Y. Kunikata T. Watanabe T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 85: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Gertler A. Birk Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 118: 98-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sweet potato (36Thoma A.J.

The pK1 values of the mutants increased about 0.8-0.9 pH units from that of the wild-type enzyme, while the pK2 values were almost the same as that of the wild-type enzyme. These results indicated that the mutations affected the environment of the base catalyst and that due to these mutations the changes in the base catalyst were more significant than those in the acid catalyst, resulting in the increased pK1 characteristic of the mutant enzymes.Table IISpecific activity and pKa values for the hydrolysis of potato amylopectinSpecific activityApparent pKa valuesOptimum pHUnits/mgpK1pK2Wild type5.4684 ± 0.183.6 ± 0.098.1 ± 0.06M51T6.575 ± 0.024.4 ± 0.088.1 ± 0.07E178Y6.0292 ± 0.284.4 ± 0.077.9 ± 0.06N340T6.6222 ± 0.564.5 ± 0.148.2 ± 0.13BCB6.72,667 ± 0.545.0 ± 0.098.6 ± 0.11 Open table in a new tab As shown in Table III, the apparent Km values of E178Y and N340T were approximately the same as that of the wild type, whereas that of M51T was over 20 times larger than that of the wild-type enzyme. On the other hand, the Vmax values of E178Y and N340T were approximately 2 and 3 times lower, respectively, than that of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the Km values, the Kd value of M51T for maltose was 10-fold lower than that of the wild type, whereas the Kd values of the two mutants were both approximately equal to that of the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that conformational changes occurred at the active site of M51T and consequently reduced the catalytic level and increased the unusual binding of substrates.Table IIIKinetic parameters of SBA and mutants (pH 5.4)Apparent KmVmaxKd for maltose complexmg/mlμm/smmWild type1.0 ± 0.148.5 ± 0.335.1 ± 1.00M51T>20>1.10.46 ± 0.08E178Y1.2 ± 0.084.2 ± 0.092.4 ± 0.34N340T1.0 ± 0.202.4 ± 0.148.8 ± 0.91 Open table in a new tab Quality of the Refined Models—To investigate the structural changes in the mutant SBA, we determined the crystal structures of the wild-type and mutant SBA complexed with maltose at 1.86-2.1-Å resolutions. The x-ray data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. From the Luzzati plots (38Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar), the mean absolute positional errors were estimated to be 0.21-0.22 Å. Ramachandran plots of the main-chain conformation angles (39Ramakrishan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) showed that 88.8-88.9% of the residues lie within the core region, and 99.7-99.8% lie within the allowed region. With the exception of a small displacement of the main-chain region (residues 341-344) over the active site cleft, no significant changes occurred in the backbone structure of the mutants. The root mean square deviations between the wild-type and the mutant structures, calculated for all Cα atoms, were less than 0.2 Å. The flexible loop (residues 96-103), which was reported to play an important role in the catalytic step (16Mikami B. Hehre J.A. Sato M. Katsube Y. Hirose M. Morita Y. Sacchattini J.S.

As shown in Fig. 3, the 2Fo - Fc maps of the active site and the bound maltose, except in the case of subsite +3, were sufficiently clear to provide a reliable interpretation of the structural changes in the mutants.Fig. 3Stereoviews of the structural conformation of SBA and the mutants complexed, respectively, with maltose.

Degano M. Hehre E.J. Sacchattini J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7779-7787Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the electron density map of two tandem maltose molecules at subsites -2 to +2 was interpreted to indicate that one maltotetraose and two maltose molecules (β-anomer at subsites -2 to -1 and subsites +1 to +2, respectively) bind simultaneously. A better interpretation was considered to be that both 4C1 α- and distorted β-anomeric maltoses can bind at subsite -2 to -1 without forming maltotetraose from the excess maltose. It is also assumed that due to steric hindrance, no glucose residue can bind at subsite +1 when an α-anomeric glucose residue binds at subsite -1. For the previous data, the ratio of the two anomers at subsite -1 was estimated to be 0.2 and 0.8 for α and β, respectively (40Mikami B. Ohnishi M. Structure of β-Amylase: Glycoenzymes. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo2000: 55-81Google Scholar). However, the present data set of SBA-maltose complex could be refined by two maltoses at subsites -2 to -1 and +1 to +2, respectively, with a distorted sugar ring almost assuming the boat form with unknown anomer type at subsite -1 (Fig. 3A). It was suggested that the ratio of the distorted glucose and 4C1 α-glucose residue at subsite -1 depended on the slight change in pH. The Structure of M51T-Maltose Complex—Fig. 3B shows the 2Fo - Fc map and the residues around Glu380 of M51T with the bound maltose determined at pH 5.4. In the structure of M51T, the substitution of Thr51 created a space that had been occupied by Sδ and Cϵ in the original Met51. Instead of being occupied by the side chain of Met51, this space was occupied by one water molecule, which was hydrogen-bonded to Oϵ-2 of Glu380 (2.8 Å) and Nζ of Lys295 (3.2 Å). The loss of the side chain of Met51 resulted in the disruption of the hydrogen bond between Nζ of Lys295 and Oϵ-2 of Glu380 (from 2.9 to 3.8 Å), which may have allowed for the splitting of the side chain of Glu380 into two alternate positions. Both of the positions were shifted by 0.6 and 2.1 Å from that of the Glu380 Oϵ-2 in the wild-type SBA. The disposition of Glu380 Oϵ-2 also disrupted the hydrogen bond between Oϵ-2 of Glu380 and Nδ-2 of Asn340. The altered side-chain position of Glu380 was so close to O-1 of the distorted glucose at subsite -1 that it prevented the binding of β-anomeric glucose and the localization of a catalytic water molecule, which would be in accord with the low activity of M51T. In contrast to the electron density map of the wild-type enzyme, that of maltose in M51T was interpreted to show a mixture of three maltose molecules bound at subsites -2 to -1 (a distorted glucose and an α-4C1 glucose at subsite -1), at subsites +1 to +2, and at subsites +2 to +3. It is assumed that a maltose molecule can bind at subsites +1 to +2 only when a distorted glucose residue binds at subsite -1. If an α-anomeric glucose residue binds at subsite -1, the second maltose will bind at subsites +2 to +3 due to a collision between O-1 of the glucose at subsite -1 and O-4 of the glucose at subsite +1. The occupancy refinement of the two alternate positions of maltose coupled with the alternate position of the side chain of Glu380 showed that their respective occupancies were both about 0.5. The Structure of E178Y-Maltose Complex—Fig. 3C shows the 2Fo - Fc map and the residues around Glu380 of E178Y with the bound maltose determined at pH 5.4. The s"

Nuclear estrogen receptor (ER), on the other hand, regulates gene expression through both estrogen response elements and AP-1. Here we show that stress stimulates c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activity in both ER+ and ER- human breast cancer cells and only induces cell death in ER- cells, indicating a determinant role of ER in c-Jun/AP-1 activity. The inhibitory effect of ER in stress-induced cell death is confirmed by ER transfection into ER- cells. Furthermore, inhibition of c-Jun activation by a dominant negative c-Jun blocks AP-1 activity in ER+ cells and attenuates stress-induced cell death but not AP-1 activity in ER- cells, suggesting that the c-Jun/AP-1 activity has distinct properties depending on ER status. ER was shown to inhibit stress-induced cell death through its physical interaction with c-Jun. This is because ER binds c-Jun in breast cancer cells, stress treatment further increases the ER-bound phosphorylated c-Jun, and the c-Jun binding-deficient ER mutant fails to protect stress-induced cell death. Together, our studies reveal a novel function of ER in stress response by modification of c-Jun activity."

Mass spectrometry showed that a disulfide bond replaced the second heme group found in the diheme SoxA subunits. Apparent molecular masses of 27,229 ± 10.3 Da and 20,258.6 ± 1 Da were determined for SoxA and SoxX with an overall mass of 49.7 kDa, indicating a heterodimeric structure. Optical redox potentiometry found that the two heme cofactors are reduced at similar potentials (versus NHE) that are as follows: +133 mV (pH 6.0); +104 mV (pH 7.0); +49 (pH 7.9) and +10 mV (pH 8.7). EPR spectroscopy revealed that both ferric heme groups are in the low spin state, and the spectra were consistent with one heme having a His/Cys axial ligation and the other having a His/Met axial ligation. The His/Cys ligated heme is present in different conformational states and gives rise to three distinct signals. Amino acid sequencing was used to unambiguously assign the protein to the encoding genes, soxAX, which are part of a complete sox gene cluster found in S. novella. Phylogenetic analysis of soxA- and soxX-related gene sequences indicates a parallel development of SoxA and SoxX, with the diheme and monoheme SoxA sequences located on clearly separated branches of a phylogenetic tree. Cytochromes from the SoxAX family have a major role in thiosulfate oxidation via the thiosulfate-oxidizing multi-enzyme system (TOMES).

Reduced sulfur compounds can be used as electron donors by a variety of photo- and chemolithotrophic microorganisms supporting autotrophic growth. Thiosulfate is one of the most abundant forms of reduced sulfur in nature, and hence the ability to oxidize this compound is found in many microorganisms belonging to a number of different phyla (1Petri R. Podgorsek L. Imhoff J.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 197: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several pathways for thiosulfate oxidation have been proposed over the years, but in many cases investigations have been hampered by the reactivity of intermediates and the low growth yields common to chemolithotrophic microorganisms growing on sulfur. The most common (1Petri R. Podgorsek L. Imhoff J.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 197: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also best studied pathway of thiosulfate oxidation involves the so-called thiosulfate-oxidizing multi-enzyme system (TOMES), 1The abbreviations used are: TOMES, thiosulfate-oxidizing multienzyme system; CV, column volume; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; NHE, normal hydrogen electrode. 1The abbreviations used are: TOMES, thiosulfate-oxidizing multienzyme system; CV, column volume; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; NHE, normal hydrogen electrode. which can oxidize thiosulfate, sulfite, or sulfide to sulfate with cytochrome c as electron acceptor (2Kelly D.P.

The complex has been studied mainly in Paracoccus versutus (2Kelly D.P. Shergill J.K. Lu W.P. Wood A.P. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1997; 71: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), Paracoccus pantotrophus (4Friedrich C.G. Adv. Microb.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6107-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and is encoded by “sulfur oxidation” (sox) gene clusters. The TOMES from P. pantotrophus contains nonheme metalloproteins (SoxB, SoxC) as well as a number of cytochromes (SoxA, SoxX, SoxD, SoxE) and proteins without redox cofactors (SoxY, SoxZ) (2Kelly D.P. Shergill J.K. Lu W.P. Wood A.P. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1997; 71: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3Friedrich C.G. Rother D. Bardischewsky F. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Appl.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Of these proteins, SoxAX, SoxB, and SoxYZ have been shown to be essential for complex function, whereas the role played by other components (SoxCD, SoxF, SoxE) has not yet been fully understood (3Friedrich C.G. Rother D. Bardischewsky F. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 5Rother D. Henrich H.J. Quentmeier A. Bardischewsky F.

Microbiol. 2000; 173: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The proposed reaction cycle of the complex involves a sequential oxidation of thiosulfate, which is bound covalently to the carrier protein SoxYZ. Sulfate and/or sulfite is thought to be liberated in the process (3Friedrich C.G. Rother D. Bardischewsky F. Quentmeier A. Fischer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) although no free reaction intermediates have been detected so far. The SoxAX protein is the best characterized of the essential components of the TOMES. It is a heterodimeric protein composed of two heme c-bearing subunits with molecular masses of about 30 and 15 kDa, respectively. It has been studied mainly in R. sulfidophilum, in which the SoxA subunit contains two heme c groups with an unusual heme ligation (His/Cys and His/Cys-persulfide), whereas the SoxX subunit contains only one heme c group with a His/Met ligation (8Appia-Ayme C. Little P.J. Matsumoto Y. Leech A.P. Berks B.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6107-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Cheesman M.R. Little P.J. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10562-10569Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of SoxAX from R. sulfidophilum has recently been solved and showed a novel type of domain packing for the SoxA subunit, which might have arisen from a gene duplication event (12Bamford V.A. Bruno S. Rasmussen T. Appia-Ayme C. Cheesman M.R. Berks B.C. Hemmings A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5599-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Only one of the two SoxA heme groups is thought to participate in the reaction cycle, and this heme showed a modification of the ligating cysteine to a persulfide. The SoxAX protein from P. pantotrophus has been expressed in Escherichia coli and been shown to be functionally active in the recombinant form (13Rother D. Friedrich C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1598: 65-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As isolated, this form apparently did not contain a modified cysteine ligand, raising the question as to whether this modification is an artifact of an incomplete reaction cycle or is necessary for protein function. A SoxA-related protein that was reported to be a SoxA homodimer lacking a SoxX subunit has been purified from Chlorobium limicola (14Klarskov K. Verte F. Van Driessche G. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10555-10562Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Genes related to soxAX have been reported from a variety of microorganisms such as Aquifex aeolicus, Chlorobium tepidum, Chl. limicola, Ralstonia species, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and others, usually as a result of genome sequencing projects (8Appia-Ayme C.

They have uncovered considerable diversity within the SoxAX protein family. In particular, in addition to the well characterized triheme form of SoxAX found in R. sulfidophilum and P. pantotrophus, analysis of the gene sequences indicates that a number of diheme SoxAX proteins may exist in which the SoxA homologues possess only one heme group (8Appia-Ayme C. Little P.J. Matsumoto Y. Leech A.P. Berks B.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6107-6118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, the SoxX homologues found in these proteins are usually much larger (25-75%) than their counterparts found in the triheme forms and exhibit low similarity values (about 36%) toward their characterized relatives. Here, we report for the first time the purification and biochemical characterization of a diheme member of this cytochrome family, the SoxAX protein from Starkeya novella. Structural aspects of the protein along with redox and spectroscopic properties of the heme groups present are reported herein. The diversity present within the SoxAX family is highlighted by analysis of the phylogenetic relationships between the different existing forms. Materials and Reagents—All chemicals were purchased in analytical or corresponding grade unless otherwise stated. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Plasmids—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are specified in Table I. S. novella was cultivated on DSMZ medium 69 as described (18Kappler U. Bennett B.

Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) was carried out using the Big Dye terminator chemistry (v. 2.0, Applied Biosystems). Probes for Southern blots were labeled nonradioactively by PCR incorporation using digoxigenen-dUTP (Roche Applied Science), and detection of signals was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Sciences). Plasmid purification kits were obtained from SIGMA and PCR purification and gel extraction kits from Qiagen. Cloning of the S. novella sox Gene Region—The insert of the previously reported pTNSOX2 plasmid (22Kappler U. Friedrich C.G. Truper H.G. Dahl C. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was completely sequenced. Gene probes targeting the soxF (Soxdf5, GAA CGC CAG CTC GCG ACC; Soxdr1, GCA CAT GGC TGT CGC GAG) and soxY (Soxbf1, TCT CCT TCT CGC TCT CAT, Soxbr5, TCC GCC ATC GAC TTG TCG) genes were amplified by PCR from pTNSOX2 (22Kappler U. Friedrich C.G. Truper H.G. Dahl C. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and PCR-labeled using digoxigenen-dUTP. These probes were used in Southern blot experiments with genomic DNA of S. novella. A 2.5-kb PstI fragment and a 3.5-kb EcoRI fragment hybridized with the downstream (soxF) and upstream (soxY) gene probes for the S. novella sox gene cluster, respectively. Partial genomic libraries of PstI and EcoRI fragments in the appropriate size range were constructed in pBluescript and screened by Southern blotting. Two plasmids, designated pSNSOX3 and pSNSOX4, were identified as positives and their inserts sequenced on both strands (Table I, Fig. 1). A further round of screening using a gene probe targeting the soxX (M13rev primer, Soxyr3A TCA AGC GTT GAG GGA GGC; template, pSNSOX4) gene led to the identification of a 3.5-kb SstII fragment hybridizing with that gene probe. A plasmid, pSNSOX5, containing this insert was isolated from a partial clone library as described above and sequenced. Purification of the Diheme SoxAX Cytochrome from S. novella—40 g of frozen S. novella cell paste were resuspended in 5 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and broken by two passages through a French pressure cell (Aminco) at 1000 p.s.i. Preparation of a cell-free extract and ammonium sulfate precipitation were carried out as described (18Kappler U. Bennett B. Rethmeier J. Schwarz G. Deutzmann R. McEwan A.G. Dahl C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13202-13212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) with omission of the heat step at 50 °C. The pellet resulting from the 35-80% saturation ammonium sulfate cut was resuspended in 40 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, dialyzed against 2 × 5 liters of the same buffer, and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.6 × 20 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. A gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in 11 column volumes (CV) was applied, in which the SoxAX protein eluted between 80-120 mm NaCl. Fractions were pooled and concentrated, and ammonium sulfate was added to a concentration of 15% (w/v). The sample was then applied to a Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B FastFlow (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.6 × 18 cm) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 15% ammonium sulfate (w/v). 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 without ammonium sulfate served as the second buffer (B). A step gradient was used to develop the column: 2 CV 0% B, 4 CV 0-50% B, 4 CV 50% B, 3 CV 50-100% B, 2 CV 100% B. The SoxAX protein eluted at 50% B. Pooled fractions were concentrated and run on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl). Fractions collected after this step were 98% pure. For further purification these fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, applied to a MonoQ (5/5 HR) column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted using a linear gradient of 0-250 mm NaCl in 35 CV. Spectroscopic and Analytical Techniques—Optical spectra of the SoxAX protein were recorded using a Hitachi U-3000 double-beam spectrophotometer. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed on samples with an A280 of 0.4 at 13,000 rpm for 20 h at 20 °C using a Beckman XL-1 Ultracentrifuge. Heme type and content were determined in alkaline pyridine solution (23Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Denaturing and nondenaturing PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Gels were routinely stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue; staining of polyacrylamide gels for heme-dependent peroxidase activity was carried out according to Thomas et al. (25Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levit M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing was performed by sequential Edman degradation of protein samples blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane subsequent to denaturing PAGE. N-terminal protein sequencing was performed at the University of Queensland Protein Analysis Laboratory. Mass Spectrometry—Protein samples for tryptic digestion were exchanged into 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9. Porcine trypsin (sequencing grade) was from Promega. Tryptic digests were carried out for 20 h at 37 °C with an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:20 according to the manufacturer's instructions. For mass analysis following SDS-PAGE, protein bands were cut out of Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250-stained gels and destained by repeated washing in 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9 (10 min at 37 °C with agitation per wash step) until the gel slice appeared clear. The destained gel slices were carefully dried under a gentle nitrogen flow. Tryptic digests were carried out in 10 μl of 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.9, using 200 ng of porcine trypsin/sample (37 °C, 22 h) followed by enzyme inactivation at -20 °C. Prior to mass analysis, 20 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid was added, and the samples were sonicated in a water bath for 20 min. In some cases the destained gel slices were treated with dithiothreitol followed by alkylation of reduced SH groups with iodoacteamide as described previously (26Westermeier R. Naven T. Proteomics in Practice: A Laboratory Manual of Proteome Analysis, 1st Ed. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, Weinheim, Germany2002Crossref Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE STR 4316 MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager™ 5.1 software with data explorer). Sinnapinic acid and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were used as matrices in sample preparations of whole proteins and peptides, respectively. Matrices were mixed with samples in a 1:1 ratio. Applied Biosystems Sequazyme™ calibration mixtures 2 and 3 were used in the analyses. Sequencing of tryptic peptides was carried out using an Applied Biosystems Qstar/Pulsar I instrument equipped with a nanospray source (Protana), LINAC™ Pulsar collision cell, and a TOF mass detector. Applied Biosystems AnalystQS software was used in data acquisition and BioAnalyst (Applied Biosystems) for data analysis. Thiosulfate:Cytochrome c Oxidoreductase Assays—Reaction mixtures contained 0.05 mm cytochrome c (horse heart, Sigma), 2 mm thiosulfate, and variable amounts of purified SoxAX in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The assay volume was 1 ml, and all measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a Hitachi UV-3000 double-beam spectrophotometer. Redox Potentiometry—Heme redox potentials were determined by standard redox potentiometric methods (27Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) using a glove box and a N2 atmosphere (O2 concentration <2 ppm). The redox mediators used were tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (2 μm), phenazinemethosulfate (2 μm), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (8 μm), benzylviologen (2 μm), and methylviologen (2 μm); the reductant was Na2S2O4, and the oxidant was K3[Fe(CN)6]. 20 mm phosphate buffer was used in titration experiments. The solution pH was adjusted with acetic acid before each titration, and the solution potential was measured upon equilibration with an ABB Kent Taylor combination Pt-Ag/AgCl electrode attached to a Hanna 8417 meter. Spectral differences between the oxidized and reduced hemes were monitored at 416 nm with a Shimadzu UV Mini 1240 spectrophotometer. The experimental data were fitted to the Nernst equation. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy—X-band (∼9-10 GHz) continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Biospin Elexsys E500 EPR spectrometer fitted with a super-high Q cavity. Calibration of the magnetic field and microwave frequency was achieved with a Bruker ER 035 m gaussmeter and an EIP 548B microwave frequency counter, respectively. Liquid helium temperatures (1.5-50 K) were obtained with an Oxford ESR910 flow-through cryostat in conjunction with an Oxford Instruments ITC-4 temperature controller. Spectrometer tuning, signal averaging, and subsequent spectral comparisons and plotting were performed with Bruker's Xepr (version 2.1) software. SoxAX protein samples for EPR analysis contained 50 μm protein. Computer simulation of the EPR spectra was performed using version 1.1.3 of XSophe-Sophe-XeprView computer simulation software suite running on a personal computer with Mandrake Linux version 9.1 (28Hanson G.R.

The computational program Sophe employs a number of methods, including matrix diagonalization, SOPHE interpolation, and homotopy for the analysis of randomly oriented EPR spectra. In this research we employed matrix diagonalization in conjunction with mosaic misorientation to simulate the randomly oriented EPR spectra from the hemes. This method 2C. J. Noble, K. E. Gates, and G. R. Hanson, unpublished results. significantly reduces the computational times. Comparisons of simulated and experimental spectra and data manipulation were performed with Xepr. Assignment of the g values to gx,gy, and gz was performed using the computer program ls_iron, which was developed using the theory described by Bohan (30Bohan T.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1977; 26: 109-118Google Scholar). Phylogenetic Analysis—Genes encoding proteins related to SoxAX were identified using the BLAST algorithm (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Deduced amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalX (32Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35075) Google Scholar), and regions of low homology were removed from the alignment. This concerned mainly N-terminal regions and inserted amino acids that were found in only one of the sequences under consideration. The alignments constructed for SoxA- and SoxX-related sequences spanned 274 and 190 residues, respectively. The data were then analyzed with the Phylip package (33Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). Different distance methods (neighbor-joining, fitch, kitsch) and a maximum parsimony analysis were applied to the data sets. Robustness of the resulting trees was verified by bootstrap and jackknife analysis with 1000 resampled data sets. 1000 randomly permutated data sets were generated to check the significance of the observed protein relationship. GenBank™ Accession Numbers and Computer-based Analyses—The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited under accession number AF139113. Sequence data were analyzed using the WEBANGIS program suite (Angis). Signal peptide cleavage sites were predicted using the SignalP program (34Nielsen H. Brunak S. VonHeijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 35Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. VonHeijne G. Int. J. Neural Syst. 1997; 8: 581-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and similarity searches were conducted using the BLAST algorithm (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W.

The soluble cytochrome c551 was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1C) as described under “Experimental Procedures” and designated SoxAX after its identity had been established by peptide sequencing (see below). Electronic absorption spectra of SoxAX confirmed that the protein is a cytochrome c551 with peaks at 551 (α), 522 (β), and 416 nm (γ) for the reduced protein (oxidized: 410 (γ) and 362 nm (δ)) (Fig. 1B). The apparent molecular masses of the subunits were 24.9 and 19.1 kDa as calculated after SDS-PAGE and were in good correspondence with the 27,229.3 ± 10.3 Da (SoxA) and 20,258 ± 1 Da (SoxX) subsequently obtained by MALDI-TOF. Unlike the SoxX protein, which resulted in well defined mass peaks, the SoxA protein gave rise to a broad signal with a number of additional mass peaks (i.e. 26,812 ± 7.4 Da, 27,044.4 ± 16.2 Da, and 27,434.05 ± 14.4 Da) during MALDI-TOF analyses. This seems to indicate that the protein may be subject to some form of fragmentation in the laser beam and the possibility that other forms or modifications may exist. Additional mass peaks have also been observed for the SoxAX protein from P. pantotrophus (13Rother D. Friedrich C.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1598: 65-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of the S. novella SoxAX holo-protein was determined to be 49.7 kDa by analytical ultracentrifugation, suggesting a heterodimeric composition (αβ) of the protein. This value is close to the sum of the molecular masses determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (47,"

We report the characterization of a SK3 variant (SK3-1C) that differs from SK3 by utilizing an alternative first exon (exon 1C) in place of exon 1A used by SK3, but is otherwise identical to SK3. Quantitative RT-PCR detected abundant expression of SK3-1C transcripts in human lymphoid tissues, skeletal muscle, trachea, and salivary gland but not the nervous system. SK3-1C did not produce functional channels when expressed alone in mammalian cells, but suppressed SK1, SK2, SK3, and IKCa1 channels, but not BKCa or KV channels. Confocal microscopy revealed that SK3-1C sequestered SK3 protein intracellularly. Dominant-inhibitory activity of SK3-1C was not due to a nonspecific calmodulin sponge effect since overexpression of calmodulin did not reverse SK3-1C-mediated intracellular trapping of SK3 protein, and calmodulin-Ca2+-dependent inactivation of CaV channels was not affected by SK3-1C overexpression. Deletion analysis identified a dominant-inhibitory segment in the SK3-1C C terminus that resembles tetramerization-coiled-coiled domains reported to enhance tetramer stability and selectivity of multimerization of many K+ channels. SK3-1C may therefore suppress calmodulin-gated SKCa/IKCa channels by trapping these channel proteins intracellularly via subunit interactions mediated by the dominant-inhibitory segment and thereby reduce functional channel expression on the cell surface. Such family-wide dominant-negative suppression by SK3-1C provides a powerful mechanism to titrate membrane excitability and is a useful approach to define the functional in vivo role of these channels in diverse tissues by their targeted silencing.

When expressed heterologously in mammalian cells, SK3-1C suppressed SK1, SK2, SK3, and IKCa1 channels but not KV or BKCa channels. Variations in the levels of functional SKCa and IKCa channels versus SK3-1C subunits in peripheral tissues may provide an endogenous mechanism to regulate membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODS5′-RACE—The sequence of the SK3-1C cDNA was extended by 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) with an AP1 primer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and a SK3-1C specific primer (5′-CTGTCCTTGCAGATGTCGCGTGGCAGGC-3′), using human adult Marathon-ready™ cDNA from human lymph node tissue (Clontech) as the template. Subsequently, a nested PCR was carried out using the RACE product and an SK3-1C-specific primer (5′-CAGCAAGCTCTAAGGAGTAGGTGCCAGC-3′) and an AP2 primer (Clontech). The longest product (206 bp) was purified using a QIAQuick™ gel extraction kit, ligated into PCR 2.1 vector and sequenced.Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Human total RNA master panel (Clontech) and total RNA isolated from human lymph node tissue and peripheral blood lymphocytes were used to profile the expression pattern of SK3, SK3-1C, and IKCa1 with methods previously described (16Tomita H. Shakkottai V.G. Gutman G.A. Sun G. Bunney W.E. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Gargus J.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following DNase digestion, total RNA (2 μg) was used as a template for first-strand cDNA synthesis using random hexamers (TaqMan™ reverse transcription reagents, Applied Biosystems). The mRNA for each SK3 transcript was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using a Prism model 7000-sequence detection instrument (PE Applied Biosystems). Forward and reverse primers and TaqMan™ fluorescent probes were designed by Primer Express version 1.5 (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of forward primers, designed to anneal to exon 1, were 5′-GCGACATCTGCAAGGACAGTT-3′ for SK3-1C, and 5′-GGAACTGGCATTGGACTCATG-3′ for IKCa1. The reverse primers, designed to anneal to exon 2, were 5′-CAACGAAAACATGGAGTCCTTTATAG-3′ for SK3-1C, and 5′-TGCTGATCGTGCATTTAACCA-3′ for IKCa1. The TaqMan™ fluorescent probes (5′-labeled with 6FAM, and 3′-labeled with TAMRA as a quencher), designed to anneal to sequences between the forward and reverse primers, were 5′-TTTGGTGTTTTGCTTCAGGTTATAGATGGAGAGA-3′ for SK3-1C, and 5′-TGCTCGTGGGCGCTCTACCTGTTC-3′ for IKCa1. The SK3-1C and IKCa1 amplification products were 83 and 100 bp, respectively. The threshold cycle, Ct, which correlates inversely with the target mRNA levels, was measured as the cycle number at which the reporter fluorescent emission increased above a pre-set threshold level. To obtain absolute quantification, standard curves were plotted for every assay and were generated using defined concentrations of SK3-1C in Image clone 3678178, and IKCa1 cDNA cloned into the eGFPN1 vector. Standard curves for each amplicon were plotted from 8 different concentrations of standards, each run in triplicate. Concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry and purity confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Purified clones were diluted to eight different concentrations and stored in single-use aliquots at -20 °C and the same diluted preparations were used throughout.Cell Culture and Transfection—All cells were kept in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and were split 1:10 twice a week. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents used in tissue culture were obtained from Sigma. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and 2 mm glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin. HEK293T cell lines stably expressing human SK1, rat SK2, and human IKCa1 were a generous gift from Dr. Khaled Houamed (University of Chicago), and were kept in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, and 2 mm glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin. Puromycin (10 μg/μl) was used as a selection marker to preserve channel expression. The HEK293T cell line that stably expresses human BKCa was a generous gift from Dr. Andrew Tinker (University College London). The HEK293T cell line that stably expresses the cloned l-type CaV channel (CaV1.2b + β2 α) was a gift from Dr. Franz Hofmann (Institut für Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Munich, Germany). This cell line was grown in DMEM, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and 2 mm glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin, with selection markers G418 (20 μg/ml), and hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) to preserve channel expression.All constructs were transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were seeded at a density of 200,000-300,000/well in a 12-well plate and were grown overnight. Transfection complexes consisting of 3 μl of FuGENE 6 and 2 μg of DNA were incubated in serum-free Optimem (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) for at least 20 min before application to cells. Electrophysiology and confocal imaging were performed 72-h post-transfection.Generation of Constructs—SK3-1C and all its deletion constructs were engineered into the IRES-EGFP vector (Clontech), using 5′ HindIII and 3′ BamHI restriction sites. PCR reactions were catalyzed by thermalase DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and the incorporation of stop codons in the 3′-primer generated 4 SK3-1C deletion mutants. The two SK3 C-terminal fragment constructs were generated through a PCR reaction amplifying a region beginning with an internal methionine (M330) artificially placed in a good Kozak consensus sequence. One of these C-terminal constructs was placed in the IRES-EGFP vector, and the other was made into a GFP fusion protein by cloning it into the eGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech). CaM, a generous gift from Dr. Mitsuhiko Ikura (University of Toronto), was inserted into the first multiple cloning site of the bicistronic pIRES vector (Clontech) directly 3′ to the CMV promoter using NheI and EcoRI restriction sites. Inserted at SalI and NotI sites, directly downstream to the IRES element, was a C-terminally tagged SK3-1C-EGFP fusion construct, which yielded a bicistronic expression construct, CaM-IRES-SK3-1C-EGFP, which produced both CaM and SK3-1C-eGFP driven by the same CMV promoter. All constructs were sequenced and shown to contain the expected open reading frames.Whole Cell Recording—Whole cell patch-clamp recordings for SKCa, IKCa, BKCa, and KV currents were performed using a 1μm free Ca2+ internal pipette solution containing (in mm): 145 K+ aspartate, 8.5 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 2 MgCl2 (pH 7.4; 300 mosm). When recording from stably transfected HEK cells, a sodium aspartate Ringer solution comprised of (in mm) 155 Na+ aspartate, 4.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4; 300 mosm) was used as a bath solution. A 160 mm K+ aspartate solution was used when recording SKCa currents from PC12 cells, which contained (in mm): 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2 (pH 7.4; 300 mosm). Glass patch-clamp electrodes (Kimble) with pipette resistances ranging from 1.8-2.5 MΩ were used to form gigaohm seals. Recordings were made using an EPC-9 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Instruments). In voltage-clamp experiments, cells were held at -80 mV, and SKCa and IKCa currents were recorded using voltage ramps from -120 to 40 mV (80 mV for BKCa) in 200 ms. Slope conductances were analyzed between -70 to -50 mV from cells in which the series resistance was less than 10 mΩ. Prior to recording, cells were placed on coverslips coated with polylysine and were allowed to adhere for at least 15 min.Whole cell recording for CaV1.2 currents in stably transfected HEK293T cells were performed using an internal solution containing (in mm): 102 CsCl, 10 TEA Cl, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 3 Na2ATP, and 1 MgCl2 (pH 7.4; 300 mosm). Bath solutions contained (in mm) either 30 BaCl2 or 20 CaCl2, 82 NaCl, 5.4 CsCl, 10 TEA Cl, 5 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4; 300 mosm). In PC12 cells, whole cell recording for CaV currents was performed using an internal solution containing (in mm): 150 CsCl, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgATP, and 0.5 GTP (pH 7.2; 300 mosm). External solutions contained (in mm) either 20 BaCl2 or 20 CaCl2, 135 TEA Cl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2 and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2; 300 mosm). Using a holding potential of -80 mV, families of CaV currents were elicited by 600-ms pulses from -40 to 40 mV given at 10 s intervals. Mock- and SK3-1C-IRES-GFP-transfected PC12 cells were plated onto coverslips and grown for 72 h in nerve growth factor-containing medium prior to recording.Immunostaining—Prior to immunostaining, transfected PC12 cells were plated onto glass coverslips and allowed to settle overnight. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and permeablilized with Triton X-100 for 20 min. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, both before and after a 4-hr incubation with the anti-SK3-specific antibody that reacts with the N terminus of full-length SK3 (Alomone Labs), and following a 1-h incubation with the secondary Alexa-594-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Molecular Probes). Antibodies specific for the C termini of rodent SK3 were gifts from Dr. Hans-Gunther Knaus (Innsbruck, Austria) (17Sailer C.A. Hu H. Kaufmann W.A. Trieb M. Schwarzer C. Storm J.F. Knaus H.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9698-9707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Dr. Martin Stocker (University College London).Confocal Microscopy and Image Analysis—An MRC-1024 laser-scanning confocal microscope (BioRad) was used to acquire images. The microscope was housed on an inverted Nikon Diaphot 200 stand, and 1-μm sections of PC12 cells were obtained using a ×100 oil immersion objective. Excitation wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm were used to visualize GFP and Alexa-594 fluorescence respectively, and images were collected with 522/35 and 605/32 emission filters. Confocal Assistant and Adobe Photoshop were used to process confocal sections, and pixel intensities of fluorescence histograms representative of the localization of tagged SK3 were computed using the Scion Image 4.0.2 software. The image of each cell was bisected in each of three axes. Pixel intensity was determined and averaged along each of these axes. The borders of an individual cell were defined as a rise in pixel intensity 50% above background levels. The length of all pixel intensity histograms was scaled to an arbitrarily chosen histogram, and the numerical pixel intensity values were averaged for SK3-1C-IRES-GFP-, IRES-GFP-, and mock-transfected cells in all axes, in order to generate an average line plot histogram for the entire experimental group. A ratio of presumed membrane to intracellular fluorescence was calculated by partitioning the line plot histogram into three sections, averaging the two outer thirds (cell periphery), and dividing that average by the area underneath the central portion (cell interior).RESULTSIdentification of a Novel Truncated SK3 Isoform, SK3-1C— Multiple ESTs encoding a novel isoform of SK3 were discovered during a BLAST search of GenBank™ with the human SK3 sequence (AJ251016). These ESTs were derived primarily from Burkitt's lymphoma (accession nos: AL560989, BE397619, BE562092, BE513322, BE397440) and lymphoid tissues including germinal center B cells (AA490752, AW499701, AA284005, AA256031) and spleen (BQ710272).

Here it is shown that this control system extends to genes for other enzymes of one-carbon metabolism and de novo purine biosynthesis. Northern analysis of the response to glycine demonstrated that the induction of the GCV genes and the induction of other amino acid metabolism genes are temporally distinct. The genome-wide response to glycine revealed that several other genes are rapidly co-induced with the GCV genes, including SHM2, which encodes cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase. These results were refined by examining transcript levels in an shm2Δ strain (in which cytoplasmic 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate levels are reduced) and a met13Δ strain, which lacks the main methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase activity of yeast and is effectively blocked at consumption of 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate for methionine synthesis. Glycine addition also caused a substantial transient disturbance to metabolism, including a sequence of changes in induction of amino acid biosynthesis and respiratory chain genes. Analysis of the glycine response in the shm2Δ strain demonstrated that apart from the one-carbon regulon, most of these transient responses were not contingent on a disturbance to one-carbon metabolism. The one-carbon response is distinct from the Bas1p purine biosynthesis regulon and thus represents the first example of transcriptional regulation in response to activated one-carbon status. Glycine specifically induces genes encoding subunits of the glycine decarboxylase complex (GCV1, GCV2, and GCV3), and this is mediated by a fall in cytoplasmic levels of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate caused by inhibition of cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase.

The one-carbon response is distinct from the Bas1p purine biosynthesis regulon and thus represents the first example of transcriptional regulation in response to activated one-carbon status. One-carbon metabolism is a key pathway involved in providing single carbon units for the biosynthesis of purines, thymidylates, serine, methionine, and N-formylmethionyl tRNA. The importance of this pathway is highlighted by the large number of human diseases and disorders associated with folate deficiency and disturbances to folate-mediated reactions (1Lucock M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis is also the target of several drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer treatment, whereas microbial folate biosynthesis is inhibited by folate analogs such as the sulfonamide antibacterial agents (2Morgan S.L. Baggot J.E. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 405-433Google Scholar, 3Dax S.L. Antibacterial Chemotherapeutic Agents. 1st Ed. Blackie Academic and Professional, London & New York1997: 38-73Crossref Google Scholar). One-carbon units are activated by attachment at various oxidation states to the carrier molecule tetrahydrofolate (H4folate). 1The abbreviations used are: H4folate, tetrahydrofolate; 5-HCO-H4folate, 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate; 10-HCO-H4folate, 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH2-H4folate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; Dmin, glucose minimal medium; GDC, glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex; MTHFR, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase. They are derived principally from the reactions catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), which cleaves serine to generate 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-H4folate) and glycine (Fig. 1, reactions 1 and 2) (4Schirch V. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1984: 399-431Google Scholar). They can also be generated from formate, via synthesis of 10-HCO-H4folate by the synthetase activity of the C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase enzymes (Fig. 1, reactions 4c and 6c) (5McKenzie K.Q. Jones E.W. Genetics. 1977; 86: 85-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or as 5,10-CH2-H4folate from glycine cleavage by the mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) (Fig. 1, reaction 3) (6Ogur M. Liu T.N. Cheung I. Paulavicius I. Wales W. Mehnert D. Blaise D. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 926-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One-carbon unit activation occurs in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion, but one-carbon-substituted H4folate derivatives are not directly exchanged between compartments to any significant extent (7Horne D.W. Patterson D. Cook R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The intercompartmental flow of one-carbon units is instead maintained by the movement of serine, glycine, and formate, which are interconverted by the one-carbon metabolic enzyme activities duplicated in the cytosol and mitochondrion. One-carbon metabolism therefore operates as a flexible system whereby different sources and locations of one-carbon units can supplement and substitute for each other in order to maintain the supply to anabolic pathways (8Kastanos E.K. Woldman Y.K. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14956-14964Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 9Barlowe C.K. Appling D.R. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar, 10Pasternack L.B. Laude D.A. Appling D.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8713-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GCV1, GCV2, and GCV3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode the protein subunits that are unique to the glycine decarboxylase complex. The fourth subunit, lipoamide dehydrogenase, is present in several other multienzyme complexes (11Dickinson J.R. Roy D.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These genes are up-regulated following addition of glycine to the medium (12Nagarajan L. Storms R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4444-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13McNeil J.B. Zhang F.-R. Taylor B.V. Sinclair D.A. Pearlman R.E. Bognar A.L. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 186: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Sinclair D.A. Hong S.-P. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) via a glycine response element with the consensus sequence CATCN7CTTCTT (15Hong S.P. Piper M.D. Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10523-10532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Previously, it was demonstrated that this glycine effect is a response to a decrease in cytosolic 5,10-CH2-H4folate levels rather than directly to glycine (16Piper M.D. Hong S.-P. Ball G.E. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30987-30995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This was proposed to reflect inhibition of SHMT through the formation of a “dead-end” complex with glycine and 5-HCO-H4folate (17Girgis S. Suh J.R. Jolivet J. Stover P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli and in mammalian liver tissue 5-HCO-H4folate is formed by a side reaction of SHMT in the presence of glycine (19Stover P. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14227-14233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results raised the possibility that the one-carbon response of the GCV genes reflects a more general system controlling transcription of one-carbon metabolism genes. In this study, microarray analysis was used to characterize the transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae to the addition of glycine. A sequence of regulatory responses was identified that indicated extensive transient physiological effects of the change, including disturbance to amino acid and mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and purine biosynthesis were temporally co-regulated over the time course. Further refinement of the genes included in this regulon was obtained by microarray analysis of strains deleted for the genes encoding the key one-carbon metabolism enzymes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, encoded by MET13) and cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cytoplasmic SHMT, encoded by SHM2) (20Raymond R.K. Kastanos E.K. Appling D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21McNeil J.B. McIntosh E.M. Taylor B.V. Zhang F.R. Tang S. Bognar A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9155-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the regulon was found to include genes involved in purine nucleotide biosynthesis, the glycine response of a GCV2::lacZ fusion construct in strains deleted for the BAS1 and GCN4 genes was examined.

HinnebuschH122MATa; ino1-113, ura3-52, CAN1R, gcn4-103; bas1ΔThis study Open table in a new tab Glucose minimal medium (Dmin) contained 2% (w/v) d-glucose, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), and 0.5% ammonium sulfate. Auxotrophic requirements were added at 40 mg/liter, except for uracil, which was added at 80 mg/liter. For the microarray experiments using strains from the BY4743 series, 40 mg/liter methionine and adenine were also added to all media. Where indicated, glycine was added to a final medium concentration of 10 mm. For microarray analysis of the response to glycine in strain BWG1-7A, yeast were grown in Dmin at 30 °C to an A600 of 1.0 and then diluted by half into either Dmin or Dmin plus glycine. Samples were subsequently harvested at eight time points over 4 h and poured onto -80 °C crushed ice prior to centrifugation. For the equivalent Northern analysis, parallel control samples were harvested, whereas for the microarray experiment a pooled zero time reference control was harvested as well as a 2-h growth control culture without added glycine. For microarray analyses of the shm2Δ, met13Δ, and BY4743 strains, triplicate cultures were grown as above to an A600 of 0.5 before harvesting. For the glycine response in shm2Δ and BY4743, cultures were grown as above to an A600 of 0.5, divided in two at zero time, and 20% (w/v) glycine stock solution was added to 1 aliquot such that the final glycine concentration was 10 mm. The glycine-treated and control cultures were further split into triplicate samples, which were harvested after 2 h. Northern blot confirmation of microarray observations was also performed in this way, except samples from control and glycine-treated cultures were harvested 18 min and 2 h after zero time. For the analysis of GCV2::lacZ expression constructs, cells were grown in Dmin to an A600 of 0.9-1.0, then diluted in an equal volume of fresh Dmin or Dmin plus glycine, and harvested after 2 h. Total RNA was extracted by the AE-phenol procedure described in Schmitt et al. (22Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). For microarray analyses, this was followed by on-column DNase I digestion and clean-up using an RNeasy kit from Qiagen. RNA purity and integrity were checked by UV spectrophotometry and denaturing agarose-gel electrophoresis. Northern Analysis—Northern blotting was performed as described in Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-47.50Google Scholar). Probes were generated by random primer labeling of PCR-amplified 1-kb regions of the ACT1, ADE1, ARG4, CYT1, GCV1, GCV2, GCV3, and SHM2 open reading frames with [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hybridization and pre-hybridization were performed at 65 °C in RapidHyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences). Membrane-bound radioactivity was quantified using a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager. Microarray Production—S. cerevisiae oligonucleotide microarrays were obtained from the Ramaciotti Centre for Gene Function Analysis (Sydney, Australia) and consisted of 40-mer oligonucleotide probes for 6,250 yeast open reading frames (MWG Biotec) printed in duplicate on epoxy-coated glass microarray slides (Eppendorf). Slides were processed by baking at 120 °C and blocking with ethylene glycol on the same day as hybridization according to the substrate manufacturer's instructions. cDNA Synthesis, Labeling, and Hybridization—cDNA synthesis and labeling were carried out according to a modification of the amino-allyl dye-coupling protocol (24Hughes T.R. Mao M. Jones A.R. Burchard J. Marton M.J. Shannon K.W. Lefkowitz S.M. Ziman M. Schelter J.M. Meyer M.R. Kobayashi S. Davis C. Dai H. He Y.D. Stephaniants S.B. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from 20 μ g of total RNA by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) by using a 2:1 mixture of 5-(3-aminoallyl)-uridine 5′-triphosphate (Sigma) to dTTP and the RNA subsequently hydrolyzed with NaOH. cDNA was purified using QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and labeled with N -hydroxysuccinimide esters of either Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed at 37 °C for 14-16 h in DIG EasyHyb (Roche Diagnostics) with 0.5 mg/ml E. coli tRNA and 0.5 mg/ml herring sperm DNA. The slides were washed 3 times in 1× SSC (0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.015 m trisodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, followed by rinsing in 1× SSC, dried by centrifugation, and scanned in an Applied Precision ArrayWoRx E Biochip Reader. For time course analysis of the glycine response in strain BWG1-7A, each slide was prepared in technical duplicate, using reciprocal labeling. A culture without added glycine was treated identically as a growth control; this did not show any significant expression changes over the 4-h period. For the comparison between deletion mutant strains, each replicate sample from the BY4743, shm2Δ, and met13Δ cultures was hybridized to one microarray slide, using a pooled wild-type sample as the reference control. For the glycine response of the BY4743 and shm2Δ strains, each replicate glycine-treated sample was co-hybridized with a replicate control sample. Data Analysis—Microarray image analysis was performed in GenePix Pro 3.0 (Axon Instruments) followed by normalizing the fluorescence intensities by the LOWESS method in GeneSpring 5.0 (Silicon Genetics). Welch's analysis of variance (with a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction) was used to determine which genes showed significantly changed expression either at any time point after glycine addition or in any sample of the experiments using mutant strains. Genes showing significant expression changes were hierarchically clustered by using the program Cluster (25Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar) using complete linkage clustering of the uncentered Pearson's correlation coefficient. The output of a one-dimensional self-organizing map was used to determine leaf order in the dendrograms. When clustering across experiments, to compensate for the differences in sample number each sample was weighted such that the combined weight of samples from a single experiment was one. Web-based FunSpec software was used to detect cluster nodes that were enriched for genes with particular functional annotations (26Robinson M.D. Grigull J. Mohammad N. Hughes T.R. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Normalized data and cluster results are available at www.genomics.unsw.edu.au/microarray/data/gelling. Hexamer motifs (with up to two degenerate positions) that were over-represented 800 bp upstream of genes from the one-carbon regulon were detected using Yeast Motif Finder and FindExplanator (27Sinha S.

The cellular response to glycine addition includes induction of the GCV genes, which encode the specific subunits of the glycine decarboxylase complex (14Sinclair D.A. Hong S.-P. Dawes I.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Hong S.P. Piper M.D. Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol.

Given the central role of H4folate intermediates in one-carbon metabolism, it was proposed that this novel “glycine response” might represent a more general one-carbon metabolic transcriptional control system (regulon). To test this hypothesis it was necessary to identify all genes whose transcription is altered by the addition of glycine coordinately with the induction of the GCV genes. Kinetics of the Transcriptional Response to Glycine Addition in GCV1, GCV2, and GCV3—In order to establish the kinetics of induction of the GCV genes, temporal changes in the transcript levels of GCV1, GCV2, and GCV3 following glycine addition were examined by Northern analysis. Glycine (to 10 mm) was added to cultures of S. cerevisiae strain BWG1-7A growing in minimal medium, and samples were taken at intervals. The results in Fig. 2 show that induction of each of the GCV genes occurred with similar kinetics. Glycine induction began within 30 min, reached a maximal level within an hour, and remained at an elevated level with a slight decline from maximal induction after 4 h. Glycine has several different metabolic fates; it can act as a nitrogen and/or a one-carbon unit source, or it can be used in protein synthesis and other biosynthetic processes (purine, glutathione, and heme biosynthesis). Induction of the one-carbon regulon is therefore probably not the only transcriptional response to glycine addition. Indeed, addition of glycine also resulted in induction of the ARG4 gene, which is a member of the Gcn4p-mediated response to changes in amino acid availability (32Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, the timing of ARG4 induction was distinct from the response of the GCV genes (Fig. 2), indicating that a time course analysis can distinguish the one-carbon regulon from other changes mediated by glycine addition. The Genome-wide Transcriptional Response to Glycine Addition—For genome-wide analysis of the response to glycine, cells were grown to mid-exponential phase; glycine was added at zero time, and samples were harvested at intervals up to 240 min. The zero time sample was used on each slide as a reference. 949 genes showed a significant change in expression at some time after addition of glycine. Hierarchical clustering (Fig. 3A) identified groups of genes that were temporally co-regulated. Genes that showed expression changes greater than 2-fold in a 2-h growth control sample are provided as Supplemental Material and results from the glycine-treated samples were interpreted with reference to these data. The hierarchical cluster dendrogram (Fig. 3A) revealed blocks of genes with similar temporal expression profiles. By identifying nodes of the dendrogram that were significantly enriched for genes with related functions, it was possible to reconstruct a sequence of transcriptional responses to glycine. The results for selected nodes are shown in Table II. Responses detected in this way were also examined by comparing the cluster expression profile to the average expression profile of genes with a corresponding functional annotation (Fig. 4).Table IIOver-represented functional categories among genes co-regulated in response to glycine (nodes of dendrogram in Fig. 3A)Node (Fig. 3A)p valueaRepresents the approximate probability that the cluster would contain the observed number of genes from a particular functional annotation by chance.Genes in node from functional category% node% genomeSize of nodeaGO biological processbFunctional categories from the Gene Ontology™ Consortium (GO) (www.geneontology.org).Amino acid biosynthesis (GO:0008652)2.10 × 10−10ARO3 TRP5 HIS5 ARG3 CPA2 ARG1 ORT1 ASN138.11.421Arginine biosynthesisbFunctional categories from the Gene Ontology™ Consortium (GO) (www.geneontology.org).

Open table in a new tab Glycine addition caused extensive changes to the yeast transcriptome. Within 30 min of glycine addition, genes involved in formation and function of the respiratory chain were induced, and remained so for the duration of the time course (Fig. 3A, node b; Table II), despite the fact that cultures were grown under fermentative conditions. The glycine induction of a representative respiratory gene CYT1, encoding cytochrome c1, was confirmed by separate Northern analysis (Fig. 5). Several stress-responsive genes also were strongly induced after 1 h, and then their expression decreased (Fig. 3A, node c; Table II). Amino acid biosynthesis genes, particularly those from the arginine pathway, were transiently induced after 1 h (Fig. 3A, node a; Table II), consistent with the timing of ARG4 expression obtained from the Northern analysis (Fig. 2). Although this temporal pattern was not evident for all known amino acid biosynthetic genes (data not shown), it was apparent when those genes shown by Natarajan et al. (33Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) to be induced during mild leucine/histidine starvation were considered. These genes presumably represent those most highly induced by amino acid starvation. Glycine addition also led to a transient down-regulation of ribosome biogenesis (Fig. 3A, nodes e and f; Table II). Genes involved in transcription and processing of rRNA were repressed 30 min after glycine addition and remained so for 2 h. Ribosomal protein genes showed a similar pattern, with a 30-min delay from the initial repression of rRNA-processing genes. Rapid Induction of One-carbon Metabolism and Purine Biosynthesis Genes following Glycine Addition—The most rapid response identified was induction of genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and purine biosynthesis 10 min after glycine addition. Only a small number of genes showed strong expression changes in the first 10 min. Of the eight genes that showed significant change and greater than 2-fold induction at this time point, five have known functions in one-carbon metabolism or a one-carbon unit-dependent process. In addition to being rapidly induced, the one-carbon metabolism genes were also co-regulated over the rest of the time course together with purine biosynthesis genes. These were in a set that showed rapid induction followed by maintenance of the new transcript levels over 4 h (Fig. 3A, node d). Glycine induction of ADE1 and SHM2 was confirmed by Northern analysis (Fig. 5). Temporal co-regulation of this set of genes (Fig. 3A, node d) with GCV1, GCV2, and GCV3 strongly implies that they represent at least part of a one-carbon regulon. However, some of these genes are of unknown function or have no obvious connection to one-carbon metabolism. Additional evidence to support this, including a gene in the one-carbon regulon, could be obtained by observing its expression across a number of different disturbances affecting the balance of one-carbon metabolism. GCV2 expression is decreased, but still glycine-responsive, in a met13 strain, which lacks the main methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase activity of the cell (16Piper M.D. Hong S.-P. Ball G.E. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30987-30995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The effect of this mutation is thus to reduce synthesis of 5-CH3-H4folate from 5,10-CH2-H4folate. Conversely, expression of GCV2 was constitutively high and showed no further induction upon glycine addition in an shm2 strain, which had reduced cytosolic levels of 5,10-CH2-H4folate. If the members of the one-carbon regulon are indeed regulated by levels of cytoplasmic 5,10-CH2-H4folate, they should show similar responses in these mutants. Co-regulation of One-carbon Metabolism and Purine Biosynthesis Genes under Conditions of Altered 5,10-CH2-H4folate—Transcript levels in cells grown in minimal medium of strains deleted for the SHM2 and MET13 genes were therefore compared with those in the isogenic wild-type in the homozygous diploid BY4743 background. Microarray analyses of the glycine response in both the BY4743 wild-type and the otherwise isogenic shm2Δ strain were also performed. Northern analysis in this wild-type strain demonstrated that transcription of both ADE1 and SHM2 was induced 2 h after glycine addition (Fig. 6), and hence cultures were harvested at this time. Because the met13Δ strain is a methionine auxotroph, and the shm2Δ strain is a partial adenine auxotroph (20Raymond R.K. Kastanos E."

In this report, we identify one such protein encoded by the FLJ10193 open reading frame as a new subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. Materials—Anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibodies, anti-Myc (C-3956) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, anti-FLAG (M2) agarose, and FLAG peptide were purchased from Sigma.

Light chain-specific anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories and labeled with Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Super-Signal West Dura extended duration substrate and SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate were obtained from Pierce. Glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow and Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-FLAG Agarose Chromatography—Anti-FLAG agarose immunoaffinity chromatography was carried out essentially as described for purification of the TRAP·SMCC Mediator complex (10Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (11Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar). Undialyzed nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG (M2) agarose beads in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100 for at least 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times with a 50-fold excess of the same buffer and once with a 50-fold excess of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100. Beads were then eluted with 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide. All buffers contained 1:1000-fold dilution of Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma catalog number P8340). Mass Spectrometry—Identification of proteins was accomplished using a modification of the MudPIT procedure described by Washburn et al. (12Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4079) Google Scholar). Aliquots of anti-FLAG agarose eluates were brought to 100 μl with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and H2O to a final concentration of 100 mm Tris-HCl. Solid urea was added to 8 m. Proteins were reduced with 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, Roche), alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide (IAM, Sigma), and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche) for at least 6 h at 37 °C. Proteins were then diluted 4 times 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and digested overnight at 37 °C with modified Trypsin (Roche) in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. Peptide mixtures were pressure-loaded onto a 250 μm inner diameter (i.d.) fused-silica capillary packed first with 4 cm of 5 μm strong cation exchange material (Partisphere SCX, Whatman), followed by 2 cm of 5 μm C18 reverse phase particles (Aqua, Phenomenex). Loaded and washed microcapillaries were connected via a 2 μm filtered union (UpChurch Scientific) to a 100 μm i.d. column, which had been pulled to a 5 μm i.d. tip using a P-2000 CO2 laser puller (Sutter Instruments), then packed with 10 cm of reverse phase particles and equilibrated in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (Buffer A). This split-column was then installed in-line with a Quaternary Agilent 1100 series HPLC pump. Overflow tubing was used to decrease the flow rate from 0.1 ml/min to about 200-300 nl/min. Fully automated 6 step chromatography runs were carried out. Three different elution buffers were used: Buffer A; 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (Buffer B); and 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (Buffer C). In such sequences of chromatographic events, peptides are sequentially eluted from the SCX resin to the reverse phase resin by increasing salt steps (increase in Buffer C concentration), followed by organic gradients (increase in Buffer B concentration). The last chromatography step consists in a high salt wash with 100% Buffer C followed by the acetonitrile gradient. The application of a 2.5 kV distal voltage electrosprayed the eluting peptides directly into a Deca-XP ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoFinnigan). Full MS spectra were recorded on the peptides over a 400 to 1,600 m/z range, followed by three tandem mass (MS/MS) events sequentially generated in a data-dependent manner on the first, second, and third most intense ions selected from the full MS spectrum (at 35% collision energy).

SEQUEST (14Eng J.K. McCormick A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass.

The validity of peptide/spectrum matches was assessed using the SEQUEST-defined parameters, cross-correlation score (XCorr) and normalized difference in cross-correlation scores (DeltCn). Spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.08 and minimum XCorr of 1.8 for +1, 2.5 for +2, and 3.5 for +3 spectra. In addition, the peptides had to be at least 7 amino acids long. DTASelect (15Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J.

Our most highly purified rat Mediator contained many previously characterized mammalian Mediator subunits, as well as a collection of potential Mediator subunits including the p28b, Surf5, LCMR1, HSPC296, and mammalian Intersex proteins, which we subsequently demonstrated are bona fide subunits of the mammalian Mediator complex (8Sato S.

Among the collection of additional proteins present in our most highly purified rat Mediator fractions and identified by mass spectrometry was a 142-amino acid protein encoded by the FLJ10193 open reading frame (Fig. 1A). PSI-BLAST searches of the NCBI protein data base indicates that the FLJ10193 protein has diverged substantially during evolution, with obvious FLJ10193 orthologs in insects, but not in more distantly related species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and yeast. The N-terminal ∼50 amino acids of FLJ10193 diverge significantly even between human and mouse; in contrast, the C-terminal ∼80 amino acids is highly conserved from mammals to insects, suggesting that it may represent the functional core of the protein. Multiple sequence alignments of the FLJ10193 protein with yeast Mediator subunits identified two short regions of FLJ10193 with some similarity to S. cerevisiae Mediator subunit Cse2 (Fig. 1B), raising the possibility that FLJ10193 and Cse2 may be related. Notably, like the sequence of the FLJ10193 protein, the sequence of Cse2 has diverged substantially during evolution, with apparent Cse2 orthologs in yeasts closely related to S. cerevisiae, but not in more distantly related yeasts such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida, and Neurospora. Below we present direct biochemical evidence that the FLJ10193 protein, which we designate Med25, is a previously unrecognized subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex with features similar to those of yeast Mediator subunit Cse2. To begin to address the possibility that the Med25 protein is a component of the mammalian Mediator complex, we sought to identify Med25-associating proteins. To accomplish this, we took advantage of four HeLa cell lines stably expressing either human Mediator subunit Nut2 (10Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), mouse Mediator subunit LCMR1 (16Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Banks C.A. Parmely T.J. Sorokina I. Brower C.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49671-49674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), human Mediator subunit Intersex (16Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Banks C.A. Parmely T.J. Sorokina I. Brower C.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49671-49674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or the mouse Med25 protein, all with N-terminal FLAG epitope tags. The FLAG-Nut2 expressing cell line has been used extensively for preparation of the transcriptionally active TRAP/SMCC Mediator complex (10Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and we have previously used HeLa cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged mouse LCMR1 and FLAG-tagged human Intersex as sources for anti-FLAG immunoaffinity purification of the mammalian Mediator complex (16Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Banks C.A. Parmely T.J. Sorokina I. Brower C.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49671-49674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts prepared from equivalent numbers of parental, FLAG-Nut2, FLAG-LCMR1, FLAG-Intersex, and FLAG-Med25 expressing HeLa cells were subjected to anti-FLAG agarose chromatography as described previously for purification of the TRAP·SMCC Mediator complex (10Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As shown in the silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of Fig. 2, anti-FLAG agarose eluate from FLAG-Med25 expressing HeLa cells appeared to include a very similar set of proteins as the TRAP·SMCC Mediator complex purified from FLAG-Nut2, FLAG-LCMR1, or FLAG-hIntersex expressing HeLa cells. In addition, analysis of Med25-associating proteins present in the anti-FLAG agarose eluate from FLAG-Med25 expressing HeLa cells by tandem mass spectrometry (Table I in Supplemental Material) and by Western blotting (Fig. 3) identified nearly all of the mammalian Mediator subunits known to be present in the TRAP·SMCC Mediator complex, arguing that Med25 is a previously unrecognized subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex. The Med25 protein was detected by Western blotting only in anti-FLAG agarose eluates from FLAG-Med25 and FLAG-Intersex expressing HeLa cells. Med25 was, however, detected by tandem mass spectrometry in anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from all four HeLa stable cell lines, but not from parental HeLa cells (Table II in Supplemental Material). These observations suggest that the Med25 protein is present at varying levels in these different Mediator preparations. Finally, and consistent with previous findings indicating that the mammalian Mediator complex binds to and can be purified through interactions with the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (4Naar A.M. Beaurang P.A. Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 10Malik S. Gu W. Wu W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we observe that the Med25 protein can be purified together with other Mediator subunits from nuclear extracts of FLAG-Med25 expressing HeLa cells by GST-VP16 chromatography. As shown in the Western blot of Fig. 4, the Med25 protein and representative Mediator subunits Cdk8, Med8, Med6, and TRAP36 are copurified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts using immobilized GST-VP16, but not GST. Thus, the Med25 protein copurifies with the mammalian Mediator complex by several independent methods, arguing that it is a bona fide Mediator subunit.Fig. 3The Med25 protein is present in the purified TRAP·SMCC Mediator complex. Anti-FLAG agarose immunoaffinity chromatography of nuclear extracts from HeLa cells or FLAG-Nut2, FLAG-LCMR1, FLAG-Intersex, and FLAG-Med25 expressing HeLa cells was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of anti-FLAG eluates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis in 4-20% gradient gels, and proteins were visualized by Western blotting with antibodies recognizing the Mediator subunits indicated in the figure. Western blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and Super-Signal West Dura extended duration substrate.

(11Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar). The glutathione-Sepharose beads were then washed 7 times with a 50-fold excess of the same buffer containing 0.5 m KCl, and bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.12 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm glutathione. Aliquots of glutathione-Sepharose eluates were analyzed by 10% or 13% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by Western blotting with antibodies recognizing the Mediator subunits indicated in the figure.

To accomplish this, we began by exploiting a convenient screen (8Sato S. Tomomori-Sato C. Banks C.A. Sorokina I. Parmely T.J. Kong S.E. Jin J. Cai Y. Lane W.S. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15123-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to assess the ability of Med25 to interact with known mammalian Mediator subunits prepared by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. pcDNA3.1 expression vectors encoding the known mammalian Mediator subunits and additional proteins indicated in Fig. 5 were used to program rabbit reticulocyte lysates for translation of 35S-labeled Mediator proteins. Binding of 35S-labeled Mediator proteins to a GST-Med25 fusion protein was assayed in GST pull-down experiments using glutathione-agarose beads, and bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The results of this screen revealed significant and reproducible binding of Med25 to Mediator subunit TRAP36 (Fig. 5), the mammalian ortholog of yeast Mediator subunit Med4. Notably, in a previous study, S. cerevisiae Mediator subunit Cse2 was found to interact directly only with yeast Mediator subunit Med4 (17Kang J.S. Kim S.H. Hwang M.S. Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42003-42010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that Med25 and Cse2 may be functionally related. To confirm and extend this finding, we sought to reconstitute the Med25-TRAP36 interaction detected in in vitro translation experiments in transiently transfected human 293T cells and with recombinant proteins expressed in Sf21 insect cells and E. coli. As shown in Fig. 6A, the TRAP36 protein could be coimmunoprecipitated with the Med25 protein from lysates of 293T cells cotransfected with pcDNA3.1 expression vectors encoding TRAP36 and Med25. In addition, direct pairwise binding of Med25 to TRAP36 was detected following their coexpression in Sf21 cells (Fig. 6B) and in E. coli (Fig. 6C), arguing that Med25 binds directly to TRAP36 and may be recruited to the Mediator complex through this interaction. In summary, in this report we identify the previously uncharacterized FLJ10193 protein as a new mammalian Mediator subunit designated Med25. Although lower eukaryotic orthologs of the Med25 protein have not yet been unequivocally identified, our findings have brought to light structural and functional similarities between Med25 and yeast Mediator subunit Cse2. First, Med25 exhibits limited sequence similarity with Cse2. Second, like Cse2, the Med25 protein forms a heterodimer with Mediator subunit Med4 (or TRAP36 in mammals) and thus may be recruited to the “middle module” of the mammalian Mediator complex through its interaction with Med4. Whether Med25 fulfills a similar role as Cse2 in Mediator, however, remains to be determined. We thank W. S. Lane for assistance with mass spectrometry. We also thank R. G. Roeder and S.

Hyman B.T. Graham D.I. Lantos P.L. Greenfield's Neuropathology. Vol. II. Arnold, New York2002: 195-272Google Scholar). The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides consist predominately of 40-42 amino acid residues derived from amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP) proteolysis. Rare, familial mutations both within the Aβ coding domain and flanking N- and C- terminal regions have been described that result in Aβ deposition, dementia, and in some cases hemorrhagic stroke (2Miravalle L.

One of the best characterized forms of FAD is the Val → Phe mutation at position 717 of the AβPP (AβPP770 isoform numbering), a rare mutation expressed in a single family (5Murrell J. Farlow M. Ghetti B. Benson M.D. Sci. 1991; 254: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Neurological disease is clinically manifested in relatively young individuals who become demented in their late thirties to early forties and die at about fifty years of age (6Farlow M. Murrell J.

This mutation is of great biological importance since it has been utilized to construct an AβPP transgenic (Tg) mouse in combination with the platelet-derived growth factor promoter to enhance Aβ production and amyloid deposition (8Games D.

Nature. 1999; 400: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Known as the PDAPP Tg mouse, the model is widely employed in academic and industrial settings to study fundamental Aβ peptide chemistry and amyloid pathophysiology (8Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R. Berthelette P. Blackwell C. Carr T. Clemens J. Donaldson T. Gillespie F. Guido T. Hagopian S. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Lee M. Leibowitz P. Lieberburg I. Little S. Masliah E. McConlogue L.

Nature. 1995; 373: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). The PDAPP Tg mice reproduce some of the pathological features observed in AD such as senile plaques with amyloid cores, dystrophic neurites, synaptic loss, astrogliosis, and microgliosis but lack any detectable neurofibrillary tangle pathology (10Masliah E. Sisk A. Mallory M. Mucke L. Schenk D. Games D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5795-5811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Morphologically, three unique pathological features distinguish AβPP V717F individuals from sporadic AD cases, 1) the generation of flocculent amyloid plaques, 2) an almost complete absence of compact amyloid cores, and 3) an enormous production of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The extreme scarcity of AβPP V717F individuals has precluded a biochemical comparison between the amyloid peptides deposited in these FAD cases and those present in sporadic AD. Because several important AβPP Tg mice models employ this specific mutation to mimic AD amyloid production and deposition, it is critical to establish the precise chemical nature of the Aβ peptides in both humans and AβPP Tg mice. We characterized the Aβ-related peptides derived from three FAD individuals carrying the AβPP V717F mutation and compared them to the Aβ peptides characteristic of sporadic AD patients. Our experiments revealed that the biochemical and pathological attributes of AβPP V717F FAD amyloid differ significantly from those characteristic of sporadic AD. The presence of the AβPP Phe substitution at position Aβ46 (Aβ numbering) 4-6 amino acids beyond the normal Aβ peptide wild-type C-terminal Ala-42 or Val-40 residues results in the generation of longer and more hydrophobic Aβ peptides than those that exist in sporadic AD patients. These extended-length Aβ peptides are associated with clinical and pathological manifestations vastly different from sporadic AD. Human Subjects—All three subjects investigated in the present report were demented, belonged to the same family, and were heterozygous for the FAD autosomic dominant Val → Phe mutation at position 717 of the AβPP770. A complete description of the family pedigree is given in Farlow et al. (6Farlow M. Murrell J. Ghetti B. Unverzagt F. Zeldenrust S. Benson M. Neurology. 1994; 44: 105-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patient A, a female, was diagnosed with AD at age 43 and died at age 53. Patient B, a male, was diagnosed with AD at age 39 and died at age 45. Patient C, a female, was diagnosed with AD at age 40 and died at age 49. The brain regions used in this study were frontal and parietal cortex (patient A), superior and middle frontal gyri (patient B), and occipital leptomeninges (patient C). The postmortem delays were 19, 4, and 3 h for patients A, B, and C, respectively. All three patients were homozygous for apolipoprotein E ϵ3. Isolation of Parenchymal Amyloid—Approximately 10 g of cerebral cortex from patient A and 13 g from patient B were dissected from underlying white matter. The leptomeninges overlying the cerebral cortex were removed, and the gray matter was minced and divided into two equal portions that were subjected to two different amyloid purification protocols. Protocol A—The gray matter was homogenized in 10 volumes of TBS buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 1% SDS) to which 1 tablet of enzyme inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) per 100 ml of buffer was added. An equal volume of a 4% SDS solution prepared in the same buffer was added to yield a final concentration of 2.5%. After 4 h of gentle stirring, the homogenate was filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh to eliminate most of the larger blood vessels and centrifuged 2 h at 135,000 × g (Beckman SW 28 rotor) at 20 °C. The resulting pellets were suspended in 100 ml of TBS buffer and passed through a 50-μm nylon mesh, and the filtrate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. This pellet contained a large amount of smaller blood vessels and NFT. The supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h at 275,000 × g (Beckman SW 41 rotor), and the supernatant was filtered through a 37-μm nylon mesh. The pellets were suspended, and washed with 10 ml of distilled water, and centrifuged at 275,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellets were dissolved in 10 ml of 90% glass-distilled formic acid (GDFA), divided into in 500-μl samples, and centrifuged at 480,000 × g for 15 min (Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor). The supernatants were stored at -85 °C and subsequently chromatographed at room temperature on a FPLC Superose 12 size-exclusion column (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 80% GDFA at a flow rate of 15 ml/h and monitored at 280 nm. Fractions corresponding to the 2.5-9-kDa mass range were collected and pooled followed by the addition of 5 μl of 2% aqueous betaine (Sigma). The FPLC columns had been previously calibrated using a reversed Aβ amino acid sequence (Aβ residues 40-1). Protocol B—Approximately 13 g of cerebral cortex was dissolved in 66 ml of 90% GDFA and thoroughly dissolved using a glass homogenizer. The lysed tissue was loaded into 6 polyallomer tubes (14 × 89 mm) and centrifuged at 275,000 × g (Beckman SW 41 rotor) for 1 h at 10 °C. The thick fatty layer floating at the top of the tube was carefully avoided, and the supernatant was removed by aspiration while also avoiding the small pellet at the bottom of the tube. The supernatant was divided into 500-μl aliquots and submitted to FPLC using the conditions described for Protocol A. Fractions encompassing a 2.5-9.0-kDa mass range were collected, and volumes were reduced by vacuum centrifugation to ∼50 μl and stored at -85 °C. Isolation of Leptomeningeal Vascular Amyloid—The leptomeninges were gently separated from the brain surface of patient C and washed extensively with cold distilled water to eliminate all traces of blood. During this process vessels larger than 500 μm in diameter were dissected and eliminated since in our experience they do not contain detectable thioflavine S staining cerebrovascular amyloid deposits (11Weller R.O. Massey A. Newman T.A. Hutchings M. Kuo Y.M. Roher A.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 725-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The washed leptomeningeal vessels were finely minced and submitted to 90% GDFA extraction and disruption in a glass homogenizer, which was followed by sieving through a nylon mesh (37 μm). The resulting filtrate was centrifuged at 275,000 × g for 1 h at 10 °C, and the supernatant was subjected to FPLC following the protocol described above. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—The FPLC fractions containing the Aβ peptides were further separated on a Thermo Separation Products HPLC (Schaumburg, IL) using a Zorbax 300 SB C8 column (300-Å pore, 5-μm particle size, 6.4 × 250 mm; Mac-Mod, Chadds Ford, PA) employing a 2-solvent system (A: water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; B: acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The column was equilibrated with 20% solvent B. For a single HPLC experiment, 5 FPLC runs, each reduced to a volume of ∼50 μl, were pooled, and 100 μl of 80% GDFA (to enhance solubility) and 150 μl of water were added just before loading onto the column (total of 500 μl of loading loop capacity). The chromatography was developed with a linear gradient as follows: 0-15 min at 20% B; 16-75 min at 20-40% B; 76-135 min at 40-100% B. During the whole procedure the column was maintained at a constant temperature of 80 °C using an LKB 2155 column oven (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatographic separations were followed by monitoring UV absorbance at 214 nm. Immuno Dot Blot—A polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was soaked in methanol for 10 s, then immersed in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.9% NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and sandwiched between a multiwell bio-dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) connected to a vacuum line. Into each of the wells 450 μl of each of the collected FPLC or HPLC fractions was deposited, and the fluid was removed by vacuum. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.9% NaCl) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated at room temperature with a 1:500 dilution of the anti-Aβ antibodies 4G8 and 6E10 (Signet, Dedham, MA) for 2 h and rinsed 6 times with TBS-T and 2 times with TBS. The membrane was then incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce). After repeating the washes as indicated above, the reactive proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detecting reagents (Amersham Biosciences) following the steps indicated by the manufacturer. Enzymatic Digestion and Cyanogen Bromide Cleavage—The chromatographic fractions containing Aβ peptides that were separated by high temperature HPLC were pooled from several runs and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation to an ∼1-ml volume. The specimens were dialyzed (SpectraPor 6 membrane 2000-Da cutoff) against water for 1 h followed by 2 changes of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Once equilibrated, the specimens were digested with freshly prepared trypsin (∼10 μg/ml) for 16 h at 37 °C. To minimize hydrophobic peptide losses, all the fractionated peptides were collected and hydrolyzed in polypropylene tubes. To facilitate the separation of long nonpolar peptides and reduce hydrophobicity, the Aβ peptides were further cleaved at Met residues by cyanogen bromide (CNBr) in the presence of 80% GDFA for 16 h at room temperature. The volumes of the resulting tryptic- and CNBr-digested peptides were subsequently reduced in a rotary evaporator. Peptides were separated by HPLC using the same equipment as above on a Zorbax C8 SB (300-Å pore, 5-μm particle size, 6.4 × 250 mm; Mac-Mod) column at room temperature using a 2-solvent system (A: water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; B: acetonitrile, isopropanol (1:2 volume/volume) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). After equilibration with solvent A, the chromatographs were developed with a linear gradient, 0-15 min at 0% B, 16-60 min at 0-15% B, 61-130 min at 15-55% B, and monitored at 214 nm. Automated Amino Acid Analysis—Selected HPLC-separated peptides were submitted to automated amino acid analysis. The peptides were hydrolyzed in the presence of 6 m glass-distilled HCl, 0.1% phenol in a gas phase Waters PicoTag work station hydrolysis unit (Walters, Milford, MA) at 150 °C for 90 min. After removal of the acid by vacuum centrifugation the specimens were transferred into an automatic sample loader unit attached to a Thermo Separation Products HPLC (Schaumburg, IL), and the amino acids were separated on a sodium cation exchange column. The amino acids were detected using a Pickering Laboratories Model PCX-5200 post-column ninhydrin derivatization (Model PCX-5200 Pickering Laboratories, Mountain View, CA), recorded at 570 and 440 nm and automatically quantified against amino acid standards. Mass Spectrometry—Two different mass spectrometric technologies were employed to determine the Mr of the HPLC-separated peptides. Some of the HPLC-separated fractions were subjected to a Vestec Lasetec mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser that produced 337-nm pulses of 3 ns duration at a repetition rate of ∼7 Hz. Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode. HPLC-purified peptide samples were mixed with an equal volume of a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile, and 1 μl of the mixture was dried on a stainless steel sample pin. Each mass spectrum was the average of 128 laser shots. Calibration was performed using two synthetic peptides (protonated average masses of 568.696 and 1980.238) as external standards. Monoisotopic masses obtained by this procedure are accurate to within 1 Da over the mass range of peptides examined in this work. HPLC peaks were also analyzed by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Ciphergen Biosystems Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The anti-Aβ capture antibodies used in this study were the monoclonal 6E10 and 4G8, raised against Aβ residues 1-16 and 17-24, respectively (Signet Laboratories, Inc. Dedham, MA). Two polyclonal antibodies recognizing the C-terminal region of Aβ were also utilized, R293 and R309, raised against Aβ residues 32-40 and Aβ residues 34-42 (Dr. P. Mehta, Institute for Basic Research and Mental Disabilities, Staten Island NY). In addition, bovine IgG (Pierce) was used as a negative control. All antibodies were adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml with PBS, loaded in aliquots of 2 μl onto PS20 ProteinChip® arrays, and incubated in a humidity chamber for 2 h at room temperature. The surfaces were blocked with 2 μl of glycine (0.1 m, pH 8.0) for 20 min. After the solutions were removed the spots were washed with 5 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 for 5 min. The chips were washed 2 times with 10 ml of PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min and then twice with 10 ml of PBS for 10 min. A 2-μl sample was loaded, and the chip was incubated in a humidity chamber at 4 °C overnight. After the medium was removed the chips were washed 2 times with 10 ml of PBS-Triton for 10 min, twice with PBS for 10 min, and finally washed 2 times with distilled water and air-dried. A 1:5 dilution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/ml) dissolved in a mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and acetonitrile (1:1 ratio) was added (2 times, 1-μl each), and mass assignments were made by averaging 100 shots in a Ciphergen Seldi™ Protein Biology System (PBS II). Calibration was externally made with the Ciphergen All-in-1 peptide® standard. Thioflavine S-stained cerebral cortex sections from human FAD AβPP V717F mutation revealed the presence of numerous cortical plaques composed of flocculent aggregates of amyloid fibrils surrounded by profuse NFT (Fig. 1A). Particularly notable was an almost complete absence of the classical amyloid plaque core structures that are commonly observed in sporadic AD individuals who carry the wild-type AβPP gene (Fig. 1B). The AβPP V717F mutation produced a moderate amyloid deposition in the leptomeningeal vasculature (Figs. 1, C and D). Amyloid deposits created in the AβPP V717F mutant individuals were resistant to complete disruption in buffers containing SDS-EDTA, a characteristic shared with the compact amyloid cores of the wild-type Aβ present in sporadic AD patients. The SDS-EDTA buffer efficiently dispersed the flocculent amyloid aggregates into fine bundles recovered by high speed centrifugation that were clearly visible with thioflavine S staining (Fig. 1E). From a neuropathological point of view, a striking consequence of the AβPP V717F mutation is the staggering number of NFT, in amounts seldom seen in sporadic AD cases. As demonstrated in Fig. 1F, a very rich fraction of SDS-EDTA-insoluble NFT is recovered by low speed centrifugation. To compare the differences between the amyloid peptides deposited in sporadic AD and AβPP V717F FAD individuals, the amyloid cores present in senile plaques of the former were purified and enriched by stepwise sucrose gradient centrifugations (12Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3072-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amyloid cores were solubilized in 80% GDFA and subjected to FPLC size-exclusion chromatography under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2A). Most of the dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric Aβ peptides were cross-linked and oxidized, whereas the monomeric forms were mainly composed of intact and N-terminal-degraded Aβ ending at residues 40 and 42. A high percentage of the Aβ peptides were post-translationally modified (12Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J.

Clarke S. Wolkow C. Wang R. Cotter R.J. Reardon I.M. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Ball M.J. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol.

The SDS-EDTA insoluble amyloid derived from the flocculent senile plaques of the AβPP V717F FAD individuals was enriched through a series of high speed centrifugations. Size-exclusion FPLC chromatography produced three large discrete peaks (Fig. 2B). Immuno-dot blot indicated that the central broad peak, which included peptides with a Mr of 2.5-9 kDa, contained Aβ peptides (Fig. 2B). As can be appreciated in this figure the oligomeric and monomeric Aβ forms were not resolved, suggesting this large fraction contains a complex heterogeneous mixture of hydrophobic peptides of similar molecular Mr. As an alternative to the SDS-EDTA purification protocol, the cerebral cortex of the AβPP V717F mutation was directly lysed in 80% GDFA, and the supernatant was fractionated by FPLC size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2C). This method yielded a chromatographic profile similar to that of the SDS-EDTA protocol, with most of the Aβ immunopositive reaction localized to the 2.5-9-kDa fractions. Previous studies of the AβPP V717F individuals demonstrated the presence of Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides, which were characterized after tryptic-CNBr hydrolysis (17Cataldo A.M. Nixon R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3861-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, because of their insolubility and tendency to aggregate and precipitate, any native Aβ peptides and C-terminal tryptic peptides longer than 42 residues may be lost during standard HPLC procedures. The chromatographic fractions from patient A, which were separated by C8 reverse-phase HPLC at high temperature (80 °C), were subjected to immuno-dot blot analyses using Aβ 4G8 and 6E10 antibodies. This experiment revealed that the Aβ peptides were spread in an incompletely resolved section of the C8 reverse-phase chromatography encompassing four consecutive, large fractions (Fig. 3A). These fractions were submitted to mass spectrometry analysis and revealed a complex mixture of Aβ peptide species (Table I). The spontaneous cyclization of Glu-3 and Glu-11 at the N-terminal position resulted in pyroglutamyl residues, a modification commonly observed in the wild-type Aβ peptides. The N- and C-terminal regions were heterogeneous with Aβ peptides starting at residues Asp-1, Asp-2, Glu-3, Phe-4, Arg-5, His-6, Asp-7, Gly-9, Tyr-10, Glu-11, His-13, His-14 and ending at Aβ residues Val-36, Gly-37, Gly-38, Val-39, Val-40, Ile-41, Ala-42, Val-44, Val/Phe-46, Thr-48, Leu-49, and Val-50 (Table I).Table IAβ-related peptides (MALDI-TOF)Observed MrCalculated MrPeptidePeak 12951.82952.413-40 + f3831.53832.33-364326.74326.93PG-42 + O4346.24346.91-40 + O4974.84975.71-46 (Phe)5381.65382.21-50 + fPeak 23388.63388.99-40 + O3817.63817.34-383899.13899.43PG-37 + f3917.13916.54-393929.73928.43PG-384015.44015.64-404081.94080.65-42 + f4229.34227.84-42 + f4275.24275.71-39 + f + O4328.44328.93-425051.15050.93PG-49Peak 32788.02787.314-403334.73334.911PG-42 + O3817.53817.34-384047.04046.51-36 + f4232.04231.82-40 + O4286.24285.93-41 + f4511.34511.23PG-444512.04511.23PG-444600.64600.32-444982.24983.73-48 + f5154.65154.93PG-49(Phe-46) + 2fPeak 43316.23315.910-403319.23318.911PG-423427.93428.99-40 + 2f3499.33500.110-423555.73556.110-42 + 2f3758.43759.37-423897.43898.56-424300.44300.94-434310.24310.93PG-424512.44511.23PG-444722.84723.53PG-465018.35019.71-46 (Phe-46) + f + O5418.15418.21-50 (Phe-46) + O Open table in a new tab To confirm that the C-terminal region of the AβPP V717F-derived Aβ peptides extended beyond the wild-type Aβ40 and Aβ42 termini, peaks 1-4 of the C8 HPLC-separated fractions (Fig. 3A) were subjected to tryptic (Tp) hydrolysis followed by cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage. The Tp-CNBr resulting peptides were separated by C18 reverse-phase HPLC in the presence of a linear gradient formed by water/acetonitrile-isopropanol. We concentrated our initial efforts on C8 HPLC fractions 2 and 3 (Fig. 3A) since previous studies demonstrated the retention time corresponded to the elution of Aβ 1-40 and 1-42 peptides (14Kalback W. Watson M.D. Kokjohn T.A. Kuo Y.M. Weiss N. Luehrs D.C. Lopez J. Brune D. Sisodia S.S. Staufenbiel M. Emmerling M. Roher A.E. Biochem. 2002; 41: 922-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As can be appreciated in Fig. 4, this chromatography was capable of resolving the Tp-CNBr-hydrolyzed Aβ peptides of up to 42 amino acid residues (Fig. 4). However, also present was a broad unresolved fraction of larger hydrophobic Aβ-related peptides that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis revealed as residues starting at 17, 29, and 36 and terminating at residues beyond amino acid 42. We then examined the Tp-CNBr-hydrolyzed peptides of the HPLC-separated fractions 1-4 (Fig. 3A) by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A series of Aβ-related peptides were identified that started at residues Glu-3, His-6, Leu-17, Gly-29, and Leu-36 and ending, as expected, at residues Arg-5, Lys-16, Lys-28, homoserine (Hse) 35, Val-40, and Ala-42 (Table II). In addition, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry also detected hydrophobic peptides ending at residues"
https://openalex.org/W2013908828,"The 2nd transmembrane domain (tm) of the secretory Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC1) and of the kidney-specific isoform (NKCC2) has been shown to play an important role in cation transport. For NKCC2, by way of illustration, alternative splicing of exon 4, a 96-bp sequence from which tm2 is derived, leads to the formation of the NKCC2A and F variants that both exhibit unique affinities for cations. Of interest, the NKCC2 variants also exhibit substantial differences in Cl- affinity as well as in the residue composition of the first intracellular connecting segment (cs1a), which immediately follows tm2 and which too is derived from exon 4. In this study, we have prepared chimeras of the shark NKCC2A and F (saA and saF) to determine whether cs1a could play a role in Cl- transport; here, tm2 or cs1a in saF was replaced by the corresponding domain from saA (generating saA/F or saF/A, respectively). Functional analyses of these chimeras have shown that cs1a-specific residues account for most of the A-F difference in Cl- affinity. For example, Km(Cl-)s were ∼8 mm for saF/A and saA, and ∼70 mm for saA/F and saF. Intriguingly, variant residues in cs1a also affected cation transport; here, Km(Na+)s for the chimeras and for saA were all ∼20 mm, and Km(Rb+) all ∼2 mm. Regarding tm2, our studies have confirmed its importance in cation transport and have also identified novel properties for this domain. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that an intracellular loop in NKCC contributes to the transport process perhaps by forming a flexible structure that positions itself between membrane spanning domains.

The importance of tm2 in ion transport by the NKCCs was also confirmed through functional characterizations of NKCC2 variants (24Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush B. J. Biol.

Indeed, these variants exhibit marked differences in their affinities for cotransported ions, yet they are identical to one another with the exception of a single exon from which tm2 is derived. It is noteworthy that this exon also encodes part of the following connecting segment (cs1a), which as tm2, is only conserved to a degree among variants. Domains that play important roles in the various operations of homologous proteins can be identified readily through structure-function analyses. With such an approach, however, key residues can be missed if they are conserved. For example, the importance of tm2 or cs1a in Cl- transport was revealed through structure-function analyses involving the 3 NKCC2 variants but not the saNKCC1-huNKCC1 chimeras (12Isenring P.

To this effect, the tm2-cs1a region among the B, A, and F variants is less conserved (∼65%) than the corresponding region between saNKCC1 and huNKCC1 (> 80%). In this work, we have prepared chimeras of A and F variants to determine whether cs1a is also involved in ion movement by NKCC2. We have found that cation transport kinetics are mediated at least in part by variant residues in tm2, confirming previous observations. Here, in addition, we have found that differences in Cl- affinity and in the magnitude of Na+-independent 86Rb+ influx are specified by variant residues in cs1a mainly. Vectors and cDNA Construction—For our experiments, the following vectors were used: (1) pBluescript SK (pBS); (2) Pol1, a Xenopus laevis oocyte expression vector derived from pGEM and comprised of the T7 promoter, the X. laevis β-globin untranslated regions, and a poly(A) tract (10Caron L.

Wild type constructs analyzed in this study (saNKCC2A/Pol1 and saNKCC2F/Pol1) are the same as those analyzed in previous studies (25Gagnon E. Forbush B. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C365-C370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Gagnon E. Forbush B. Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F1046-F1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, saNKCC2A/Pol1 and saNKCC2F/Pol1 were generated from 3 library-derived saNKCC2/pBS constructs, each consisting of: (1) a full-length saNKCC2AF, which contains the A and F exons in tandem, (2) a partial-length saNKCC2A, or (3) a partial-length saNKCC2F. For saNKCC2A/Pol1, the ∼712-bp SphI-PflmI fragment of saNKCCAF/pBS was replaced with that of saNKCCA/pBS, and the resulting insert was transferred to Pol1 as an EcoRI fragment. For saNKCC2F/Pol1, the fragment of saNKCC2F was used as replacement. For simplicity, saNKCC2A/Pol1 and saNKCC2F/Pol1 are called saA and saF hereafter. Chimeric structures between shark A and F variants were produced by transferring the 2428-bp SphI-Bst1107I fragment of saA or saF into pTZ19U digested with SphI-SmaI. The mutagenic synthetic oligonucleotide cc acc tcc acg aac aac tcc att ggt aca tat agc gga cat aga gat gca agt aat tg, which corresponds to a sequence of saNKCC2F comprised between bps 854 and 911 of the open reading frame and which encodes the tm2-cs1a junction point region, was hybridized to saNKCC2A/pTZ19U and extended with T7 polymerase to generate uracil-containing single-stranded DNA. Another oligonucleotide, c tcg aac aca tcc gtt ggt cga aat ggc tga ggt aga caa ccc tgt taa gac, which corresponds to a sequence of saNKCC2A comprised between bps 853 and 904 of the open reading frame and which also encodes the tm2-cs1a junction point region, was hybridized to saNKCC2F/pTZ19U and extended as above. Mutants were screened with AccI (the restriction site was removed from saNKCC2F/pTZ19U and it was introduced in saNKCC2A/pTZ19U), and positive clones were verified by sequencing. After these steps, the 1433-bp DraIII-MunI fragment of each mutant was reinserted in saA or saF to generate saA/F or saF/A. The former contains the tm2-coding sequence of saNKCCA and the cs1a-coding sequence of saNKCC2F and the latter, the tm2-coding sequence of saNKCCF and the cs1a-coding sequence of saNKCC2A. Expression in the X. laevis Oocyte—The 4 cDNA/Pol1 constructs were linearized and in vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit (Ambion). Defolliculated stage V-VI oocytes were injected with 25 nl H2O or with ∼5 to 25 ng cRNA diluted in 25 nl H2O, and tested 3 to 4 days after injection. Before the kinetic studies, eggs were maintained at 18 °C in Barth's medium supplemented with 125 μm furosemide. Kinetic Studies—Ion transport rates were determined by 86Rb+ influx measurements at ∼22 °C. As shown in Table I, various flux media were used for these studies. Each medium is derived from a basic solution that is isoosmolar relative to the X. laevis extracellular fluid.Table IHEP, Hepes; NMG, N-methyl glucamine; GLU, gluconate; SUC, sucrose; OSM, osmolality[Ion]Na+Rb+ or K+Cl-CaMgPO4SO4HEPNMGGLUSUCOSMmmBasic isoosmolar87586221110000200Hyperosmolar (SUC)875862211100084284Barth's medium90.41900.70.800.810000200Rb+ dependence870.1-20862211100-20150230Na+ dependence0-875862211100-8700200Cl- dependence8750-862211-101000-780200Wash197382211100780200 Open table in a new tab The following multi-step protocol was used: 1) Removal of furosemide with several washes in a tracer-free basic solution. 2) Preincubation of oocytes for 1 h in a tracer-free hyperosmolar solution (obtained by supplementing the basic solution with 84 mosM sucrose) to activate cotransporter-mediated transport (25Gagnon E. Forbush B. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C365-C370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Gagnon E. Forbush B. Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F1046-F1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); for some experiments, bumetanide was added at various concentrations (0 to 2 μm) during the last 15 min of this preincubation. 3) Reincubation of oocytes for 45 min in one of several isoosmolar solutions containing 1 to 2 μCi/ml86RbCl, 10 μm ouabain, and 0 to 250 μm bumetanide. Here, the various isoosmolar solutions consisted of basic solutions in which [Na+] was varied from 0 to 87 mm, [Rb+] from 0.1 to 20 mm or [Cl-] from 0 to 86 mm. In these solutions, Na+ or Rb+ was replaced with N-methyl glucamine and Cl- with gluconate ± SO4 (see Table I and figure legends). 4) Repeated washes in a tracer-free basic solution containing 250 μm bumetanide and 10 μm ouabain. 5) After the final washes, oocytes were transferred in 96-well plates (1 oocyte/well) and solubilized in 2% SDS. 86Rb+ was detected by liquid β-scintillation counting using the TopCountNXT microplate counter (Packard). In each experiment, fluxes among 1 to 9 oocytes (usually from 4 to 6 oocytes) were averaged and normalized to other flux values or to [85Rb+]/[86Rb+] used in the flux medium. Normalized flux rates from 2 to 7 experiments (usually from 3 to 4 experiments) were then reaveraged and expressed as means ± S.E. For none of the data presented in this study were the bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+ influxes of H20-injected oocytes subtracted from the bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+ influxes of NKCC2-expressing oocytes. These background levels, which have been determined repeatedly in the past (25Gagnon E. Forbush B. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C365-C370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Gagnon E. Forbush B. Flemmer A.W. Gimenez I. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: F1046-F1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), are very low under the experimental conditions used for the assays, and they do not alter the dependence of NKCC2 activity on [Na+], [Rb+], or [Cl-]. Km values were determined by non-linear least square analysis using the Michaelis-Menten equation (for a one-binding site model) or the Hill equation with a coefficient of 2 (for a 2-binding site model). These Km values were obtained by fitting averaged “activity versus [ion]” data points from all experiments as well as from individual experiments (see figure legends). Closeness of fits (expressed as S.E. in this work) were determined with the program SigmaPlot 4.00 for Windows. When appropriate, differences between Km values obtained for different chimeras were analyzed by Student two tail t-tests and the null hypothesis was rejected for p values < 0.05. Functional Expression of NKCC2s—As seen in Fig. 2, X. laevis oocytes injected with either wild type or mutant NKCC2s (saA, saF, saA/F, saF/A) exhibit bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb+ influxes that vary between 1.9 to 4.5 nmol/oocyte/h. For saA and saF, these rates are more than ∼8-fold above the usual background level (∼0.4 nmol/oocyte/h), and they are also similar to those reported previously (25Gagnon E. Forbush B. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C365-C370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For saF/A, on the other hand, cotransporter-specific activity is shown to be slightly lower (∼4-fold above background). In these studies, flux measurements were obtained after a 1-h preincubation in hyperosmotic medium. Kinetics of Na+Transport—To determine whether variant residues in tm2 and/or cs1a account for differences in Na+ affinity between saA and saF, we measured the dependence of 86Rb+ influx on [Na+] for the saA/F and saF/A chimeras, and compared results to those obtained in simultaneous experiments for wild type transporters. Data are illustrated in Fig. 3, A–D, fit by a model of Na+ binding at a single site, and Km values derived from these activity versus [ion] relationships are depicted in Fig. 3E. Unexpectedly, the results show that the saA/F and saF/A chimeras both exhibit an affinity for Na+ that is very similar to that exhibited by saA, the wild type high affinity carrier in this study; the Km values are 18, 23, and 15 mm, respectively, contrasting with a Km value of 93 mm for saF (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that variant residues in both tm2 and cs1a mediate differences in Na+ affinities between the 2 NKCC2 variants. When compared with the wild type carriers, on the other hand, saA/F and saF/A exhibit changes in Km(Na+)s that are not additive, contrasting with the expected behavior of reciprocal chimeras. Hence, it is possible that a change in affinity for one ion following residue substitutions at one site (e.g. in cs1a) is at least partly due to a change in affinity for a co-ion (see “Discussion”). Looking more closely at the activity versus [ion] relationships, it is seen that even if the chimeras exhibit a similar Km for Na+, their kinetic behavior is not identical. Indeed, Fig. 3, C and D, show that saF/A-mediated activity at 0 mm Nao is ∼50% of that at 87 mm (see panel D), whereas saA/F-mediated activity at 0 mm Nao is ∼20% of that at 87 mm (see panel C). In this regard, saF/A is similar to the A variant (see panels A versus D), whereas saA/F is similar to the F variant (see panels B versus C); for the wild type saA and saF carriers, such behaviors are similar to those reported previously (24Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Gagnon E. Forbush B. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C365-C370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results indicate that differences in the magnitude of Nao-independent activity are probably conveyed to a large extent by variant residues in cs1a. Kinetics of Rb+Transport—To determine whether tm2 and cs1a also convey differences in affinity for the other cotransported cation, the dependence of 86Rb+ influx on [Rb+] was measured as above for saA/F and saF/A as well as for the wild type transporters (see Fig. 4, A–E). For these experiments, the data is again fit by a model of ion binding at a single site and Km values derived from the activity versus [ion] relationships are provided in panel E. As for Na+, the 2 chimeras display an affinity for Rb+ that is very similar to that displayed by the wild type high affinity NKCC2 carrier; as shown in panel E, for instance, Km(Rb+)s are 2.2, 1.8, and 2.2 mm for saA/F, saF/A, and saA, respectively, whereas Km(Rb+) is 4.6 mm for saF. It thus appears obvious from these results that differences in cation transport kinetics among the NKCC2 splice variants are specified by variant residues in both tm2 and cs1a. Kinetics of Cl-Transport—Fig. 5 presents results for the Cl- dependence of 86Rb+ influx and Km values derived from the activity versus [ion] relationships. Similar to the observed differences in cation affinities, the wild type carriers exhibit marked differences in Cl- affinity. As shown in panels A and B, by way of illustration, Km(Cl-) is 6.9 mm for saA and 69.1 mm for saF. 2It should be noted that we have reported a Km(Cl-) for saA in Ref. 25Gagnon E. Forbush B. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C365-C370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar that is higher than that measured in the current work (38 versus 7mm). Hence, the difference between the A and F variants in regard to Cl- affinity may be more important than initially assumed. Although we do not have a firm explanation for this discrepancy, it is reasonable to assume that Km(Cl-) for saA is in fact probably closer to 10 mm based on the behavior of the rabbit NKCC2A and rat NKCC2A (32Gimenez I. Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8767-8770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Plata C. Meade P. Vazquez N. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11004-11012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, it should be noted that Km(Cl-)s reported in Ref. 25Gagnon E. Forbush B. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C365-C370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar were obtained by averaging Km values of individual experiments; when the Km(Cl-) for saA in this previous study was obtained by fitting the averaged activity versus [ion] data points from all experiments, Km(Cl-) was actually ∼2-fold lower (16 instead of 38 mm). Here, on the other hand, the affinity for cotransported anions also differs substantially between the chimeras. Indeed, Km(Cl-) for saF/A is 8.6 mm (panel C), comparable to that for saA, and Km(Cl-) for saA/F is 70.0 mm (panel D), comparable to that for saF. These results suggest that cs1a plays a key role in Cl- transport but that tm2, on the other hand, does not mediate appreciable differences in Cl- affinity. Results presented in Fig. 5 also point to the possibility that cs1a contains residues that constitute part of a high affinity Cl--binding site. In a recent publication (25Gagnon E. Forbush B.

Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that this inhibited complex results from the oxidative addition of superoxide to Mn(II)-SOD to form either an inner sphere side-on or end-on peroxo complex of the metal (2Cabelli D.E.

Human Mn-SOD is a homotetramer of 22-kDa subunits; an association of two dimers forms the homotetramer, which has a 2-fold axis of symmetry. This association forms at least two different interfaces: the dimeric interface, which joins two individual subunits and the tetrameric interface, which joins the dimers to form a tetramer (7Borgstahl G.E.O.

This mutant was found to be less stable by 15 °C in the main unfolding transition of the enzyme. The dimers of human Mn-SOD are similar in structure to the dimeric bacterial Fe- and Mn-SODs; at the dimer interface, the side chains of Tyr166 from subunit B (Tyr166(B)) and His30 of the adjacent A subunit (His30(A)) are connected by a hydrogen bond (7Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). His30 is also part of an extended hydrogen-bonded chain involving residues Tyr34, Gln143, and water that extend to the manganese-bound solvent molecule. The replacements by site-specific mutagenesis of Tyr166 with Phe and His30 with Asn in single mutants and in a double mutant caused substantial conformational changes at the dimeric interface, including a nearby residue, Asn171. Each single mutation caused about a 10-fold decrease in the steady-state constants for catalysis and a 10-14 °C decrease in the main unfolding transition. Moreover, the double mutant containing the replacement of both Tyr166 and His30 had catalytic properties similar to each single mutant, emphasizing the significance of their hydrogen bond in wild type. These results are compared with single mutants at analogous residues in Escherichia coli Mn-SOD reported by Edwards et al. (9Edwards R.A. Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This work demonstrates the interaction and significance of the specific hydrogen-bonded network of side chains and water that extend from Tyr166 through the dimeric interface to the active site of an adjacent subunit. Enzymes and Purification—The mutant enzymes H30N, Y166F, and H30N/Y166F human Mn-SOD were prepared using oligonucleotide primers, the sequences of which contained the mutations of interest, as described for H30N Mn-SOD (10Ramilo C.A.

PCR reactions were used to amplify the Mn-SOD coding sequence. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing of the entire coding region. The PCR products were cloned into the expression vector pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into the E. coli (strain QC774) SodA-/SodB- null mutant. Mutants of human Mn-SOD were purified from E. coli using heat treatment and ion exchange chromatography (DE52 (anion exchanger) and CM52 (cation exchanger), Whatman Corp.) according to the procedures of Beck et al. (11Beck Y. Bartfeld D. Yavin Z. Levanon A. Gorecki M. Hartman J.R. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 930-935Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The modification included the use of an additional cation exchanger, SP-Sepharose (Pfizer-Pharmacia), whenever necessary. Heat treatment was also reduced to 30 min and 55 °C for the less stable mutants. The purity of the protein was checked at various stages of purification using SDS-PAGE. The purified protein showed a unique intense band at 22 kDa. Each mutant was dialyzed extensively with EDTA and passed through a desalting column (PD 10, Pfizer-Pharmacia) before analysis for manganese content using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The concentration of the active enzyme was taken as the manganese concentration (ϵ480 for Mn(III)-SOD is 600 ± 20 m-1 cm-1) (12Leveque V.J.-P. Vance C.K. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10586-10591Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The fraction of active sites occupied by manganese varied from 0.68 for H30N to 0.76 for wild type. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method. Determination of the oligomeric form of Y166F and H30N/Y166F Mn-SOD was done through gel-filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Biosciences) using wild-type human Mn-SOD for reference. Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction of Y166F and H30N/Y166F Human Mn-SOD—The mutants Y166F and H30N/Y166F human Mn-SOD were both crystallized from solutions consisting of 6 mg/ml protein buffered in 25 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.6 and 25% Polyethylene Glycol 3350. The rod-shaped crystals belong to an orthorhombic crystal form with unit cell dimensions of a = 73.7 Å, b = 77.7 Å, and c = 135.8 Å for Y166F and a = 71.6 Å, b = 76.5 Å, and c = 66.6 Å for H30N/Y166F. Flash-cooled crystals were mounted under the liquid N2 stream, and data were collected at Beamline 5.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using a charge-coupled device detector. The data were processed using DENZO software (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The structures were solved with Molrep (14Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar) using one dimer of human Mn-SOD as a search probe. The dimeric mutant (H30N/Y166F) Mn-SOD model in the asymmetric unit was then rigid body-refined followed by geometrically restrained positional and temperature factor refinement using crystallography NMR software (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). Both models were refit to σA-weighted 2FO - FC and FO - FC maps using XFIT software (18McRee D.E. J. Struct.

Open table in a new tab Pulse Radiolysis—Pulse radiolysis experiments were performed using the 2 MeV van de Graaff accelerator at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Superoxide generated during pulse radiolysis was quantitated using the KSCN dosimeter, assuming that (SCN)2- has a G value of 6.13 and molar absorptivity of 7950 m-1 cm-1 at 472 nm. A Cary 210 spectrophotometer was used to record UV-visible spectra at a constant temperature of 25 °C. The pathlength was either 2.0 or 6.1 cm. Solutions contained enzyme, 30 mm sodium formate (as a hydroxyl radical scavenger) (19Schwarz H.A. J. Chem. Ed. 1981; 58: 101-105Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar), 50 μm EDTA, and 2 mm TAPS. Superoxide radicals were generated in situ by introducing nanosecond pulses to aqueous air-saturated solutions containing sodium formate according to the mechanisms described by Schwarz (19Schwarz H.A. J. Chem. Ed. 1981; 58: 101-105Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the formation of O2·¯/HO2 radicals is 95% complete by the first microsecond after the pulse. The decay of superoxide was monitored spectrophotometrically at 260 nm (ϵ260 = 1800 m-1 s-1) (20Rabani J. Nielson S.O. J. Phys. Chem. 1969; 73: 3736-3744Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Differential Scanning Calorimetry—A CSC Nano or Microcal VP high sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter was used to obtain all denaturation profiles. Human Mn-SOD and mutants at 1.0 mg/ml in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) were degassed under mild vacuum for 5 min and immediately scanned at a temperature increase rate of 1 °C/min. The base line and change in specific heat (ΔCp) upon denaturation were corrected as described previously (21Hsieh Y. Guan Y. Tu C.K. Bratt P.J. Angerhofer A. Lepock J.R. Hickey M.J. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4731-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Essentially, the base line immediately preceding the transition and following it were assumed to be linear, and the base line under the transition was taken as an average of the two base lines weighted for the fraction of the transition completed. The peaks of the differential scanning calorimetry profile were deconvoluted assuming a reversible, non-two-state model using the software package ORIGIN (Microcal, Inc.). ΔH, ΔS, and Tm for each transition were obtained from the best fits. The Tm values are the temperatures at which Cp reached a maximum. Redox Potential Measurements—The midpoint potential, Em, of human Y166F and H30N/Y166F Mn-SOD was determined by single point experiments. The enzyme and mediator were allowed to equilibrate from opposite redox states at pH 8.0 as described by Leveque et al. (12Leveque V.J.-P. Vance C.K. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10586-10591Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Solutions of enzyme were exchanged into 20 mm TAPS and 100 mm KCl through three cycles of concentration and dilution using centricon-10 filters. Once the buffer exchange was completed, the solution was diluted to 3 ml, resulting in 0.3-0.4 mm active sites. The solutions were sealed in an anaerobic cell with a combination electrode and were made anaerobic through several cycles of vacuum and N2 gas. Mn-SOD was partially reduced by 0.3 mm H2O2 and 0.27 mm K3Fe(CN)6. The absorbance spectra and redox potential of the system were measured every hour for up to 24 h. Absorbance at 421 nm (ferricyanide) and 485 nm (mutant Mn(III)-SOD) were plotted against the redox potential, and the midpoint potential Em was determined through least square fits (Enzfitter, Biosoft) of the Nernst equation. Midpoint potentials are reported versus the normal hydrogen electrode. Stopped-flow Spectrophotometry—The zero-order rate constant k0/[E] was measured for the mutant Mn-SODs in this work by the stopped-flow methodology of McClune and Fee (22McClune G.J. Fee J.A. Biophys. J. 1978; 24: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Potassium superoxide (Aldrich) was dissolved in dry Me2SO with solubility increased by addition of an approximately equimolar amount of 18-crown-6 ether. A dual mixing stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SX18.MV, Applied Photophysics) was used to follow the decrease in the absorption of superoxide at 250 nm. To minimize instrumental dead time, two dilutions were used in sequence. Initially, superoxide in Me2SO in a 250-μl syringe was mixed with an aqueous solution at pH 11 containing 2 mm CAPS and 1 mm EDTA from a 2.5-ml syringe. After a 500-ms aging time, this solution was rapidly mixed in a 1:1 ratio with a solution containing 1 μm enzyme, 200 mm TAPS, and 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.2. The final Me2SO concentration was 4.5% by volume. Instrumental dead time was, on average, 4 ms. Catalysis—The decay of superoxide catalyzed by human Mn-SOD and the mutants in Table II was measured from the rate of decrease of absorbance of superoxide at 260 nm generated by pulse radiolysis. Initial velocities of the first 5-10% of reaction were determined at times up to 2 ms of reaction, before inhibition was observed, and could be fit to the sum of Michaelis-Menten kinetics for the catalyzed and second-order kinetics for the uncatalyzed reactions. No evidence of cooperative or non-Michaelian kinetics was observed. The steady-state constants for the catalyzed decay of superoxide were rather similar for the three mutants of Mn-SOD; all were smaller by roughly 10-fold compared with wild-type human Mn-SOD (Table II). At later times in the catalysis, a prominent zero-order component was observed for all of the enzymes in Table II. The zero-order rate constant k0/[E] determined by stopped-flow varied among the enzymes, with H30N Mn-SOD being the least inhibited and the mutant containing Y166F the most inhibited (Table II).Table IIKinetic constants and midpoint potential Em for MnSOD and mutantsEnzymekcataStandard errors are <15%.kcat/KmaStandard errors are <15%.ko/[E]aStandard errors are <15%.EmbMean ± S.D. of at least three measurements.ms−1nm−1s−1mVs−1Wild-typecFrom Ramilo et al.

Open table in a new tab Pulse radiolysis was also used to determine rate constants in a simplified mechanism (Equations 3-6), which has been useful in describing catalysis by Mn-SOD and mutants (23McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Hearn A.S. Stroupe M.E. Cabelli D.E. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12051-12058Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The individual steps of the catalysis (Equations 3 and 4) are considered irreversible, justified partly by the favorable equilibrium constants for the catalyzed dismutation. The formation and dissociation of the product-inhibited complex is represented in Equations 5 and 6.Mn(III)SOD+O2·¯k1→Mn(II)SOD+O2(Eq. 3) Mn(II)SOD+O2·¯k2(+2H+)→Mn(III)SOD+H2O2(Eq. 4) Mn(II)SOD+O2·¯k3→Mn-X-SOD(Eq. 5) Mn-X-SODk4(+2H+)→Mn(III)SOD+H2O2(Eq. 6) Hearn et al. (24Hearn A.S. Stroupe M.E. Cabelli D.E. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12051-12058Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) describe the use of pulse radiolysis to estimate the rate constants k1-k4 under single turnover conditions. The rate constant k1 is estimated from the observation of the decrease of the absorbance of Mn(III)-SOD at 480 nm that occurs after introduction of superoxide. Rate constant k3 is measured from the rate of emergence of the peak at 420 nm characteristic of the inhibited complex (5Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and k4 is measured from the rate of decrease of the 420 nm absorption and from the rate of increase at 480 nm associated with the dissociation of the product-inhibited complex. Rate constant k2 is, in this study, poorly determined because of the similar magnitude of k3 and the extent of product inhibition. Typical data for these experiments are shown in Fig. 1; the first-order appearance of the 480-nm absorption corresponding to the dissociation of the product-inhibited state and the appearance of Mn(III)-SOD as in Equation 6. The reaction of Equation 4 occurs on a much faster time scale and is not apparent in the time range shown in Fig. 1. The rate constants k2 and k3 both describe the reactions of the reduced enzyme Mn(II)-SOD, k2 in the catalytic cycle (Equation 4) and k3 (Equation 5) in the formation of the inhibited complex. These rate constants are of similar magnitude in the variants in Table III and are difficult to differentiate. The values of k3 given in Table III are rough estimates and may represent substantial contributions from k2. It is significant that k2 and k3 are of a similar magnitude for each of the mutants in Table III; however, the small value of k4 for the dissociation of the inhibited complex means that this complex accumulates during catalysis. Values of k1 and k4 presented in Table III are more accurate. The rate constants k1 are similar to the steady-state constants in that the values for the mutants are smaller by about 10-fold than for the wild type (Table III). The 10-fold decreases in kcat and kcat/Km for the mutants in Table II suggest that they may be affected by the same rate-limiting step. The 10-fold decrease in k1 in Table III suggests that the reaction of Equation 3 may be that step. In wild-type Mn-SOD, the magnitudes of k1 and k2 are similar; hence, energy barriers for transition states in the catalysis are similar, and no single step is rate-determining.Table III.Values of the rate constants (Eqs. 3-6) for catalysis by human MnSOD and mutantsEnzymek1k2, k3aValues of k2 and k3 were very close and difficult to differentiate.k4nm−1s−1nm−1s−1s−1Wild-typebFrom Hearn et al.

Open table in a new tab Structure of Y166F Mn-SOD—Unlike the structure of human wild-type Mn-SOD, which crystallizes in space group P21212 and has two Mn-SOD subunits in the asymmetric unit (7Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), the mutant Y166F crystallized in space group P212121 and had four Mn-SOD subunits in the asymmetric unit. The subunit fold and tetrameric assembly of the Y166F mutant are very similar to the wild type; there was a root mean square deviation of 0.33 Å for 196 Cα atoms when one subunit of Y166F and the wild-type Mn-SOD were superimposed. There was no significant change in the conformations of the inner sphere ligands of the manganese, including distances to the metal for Y166F compared with wild-type Mn-SOD. The crystal structure of the mutant Y166F Mn-SOD showed no significant change in the orientation of the Phe166 side chain compared with the Tyr166 of wild type (Fig. 2); however, there were significant changes in hydrogen bonding and side-chain conformation at the dimeric interface. In wild-type Mn-SOD, the phenolic OH of Tyr166(B) forms a hydrogen bond with the Nϵ-2 of His30(A) from the adjacent subunit of the dimer. This interaction was lost in the Y166F mutant and resulted in the shift of His30(A) toward Tyr34(A) (Fig. 2). In Y166F, the imidazole ring of His30(A) was flipped over, and the Nϵ-2 of His30(A) formed a hydrogen bond with the phenolic OH group of Tyr34(A) (heavy atom distance 2.7 Å). Furthermore, in Y166F the Nδ-1 of His30(A) formed a new hydrogen bond with Asn171(B) (2.8 Å), which turned inward to the protein (Fig. 2). Therefore, the hydrogen-bonded network in wild type, Mn-H2O-Gln143-Tyr34-H2O-His30-Tyr166(B) (7Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), was changed in Y166F to Mn-H2O-Gln143-Tyr34-His30-Asn171(B). Note that a water molecule (Fig. 2, wat2) present in the hydrogen-bonded network of wild-type Mn-SOD is absent in Y166F. Structure of H30N/Y166F Mn-SOD—Gel permeation chromatography showed that H30N/Y166F Mn-SOD was tetrameric like the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). However, this mutant, similar to the wild-type Mn-SOD, crystallized in space group P21212 and had two subunits in the asymmetric unit. The subunit fold and tetrameric assembly of the H30N/Y166F mutant are very similar to the wild type with a root mean square deviation value of 0.35 Å for 196 Cα atoms when one subunit of H30N/Y166F mutant and the wild type are superimposed. Again, there was no change in the coordination of the metal compared with wild-type Mn-SOD. This double mutant had similar changes in local hydrogen bond interactions to those in Y166F (Fig. 3). Asn30 of the H30N/Y166F mutant was oriented in a manner similar to His30 in the Y166F mutant. The Nδ-2 of Asn30 does not form a hydrogen bond with the phenolic OH group of Tyr34 (heavy atom distance 3.4 Å), or this could be a very weak hydrogen bond. Similar to Asn171 in Y166F Mn-SOD, Asn171 turned inward in the H30N/Y166F mutant, but there was no hydrogen bond between Asn171(B) and Asn30(A) because of the shorter length and orientation of the side chain of Asn30(A) (Fig. 3). The functionally important Mn-H2O-Gln143-Tyr34-H2O-His30-Tyr166(B) hydrogen-bonded network in the wild type became Mn-H2O-Gln143-Tyr34, representing hydrogen-bonding interactions solely within each subunit in the H30N/Y166F mutant. As in the single mutant, with H30N/Y166F the water molecule (Fig. 3, wat2) was displaced in the mutant structure. The structure of H30N human Mn-SOD was reported earlier (10Ramilo C.A. Lévêque V.

Thermal Stability of Mutant Enzymes—Differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine transition temperatures Tm for the main unfolding of Y166F and H30N/Y166F Mn-SOD, data that was compared with previous measurements of wild-type and H30N Mn-SOD (Table IV). This unfolding transition is a measure of conformational stability and is different from the value of Tm for thermal inactivation of catalytic activity, which is near 70 °C for human wild-type Mn-SOD and represents a smaller conformational change (25Guan Y. Hickey M.J. Borgstahl G.E.O. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.A. O'Connor D. Hsieh Y. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Tainer J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Each of these mutations at residues 30 and 166 caused decreases in the main unfolding transition Tm as shown in Table IV. These changes are very different from the increases in Tm of up to 6.7 °C for conservative mutations at residues 34 and 143, which do not cause significant interfacial changes (21Hsieh Y. Guan Y. Tu C.K. Bratt P.J. Angerhofer A. Lepock J.R. Hickey M.J. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4731-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Guan Y. Hickey M.J.

Interestingly, the H30N/Y166F mutant had a higher value of Tm than either of the corresponding single mutants.Table IVThermodynamic parameters for the reversible unfolding of wild-type human MnSOD and site-specific mutants at positions 30 and 166EnzymeTmΔΔG Tetramer°Ckcal/molWild-type90.7H30NaFrom Ramilo et al.

Open table in a new tab Redox Properties of Mutant Enzymes—Unlike the replacement of His30 by Asn, the replacements of Tyr166 by Phe and the double mutant both have redox midpoint potentials Em significantly different from that of wild-type Mn-SOD (Table II). However, this difference of ∼40 mV is small compared with the difference of close to 1 V in midpoint potentials of the O2·¯/H2O2 and O2/O2·¯ oxidation and reduction that represent the catalyzed reactions (26Vance C.K. Miller A.-F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13079-13087Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In fact, we observed that the steady-state constants for both single mutants and the double mutant were very similar (Table II), indicating that the differences in the midpoint potentials in Table II did not cause significant differences in catalysis. We have replaced two highly conserved residues at the dimer interface of the homotetramer human Mn-SOD, His30(A) and Tyr166(B) located on adjacent subunits A and B, which in wild type are directly hydrogen-bonded across the interface. Moreover, both His30 and Tyr166 participate in a hydrogen-bonded network that extends to the manganese-bound solvent molecule at the active site (7Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and is significant in maintaining catalysis (27Silverman D.N. Nick H.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the mutant Y166F Mn-SOD, the hydrogen bond network is abolished at Phe166, although Asn171(B) has rotated inward from a position in which it is solvent exposed to a new orientation forming a hydrogen bond with His30(A) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the side chain of Asn171 makes a similar rotation in the double mutant H30N/Y166F even though it appears to form no hydrogen bond (Fig. 3). In the single mutant H30N human Mn-SOD, the hydrogen bond network is also interrupted (10Ramilo C.A. Lévêque V. Guan Y. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27711-27716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The structural changes observed in Y166F human Mn-SOD can be compared with those observed by Edwards et al. (9Edwards R.A. Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for the equivalent mutation Y174F in E. coli Mn-SOD, in which the side chain of Asn179(B) (the equivalent of Asn171(B) in human Mn-SOD) also turns toward the side chain of His30 but makes no hydrogen bond with it (9Edwards R.A. Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The side chains of Tyr166 of wild type and Phe166 of Y166F are more closely superimposed in human Mn-SOD than their equivalents in E. coli Mn-SOD. Also, there were fewer significant conformational changes in the backbone in Y166F human Mn-SOD compared with E. coli Mn-SOD. Both the human (Y166F) and E. coli (Y174F) mutants show that the His30 residue flips its imidazole ring. In human Y166F Mn-SOD, His30(A) also rotates 98° around the C-α-C-β bond, which is perhaps a cause of the 133° rotation of Asn171(B) around its C-α-C-β bond inward to the dimer interface; these rotations were not observed in the E. coli Y174F Mn-SOD structure. These observations emphasize the considerable structural differences between human and E. coli Mn-SOD; these enzymes have a 44% amino acid identity. The calorimetry results (Table IV) showed that the effect of mutations at residues 30 and 166 in human Mn-SOD have lessened the thermal stability of the main unfolding transition. This is in contrast to conservative mutations at residues 34 (25Guan Y. Hickey M.J. Borgstahl G.E.O. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.A. O'Connor D. Hsieh Y. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Tainer J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), 143 (21Hsieh Y. Guan Y. Tu C.K. Bratt P.J. Angerhofer A. Lepock J.R. Hickey M.J. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4731-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and 161 (24Hearn A.S. Stroupe M.E. Cabelli D.E. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12051-12058Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which do not involve interfacial interactions and have actually increased stability. Table IV shows that the double mutant H30N/Y166F Mn-SOD is more stable than either single mutant. In the classification of double mutant cycles by Mildvan et al. (28Mildvan A.S. Weber D.J. Kuliopulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), these interactions are described as antagonistic. This indicates that the destabilizing effects of the individual mutations are opposed or compensated in the double mutant. Although His30 and Tyr166 play a role in maintaining enzyme stability, there is no evidence that the dissociation of subunits contributes to the main thermal unfolding transition. Catalysis by H30N, Y166F Mn-SOD, and the corresponding double mutant decreases kcat, kcat/Km, and the rate constant k1 of Equation 4 by about an order of magnitude (Tables II and III). The effects on k3 were similar (Table III); however, it was difficult to interpret these effects because we were not able to obtain separate values for k2 and k3. These effects on catalysis are intriguing because the mutations that cause them occur at rather large distances from the active-site manganese; that is, the side chains of residues 30 and 166 lie about 6 Å (Nδ-1 of His30) and 9 Å (hydroxyl O of Tyr166) from the metal. Measurements of redox potentials show rather minor changes in values of the midpoint potential Em caused by the single or double mutations (Table II) and are unlikely to account for the changes observed in catalysis. The values of kcat and kcat/Km and the rate constants k1 show no additional effect in the double mutant compared with the single mutants. The observation of no additional effect upon the second mutation is described in a study of double mutants by Mildvan et al. (28Mildvan A.S. Weber D.J. Kuliopulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as an example of cooperatively interacting residues. That is, residues 30 and 166 in wild type interact cooperatively to facilitate rate-contributing steps in catalysis. (However, there is no evidence of cooperativity or non-Michaelian kinetics in the decay of superoxide catalyzed by the enzymes in Table II.) This cooperativity is consistent with the role of the side chains of His30 and Tyr166 in the hydrogen-bonded network; single mutants, H30N and Y166F, abolish the interaction that in the wild type contributes to the integrity of the hydrogen-bonded network necessary for maximal activity. The double mutant, having also lost this interaction, causes no further decrease in catalysis. This result emphasizes the significance of this interaction across the dimer interface. Although there are considerable structural changes that are unique to the double mutant compared with the single mutants, the loss of the hydrogen bond appears to predominate as an affect on catalysis. This same effect may be manifested in the thermal stability of these enzymes; the double mutant does not reduce ΔΔG of unfolding to an extent greater than either single mutant (Table IV). Edwards et al. (9Edwards R.A. Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) obtained catalytic data for E. coli Mn-SOD by the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c inhibition assay, which showed ∼3-fold decreases in activity for both the H30N and Y174F single mutants. In contrast to the changes in kcat, kcat/Km, and k1, the changes in the rate constants k4 for the dissociation of the inhibited complex are smaller compared with wild type, at most 4-fold (Table III). Here, both single mutations at residues 30 and 166 enhance k4, and the double mutation causes an increase in k4 that is intermediate between the two individual single mutants (a partially additive interaction) (28Mildvan A.S. Weber D.J. Kuliopulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We conclude that the structural changes demonstrated at the active site upon the replacement of residues 30 and 166 result in enhanced dissociation of the product-inhibited complex. However, the specific details of this effect remain unknown, in part because the structure and identity of the inhibited complex is not yet determined. It is interesting that these mutations at residues 30 and 166 that decrease catalysis of the dismutation of superoxide also cause enhancement of the dissociation of the product-inhibited complex. This is an indication that the active-site conformation containing His30 and Tyr166 functions, in part, not only to enhance the catalytic dismutation but also to prolong the lifetime of the inhibited complex. This would have a selective advantage in blocking a cellular overproduction of toxic H2O2. 2Davis, C. A., Hearn, A. S., Fletcher, B., Bickford, J., Garcia, J. E., Leveque, V., Melendez, J.

https://openalex.org/W2070065520,"Atheroma macrophages internalize large quantities of lipoprotein-derived lipids. While most emphasis has been placed on cholesterol, lipoprotein-derived fatty acids may also play important roles in lesional macrophage biology. Little is known, however, about the trafficking or metabolism of these fatty acids. In this study, we first show that the cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification reaction, catalyzed by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), competes for the incorporation of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids into cellular phospholipids. Furthermore, conditions that inhibit trafficking of cholesterol from late endosomes/lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as the amphipathic amine U18666A and the Npc1+/- mutation, also inhibit incorporation of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids into phospholipids. The biological relevance of these findings was investigated by studying the suppression of agonist-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene C4/D4/E4 production during lipoprotein uptake by macrophages, which has been postulated to involve enrichment of cellular phospholipids with non-arachidonic fatty acids (NAAFAs). We found that eicosanoid suppression was markedly enhanced when ACAT was inhibited and prevented when late endosomal/lysosomal lipid trafficking was blocked. Moreover, PGE2 suppression depended entirely on acetyl-LDL-derived NAAFAs, not on acetyl-LDL-cholesterol, and was not due to decreased cPLA2 activity per se. These data support the following model: lipoprotein-derived NAAFAs traffic via the NPC1 pathway from late endosomes/lysosomes to a critical pool of phospholipids. In competing reactions, these NAAFAs can be either esterified to cholesterol or incorporated into phospholipids, resulting in suppression of eicosanoid biosynthesis. In view of recent evidence suggesting dysfunctional cholesterol esterification in late lesional macrophages, these data predict that such cells would have highly suppressed eicosanoid synthesis, thus affecting eicosanoid-mediated cell signaling in advanced atherosclerosis.

In view of recent evidence suggesting dysfunctional cholesterol esterification in late lesional macrophages, these data predict that such cells would have highly suppressed eicosanoid synthesis, thus affecting eicosanoid-mediated cell signaling in advanced atherosclerosis. Macrophages are a prominent feature of atherosclerotic lesions and play critical roles in both lesion initiation and progression (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 2Libby P. Clinton S.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 355-363Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). During atherogenesis, macrophages internalize atherogenic lipoproteins in the arterial subendothelium via receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In late endosomes/lysosomes or phagosomes, hydrolases release both cholesterol and fatty acids from these lipoproteins. Free cholesterol is exported from these degradative organelles by a vesicular transport process that requires the NPC1 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, Niemann-Pick C; AA, arachidonic acid; ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; cPLA2, cytosolic phospholipase A2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FC, free cholesterol; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; LT, leukotriene; NAAFA, non-arachidonic fatty acid; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; rAcLDL, reconstituted acetyl-LDL; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. protein and that is sensitive to a class of amphipathic amines, such as U18666A (6Liscum L. Munn N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). An important fate of this exported cholesterol is its esterification to fatty acids in the ER by ACAT (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 223-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction is particularly critical during the early stages of atherogenesis, because early lesional macrophages accumulate large amounts of ACAT-derived cholesteryl esters (“foam cells”) (5Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). While the fate of lipoprotein-cholesterol has been widely studied, much less is known about the fate of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids. The majority of released fatty acids traffic to the plasma membrane for efflux. Of those retained, most are incorporated into phospholipids (7Groener J.E. Bax W. Poorthuis B.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2271-2279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Li Q. Fuhrman B. Aviram M. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1995; 31: 474-478PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation with lipoprotein-derived cholesterol, however, the mechanisms and consequences of lipoprotein-derived fatty acid transport and metabolism are poorly understood. Our laboratory became interested in this topic in the context of our studies on lipid metabolism relevant to late lesional macrophages. In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages accumulate large amounts of unesterified, or “free,” cholesterol (FC) (3Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and recent in vivo data from our laboratory has provided evidence that this event is due to defective ACAT-mediated cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification (9Feng B. Zhang D. Kuriakose G. Devlin C.M. Kockx M. Tabas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10423-10428Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The consequences of FC accumulation are profound, including triggering of an ER stress pathway and apoptosis (3Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 10Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). However, a pool of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids should also accumulate as a consequence of defective cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification, and we wondered what the consequences of this would be. To explore this question, we took advantage of a model in which lipoprotein-derived fatty acids affect eicosanoid biosynthesis. In particular, investigators have observed that foam cell formation is associated with decreased eicosanoid synthesis, although the mechanism remains controversial (11Arai H. Nagano Y. Narumiya S. Kita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Pollaud C. Krause S. Lepert J.C. Orfila C. Seguelas M. Festal D. Decerprit J. Pipy B. Biochim. Biophys.

In this report, we explore the effects of altered lipid trafficking and cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification on lipoprotein-fatty acid incorporation into cellular phospholipids, cPLA2-induced fatty acid release, and eicosanoid synthesis in macrophages. We provide evidence for a model in which lipoprotein-derived non-arachidonic acid fatty acids (NAAFAs) traffic via the NPC1 pathway from late endosomes/lysosomes to a critical pool of phospholipids. In competing reactions, these NAAFAs can be either esterified to cholesterol or incorporated into phospholipids, resulting in suppression of eicosanoid biosynthesis.

All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Harvesting, Culturing, and Incubations of Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages—The mice used in this study were wild-type C57BL6/J (Jackson Laboratories), C57BL6/J in which a floxed macrophage CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α gene was silenced by LysMCre (15Zhang D. Tang W. Yao P.M. Yang C. Xie B. Jackowski S. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35368-35376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and Nctr-npc1N heterozygous/C57BL6/J. The npc1N mutation was detected by PCR analysis of tail DNA using PCR primers mp25-8f (GGTGCTGGACAGCCAAGTA) and mp25-INTR3 (GATGGTCTGTTCTCCCATG) as described by Loftus et al. (16Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Macrophages were harvested from the peritoneum of the mice 3 days after the intraperitoneal injection of 40 μg of concanavalin A in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then cultured as described previously (17Tang W. Walsh A. Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). On the day of the experiment, the cells were incubated for 5 h in 1% FBS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (w/v) containing 100 μg of acetyl-LDL/ml and 10 μg of compound 58035/ml, either in combination or separately as described previously (18Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Membranes and Cytosol—The details of this procedure are described elsewhere (19de Carvalho M.G. Garritano J. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20439-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, murine peritoneal macrophages were plated to confluency on a 6-well dish. After treatment, the monolayers were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped in 200 μl of 10 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 0.34 m sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4. Cell suspensions were then sonicated at 4 °C using twenty 0.5-s bursts at setting no. 1 on a Branson 450 sonicator equipped with a tapered microtip. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove whole cells, and then the supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet resulting from this centrifugation was used as a source of cellular membranes, and the supernatant fraction was used as a source of cytosol. The cytosol was used immediately for the cPLA2 activity assay. For immunoblotting, the cytosol was stored at -20 °C and thawed once. Lipoproteins—LDL (d, 1.020-1.063 g/ml) from fresh human plasma were isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation (20Havel R.J. Eder H. Bragdon J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6497) Google Scholar), and acetyl-LDL was prepared by reaction with acetic anhydride as described previously (21Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Acetyl-LDL was reconstituted with defined neutral lipids as described by Krieger (27Krieger M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.9 mg of acetyl-LDL and 25 mg of potato starch were frozen and lyophilized in a 15-ml glass tube. The endogenous core lipids were then extracted three times with 5 ml of heptane, and then 6 mg of the desired neutral lipid core (dissolved in 200 μl of heptane) was added to the tube. For cholesteryl-[14C]oleate, 2500 cpm/nmol neutral lipid was added. This mixture was dried, and the sample was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tricine, pH 8.4. This suspension was incubated for 10-24 h. The solubilized reconstituted lipoprotein was separated from the bulk of the starch and excess lipid by low-speed centrifugation (2000 rpm). The specimen was further clarified by two additional centrifugations at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and stored under argon at 4 °C. Arachidonic Acid Release and Eicosanoid Production—Confluent mouse peritoneal macrophages were grown on 24-well plates and incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 0.29 mg/ml glutamine, and 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with lipoproteins, and then stimulated with media containing 0.2% BSA and 20 μm A23187. After 5 min, the media were withdrawn and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to remove cellular debris, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The cells were dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH at room temperature for 5 h. A 100-μl aliquot of the cell lysate was counted, and the percent efflux was calculated as [(media cpm)/(cell + media cpm)] × 100. Background release from unstimulated cells (2-3%) was subtracted from each experimental point. The amount of PGE2 and LT-C4/D4/E4 in the media was determined using displacement enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. cPLA2 Immunoblotting—Laemmli electrophoresis sample buffer (5×) was added to 20 μg of cytosol. This mixture was boiled for 10 min, and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrotransfer to a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membrane, the blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-cPLA2 serum (1:2500) (23Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was then reprobed with an anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody to control for possible differences in loading. cPLA2 Activity Assay—cPLA2 activity in macrophage cytosol fractions was assayed using a liposomal substrate as described by de Carvalho et al. (19de Carvalho M.G. Garritano J. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20439-20446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μm unlabeled sn-2 arachidonyl PC, and 30 μm dioleoylglycerol, and phosphatidylcholine-1-stearoyl-2-[3H]arachidonyl (100,000 cpm/assay) were dried under nitrogen and then resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, with or without 1 mm CaCl2. The assay tubes were incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 5 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of 20 μg cytosol (50 μl final assay volume). The mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min, and then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.5 ml of Dole reagent (isopropyl alcohol/heptane/1 n H2SO4; 300:75:15) plus 20 μg of oleic acid carrier. To extract the lipids, 1.5 ml of heptane and 1 ml of water were added, followed by vortexing and centrifugation. The upper phase was passed over a 3-ml silica column (Supelco Cupelclean LC-Si SPE), and the released [3H]arachidonic acid was eluted with 2 ml of chloroform. The chloroform was evaporated, and the radioactivity was counted using liquid scintillation. For the experiments using cPLA2α, unlabeled sn-2 linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine was added to create liposomes with varying sn-2 arachidonoyl percentages. These liposomes were then incubated with cPLA2 for 1 min, and the release of [3H]AA was assayed as above. The cpm data were converted to mass data based upon the specific activity of [3H]AA in each liposome preparation. Fatty Acid Analysis—Macrophage lipids were extracted with 0.5 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) for two 30-min periods. The phospholipids were isolated by thin-layer chromatography on soft-layer adsorbosil using a solvent system of hexane/ethyl ether/glacial acidic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v). The phospholipid spot was scraped, and methyl ester derivatives of the phospholipid fatty acids were prepared by adding 1.5 ml of 7% acetyl chloride/dry methanol to the silica. After boiling for 60 min, the released fatty acyl methyl esters were extracted with 100 μl of hexane and 5 ml of 6% K2CO3. After vortexing and centrifugation, the fatty acyl methyl esters in the upper phase were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as described previously (24Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Johnson S.B. Schmid H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5002-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole Cell Cholesterol Esterification Assay—Macrophages were incubated for 5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% FBS containing 0.1 mm [14C]oleate complexed with albumin and 100 μg/ml AcLDL. Then, the cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS, and cellular lipids were extracted twice with 0.5 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) for 30 min at room temperature. Whole cell cholesterol esterification activity was assayed by determining the cellular content of cholesteryl-[14C]oleate by thin-layer chromatography (25Tabas I. Boykow G.C. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The lipid-extracted cellular material was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and aliquots were assayed for protein by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trafficking of Lipoprotein-derived Fatty Acids to Phospholipids— Mouse peritoneal macrophages were grown to confluency on 24-well plates. The cells were incubated for 5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% FBS containing 100 μg/ml reconstituted acetyl-LDL containing a neutral lipid core of cholesteryl-[14C]oleate. Various pharmacological agents were added as described under “Results.” At the end of the 5-h incubation, cellular lipids were extracted in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2) as described above. The phospholipids were isolated by TLC using 80:20:1 (v/v) hexane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid. The phospholipid spots were scraped, and [14C]oleate incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Statistics—Values are given as means ± S.E. (n = 3); absent error bars in the bar graphs signify S.E. values smaller than the graphic symbols. Incorporation of Lipoprotein-derived Fatty Acids into Cellular Phospholipids Is Enhanced by ACAT Inhibition and Is Dependent on a U18666A-senstitive, NPC1-dependent Trafficking Pathway—The incorporation of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids into cellular phospholipids can have important biological consequences, yet little is known about the how such events are regulated. Our first goal was to determine how cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification, a potentially competing reaction for fatty acid incorporation into phospholipids, affects this process. To evaluate the incorporation of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids into cellular phospholipids, the neutral lipid core of acetyl-LDL was reconstituted with cholesteryl-[14C]oleate using the procedure of Krieger (27Krieger M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These lipoproteins were then incubated with mouse peritoneal macrophages for 5 h. Cellular lipids were extracted, and phospholipids were isolated by thin-layer chromatography to determine formation of phospholipid-[14C]oleate. To determine how cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification might affect this process, the ACAT inhibitor 58035 was included in some of the incubations. As shown by the black bars in Fig. 1A, inhibition of esterification led to a substantial 2.6-fold increase in the incorporation of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids into cellular phospholipids. These data suggest cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification uses a pool of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids that would otherwise be incorporated into cellular phospholipids. Thus, when ACAT is active, lipoprotein-derived fatty acid incorporation into phospholipids is limited by the competing cholesterol esterification reaction. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that incubation of macrophages with acetyl-LDL plus 58035 induces de novo phospholipid biosynthesis via activation of the rate-limiting enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase α (CTα) (18Shiratori Y. Okwu A.K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11337-11348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29894-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased incorporation of fatty acids into phospholipids displayed in Fig. 1A might result from an overall increase in de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. To test this possibility, CTα-deficient macrophages, which have markedly diminished de novo phospholipid biosynthesis in response to acetyl-LDL and 58035 (15Zhang D. Tang W. Yao P.M. Yang C. Xie B. Jackowski S. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35368-35376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), were incubated with cholesteryl-[14C]oleate-labeled acetyl-LDL and 58035 and compared with wild-type macrophages in their incorporation of lipoprotein fatty acids into cellular phospholipids. We found that the CTα-deficient macrophages showed the same increase in phospholipid [14C]oleate incorporation as wild-type macrophages (1.6-fold increase in macrophages lacking CTα versus 1.7-fold for macrophages with functional CTα). These data suggest that lipoprotein-derived fatty acids, when not utilized for the competing cholesterol esterification reaction, are incorporated into cellular phospholipids via transesterification rather than by an increase in de novo phospholipid biosynthesis. Recent evidence suggests that lipoprotein-derived cholesterol-fatty acyl esters are hydrolyzed in an endosomal compartment and then transferred to late endosomes/lysosomes, where the liberated cholesterol is trafficked to peripheral cellular sites via an NPC1-dependent pathway (29Sugii S. Reid P.C. Ohgami N. Du H. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27180-27189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To determine if the trafficking of acetyl-LDL-derived [14C]oleate to cellular phospholipids shares properties with the trafficking of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol, we determined the susceptibility of phospholipid-[14C]oleate formation to the cholesterol trafficking inhibitor, U18666A. U18666A is an amphipathic amine that blocks the NPC1-dependent pathway of late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol transport in cells (30Liscum L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown by the gray bars in Fig. 1A, U18666A markedly diminished the incorporation of lipoprotein-derived [14C]oleate into phospholipids, an effect particularly apparent in the ACAT-inhibited macrophages. These data imply that lipoprotein-derived fatty acids traffic via an U18666A-inhibitable pathway from late endosomes/lysosomes to cellular phospholipids. To further support a role for late endosomal/lysosomal trafficking, we employed macrophages with a heterozygous mutation in Npc1, which have a partial defect in intracellular cholesterol trafficking (10Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D. Harding H.P. Sweeney M. Rong J.X. Kuriakose G. Fisher E.A. Marks A.R. Ron D. Tabas I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 31Feng B. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43271-43280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These Npc1+/- mice, unlike Npc1-/- mice, have a normal lifespan and thus are more amenable for the isolation of peritoneal macrophages. Because of the partial defect in cholesterol trafficking, we predicted that these macrophages would have a partial defect in the trafficking of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids. To test this idea, peritoneal macrophages from Npc1+/+ and Npc1± mice were assayed for their ability to incorporate acetyl-LDL-derived [14C]oleate into phospholipids. As predicted, [14C]oleate incorporation into phospholipids was partially suppressed in Npc1+/- macrophages, which was most apparent in ACAT-inhibited cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, the NPC1 pathway is not only involved in late endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol trafficking (32Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) but also in the trafficking of lipoprotein-derived fatty acids. Suppression of A23187-induced Eicosanoid Secretion Is Enhanced by ACAT Inhibition and is Dependent on a U18666A-senstitive, NPC1-dependent Trafficking Pathway—We hypothesized that the effects of cholesterol-fatty acyl esterification and late endosomal/lysosomal trafficking on lipoprotein-derived fatty acid incorporation into cellular phospholipid would have important biological effects on cells that internalize lipoproteins. To test this idea, we first used a model in which incubation of macrophages with foam cell-inducing lipoproteins like acetyl-LDL causes a defect in agonist-induced AA release and PGE2 production (11Arai H. Nagano Y. Narumiya S. Kita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Pollaud C. Krause S. Lepert J.C. Orfila C. Seguelas M. Festal D. Decerprit J.

Albright E. Field F.J. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1385-1395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that cholesterol-loading of macrophages leads to a defect in cPLA2 activation. Pollaud et al. (12Pollaud C. Krause S. Lepert J.C. Orfila C. Seguelas M. Festal D. Decerprit J. Pipy B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) hypothesized that stimulation of ACAT was necessary for the suppression in PGE2 synthesis by sequestering AA. Arai et al. (11Arai H. Nagano Y. Narumiya S. Kita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) demonstrated an inverse correlation with percent AA composition of cellular phospholipids, which is consistent with a mechanism in which enrichment of cellular phospholipids with lipoprotein-derived non-AA fatty acids suppresses PGE2 synthesis. To address these uncertainties in the context of our new findings on lipoprotein-fatty acid trafficking and metabolism, we first assayed PGE2 secretion in macrophages incubated with acetyl-LDL in the absence or presence of 58035 and U18666A. In particular, we hypothesized that if lipoprotein-derived fatty acid incorporation into cellular phospholipids was important in suppressing PGE2 production, then ACAT inhibition should enhance the suppression and U18666A should prevent the suppression. Thus, macrophages were incubated for 5 h with 100 μg/ml acetyl-LDL alone or in addition to 10 μg/ml 58035, 1"
https://openalex.org/W2023402640,"Cell fate determination in invertebrate and vertebrate systems is regulated by the Notch signaling pathway. Four mammalian Notch genes, Notch 1–4, encode differentially expressed transmembrane receptors. The canonical Notch pathway involves proteolytic liberation of the Notch-1 intracellular domain (NIC-1), which activates CSL (CBF1, Su(H), and Lag-1)-mediated transactivation. We showed previously that NIC-1 also represses activator protein-1 (AP-1)-mediated transactivation. The N-terminal RAM (RBP-Jκ associated molecule) domain of NIC-1 was required for both activation and repression. To investigate the mechanism of AP-1 repression, we tested whether distinct sequences within the RAM domain mediate activation versus repression. We analyzed the capacity of RAM domain mutants to bind endogenous CBF1, to activate CSL-mediated transactivation, and to repress AP-1. A mutant lacking 20 amino acids of the RAM domain (Δ1759–1778) resembled the RAM domain deletion mutant in being defective in all activities. Analysis of 14 deletion and alanine substitution mutants revealed a correlation between CBF1 binding, CSL-mediated transactivation, and AP-1 repression. Stably transfected K562 cells could only tolerate very low level expression of wild-type NIC-1 and NIC-1 mutants retaining activation/repression activities. By contrast, transcriptionally compromised NIC-1 mutants accumulated at high levels. These results support a model in which the binding of NIC-1 to CBF1 is required for AP-1 repression and reveal a powerful cell-sensing mechanism that suppresses the levels of transcriptionally competent NIC-1.

Given the diverse macromolecular interactions in which Notch engages and its crucial biological functions, not surprisingly, the domain organization of Notch is highly conserved (18Milner L.A. Bigas A. Blood. 1999; 93: 2431-2448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Notch extracellular domain contains up to 36 tandem epidermal growth factor-like repeats and three cysteine rich Lin-12/Notch repeats, which function in ligand binding and Notch activation. The N terminus of NIC contains the RAM domain that physically associates with CSL proteins, which bind preferentially to the DNA sequence CGTGGGAA (9Tamura K. Taniguchi Y. Minoguchi S. Sakai T.

The region C-terminal to the RAM domain, containing six cdc10/Ankyrin repeats, mediates additional protein interactions. The cdc10/Ankyrin repeats also interact weakly with CSL (20Aster J.C. Xu L. Karnell F.G. Patriub V. Pui J.C. Pear W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7505-7515Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The region C-terminal to the cdc10/Ankyrin domain has been implicated in various protein interactions and is important for transactivation (TAD) (21Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), although the PEST motif contributes to the control of Notch stability (22Rechsteiner M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1988; 27: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Drosophila Notch and mammalian Notch-1, -2, and -3 contain nuclear localization signals (23Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an OPA sequence of unknown function (24Wharton K.A. Yedvobnick B. Finnerty V.G. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1985; 40: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We reported that the human Notch-1 intracellular domain (NIC-1) not only activates CSL-mediated transactivation but also represses AP-1-mediated transactivation (25Chu J. Jeffries S. Norton J.E. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7587-7597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because endogenous AP-1 target genes were repressed and similar concentrations of NIC-1 mediated activation versus repression, repression appeared to be physiologically relevant. Repression correlated with nuclear localization of NIC-1 and required the RAM domain. Repression was not accompanied by altered c-Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent signaling events, which activate AP-1.

Since our discovery of Notch-AP-1 cross-talk, two additional reports described similar interactions (39Talora C. Sgroi D.C. Crum C.P. Dotto G.P.

NIC-1 repressed transcription of E6/E7 papillomavirus genes, and this was accompanied by up-regulation of Fra-1, a component of inhibitory AP-1 complexes, and down-regulation of c-Fos, a component of activating AP-1 complexes (39Talora C. Sgroi D.C. Crum C.P. Dotto G.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2252-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, Fra-1 and c-Fos (25Chu J. Jeffries S. Norton J.E. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7587-7597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) expression were unaffected by NIC-1 in K562 cells, under conditions in which AP-1-mediated transactivation was repressed. Furthermore, NIC-1 expression in K562 cells did not impact upon AP-1 DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts in vitro, indicating that NIC-1 did not induce the assembly of stable repressive heterodimers. Another member of the AP-1/ATF superfamily of basic leucine zipper transcription factors, B-ATF, is up-regulated by NIC-1 in Epstein-Barr virus-negative B-cell lymphoma BJAB cells (40Johansen L.M. Deppmann C.D. Erickson K.D. Coffin 3rd, W.F. Thornton T.M. Humphrey S.E. Martin J.M. Taparowsky E.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6029-6040Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). B-ATF is expressed highest in hematopoietic tissues and assembles into a repressive complex with c-Jun. Because B-ATF is not expressed in HeLa cells, NIC-1 represses AP-1 in these cells (25Chu J. Jeffries S. Norton J.E. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7587-7597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and as noted above, NIC-1 does not affect AP-1 DNA binding activity in vitro, it is unlikely that B-ATF is a general mediator of inhibitory NIC-1-AP-1 cross-talk. Thus, although Fra-1 and B-ATF mediate NIC-1-AP-1 cross-talk in certain contexts, we expect that multiple modes of cross-talk exist, analogous to the inhibitory steroid receptor-AP-1 cross-talk, which has been studied for more than a decade without a unifying mechanism (41Karin M. Chang L. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 42Schroen D.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the mechanism of how Notch represses AP-1 and describe the identification of eight amino acids within the RAM domain that are crucial for CSL binding, activation, and repression. This analysis also revealed a powerful cell-sensing mechanism for selectively down-regulating NIC-1, which can be overridden by substituting only four amino acid residues with alanines.

Human NIC-1 deletion mutants were generated by the following methods.

The purified backbone of the vector was ligated with the NIC-1(EcoNI-EcoO109I) fragment containing Δ1821–1827, Δ1827–1833, or Δ1834–1840, which was generated by ligating two oligonucleotide duplexes. The NIC-1 constructs containing the deletion mutations were then subcloned into the pBabe-NIC-1(SacII-BamHI)/Myc vector. NIC-1(Δ1759–1778) was generated by high fidelity PCR using a full-length NIC-1 expression vector as the template. NIC-1(BamHI-SacII) containing Δ1759–1778 was generated by PCR using the following primer pair: CGCGGATCCACCATGGAGGCCAGCAAG (the BamHI site is shown in italics, the initiator methionine is in bold type, and the NIC-1 sequences are underlined) and AGGCCCGCGGACATTGACGTCCATGC (the SacII site is shown in italics, and the NIC-1 sequences are underlined). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and SacII. The pBabe-NIC-1 expression vector was digested with BamHI and SalI yielding pBabe(SalI-BamHI) and NIC-1(BamHI-SalI). These fragments were purified, and NIC-1(BamHI-SalI) was digested with SacII. The purified pBabe(SalI-BamHI) and NIC-1(SacII-SalI) fragments and the PCR product were ligated to generate NIC-1(Δ1759–1778). Alanine substitution mutagenesis of NIC-1 was accomplished by insertion of oligonucleotide fragments containing alanine substitutions into the NIC-1 expression vector after digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes. For NIC-1(1759–1762A), NIC-1(1763–1766A), and NIC-1(1767–1770A), the pBabe-NIC-1 expression vector was digested with BamHI and SalI. Purified NIC-1(BamHI-SalI) was subjected to another digestion with Bsu36I. Purified pBabe(SalI-BamHI) and NIC-1(Bsu36I-SalI) were ligated with oligonucleotides containing Ala substitutions. NIC-1(1771–1774A) and NIC-1(1775–1778A) were generated by sequential high fidelity PCR reactions. A short fragment from the NIC-1 BamHI site to the sequences that were substituted with Ala residues and a long fragment from the same sequences to the NIC-1 SacII site were generated by PCR using two primer sets. This strategy was designed such that the two fragments had substantial overlapping sequences surrounding the Ala substitution region. The fragments were then used as templates to generate the NIC-1(BamHI-SacII) fragment containing Ala substitutions using the forward primer for the short fragment and the reverse primer for the long fragment. After digestion with BamHI and SacII, this fragment was ligated with pBabe(SalI-BamHI) and NIC-1(SacII-SalI). Cell Culture—The human erythroleukemia cell line K562 was maintained as described previously (25Chu J. Jeffries S. Norton J.E. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol.

The cells were propagated in Iscove's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) (complete IMEM) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in the presence of 5% carbon dioxide. Transient Transfections—K562 cells (5 × 105) were collected by centrifugation at 240 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 4 ml of complete IMEM. Plasmid DNAs (1 μg of reporter and 2 μg of effector) were suspended in 150 μl of IMEM, incubated with Superfect (4 μl/1 μg DNA; Qiagen) for 10 min at room temperature, and then added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 26 h post-transfection and then treated with TPA (final concentration, 5 nm) or the vehicle (Me2SO). After incubating for 16 h, the cells were harvested, and the cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity. The luciferase activity was normalized by the protein content of the lysates, determined by Bradford assay using γ-globulin as a standard. To determine the expression levels of wild-type NIC-1 and NIC-1 mutants, DNA was transiently transfected into K562 cells using DM-RIE-C (Invitrogen). DNA (24 μg) and DMRIE-C reagent (72 μl) were diluted in 2.0 and 3.0 ml of OPTI-MEM I medium (Invitrogen), respectively. The two solutions were combined and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. K562 cells (9 × 106) were collected by centrifugation at 240 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1.0 ml of OPTI-MEM I medium. The cells were then added to the mixture of transfection components. After incubation at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 4 h, complete IMEM (12 ml) containing 15% fetal bovine serum was added to the cells. The expression levels of wild-type NIC-1 and NIC-1 mutants were determined by Western blotting 40 h post-transfection. Stable Transfection—K562 cells were stably transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). K562 cells (1 × 106) were collected by centrifugation at 240 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 800 μl of OPTI-MEM I medium. Plasmid DNA (2 μg) was added to 100 μl of OPTI-MEM I medium, incubated with LipofectAMINE 2000 (4.5 μl/μg of DNA in 100 μl of OPTI-MEM I medium) for 30 min at room temperature, and then added to the cells. After incubating for 5 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, complete IMEM (2 ml) containing 15% fetal bovine serum was added to the cells. Puromycin (1.5 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added 72 h post-transfection to select for stable transfectants, and expression levels were measured by Western blotting and by real time RT-PCR after 10–20 days of selection. Western Blotting—To detect the expression of Myc-tagged NIC-1 and NIC-1 mutants, whole cell lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were split into two aliquots and immunoprecipitated with either preimmune sera or anti-NIC-1 polyclonal antisera. Immune complexes were adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose, and eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on an 8% acrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) and detected by immunoblotting with the anti-Myc tag polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; catalog number 06-549). CBF1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-CBF1 polyclonal antisera raised against purified full-length CBF1. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from K562 cells stably expressing the blank vector, wild-type NIC-1, or NIC-1 mutants was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized by annealing RNA (2 μg) with 250 ng of a 1:4 mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers by heating at 68 °C for 10 min. After denaturation, the samples were incubated with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (10 units/μl; Invitrogen) combined with 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTPs, and 2 units/μl RNasin (Promega) at 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was heat-inactivated at 95–100 °C for 5 min and diluted to a final volume of 200 μl. Quantitative real time RT-PCR reactions (25 μl) contained 2 μl of cDNA, 12.5 μl of SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems), and the appropriate primers. Product accumulation was monitored by SYBR Green fluorescence. The relative expression levels were determined from a standard curve of serial dilutions of cDNA samples. Forward and reverse primers for real time RT-PCR (5′-3′) were: human NIC-Myc, CCAGATCGCGCGCATC and GATATCAGCTTCTGCTCCTCAGC; human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase, ATTGGTGGAGATGATCTCTCAACTTT and GCCAGTGCAATTATATCTTCCACAA; human Itch, AAACAGTCCCAAGTGGAAGCA and TCTGGTGACTCCACACACGAA; human Wwp1, CCAAAACCACTCGCATCTGAG and CGTGACAGACGCATTATCAGTTG; and human MMP1, ACAAATCCCTTCTACCCGGAA and CCCTTTGAA-AAACCGGACTTC. Structure/Function Analysis of NIC-1 RAM Domain Internal Deletion Mutants—Sequences within the highly conserved RAM domain (amino acids 1759–1819) of NIC-1 and amino acids 2105–2114 are crucial for CSL-mediated transactivation and AP-1 repression (25Chu J. Jeffries S. Norton J.E. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7587-7597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To test whether distinct sequences mediate activation versus repression and whether CSL binding is required for repression, we systematically mutagenized the RAM domain and conducted a structure/function analysis. Seven RAM domain internal deletion mutants were generated, which together with NIC-1(Δ1841–1847), resulted in mutagenesis of the majority of RAM domain sequences (Fig. 1). Expression vectors encoding the mutants were transiently transfected into K562 erythroleukemia cells, and expression was assessed by immunoprecipitation of extracts with anti-NIC-1 antibody, followed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. All of the mutants were expressed, and the expression levels did not differ greatly compared with wild-type NIC-1. However, NIC-1(ΔRAM) and NIC-1(Δ1759–1778) were reproducibly expressed at higher levels than wild-type NIC-1 and other deletion mutants (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2CBF1 binding, CSL-mediated transactivation, and AP-1 repressing activities of NIC-1 RAM domain internal deletion mutants. A, Western blot analysis of wild-type NIC-1 and NIC-1 deletion mutants. A blank vector or a NIC-1 expression vector was introduced into K562 cells by transient transfection. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-NIC-1 antibody or preimmune antisera (PI), and the bands were detected by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. The bracket identifies bands representing wild-type NIC-1 and mutants. The protein samples were resolved on separate gels (left and right blots), in which the mobility of bands differed slightly. B, Western blot analysis of endogenous CBF1 binding to NIC-1 and NIC-1 mutants. C, transient transfection analysis of CSL-mediated transactivation. D, transient transfection analysis of AP-1 repression. For C and D, K562 cells were transiently transfected with CBF1 (p4xCBF1luc, C) or AP-1 reporter (p1xAP-1luc, D) vectors and the empty pBabe vector or vectors encoding NIC-1 or NIC-1 mutants. Endogenous AP-1 was activated by treatment with TPA (5 nm, 16 h). The luciferase activity was normalized by the protein content of the lysate. The graph depicts data from three independent transient transfection experiments (means ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the mutants were competent to stably associate with endogenous CBF1, the blot of Fig. 2A was reprobed with anti-CBF1 antisera (Fig. 2B). Although CBF1 binding requires the RAM domain, the specific molecular determinants of binding have not been defined in detail. Endogenous CBF1 coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type NIC-1 and NIC-1(Δ1841–1847) but not the RAM domain deletion mutant NIC-1(ΔRAM). CBF1 coimmunoprecipitated with all RAM domain mutants except NIC-1(Δ1759–1778), which lacks the first 20 amino acids of the N terminus of the RAM domain. Similar to NIC-1(ΔRAM), no CBF1 was recovered upon immunoprecipitation of NIC-1(Δ1759–1778), whereas similar amounts of CBF1 were recovered upon immunoprecipitation of other RAM domain mutants and wild-type NIC-1. The mutants were compared with wild-type NIC-1 for their capacity to activate transcription from a luciferase reporter plasmid containing four CBF1-binding sites (11Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P.

We have determined the solution NMR structure of a recombinant onconase with Met-1, Gln1, and Leu23 residues (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC. The 20 best solution structures had a backbone root mean square deviation of 0.41 ± 0.09 Å with respect to the average structure. The energy-minimized average NMR structure had a backbone root mean square deviation of 0.72 Å from the x-ray crystallographic structure of native onconase; however, the orientation of the N-terminal residue in the two structures was very different. Comparison of the 15N HSQC spectrum of (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC with that of a mutant E1S-rONC, which is identical to the nONC except with the N-terminal pyroglutamyl residue replaced by Ser, showed that N-terminal and residue 23 mutations induced structural changes in regions beyond the mutation sites. Model-free analysis of the backbone amide 15N-T1, 15N-T2, and 15N-1H NOE relaxation data for (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC and E1S-rONC revealed that the E1S-rONC molecule showed very little flexibility, whereas (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC exhibited substantial flexibility, which may account for the previously observed reduced stability and increased protease susceptibility. The α1 helix and β-sheets of (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC displayed bending motions. These data provided strong evidence for the presence of an N-terminal hydrogen bond network in E1S-rONC, but not in (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC.

Biol. 1994; 236: 1141-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and found to be very similar to that of RNase A, RC-RNase (4Chang C.F. Chen C.P. Chen Y.C. Hom K. Huang R.F. Huang T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and RNase 4 (17Hsu C.H. Liao Y.D. Pan Y.R. Chen L.W. Wu S.H. Leu Y.J. Chen C.P. J. Mol.

A unique structural feature of the molecule is the orientation of the N-terminal pyroglutamyl residue (Pyr1), which folds back against the N-terminal α-helix and forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain nitrogen of Lys9 and the carbonyl group of Val96 in the C-terminal β-sheet and is proposed to play an important role in catalysis. A similar arrangement of Pyr1 is seen in RC-RNase (18Leu Y.-J. Chern S.-S. Wang S.-C. Hsiao Y.-Y. Amiraslanov I. Liaw Y.-C. Liao Y.-D. J. Biol.

A mutant of the recombinant enzyme (rONC), (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC, in which a methionine was added to the N terminus, Pyr1 was replaced with Gln, and Met23 was replaced with Leu, shows considerably reduced ribonuclease activity and cytotoxicity; however, cleavage of the N-terminal Met, followed by cyclization of the new N-terminal Gln residue to the native pyroglutamyl, results in the M23L-rONC mutant, which has an IC50 33.3% of that of native ONC and a catalytic activity 10-fold higher than that of (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC and about 2-fold higher than that of nONC. Using a different approach, Notomista et al. (19Notomista E. Cafaro V. Fusiello R. Bracale A. D'Alessio G. Di Donato A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) used Aeromonus proteolytica aminopeptidase to cleave the N-terminal Met from (M-1, Q1, M32L)rONC, and their refolded M23L-rONC mutant was 5-fold more active than nONC and retained all of the antitumor activity. Furthermore, M23L-rONC was shown to be significantly more susceptible to thermal and GuHCl-induced denaturation and less resistant to proteolysis (20Notomista E. Catanzano F. Graziano G. Dal Piaz F.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) further showed that modification of the 5′-region of the nONC gene to encode Ser1 (M-1, E1S)rONC or Tyr1 (M-1, E1Y)rONC results in an active enzyme, and the activity of these two mutants was proposed to be due to the presence of the hydroxyl oxygen atoms in the Ser and Tyr residues, which assume the role of the carbonyl oxygen of the pyroglutamate residue. More recently Liao and co-workers (22Liao Y.-D. Wang S.-C. Leu Y.-J. Wang C.-F. Chang S.-T. Hong Y.-T. Pan Y.-R. Chen C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5247-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that an endogenous methionine aminopeptidase in Escherichia coli is capable of cleaving the Met-1 residue preceding a small amino acid such as Ala and Ser. Thus, the restored activity in (M-1, E1S)rONC as observed by Newton et al. (21Newton D.L. Boque L. Wlodawer A. Huang C.Y. Rybak S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) may be due to the activity of E1S-rONC with the Met-1 removed by methionine aminopeptidase, and the presence of a hydrogen bond network involving Ser1 and the active site residues was also proposed but not proven. It is therefore important to explore the structural basis of mutation-induced functional changes. At present, no solution structure of onconase and no information on its dynamics have been reported. The structures of the onconase mutants are also not available. We have used NMR techniques to study the structure-function relationship of the cytotoxic RNases (4Chang C.F. Chen C.P. Chen Y.C. Hom K.

In this paper, we describe the solution structure and dynamics of the onconase mutant, (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC, and the dynamics of the E1S-rONC mutant. The structure coordinates of the solution structure of (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession numbers PDB ID 1PU3 and RCSB ID RCSB019565). Protein Sample Preparation and Characterization—A synthetic onconase gene coding for (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC, kindly provided by Dr. R. J. Youle (NINDS, National Institutes of Health), was cloned into the pET-11d plasmid and expressed in the E. coil BL21 (DE3) strain using isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as inducing agent (25Boix E. Wu Y. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The expressed protein was isolated as inclusion bodies. After vigorous washing, the protein was dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl containing 100 mm reduced glutathione and incubated at room temperature under nitrogen for 2 h. The protein was then renatured by rapid dilution into 20 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 ml-arginine and 8 mm oxidized glutathione, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 24 h prior to purification, as described previously (25Boix E. Wu Y. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was confirmed by electrophoresis on 10 and 27% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and was found to be greater than 95%. The plasmid encoding the (M-1, E1S)rONC gene was a generous gift from Dr. S. M. Rybak (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center); the protein was expressed and purified as described previously (21Newton D.L. Boque L. Wlodawer A. Huang C.Y. Rybak S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Two fractions of protein were found in our final purification step, and the enzymatic activities and cell cytotoxicities of these fractions were checked as reported previously (21Newton D.L. Boque L. Wlodawer A. Huang C.Y. Rybak S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fraction 2 was found to retain the enzymatic activity and cell cytotoxicity as reported previously, whereas fraction one had significantly reduced activities. The molecular mass of fraction 2 was checked with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS), and the first 10-amino acid sequence was determined by liquid chromatography-MS-MS. The molecule was found to correspond to E1S-rONC mutant with no N-terminal methionine instead of the expected (M-1, E1S)rONC. This fraction (named E1S-rONC hereafter) was used for further NMR structural characterization. We suspect that Met-1 in fraction 2 was removed by methionine aminopeptidase as reported by Liao et al. (22Liao Y.-D. Wang S.-C. Leu Y.-J. Wang C.-F. Chang S.-T. Hong Y.-T. Pan Y.-R. Chen C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5247-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Uniformly 13C- and/or 15N-labeled protein samples were purified from E. coli grown in M9 medium, supplemented with 2 g/liter [u-13C]glucose and/or 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA). Activity and Cytotoxicity Assays—The enzymatic activity of (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC, E1S-rONC, and nONC was assayed as described previously (21Newton D.L. Boque L. Wlodawer A. Huang C.Y. Rybak S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All showed a similar affinity for tRNA, with Km values of 22–26 μm at pH 6.0. However, the enzymatic activities were very different, with nONC exhibiting the highest activity, followed by (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC, then by E1S-rONC (13.6 and 1.7%, of the activity of nONC, respectively). These results are in good agreement with reported values (21Newton D.L. Boque L. Wlodawer A. Huang C.Y. Rybak S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Boix E. Wu Y. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of nONC, (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC, and E1S-rONC was assayed on SF539 cells as described previously (21Newton D.L. Boque L. Wlodawer A. Huang C.Y. Rybak S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2500 cells in 0.1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum were plated in each well of a 96-well plate, and then, after 24 h, the test samples (10 μl) were added, and the cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. To measure protein synthesis, the serum-containing medium was replaced with 100 μl of serum- and leucine-free RPMI, and then 0.1 mCi of [14C]leucine (10 μl) was added, and incubation continued for 2–4 h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested on glass fiber filters using a PHD cell harvester; the filters washed with H2O and dried with ethanol; and the bound radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Each point was carried out in triplicate. As expected from a previous study (21Newton D.L. Boque L. Wlodawer A. Huang C.Y. Rybak S.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5173-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), nONC showed the highest cytotoxicity (IC50 4 μg/ml), followed by E1S-rONC (IC50 45–50 μg/ml) and then (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC (IC50 > 100 μg/ml). Mass Spectrometry—ESI-MS experiments were carried out on a Finnigan LCQ™ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) with an electrospray ionization interface. The ESI source was operated in positive ion mode. The sample solution was applied using a high pressure liquid chromatography pump with loop injection. The ESI was operated at a spray voltage of 4.5 kV, a heated capillary temperature of 160 °C, and a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in full-scan profile mode with a scan range from m/z 150 to 2000. Xcalibur (version 1.3; ThermoFinnigan) and BioWorks™ 3.0 software packages were used for data acquisition and analysis and in the reconstruction of the molecular weight from the spectra. A molecular weight of 12,095 was obtained for 15N-labeled (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC, compared with the expected value of 12,102. For 15N-labeled E1S-rONC, the measured molecular weight was 11,935, compared with a calculated value of 11,946. NMR Experiments—Samples for NMR experiments (about 0.35 ml of 2 mm protein in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 10% D2O at pH 7.0) were sealed in Shigemi tubes. The pH was measured using a JENCO microelectronic pH-vision model 6071 pH meter equipped with a 4-mm electrode. All reported pH values are direct readings from the pH meter without correction for the isotope effect. To monitor the exchange rates of labile protons, a concentrated sample in H2O was lyophilized and redissolved in D2O (99.99% D), and NMR spectra were acquired immediately and thereafter at appropriate time intervals. All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE600 NMR spectrometer with the probe temperature set at 310 K. Spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker AG, Karlsruhe, Germany) or NMRPipe (26Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11549) Google Scholar) and analyzed using AURELIA (27Neidig K.P. Geyer M. Gorler A. Antz C. Saffrich R. Beneicke W. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or SPARKY (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Linear predictions (28Zhu G. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 192-199Google Scholar) were used in the indirect dimensions to improve the digital resolution. Chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate at 0 ppm (29Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B. Wright P.E. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 933-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The 15N and 13C chemical shifts were indirectly referenced using consensus Ξ ratios of the zero-point frequencies at 310 K of 0.101329118 for 15N/1H and 0.251449530 for 13C/1H (30Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Experimental Restraints and Structure Calculation and Analysis—An ensemble of NMR structures of (M-1, Q1, M23L)rONC was calculated based on NOE data, backbone dihedral angles, and hydrogen bond constraints. Hydrogen bond constraints were derived from the long range NOE data and H-D exchange experiments. At the initial stage of the structure calculation and NOE assignment, only protons that show slow exchange (longer than 8 h), display the characteristic NOE pattern, and show chemical shift indices (CSI) that indicate the presence of secondary structure (31Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) were assumed to be involved in hydrogen bonds. In some cases, hydrogen bond constraints were set to have multiple partners. In total, 49 hydrogen bonds were included in the final calculation, giving 98 hydrogen bond constraints. Backbone ϕ dihedral angles were obtained using the 3JHNHα coupling constants derived from HNHA experiments (32Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) and the empirical Karplus equation (33Pardi A. Billeter M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Backbone Ψ dihedral angles predicted using TALOS (34Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) were included in the structure calculation if they were found to be consistent with the secondary structure obtained from the CSI and NOE patterns. These gave rise to a total of 94 ϕ and 56 Ψ dihedral angle constraints. NOE distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC and 13C NOESY-HSQC and two-dimensional 13C-filtered NOESY spectra, all collected with a mixing time of 100 ms. The NOE spectra were peak-picked and quantified using the automatic picking routines of AURELIA and Sparky. Initially, the three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY spectrum was partially assigned manually, and then the manually assigned and unassigned NOEs from the 15N-separated spectrum and unassigned 13C NOESY spectra were used as input for the ARIA (35Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) software package for further NOE assignment. The NOE cross-peaks assigned by ARIA were interactively reexamined manually using Sparky. For the structure calculation, we used CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar) interfaced with ARIA 1.2. We used the parallhdg5.3 force field with ARIA default SA parameters during iterations it0–it8. Stereospecific assignment of prochiral groups was achieved using a floating assignment approach (37Folmer R. Nilges M. Konings R. Hilbers C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4132-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as implemented in the ARIA package. The 20 lowest energy structures, chosen from 100 calculated structures, were subjected to further refinement after hydration with a shell of water molecules. This ensemble of structures was analyzed using the programs InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego), GRASP (38Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar), MOLMOL (39Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar), and PROCHECK-NMR (40Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4418) Google Scholar). Relaxation Data Analysis—The longitudinal and transverse relaxation rate constants, R1 (equal to 1/T1) and R2 (equal to 1/T2), were obtained from a Marquardt-based nonlinear least-squares fit (using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) and subroutines in A. G. Palmer's Model-free package (New York)) of the measured cross-peak intensities to a single exponential function. The reported Ri values are the mean values of two independent data sets. The heteronuclear NOE value (XNOE) was determined from the peak intensity ratio in the spectra recorded, respectively, with or without proton saturation. The reported XNOE value is the average value of three pairs of XNOE experiments. The diffusion tensor analysis followed previously described procedures (41Huang Y.T. Liaw Y.C. Gorbatyuk V.Y. Huang T.-h. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1075-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Model-free Formalism—The heteronuclear 15N relaxation rate constants, R1 and R2, and the 1H-15N steady state XNOE values were further analyzed by model-free formalism, pioneered by Lipari and Szabo (42Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3397) Google Scholar, 43Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1872) Google Scholar) and further extended by Clore et al. (44Clore G.M. Szabo A. Bax A. Kay L.E. Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4989-4991Crossref Scopus (970) Google Scholar). In this approach, the overall and internal molecular motions are assumed to be independent, and the spectral density function for a molecule undergoing isotropic tumbling is given by the equation,J(ω)=25)S2τm1+(ωτm)2+(1-Sf2)τf'1+(ωτf')2+Sf2-S2)τs'1+(ωτs')2)(Eq. 1) where τm is the overall rotational correlation time of the molecule, τf'=τfτm/(τf+τm),τs'=τsτm/(τs+τm),τf(orτs) is the effective correlation time for internal motions on the fast (or slow) time scale (τf < τs< τm), and S2 (equal to Sf2Ss2) is the generalized order parameter measuring the degree of spatial restriction of the bond vector. Sf2 (or Ss2) is the order parameter for internal motions (which ranges from 0 for completely isotropic motion to 1 for completely restricted motion) on the fast (or slow) time scale. The six dynamic parameters in Equation 1 were extracted using five simple models proposed by Palmer and co-workers (45Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). These five models contain the following parameters: 1) S2 (assuming S2 (assuming Sf2=1,τf→0,Rex=0); 2) S2, τe = τf (assuming Sf2=1,τe<τm,Rex=0); 3) S2, Rex (assuming Sf2=1,τf→0); 4) S2, τe = τf, Rex (assuming Sf2=1,τe<τm); 5) S2, Sf, τe = τs (assuming τf → 0, τe < τm, Rex = 0), for model 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. 15N-1H vectors with relaxation data that can be fitted to model 1 usually have large S2 values and are more rigid. 15N-1H vectors with relaxation data that must be fitted to models 3 and 4 are those displaying conformational exchange processes on the μs/ms time scale. The most flexible 15N-1H sites, such as those in the termini and those in the unfolded state, are often be fitted to model 5. 15N-1H vectors with relaxation data fitted to model 2, 4, or 5 display internal motions on the ps time scale. Model-free parameters were obtained using the Model-free program, version 4.1. Model fitting and selection followed the procedures detailed in Mandel et al. (45Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), as described in our previous paper (41Huang Y.T. Liaw Y.C. Gorbatyuk V.Y. Huang T.-h. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2035176381,"Caspases play an essential role in the execution of apoptosis. These cysteine proteases are highly conserved among metazoans and are translated as inactive zymogens, which are activated by proteolytic cleavages to generate the large and small subunits and remove the N-terminal prodomain. The 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure of active Sf-caspase-1, the principal effector caspase of the insect Spodoptera frugiperda, is presented here. The structure represents the first nonhuman caspase to be resolved. The structure of the cleaved and active protease was determined with the tetrapeptide inhibitor N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chloromethylketone covalently bonded to the active site cysteine. As expected, the overall fold of Sf-caspase-1 is exceedingly similar to that of the five active caspases from humans solved to date. The overall structure and active site arrangement of Sf-caspase-1 is most comparable with that of the human effector caspases, with which it shares highest sequence homology. The most prominent structural difference with Sf-caspase-1 is the position of the N-terminal region of the large subunit. Unlike the N terminus of human caspases, the N terminus of Sf-caspase-1 originates from the active site side where it interacts with active site loop L2 and then extends to the backside of the heterodimer. This unusual structural arrangement raises the possibility that the N-terminal prodomain plays a regulatory role during effector caspase activation or enzyme activity in insects.

Apoptosis is a cellular pathway that eliminates damaged, potentially dangerous, superfluous, or unwanted cells in metazoan organisms. This programmed cell death pathway is a naturally occurring physiological process that is vital to normal organismal development and tissue homeostasis. Abnormalities in the regulation of apoptosis can trigger many diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune disorders, and ischemic injury. The apoptotic pathway is highly conserved in the Metazoa kingdom and can be triggered by both intracellular and extracellular stimuli. Apoptosis is executed through the activity of the caspases that are aspartyl-specific proteases (1Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J.

Because of their central role in apoptosis, these cysteine proteases are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.Synthesized as dormant single-chain zymogens, the caspases are activated by a hierarchical series of proteolytic cleavages. The apical initiator caspases typically contain a large N-terminal prodomain that interacts with cellular factors that initiate apoptosis. These initiator caspases oligomerize through their prodomains that also associate with other proteins and promote enzyme activation in the absence of proteolytic processing (7Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The activated initiator caspases subsequently cleave the proform of downstream effector caspases, which usually possess a short N-terminal prodomain. The active effector caspases proteolytically cleave cellular substrates that produce the morphological events associated with apoptosis, including cytoplasmic shrinkage, membrane blebbing, DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation (8Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6207) Google Scholar). Effector caspase activation requires a minimum of two cleavages of the zymogen proform; the first cleavage yields the large and small catalytic subunits (∼20 and 10 kDa, respectively), and the second cleavage removes the N-terminal prodomain from the large subunit. The order of these activation cleavages appears to be conserved among caspases (9Ramage P. Cheneval D. Chvei M. Graff P. Hemmig R. Heng R. Kocher H.P. Mackenzie A. Memmert K. Revesz L. Wishart W. J.

Thus, structures have been solved for human initiator and effector caspases. These structures reveal that the heterodimer of large and small subunits associates with another heterodimer to form a tetramer (or dimer-of-heterodimers). Both the large and small subunits contribute residues that form the active site pocket. Residues from the small subunit shape the binding pocket for the substrate residues P2-P4. Both subunits contribute to the selective recognition of aspartate at the P1 position. The carboxylate group of the substrate P1 aspartic acid salt-links with two conserved arginines, one from the large subunit and one from the small subunit, respectively. The P4 subsite in human caspase-1 is a large hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the preferred tryptophan side chain of the substrate. The corresponding pocket in caspase-3 is narrower and smaller, which thereby accommodates the smaller aspartate side chain. The conserved catalytic cysteine residue, which attacks the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond, is situated at the end of β-strand 4. The imidazole side chain of conserved active site histidine is adjacent to cysteine and likely plays a role in catalysis (14Wilson K.P. Black J.-A.F. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P.

Sf-caspase-1 is the principal effector caspase of Spodoptera frugiperda, a nocturnal moth infected by the large DNA baculoviruses.

Sf-caspase-1 displays 41 and 39% protein sequence identity to human effector caspases-7 and -3, respectively (26Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1421-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is most closely related to DrICE and DCP-1 (65 and 61% identical, respectively), which are short prodomain effector caspases of Drosophila melanogaster. Like its mammalian orthologs, Sf-caspase-1 is activated by two sequential caspase-mediated cleavages that take place in the cytosol (13LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). First, a P35-resistant apical caspase cleaves pro-Sf-caspase-1 at Asp195 to separate the large and small subunits (p25 and p12, respectively). Subsequent cleavage by a separate caspase (probably Sf-caspase-1 itself) at Asp28 removes the N-terminal prodomain from the p25 fragment to generate the mature large subunit p19. It is expected that the activated subunits are assembled as a dimer-of-heterodimers that is common to all effector caspases (3Grütter M.G. Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 2000; 10: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar).Because caspase activity and activation are decisive phases in executing apoptosis, a better understanding of the conserved features in caspase structure and function is necessary. Here we report the three-dimensional x-ray crystal structure of Sf-caspase-1. We compare the structural details of this invertebrate effector caspase with those of human effector and initiator caspases. The observed similarities and differences of these critical enzymes provide new insight into conserved features of the caspases that are expected to contribute to the design of therapeutic strategies for treatment of apoptosis-associated disorders.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The Sf-caspase-1 gene was cloned into the pET22b(+) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) for production of Sf-caspase-1 with a C-terminal hexahistidine extension in Escherichia coli. Purified recombinant His-tagged Sf-caspase-1 was fully functional and stoichiometrically inhibited by baculovirus P35 as described previously (13LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For purification, bacterial pellets were resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), lysed, and passed over a metal (Ni2+)-chelate column. N-Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chloromethylketone inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-cmk) 1The abbreviations used are: Ac, acetyl; cmk, chloromethylketone; DEVD, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp tetrapeptide; rms, root mean square. (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was added, then dialyzed against binding buffer, and purified over a second high pressure metal-chelate column. The purified Sf-caspase-1, with acetyl-DEVD-methylketone inhibitor bound to the active site, was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris, pH 9.0, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml before crystallization trials.Sf-caspase-1 with bound inhibitor was crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion using 2-μl drops of the protein mixed with an equal volume of reservoir buffer (1.6 mm ammonium sulfate, 2% polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5). The crystals grew at room temperature to the size of 0.7 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm by 4 weeks. The crystals were transferred to 1.8 mm ammonium sulfate, 2% polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 30% ethylene glycol and frozen to -175 °C for data collection. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.3 Å resolution at Beamline 9-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, were processed with DENZO, and were scaled with SCALEPACK (Table I) (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar).

The p17-p12 subunits of human caspase-3 (16Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struc. Biol. 1996; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), in which all residues were truncated to alanine, were used as a search model in the program AMoRe (38Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 588-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the CCP4 package (39Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). Because it was originally thought that two complete dimer-of-heterodimers were in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (corresponding to a VM of 2.1 Å3/Da), the human caspase-3 dimer-of-heterodimers was used to search for two complete copies in the Sf-caspase-1 crystal asymmetric unit. The rotation function of AMoRe found many peaks, which were subjected to the first round of a translation search to identify the position of the first dimer-of-heterodimers. The first translation search found a peak corresponding to a correlation coefficient and R factor of 25.9 and 51.6%, respectively, with the next highest peak giving values of 20.1 and 53.8% and many other peaks with values of 12.1 and 55.8%. (Searching the enantiomorphic space group, P3121, resulted in no peaks higher than 12 and 57% for the correlation coefficient and R factor, respectively.) The search model was held fixed at this position, and a second translation search was conducted using the same caspase-3 dimer-of-heterodimers model to locate the second protomer in the asymmetric unit. This search resulted in one peak that stood out among the others (correlation coefficient and R factor of 34.8 and 49.3%, respectively, with all other peaks at ∼20 and 53%, respectively). Upon packing inspection of models in the trigonal unit cell, it was identified that the second translation search result was positioned on a crystallographic 2-fold axis, which was coincident with the dimer-of-heterodimers 2-fold axis, generating essentially two molecules superimposed on each other. This signified that there were 1.5 dimer-of-heterodimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, with one p19-p12 heterodimer situated at the crystallographic 2-fold axis to generate the functional dimer-of-heterodimers. This corresponded to a more reasonable Matthews coefficient of 2.8 Å3/Da (56% solvent) assuming three p19-p12 heterodimers/asymmetric unit (40Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar).Each of the three p19-p12 heterodimers was subjected to rigid body refinement in the CNS program, which lowered the R factor to 45.1% for all data to 3 Å resolution. The molecular replacement phases were refined by 3-fold molecular averaging and solvent flattening using DM in the CCP4 package (39Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar, 41Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). One thousand rounds of averaging and phase extension starting at 8 Å resolution resulted in an overall final figure of merit of 0.86 at 3 Å resolution. The 3-fold averaged electron density map was readily interpretable, and a single p19-p12 heterodimer was built into the density with aid of the molecular graphics program O (42Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). After initial model building, the complete asymmetric unit was generated by rotating and translating the p19-p12 heterodimer built in the averaged map. The model was then subjected to subsequent rounds of simulated annealing with the program CNS (43Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar) applying the maximum likelihood as a refinement target. Initially, high restraints were placed on the noncrystallographic symmetry between the three p19-p12 heterodimers in the asymmetric unit. During stages of refinement the weight placed on the noncrystallographic symmetry restraint was re-evaluated to give the lowest Rfree value. As the model improved, the noncrystallographic weight that gave the lowest Rfree decreased until the noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were released completely, resulting in lower Rfree values. The final conventional R factor is 18.3%, and the Rfree value is 23.2% for 95 and 5% of all recorded data to 2.3 Å resolution, respectively (44Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3849) Google Scholar). The data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table I. 91.5 and 8.5% of the 759 residues in the asymmetric unit plot to the “most favored” and “additionally allowed” regions of the Ramachandran plot respectively as defined by the program PROCHECK (45Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). None of the 759 residues plot in the “generously allowed” or “disallowed” region of the Ramachandran plot.RESULTSOverall Structure—The asymmetric unit contains three large subunit (p19)-small subunit (p12) heterodimers. The p19-p12 heterodimer designated A-chain combines with the B-chain heterodimer to form one biologically functional dimer-of-heterodimers. The designated C-chain p19-p12 heterodimer is positioned next to a crystallographic 2-fold axis, which places a symmetry related C-chain p19-p12 heterodimer from the neighboring unit cell adjacent to it, thus generating the functional dimer-of-heterodimers. The final model consists of residues 40-191 (p19) and 201-295 (p12) for the A chain; residues 41-191 and 200-296 for the B-chain; and residues 40-191 and 201-300 for the C-chain. Sf-caspase-1 expression and purification in E. coli can produce a mixture of large subunits, in which some of the p19 subunits are cleaved after Asp184, generating a composite of p19/p18 large subunits with the p12 small subunit (13LaCount D.J. Hanson S.F. Schneider C.L. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15657-15664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1421-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, our preparations were homogenous with respect to the large subunit as indicated by SDS-PAGE (not shown). In addition, clear electron density was observed in the crystal structure for residues Asp184 to Arg191 in all three p19 subunits in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The Ac-DEVD-cmk inhibitor is clearly defined in all three active sites of the asymmetric unit. However, the chlorine atom is displaced by the active site Cys178, in which Sγ is covalently bonded to the methyl group. The average temperature factor (B) for all atoms is 31.3, 29.8, and 26.1 Å2 for the A-, B-, and C-chains respectively. The C-chain likely has an overall lower average B value because it makes more lattice contacts than either the A- or B-chain. Because the C-chain heterodimer residues were the most ordered, and the overall average temperature value is lower than the A- or B-chain, most of the following discussion will concentrate on the C-chain heterodimer.In Sf-caspase-1, two p19-p12 heterodimers assemble to form the biologically active dimer-of-heterodimers producing a central 12-stranded β-sheet. A total of ∼4,900 Å2 of surface area is buried between the two p19-p12 heterodimers. The two active sites in the dimer-of-heterodimers are separated by ∼35 Å. The overall topology of Sf-caspase-1 (Fig. 1) is very similar to that of the human caspases. The overall shape of the dimer-of-heterodimers is roughly a compact cylinder (∼60 Å long × 40 Å wide) consisting of a twisted 12-stranded β-sheet running down the axis of the cylinder surrounded by 10 α-helices. Each p19-p12 heterodimer folds into a single-domain α/β motif with a central six-stranded β-sheet (β2, β1, β3, β4, β7, and β8 from outside to inside) sandwiched by five α-helices, two on one side of the β-sheet (αC and αD) and three on the other (αB, αE, and αF) (Fig. 1). The secondary structure designations follow that of the human caspase-1 structure (14Wilson K.P. Black J.-A.F. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), and the active site loop designations (L1-L4) correspond to that previously reported (46Chai J. Wu Q. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Cell. 2001; 107: 399-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The first α-helix in human caspase-1, αA, is missing because the structural element is not conserved in Sf-caspase-1, as well as the human effector caspases. The p19 large subunit of Sf-caspase-1 contributes the outer four parallel β-strands and three helices, whereas the p12 small subunit adds two α-helices and two antiparallel β-strands adjacent to the 2-fold axis, which forms the central four antiparallel β-strands in the dimer-of-heterodimers (Fig. 1). Following strand β3, three short β-strands (β3a, β3b, and β3c) form a β-meander motif before the short helix αD (Fig. 1). The β7-αE loop (L3, Fig. 1) contains a short β-strand (β7a) that hydrogen bonds to the main chain of the tetrapeptide inhibitor. The αF-β8 loop (L4) adopts a hairpin loop conformation containing two antiparallel β-strands (β7b and β7c), which forms part of the active site pocket. The first ordered N-terminal residues of the p19 subunit (residues 40-44) forms a β-strand (βa), which together with β6 clamps β5 from the 2-fold related p19-p12 heterodimer (Fig. 1). The location of these N-terminal residues of the p19 in Sf-caspase-1 differs significantly from the human caspases (see below). The active site Cys178 is located at the end of β4, and the active site His136 is situated at the start of β3a. The active site pocket, which binds the tetrapeptide substrate recognition sequence, is formed by loops L1-L4 from both the p19 and p12 subunits.Structural Comparison with Human Caspases—The overall structure and topology of Sf-caspase-1 is very similar to that of the human caspases. A stereo superposition (Fig. 2) demonstrates the similarities of the Sf-caspase-1 p19-p12 heterodimer (in red) with the heterodimers of activated human caspases-1, -3, -7, -8, and -9. Over an average of 220 equivalent α-carbons, the root mean square (rms) deviation from Sf-caspase-1 is 1.22, 0.61, 0.59, 0.87, and 1.05 Å, respectively, for each of these human caspases. The rms deviation parallels the sequence identity with the higher identity correlating with lower rms deviation.Fig. 2Structural comparison of insect Sf-casp"
