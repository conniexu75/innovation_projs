https://openalex.org/W2126961173,"‘Bottom-up fabrication’, which exploits the intrinsic properties of atoms and molecules to direct their self-organization, is widely used to make relatively simple nanostructures. A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by ‘top-down’ methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide ‘staple strands’ to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex). DNA is a popular building block for nanostructures as it combines self-assembly with programmability and a plethora of chemical techniques for its manipulation. There is an extensive literature on DNA nanomaterials, but a procedure described this week breaks many of the fabrication rules established in the field. Paradoxically, although it ignores sequence design, strand purity and strand concentration ratios, the new method yields DNA nanostructures that are larger and more complex than previously possible. The one-pot method uses a few hundred short DNA strands to ‘staple’ a very long strand into two-dimensional structures that adopt any desired shape, like the ‘nanoface’ on the cover. Individual staples can be made into nanometre-scale pixels that create surface patterns on a given 100-nm shape (like the Americas map and snowflakes), or to combine shapes into larger structures (the hexagon of triangles). A robust, versatile, one-pot bottom-up nanotechnology fabrication method uses a few-hundred short DNA strands to 'staple' a very long strand into two-dimensional structures of 100 nm in diameter and resembling any desired shape, such as squares, 'nanofaces' and stars."

Here we describe an advance in the catalysis of the overall splitting of water under visible light: the new catalyst is a solid solution of gallium and zinc nitrogen oxide, (Ga(1-x)Zn(x))(N(1-x)O(x)), modified with nanoparticles of a mixed oxide of rhodium and chromium. The mixture functions as a promising and efficient photocatalyst in promoting the evolution of hydrogen gas."

https://openalex.org/W2104339949,"Systems of three interacting particles are notorious for their complex physical behavior. A landmark theoretical result in few-body quantum physics is Efimov's prediction of a universal set of bound trimer states appearing for three identical bosons with a resonant two-body interaction. Counterintuitively, these states even exist in the absence of a corresponding two-body bound state. Since the formulation of Efimov's problem in the context of nuclear physics 35 years ago, it has attracted great interest in many areas of physics. However, the observation of Efimov quantum states has remained an elusive goal. Here we report the observation of an Efimov resonance in an ultracold gas of cesium atoms. The resonance occurs in the range of large negative two-body scattering lengths, arising from the coupling of three free atoms to an Efimov trimer. Experimentally, we observe its signature as a giant three-body recombination loss when the strength of the two-body interaction is varied. We also detect a minimum in the recombination loss for positive scattering lengths, indicating destructive interference of decay pathways. Our results confirm central theoretical predictions of Efimov physics and represent a starting point with which to explore the universal properties of resonantly interacting few-body systems. While Feshbach resonances have provided the key to control quantum-mechanical interactions on the two-body level, Efimov resonances connect ultracold matter to the world of few-body quantum phenomena."

Glycan microarray analysis of this Viet04 HA reveals an avian alpha2-3 sialic acid receptor binding preference. Introduction of mutations that can convert H1 serotype HAs to human alpha2-6 receptor specificity only enhanced or reduced affinity for avian-type receptors. However, mutations that can convert avian H2 and H3 HAs to human receptor specificity, when inserted onto the Viet04 H5 HA framework, permitted binding to a natural human alpha2-6 glycan, which suggests a path for this H5N1 virus to gain a foothold in the human population."
https://openalex.org/W2090106870,"How the widely used botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) recognizes and enters neurons is poorly understood. We found that BoNT/A enters neurons by binding to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 (isoforms A, B, and C). Fragments of SV2 that harbor the toxin interaction domain inhibited BoNT/A from binding to neurons. BoNT/A binding to SV2A and SV2B knockout hippocampal neurons was abolished and was restored by expressing SV2A, SV2B, or SV2C. Reduction of SV2 expression in PC12 and Neuro-2a cells also inhibited entry of BoNT/A, which could be restored by expressing SV2 isoforms. Finally, mice that lacked an SV2 isoform (SV2B) displayed reduced sensitivity to BoNT/A. Thus, SV2 acts as the protein receptor for BoNT/A."

https://openalex.org/W2130361798,"Deposition of semiconductors and metals from chemical precursors onto planar substrates is a well-developed science and technology for microelectronics. Optical fibers are an established platform for both communications technology and fundamental research in photonics. Here, we describe a hybrid technology that integrates key aspects of both engineering disciplines, demonstrating the fabrication of tubes, solid nanowires, coaxial heterojunctions, and longitudinally patterned structures composed of metals, single-crystal semiconductors, and polycrystalline elemental or compound semiconductors within microstructured silica optical fibers. Because the optical fibers are constructed and the functional materials are chemically deposited in distinct and independent steps, the full design flexibilities of both platforms can now be exploited simultaneously for fiber-integrated optoelectronic materials and devices."
https://openalex.org/W2143157299,"A whole-genome duplication occurred in a shared ancestor of the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces castellii and Candida glabrata. Here we trace the subsequent losses of duplicated genes, and show that the pattern of loss differs among the three species at 20% of all loci. For example, several transcription factor genes, including STE12, TEC1, TUP1 and MCM1, are single-copy in S. cerevisiae but are retained in duplicate in S. castellii and C. glabrata. At many loci, different species have lost different members of a duplicated gene pair, so that 4-7% of single-copy genes compared between any two species are not orthologues. This pattern of gene loss provides strong evidence for speciation through a version of the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller mechanism, in which the loss of alternative copies of duplicated genes leads to reproductive isolation. We show that the lineages leading to the three species diverged shortly after the whole-genome duplication, during a period of precipitous gene loss. The set of loci at which single-copy paralogues are retained is biased towards genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and genes that evolve slowly, consistent with the hypothesis that reciprocal gene loss is more likely to occur between duplicated genes that are functionally indistinguishable. We propose a simple, unified model in which a single mechanism--passive gene loss-enabled whole--genome duplication and led to the rapid emergence of new yeast species."

We used a methodology based on information theory, isolating the trend from the shorter-term natural modes of variability. The results show that the trend of increasing numbers of category 4 and 5 hurricanes for the period 1970-2004 is directly linked to the trend in sea-surface temperature; other aspects of the tropical environment, although they influence shorter-term variations in hurricane intensity, do not contribute substantially to the observed global trend."

https://openalex.org/W1973422437,"Wnt signaling plays critical biological roles during normal embryonic development and homeostasis in adults. In the canonical pathway, binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled (Fzd) receptor and the low density lipoprotein-related receptor (LRP) 5 or LRP6 coreceptor initiates downstream signaling events leading to gene activation by β-catenin and the T-cell factor (TCF)-lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) family transcription factor complex. In this study, we provide several lines of evidence that the mouse Cristin/R-spondin family proteins function as Fzd8 and LRP6 receptor ligands and induce the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, leading to TCF-dependent gene activation. First, conditioned medium containing Cristin/R-spondin proteins effectively induced reporter activity in a TCF-binding site-dependent manner. Second, stimulation of cells with Cristin/R-spondin was accompanied by stabilization of endogenous β-catenin proteins and induction of canonical Wnt target genes. Third, Cristin/R-spondin proteins physically interacted with the extracellular domains of the LRP6 and Fzd8 receptors in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, unlike canonical Wnt ligands, Cristin/R-spondin failed to form a ternary complex with both LRP6 and Fzd8 receptors, suggesting that R-spondin may activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by different mechanisms. Furthermore, Cristin/R-spondin proteins possess an intriguing positive modulatory activity on Wnt ligands, possibly through a direct interaction. Our findings expand the repertoire of ligands that induce β-catenin/TCF-dependent gene activation and implicate the presence of active β-catenin-dependent gene activation in a Wnt-free biological context.

Wnt signaling is one of the key signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis during embryogenesis and in adults (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Wnt ligands are secreted glycoproteins and induce multiple intracellular signaling pathways (3Malbon C.C. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1048-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Wang H.Y.

Accumulated β-catenin proteins in the cytoplasm are eventually translocated into the nucleus, where they are engaged in gene activation as a complex with T-cell factor (TCF) family transcription factors. Additionally, Wnt ligands also induce β-catenin-independent intracellular signaling pathways, including the Wnt/Ca2+, Wnt/cGMP, and planar cell polarity pathways, in which only the Fzd receptors, not the LRP5 or LRP6 coreceptor, are required (4Wang H.Y.

Norrin, a secreted protein unrelated to the Wnt proteins, is encoded by the Norrie disease gene, which is responsible for human hereditary Norrie disease, which is associated with blindness, deafness, and mental retardation (12Berger W. Meindl A. van de Pol T.J. Cremers F.P. Ropers H.H. Doerner C. Monaco A. Bergen A.A. Lebo R. Warburg M. Zergollern L. Lorenz B. Gal A. Bleeker-Wagemakers E.M. Meltinger T. Nat.

Recently, Norrin was discovered as a high affinity ligand specific for the Fzd4·LRP6 receptor complex, which induces β-catenin-dependent signaling (8Xu Q. Wang Y. Dabdoub A. Smallwood P.M.

The RYK, Derailed, and LIN-18 proteins, receptor tyrosine kinases with unknown function, were determined to be novel Wnt receptors in mouse, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively (9Inoue T.

These discoveries expanded the repertoire of ligands and receptors involved in Wnt/Fzd/LRP signaling and suggest the possibility of unknown ligands unrelated to the Wnt proteins and receptors unrelated to Fzd and LRP5 or LRP6.We provide evidence strongly suggesting that a multigene family of novel secreted proteins, mouse Cristin/R-spondin proteins, may work at the receptor level to activate downstream β-catenin-dependent gene activation and may function as a class of ligands unrelated to Wnt proteins. Moreover, Cristin/R-spondin proteins exhibited intriguing synergistic activity on Wnt ligands, possibly through direct physical interaction. Xenopus R-spondin2 and human R-spondin1 protein activity on canonical Wnt signaling was demonstrated recently (14Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev.

These results suggest that the function of Cristin/R-spondin family proteins is conserved in vertebrates.MATERIALS AND METHODSMolecular Biology—Mouse expressed sequence tag cDNA clones encoding full-length Cristin/R-spondin proteins were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium. The coding regions of all Cristin/R-spondin genes and the deletion mutants of Cristin1/R-spondin3 were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pcDNA3 plasmid carrying a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag (pcDNA3-HA) or Myc/His epitope tags (pcDNA3.1-Myc/His). The coding sequence of mouse Wnt1 was PCR-amplified and cloned into pcDNA3-HA and the CS2-MT vectors to create HA- and Myc-tagged constructs, respectively. DNA sequence encoding a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of mouse Fzd8 was excised from the Fzd8CRD-IgG plasmid (16Hsieh J.-C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and cloned into pcDNA3-HA to create a C-terminally HA-tagged Fzd8CRD construct (Fzd8CRD-HA).Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and mouse L-cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. P19 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 7.5% calf serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. 293T cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For luciferase assay, 3 × 104 cells were seeded in each well of 24-well plates. The TOPflash or FOPflash reporter (20 ng) and a Renilla luciferase-thymidine kinase construct (10 ng) were used along with various amounts of expression plasmids as indicated in the figure legends. Both luciferase activities were measured using a Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Preparation of Conditioned Medium (CM) and Isolation of Cristin/R-spondin Proteins—Wnt3a CM was prepared from the mouse Wnt3a L-cell line (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) as described previously (17Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates J.R. II I Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). CM containing Cristin/R-spondin proteins was obtained from 293T cells transiently transfected with Cristin/R-spondin expression plasmids. For biochemical assay, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) was used to obtain the CM. Soluble heparin (50 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was used to prepare the CM for the luciferase and β-catenin stabilization assays. For purification of histidine-tagged Cristin/R-spondin proteins, total lysates of 293T cells transiently transfected with histidine-tagged Cristin/R-spondin expression constructs were prepared with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture V (Calbiochem). The cell lysates were incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen Inc.) for 2 h at 4°C and washed with 10 mm imidazole buffer three times. The Cristin/R-spondin proteins were eluted with buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The HA-tagged mouse Fzd8 CRD and human IgG fusions of the mouse Fzd8 CRD and the human LRP6 extracellular domain (LRP6N) were prepared as serum-free CM formats from transiently transfected 293T cells as described previously (18Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar).Heparin Binding and Cristin/R-spondin Binding Assay—Total cell lysates of 293T cells transfected with Cristin-HA constructs were prepared using lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and incubated overnight at 4 °C with heparin-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed with lysis buffer three times at room temperature, and the Cristin/R-spondin proteins were eluted with buffers with different NaCl concentrations. The presence of Cristin/R-spondin proteins was examined by Western blot analysis.CM containing IgG, Fzd8CRD-IgG, and LRP6N-IgG were first incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads to conjugate IgG fusion proteins to the beads. Histidine-tagged Cristin/R-spondin proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the beads. After three washings with 0.3 m NaCl/phosphate buffer, the associated Cristin/R-spondin proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-His, anti-HA, or anti-Myc primary antibody. The filters were reprobed with anti-human IgG antibody.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells and Xenopus animal cap explants using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and digested with RNase-free DNase I to remove genomic DNA contamination. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized with Super-Script II (Invitrogen), and one-tenth of the cDNA was used for each PCR. The sequences of the PCR primers were as follows: mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), 5′-GTGGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTGCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATGATGACCCGTTTGGCTCC-3′ (antisense); mouse Cristin1/R-spondin3, 5′-GTACACTGTGAGGCCAGTGAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATGGCTAGAACACCTGTCCTG-3′ (antisense); mouse BrachyuryT, 5′-TGCTGCCTGTGAGTCATAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACAAGAGGCTGTAGAACATG-3′ (antisense); mouse Cdx1, 5′-GAACCAAGGACAAGTACCGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTAGAAACTCCTCCTTGACG-3 (antisense); Xenopus Siamois, 5′-AAGGAACCCCACCAGGATAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TACTGGTGGCTGGAGAAATA-3′ (antisense); Xenopus Xnr3, 5′-TCCACTTGTGCAGTTCCACAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATCTCTTCATGGTGCCTCAGG-3′ (antisense); and Xenopus Xmax2, 5′-GTGGAAAGCGACGAAGACTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGAGCTCGAGTAGTTGGAC-3′ (antisense).Western Blot Analysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunofluorescence Staining—For Western blotting, anti-HA (clone 12CA5), anti-Myc (clone 9E10), anti-His (Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.), and anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) antibodies were used at 1:2000, 1:5000, 1:3000, and 1:4000 dilutions, respectively. Anti-β-catenin (Pharmingen) and anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies were used at 1:500 and 1:5000 dilutions, respectively. The presence of target proteins was detected by the chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose and anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody conjugated to agarose (Sigma) or Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) beads were used to purify the protein complex. Subcellular localization of Cristin/R-spondin proteins in 293T cells was determined by immunofluorescence staining using mouse anti-HA primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:500 dilution; Molecular Probe). Images were acquired by confocal microscopy.Mouse Embryo Collection and Whole-mount in Situ Hybridization— Wild-type embryos at different stages were collected from the timed matings of ICR mice. The pMesogenin1 gene mutant embryos were collected from the mating between the heterozygous animals, and the genotypes of collected embryos were determined by genomic DNA PCR analysis with yolk sac DNA as described (19Yoon J.K. Wold B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The collected embryos were immediately fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline solution overnight at 4 °C and kept in 100% methanol at -20 °C until used. Digoxigenin-labeled antisense Cristin1/R-spondin3 RNA probes were synthesized in vitro from a linearized DNA template utilizing appropriate RNA polymerases in the presence of digoxigenin-labeled CTP. Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (19Yoon J.K. Wold B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Stained embryos were photographed with a Zeiss AxioCam digital camera.Xenopus Embryos and Animal Cap Explants—Xenopus embryos were prepared by in vitro fertilization of oocytes collected from hormonally induced females by a standard protocol. Capped RNA was synthesized using an Ambion Message Machine kit according to the recommended protocol. Various amounts of RNA were injected into the animal pole of two-cell stage embryos. Animal caps were explanted at the blastula stage and cultured in 1× modified Bart's saline until the companion embryos reached the gastrulation stage.RESULTSMultigene Family of Novel Secreted Mouse Cristin/R-spondin Proteins—We previously demonstrated that mouse mutants lacking the pMesogenin1 gene, which encodes a presomitic mesoderm-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (20Yoon J.K. Moon R.T. Wold B. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 376-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), display severe defects in posterior paraxial mesoderm development (19Yoon J.K. Wold B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3204-3214Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms by which pMesogenin1 regulates paraxial mesoderm development, potential target genes for pMesogenin1 were screened by analyzing gene expression profiles in the presomitic mesoderm of pMesogenin1-null and wild-type embryos. One gene whose RNA expression was increased by ∼4-fold in the pMesogenin1-null mutant samples encoded a novel secreted protein (Fig. 1A). Based on the protein structure derived from the predicted peptide sequences, we named this gene Cristin1 (for cysteine-rich and single thrombospondin domain-containing protein-1) (Fig. 1C). Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis showed prominent RNA expression of Cristin1 in the tail buds of wild-type mouse embryos (Fig. 1B). Cristin1 expression within the tail buds of homozygous pMesogenin1-null mutants was significantly expanded, increased, and tightly associated with the tail bud defects, consistent with RT-PCR data. Thus, aberrant Cristin1 expression may be related to the pMesogenin1-null phenotype. Cristin1 expression was also detected in the primitive streak, dorsal neural tube, forebrain, and migrating neural crests of mouse embryos (Fig. 1B). In searching sequence data bases, we identified three genes homologous to Cristin1 in the mouse genome (designated as Cristin2, Cristin3, and Cristin4) (Fig. 1C). We also identified four homologous genes in the human genome as well as expressed sequence tag clones with high sequence homology among other vertebrates, including chicken, Xenopus, and zebrafish. Phylogenetic analysis of predicted protein sequences, syntenic relationships of gene loci in human and mouse chromosomes, and comparisons of genomic structures determined the orthologous relationships among the human and mouse genes (Fig. 1, D and E). Interestingly, searches of the Drosophila and C. elegans genome data bases failed to identify Cristin homologs. Thus, Cristin genes may be unique to vertebrates, although functional homologs may exist in invertebrate species. Recently, the isolation of mouse R-spondin, which is identical to mouse Cristin3, and two Xenopus homologs of the mouse R-spondin genes was reported (14Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 525-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 21Kamata T. Katsube K. Michikawa M. Yamada M. Takada S. Mizusawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1676: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, for consistency in nomenclature, we renamed the Cristin genes to R-spondin as indicated in Fig. 1D.Comparisons of the predicted mouse R-spondin amino acid sequences revealed significant homologies (Fig. 1C). First, all R-spondin proteins contain an N-terminal 20-25-amino acid hydrophobic region, which likely serves as a signal sequence for secretion. Three additional conserved protein domains are evident: (i) a CRD with homology to the CRDs of furin and the insulin-like growth factor receptor, (ii) a thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR) (22Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and (iii) a C-terminal basic amino acid-rich domain (Fig. 1C).The presence of a putative signal sequence and the lack of a notable transmembrane domain suggest that R-spondins may be secreted proteins. To test this possibility, we transfected expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged R-spondins into human embryonic kidney 293T cells and examined the subcellular localization of R-spondins by immunofluorescence staining. R-spondin proteins were detected mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2A), indicating that R-spondin proteins are in the secretory pathway. In similarly transfected cells, the expression of R-spondin proteins and their secretion into the CM were monitored by Western blot analysis. The majority of the R-spondin proteins were associated with total cell lysates and were barely detected, if at all, in the CM (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the addition of soluble heparin to the medium in culture significantly enhanced the presence of R-spondins in the CM and confirmed their nature as secreted proteins (Fig. 2B). The addition of sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of sulfation, increased the level of R-spondin proteins in the CM. 3J.-S. Nam, T. J. Turcotte, and J. K. Yoon, unpublished data. These results suggest that secreted R-spondins may be associated, in part, with the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) of the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix.FIGURE 2Cristin/R-spondins are secreted proteins. A, mouse Cristin/R-spondins (Rspo) are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus in 293T cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with Cristin/R-spondin-HA expression plasmids and pDsRed2-ER (Clontech). The majority of Cristin/R-spondin proteins co-localized with the DsRed proteins residing in the endoplasmic reticulum. The white arrow indicates Cristin/R-spondin expression in the Golgi apparatus. B, mouse Cristin/R-spondins are secreted proteins. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged Cristin/R-spondin proteins. Total cell lysates (TCL) and serum-free CM were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)R-spondin Binds to Heparin with High Affinity—We next examined whether R-spondin can bind to heparin. We prepared lysates from 293T cells transfected with R-spondin-HA expression plasmids. The cell lysates were incubated with heparin-Sepharose beads, and the bound proteins were eluted with a series of buffers with different salt concentrations. All R-spondins tested efficiently bound to the heparin-Sepharose beads and were eluted from the heparin beads between 0.8 and 1.2 m NaCl (Fig. 3A). Thus, all R-spondins bind to heparin with high affinity comparable with fibroblast growth factors (23Fernig D.G. Gallagher J.T. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 353-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Cristin/R-spondins are heparin-binding proteins. A, total cell lysates (TCL) containing Cristin/R-spondin (Rspo) proteins were incubated with heparin-agarose beads, and the bound proteins were eluted with buffers containing different concentrations of NaCl. The presence of Cristin/R-spondin proteins was analyzed using 0.1 volume of each eluted fraction by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody. B, shown is a schematic diagram of Cristin1/R-spondin3-HA deletion constructs. BR, basic amino acid-rich domain; CR, CRD; SS, single sequence; TB, TSR plus BR. C, total cell lysates containing various Cristin1/R-spondin3 deletion constructs were incubated with heparin-agarose beads, and the bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 m NaCl buffer. 0.1 volume of eluted protein was analyzed by Western blotting as described for A. To monitor protein expression levels, the Cristin1/R-spondin3 protein expression level was measured in total cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine which domains within R-spondin3 are required for heparin binding, we generated a set of R-spondin3 constructs containing various deletions of the identified domains (Fig. 3B). Total lysates of 293T cells transfected with these constructs were prepared, and the heparin binding of each protein construct was determined. It appears that both the basic amino acid-rich and TSR domains contain the majority of heparin binding capability, as deletion of both domains significantly decreased R-spondin3 binding to heparin (Fig. 3C). In contrast, R-spondin3 with a CRD deletion showed efficient binding to heparin comparable with wild-type R-spondin3, indicating that the CRD may not be necessary for heparin binding. We concluded that R-spondin3 is a heparin-binding protein and that both the TSR and basic amino acid-rich domains are necessary for binding to heparin.R-spondin Activates Canonical Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling—Two observations led us to evaluate the possible involvement of R-spondin in Wnt signaling. First, embryonic expression of R-spondin genes highly overlaps with known wnt gene expression domains (24Takada S. Stark K.L. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 174-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Second, CCN (CYR61/connective tissue growth factor/NOV) family proteins, which contain domains structurally similar to those of R-spondins such as the cysteine-rich and TSR domains (25Brigstock D.R. J. Endocrinol. 2003; 178: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), were recently demonstrated to either antagonize or agonize Wnt signaling in a context-dependent manner (26Mercurio S. Latinkic B. Itasaki N. Krumlauf R. Smith J.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2137-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 27Latinkic B.V. Mercurio S. Bennett B. Hirst E.M. Xu Q. Lau L.F. Mohun T.J. Smith J.C. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 2429-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The steady-state level of β-catenin protein and the activity of reporter constructs such as the TOPflash reporter carrying TCF1-binding sites in their upstream regulatory regions were extensively used to analyze canonical Wnt signaling. In 293T cells, overexpression of R-spondin3 strongly induced TOPflash reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Activation was dependent on the TCF1-binding site because a reporter carrying nonfunctional TCF1-binding sites (FOPflash) was not activated by R-spondin3. In addition, other mouse R-spondin family members and Xenopus R-spondin2 showed similar activities (14Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 525-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).3 Interestingly, CM collected from the culture of 293T cells transfected with R-spondins effectively induced TOPflash reporter activity, suggesting that R-spondin may act in the extracellular environment (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Cristin/R-spondin proteins activate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A, mouse Cristin1/R-spondin3 (Rspo3) induced β-catenin-dependent gene activation in a dose-dependent manner. 20 ng of TOPflash or FOPflash reporter plasmid was cotransfected with the indicated amounts of Cristin1/R-spondin3 expression plasmid into 293T cells grown in 24-well plates. 10 ng of Renilla luciferase driven by the thymidine kinase gene promoter was included as a transfection control. B, Cristin/R-spondin functioned at the ligand/receptor level. 293T cells were transfected with mouse Fzd8 (25 ng) and human LRP6 (10 ng) expression plasmids and stimulated with CM containing Cristin1/R-spondin3 for 24 h. The TOPflash reporter activities were measured. CMV, cytomegalovirus. C, Dkk1 and Kremen1 reversed the activation of the TOPflash reporter that was induced by both Cristin1/R-spondin3 and LRP6. 293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with various combinations of Cristin1/R-spondin3 (25 ng), LRP6 (10 ng), Dkk1 (10 ng), and Kremen1 (10 ng) expression plasmids with the T"

https://openalex.org/W1996899853,"Mitotic spindle morphogenesis is a series of highly coordinated movements that lead to chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. We report that the intermediate filament protein lamin B, a component of the interphase nuclear lamina, functions in spindle assembly. Lamin B assembled into a matrix-like network in mitosis through a process that depended on the presence of the guanosine triphosphate–bound form of the small guanosine triphosphatase Ran. Depletion of lamin B resulted in defects in spindle assembly. Dominant negative mutant lamin B proteins that disrupt lamin B assembly in interphase nuclei also disrupted spindle assembly in mitosis. Furthermore, lamin B was essential for the formation of the mitotic matrix that tethers a number of spindle assembly factors. We propose that lamin B is a structural component of the long-sought-after spindle matrix that promotes microtubule assembly and organization in mitosis."

This detection of novelty is necessary for many types of learning. Neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are critically involved in the acquisition of long-term declarative memories. During a learning task, we recorded from individual MTL neurons in vivo using microwire electrodes implanted in human epilepsy surgery patients. We report here the discovery of two classes of neurons in the hippocampus and amygdala that exhibit single-trial learning: novelty and familiarity detectors, which show a selective increase in firing for new and old stimuli, respectively. The neurons retain memory for the stimulus for 24 hr. Thus, neurons in the MTL contain information sufficient for reliable novelty-familiarity discrimination and also show rapid plasticity as a result of single-trial learning."

Earlier studies suggest that RIP undergoes a ligand-dependent ubiquitination. However, it remains to be determined whether the ubiquitination of RIP is required for TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. In this study, we have identified Lys377 of RIP as the functional ubiquitination site, because mutating this residue to arginine completely abolished RIP-mediated NF-κB activation.

NF-κB is a homo- or heterodimeric transcription factor that controls the expression of various genes involved in inflammatory, apoptotic, and immune responses. In resting cells, the activity of NF-κB is controlled through its cytoplasmic sequestration by a family of inhibitors, IκB (Inhibitor of NF-κB) (1Baldwin A.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In response to extracellular stimuli, IκB proteins are phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) 2The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor; TAK1, tumor growth factor β-activated kinase 1; MEKK3, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin conjugation enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; WT, wild type; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; CTxB, cholera toxin B. complex, then ubiquitinated, and rapidly degraded, which leads to the nuclear localization and activation of NF-κB (2Karin M.

One of the most potent NF-κB activators is the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α. TNFα functions through the TNF receptors, mainly TNFR1, on the cell surface. The binding of TNFα to TNFR1 causes trimerization of the receptor and recruitment of the adaptor protein TRADD (TNF receptor-associated death domain) (3Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Therefore, RIP likely functions as an adaptor molecule to mediate the TNFα signaling cascade.

Our recent studies show that RIP fusion proteins, which contain the death domain of RIP and MEKK3 or TAK1, can effectively rescue TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in RIP-deficient cells (10Blonska M.

Geleziunas R. Lin X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10757-10765Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that one of the roles of RIP is to recruit these downstream kinases to the TNFR1 complex. Ubiquitination has been shown to play various roles in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways (17Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) as well as many other biological processes. Ubiquitin is a 76-amino-acid protein that is highly conserved among different species and is covalently attached to lysine residues of target proteins (18Haglund K. Dikic I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3353-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). This process is catalyzed in three steps. First, ubiquitin is activated in an ATP-dependent reaction by an ubiquitin activation enzyme (E1). Then, the activated ubiquitin is transferred to an ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme (E2). Subsequently, the ubiquitin is attached to the target protein through an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal of ubiquitin and the [cepsilon]-amino group of the lysine residue in the target protein in the presence of ubiquitin ligase (E3) (17Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin itself contains several lysine residues, in which Lys48 or Lys63 could be linked to another ubiquitin to form polyubiquitin chain on target proteins. In vivo, Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains lead to the recognition and degradation of proteins by the proteasome complex. In contrast, Lys63-linked polyubiquitination does not undergo the proteasome degradation but has been implicated in other biological processes (17Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Both forms of polyubiquitination play important roles in TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. IκB is ubiquitinated through Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner, whereas Lys63-linked polyubiquitination has been suggested to be involved in the modification of NEMO (11Kanayama A.

It has been shown that RIP is also ubiquitinated following TNFα stimulation (8Lee T.H. Shank J. Cusson N. Kelliher M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33185-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination of RIP may occur in both Lys63 and Lys48 linkages (21Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that RIP is ubiquitinated by TRAF2 through the Lys63 linkage immediately following TNFα stimulation (21Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). This ubiquitination may provide a docking site on RIP for its association with TAB2, a TAK1-associated protein (11Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In contrast, RIP may also be ubiquitinated by A20 through a Lys48 linkage (21Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M.

Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar), which is suggested to play an important role for the down-regulation of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation and degradation of RIP (22Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, the remaining key question is whether the ubiquitination of RIP is required for TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. In this study, we have generated a series of RIP mutants and reconstituted RIP-deficient cells with these mutants. Our results indicate that Lys377 of RIP is the functional ubiquitination site and is required for the recruitment of downstream signaling components to the TNFR1 complex, leading to NF-κB activation. Together, our results provide both biochemical and genetic evidence that the ubiquitination of RIP is required for TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. Reagents and Plasmids—Antibodies specific for Myc (A14 and A7404), TAK1 (C-9), TRAF2 (C-20), IKKα/β (H-470), ubiquitin (P4D1), NEMO (FL-419), Bcl10 (H-197), and β-tubulin (D-10) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-IκBα monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Recombinant human TNFα was obtained from Endogen (Woburn, MA). The plasmids encoding Myc-RIP and deletion mutants of RIP were constructed by inserting the BglII/HindIII fragments into corresponding sites of pRK6-Myc vector. Plasmids encoding Flag-RIP and Flag-RIP-K377R were constructed by inserting the HindIII/XbaI fragment into pcDNA3(-) vector. Point mutations of RIP were constructed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Lentivirus expression vectors were constructed by inserting RIP into the ClaI and SmaI sites in a lentiviral vector, pRV3, which contains a multiple cloning site of ClaI-SalI-BamHI-SmaI-EcoRI and a bicistronic internal ribosome entry site green fluorescent protein cassette downstream of the multiple cloning site. Cell Cultures and Transfection—RIP-deficient Jurkat T cells (RIP-) were kindly provided by B. Seed (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) (6Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Jurkat T and RIP- cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics described above. Cells were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and passed every 3 days. Stable transfectants of RIP- cells were established by electroporation using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) at 250 V, 950 mF. Plasmids (10 μg) encoding RIP-WT or RIP-K377R were transfected into 1 × 107 RIP- cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days and then treated with G418 (1 mg/ml) for 2 weeks. The clones resistant to G418 were collected and examined for the presence of RIP proteins using anti-FLAG antibodies. HEK293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (1-4 μg of DNA/7 × 105 cells). Generation of Stable Cell Lines Using Lentiviral Infection—HEK293T cells (3 × 106) were seeded in 100-mm dishes 1 day before transfection. The cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were transfected with 10 μg of pRV3 vector encoding different mutant forms of RIP together with 5 μg of pHep (packaging vector) and 5 μg of pEnv (Envelope vector) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Ten to sixteen hours later, 3-5 ml of warm RPMI 1640 medium was used to replace the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Viral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection by spinning to remove cells. RIP- cells were resuspended in viral supernatant for infection at the concentration between 0.8 and 1.0 × 106 and incubated in 24-well plates for 30-48 h. The efficiency of the viral infection was determined by the flow cytometry or Western blot analysis of the expression of RIP proteins in the infected cells. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were transfected with different vectors and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4,1mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). The cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotted or immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc-agarose affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer four times and eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer. After boiling (4 min), the samples were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were incubated with specific primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Luciferase Reporter Assay—HEK293T cells (3 × 105 in 12-well plates) were transfected with reporter plasmid encoding 5xNF-kB-luc (60 ng) and pEF-Renilla-luc (10 ng) together with plasmids encoding the desired genes using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Twenty hours later, cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activities were measured with the Dual-Luciferase assay kits (Promega, Madison, WI). NF-κB activities were determined by normalization of NF-κB-dependent firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat or its derivative cells following various stimulations. Cells (2 × 107) were resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The nuclei were pelleted, and the cytoplasmic proteins were carefully removed. The nuclear pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture). After vortexing for 30 min at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min), and the nuclear proteins in the supernatant were collected. Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The nuclear extract (10 μg) was incubated with a 32P-labeled, double-stranded, NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide probe or Oct-1 probe as a control (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature. After incubation, samples were fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Cell Viability Assay—RIP- cells reconstituted with different forms of RIP were seeded into 6-well plate (0.4 × 106/well) and treated with or without TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 22 h. Cells were then collected and assayed either for cell viability by flow cytometry or for cell death by annexin V staining on triplicate cultures. Confocal Microscopy—Jurkat T cells or RIP- cell lines expressing FLAG-RIP-WT or FLAG-RIP-K377R were used to examine the capping of TNFR1 and recruitment of signaling components into the lipid raft. Briefly, 1 million cells were stained with FITC-conjugated cholera toxin B (CTxB) (8 μg/ml (Sigma)) at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were then washed and treated with 2 μg/ml TNFR1 agonistic antibodies (Goat anti-TNFR1 antibodies, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 4 °C for 60 min. Unbound antibody was removed by washing twice. To show the capping of TNFR1, cells were incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies at 1:100 dilution at 4 °C for 60 min. Capping was induced by warming cells to 37 °C in a water bath with mild agitation for 10 min. Cells were harvested and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed and mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated glasses by cytospin. Unstimulated controls were sequentially exposed to TNFR1 antibodies and secondary antibody at 4 °C only. Thereafter, fixed cells were permeabilized and treated with primary antibodies as indicated followed by Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Fluorescence was detected using a Olympus Fluoview FV300 confocal laser scanning biological microscope. Previous studies indicate that RIP undergoes a TNFα-dependent ubiquitination (8Lee T.H.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the ubiquitination of RIP is required for TNFα-dependent NF-κB activation, we decided to map the ubiquitination site(s) of RIP. RIP is composed of three structural domains, the N-terminal kinase domain (KD), an intermediate domain (ID), and the C-terminal death domain (DD) (Fig. 1A). Thus, we constructed a series of RIP deletion mutants that encode different domains (Fig. 1A). The expression vectors encoding these mutants were transfected into HEK293T cells together with a vector encoding the NF-κB-dependent luciferase to measure their ability to activate NF-κB. To prevent transfection-associated cell death, a plasmid encoding CrmA was included in the transfection. Consistent with previous observations (5Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 6Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), overexpression of full-length (residues 1-671), the intermediate domain (residues 301-550), and the death domain (residues 551-671) of RIP could induce NF-κB activation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, overexpression of the kinase domain (residues 1-300) of RIP failed to activate NF-κB (Fig. 1B). To determine which domain of RIP contains the ubiquitination site of RIP, the full-length and deletion mutants of RIP were immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, both full-length and the intermediate domain of RIP were ubiquitinated, whereas the kinase domain and the death domain were not ubiquitinated. These results indicate that the intermediate domain of RIP contains the ubiquitination sites. To identify which lysine residue(s) in the intermediate domain of RIP is the functional ubiquitination site, we aligned the sequence of the intermediate domain of human, rat, and mouse RIP. We found that Lys residues 305, 306, 377, 396, and 530 are conserved among different species (Fig. 2A), any of which might be the ubiquitination site in the intermediate domain of RIP. Therefore, we first constructed a series of RIP intermediate domain mutants, in which Lys residues 377, 396, 530, or both 305 and 306, were mutated to Arg. Although overexpression of these mutants, as well as wild type RIP intermediate domain, can induce NF-κB activation (Fig. 2B), the RIP intermediate domain mutant with Lys377 mutated to Arg (K377R) had the most significant defect for NF-κB activation (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the overexpression-associated ubiquitination was significantly reduced for the K377R mutant (Fig. 2C, lane 3). Similarly, the RIP full-length mutant with Lys377 mutated to Arg (RIP-K377R) had the most significant defect for NF-κB activation (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that Lys377 may be the ubiquitination site in the intermediate domain of RIP and plays an important role for RIP-mediated NF-κB activation. To demonstrate that Lys377 of RIP plays a crucial role for TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, we reconstituted RIP-deficient (RIP-) Jurkat T cells with wild type RIP and its mutants, in which Lys residues in the intermediate domain were mutated to Arg. As shown in Fig. 3A, all of these mutants of RIP are expressed at comparable levels. Next, we examined TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3B) and determined the induction of phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 3C). We found that expression of RIP-K396R, RIP-K530R, RIP-K305/306R (data not shown), as well as wild type version of RIP (RIP-WT), could effectively restore TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in RIP- cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, mutant forms of RIP, containing mutated lysine 377 (RIP-K377R and RIP-K377/396/530R), failed to restore TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in RIP- cells (Fig. 3B). The defect observed in Lys377 mutants was specific for TNFα signaling, because phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) CD28 costimulation-induced NF-κB activation was normal in these cell lines (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these results, inducible IκBα phosphorylation was detected in RIP-deficient cells expressing RIP-WT, RIP-K396R, or RIP-K530R but significantly defective in RIP-deficient cells expressing RIP-K377R or RIP-K377/396/530R following TNFα stimulation (Fig. 3C). Together, these results indicate that lysine 377 of RIP plays a crucial role for mediating TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. TNFα treatment activates both apoptotic and survival signals. The outcome of cell survival or death following TNFα treatment is dependent on the balance of these two signals. Earlier studies indicate that the TNFα-induced survival signal is dependent on NF-κB activation, which induces the expression of several anti-apoptotic or survival genes. These anti-apoptotic or survival proteins protect cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis. Because TNFα stimulation cannot activate NF-κB in RIP-deficient (RIP-) cells, these cells are sensitive to TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4) (6Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 8Lee T.H. Shank J. Cusson N. Kelliher M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33185-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To examine whether the mutant form of RIP can rescue RIP- cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis, stable cells with different mutants of RIP were stimulated with TNFα for 22 h before the cell viability was measured. Cells without TNFα treatment are normalized to 100% and used as the negative control. TNFα treatment induced more than 50% of apoptosis in RIP RIP- (Mock), RIP- (RIP-K377R), and RIP- (RIP-K377/396/530R) cells, whereas the expression of RIP-WT, RIP-K396R, or RIP-K530R protected RIP- cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4). This protective effect is highly specific, because Fas-induced apoptosis was not affected in these cells (Fig. 4). Together, these data further support the conclusion that Lys377 of RIP is important for TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. To further explore whether the functional deficiency of the RIP-K377R mutant is because of the lack of ubiquitination following TNFα stimulation, RIP ubiquitination was measured in RIP-deficient (RIP-) cells expressing RIP-WT, RIP-K377R, or vector control. As shown in Fig. 5A, the ubiquitinated form of RIP can be detected in RIP- (RIP-WT) cells treated with TNFα for 4 min, whereas RIP-K377R expressed in RIP- cells cannot be ubiquitinated following TNFα stimulation, although RIP-WT and RIP-K377R are expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 5A). Consistent with these results, TNFα effectively induced phosphorylation of IκBα in RIP- (RIP-WT) but not in RIP- (RIP-K377R) cells (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 6). These results demonstrate that Lys377 in the intermediate domain of RIP is the functional ubiquitination site for TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. Earlier studies suggest that RIP may provide docking sites to recruit downstream signaling components such as TAK1 and NEMO (11Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 23Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and our recent data also suggest that the role of RIP is to recruit TAK1 to the TNFR1 complex leading to NF-κB activation (10Blonska M. Shambharkar P.B. Kobayashi M. Zhang D. Sakurai H. Su B. Lin X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43056-43063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the defect of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in the RIP-deficient cells expressing RIP-K377R is because RIP-K377R cannot effectively associate with TAK1 or NEMO. To test this hypothesis, plasmids encoding Myc-RIP-WT, Myc-RIP-K377R, Myc-RIP-K396R, or Myc-RIP-K530R were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells (Fig. 6A). The Myc-tagged RIP proteins were immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells, subjected to SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted with anti-TAK1 antibodies. Compared with RIP-WT and other mutants of RIP, the interaction between RIP-K377R and endogenous TAK1 was significantly reduced (Fig. 6B). However, although it also slightly reduced, RIP-K377R could still associate with the endogenous NEMO (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the association of RIP with TAK1 is mainly dependent on the ubiquitination of Lys377, whereas the association of RIP with the IKK complex may be independent of Lys377 ubiquitination. The lipid raft, the cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains, has been suggested to involve in the activation of NF-κB in the TNFα signaling pathway. It has been shown that TNFR1 and downstream signaling components are recruited to the lipid raft following TNFα stimulation, and this recruitment may be required for NF-κB activation. To examine the recruitment of signaling components to TNFR1 after the stimulation of TNF receptor 1, we examined the localization of signaling components using fluorescent confocal microscopy methods. Jurkat T cells were first labeled with FITC-conjugated CTxB (green), which specifically associates with the lipid raft. To show the localization of TNFR1, CTxB-labeled cells were stimulated with or without TNFR1 agonist antibodies followed by the staining with Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibody (red). In unstimulated cells, lipid raft and TNFR1 are evenly distributed on the cell surface (Fig. 7). After cross-linking TNFR1, TNFR1 was recruitment into aggregated lipid rafts (Fig. 7). Therefore, we can determine whether signaling components are recruited into the TNFR1 complex by examining their colocalization with lipid rafts following the stimulation of TNFR1. To further determine whether Lys377 of RIP plays an essential role for the recruitment of downstream signaling components to TNFR1 complex, we reconstituted RIP-deficient (RIP-) cells with plasmids encoding RIP-WT or RIP-K377R. RIP-WT and RIP-K377R were expressed at comparable levels in the reconstituted RIP- cells (data not shown). The resulting stable cells were also labeled with CTxB and cross-linked with or without TNFR1 agonist antibodies. As found in Jurkat T cells, TNFR1 was colocalized with lipid rafts following the stimulation of TNFR1 in both RIP-WT and RIP-K377R-reconstituted RIP- cells (Fig. 8A, lower panels). To examine the localization of signaling components, these cells were immunolabeled with anti-RIP (Fig. 8B), anti-TAK1 (Fig. 8C), or anti-TRAF2 (Fig. 8D) antibodies. In the unstimulated cells, RIP, TAK1, and TRAF2 were uniformly distributed in cytoplasm. Following the stimulation, RIP (WT), TAK1, and TRAF2 were recruited to the region close to lipid raft on the cytoplasm in the RIP- cells expressing RIP-WT. In contrast, the recruitment of TAK1 was defective in the RIP- cells expressing RIP-K377R (Fig. 8C, lower right panels), although the recruitment of TNFR1, RIP (K377R), and TRAF2 was normal in these cells (Fig. 8, A, B, and D, lower right panels). Together, our results indicate that the ubiquitination of Lys377 in RIP is required for the recruitment of its downstream signaling components to the TNFR1 complex in lipid rafts. RIP is an essential signaling component for the NF-κB activation in TNFα signaling pathway (6Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 7Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) and is ubiquitinated following TNFα stimulation (8Lee T.H. Shank J. Cusson N. Kelliher M.A. J. Biol.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), which has been suggested to play an important role in the NF-κB activation. In this study, we have investigated the role of RIP ubiquitination by identifying the ubiquitination site and examining TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in the RIP-deficient cells reconstituted with various RIP mutants. Our results indicate that Lys377 in the intermediate domain of RIP is the functional ubiquitination site, because expression of the ubiquitination-deficient mutant of RIP, in which Lys377 was replaced with an arginine residue, cannot restore the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in RIP-deficient cells. This defect is likely because this RIP mutant fails to recruit the downstream signaling components (TAK1-TAB complex) into the TNFR1 complex. Together, our studies demonstrate that ubiquitination of RIP is required for TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. RIP is composed of an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain, and a C-terminal death domain. Consistent with previous studies (5Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 6Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), we found that the kinase domain of RIP cannot activate NF-κB (Fig. 1B) and, in addition, it is not ubiquitinated (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the intermediate domain is ubiquitinated (Fig. 1C) and can also activate NF-κB, supporting the hypothesis that ubiquitination of RIP is important for the NF-κB activation. Of note, although the death domain, which is required for the recruitment of RIP to the upstream component TRADD, does not contain an ubiquitination site, it can still activate NF-κB. One explanation for the death domain-induced NF-κB activation is that the overexpressed death domain may lead to oligomerization-dependent NF-κB activation (24Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J.H. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yamaoka S. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37966-37977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) by oligomerizing the endogenous RIP. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that RIP indeed forms oligomers through its death domain (data not shown). The intermediate domain of RIP contains several lysine residues, including lysine 305, 306, 377, 396, and 530, which are conserved among different species (Fig. 3A). However, only the mutation on Lys377 in the intermediate domain leads to the defect for ubiquitination (Fig. 3C), indicating that Lys377 may be the key ubiquitination site in the intermediate domain. Although the NF-κB activation induced by overexpression of ID-K377R was significantly reduced in comparison with wild type intermediate domain or other mutants, it remained partial activity to activate NF-κB (Fig. 2B). This remaining activity is likely because of the fact that other Lys residues in the intermediate domain may partially compensate the function of Lys377 when ID-K377R is overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Nevertheless, RIP-deficient cells expressing RIP-K377R mutant are completely defective in TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, whereas mutations on Lys396, Lys530 (Fig. 3), and Lys305/Lys306 (data not shown) have no significant defect for the NF-κB activation. Consistent with the functional assay, TNFα-induced ubiquitination is also significantly reduced for RIP-K377R (Fig. 5). It has been reported that TRAF2 may work as an E3 ligase for the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP, and this Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP has been suggested to provide a docking site for the recruitment of TAK1-TAB2 complex (11Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that the mutation of Lys377 significantly disrupts the interaction between RIP and TAK1 (Fig. 6), suggesting that the Lys377-mediated ubiquitination is likely involved in this Lys63-linked ubiquitination and is required for the association of TAK1. Consistent with this conclusion, RIP-K377R fails to recruit TAK1 to the TNFα receptor complex following the stimulation of TNFR1 (Fig. 8). However, we have not been able to demonstrate directly that Lys377 only undergoes the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination in vivo, because the high level of endogenous ubiquitin interferes a direct assessment of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination. It has been suggested that A20 functions as a deubiquitination enzyme to remove the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP and then functions as an E3 ligase to further ubiquitinate RIP through the Lys48-linked polyubiquitination. This Lys48-linked polyubiquitination may play a role in the down-regulation of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by targeting RIP for proteasome-mediated degradation (21Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Because the mutation of Lys377 does not significantly increase the stability of RIP (data not shown), we believe that the Lys48-linked polyubiquitination of RIP is through a Lys377-independent process. Of note, when full-length RIP-K377R was overexpressed in HEK293 cells, it could still be ubiquitinated (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether this Lys377-independent ubiquitination of RIP is Lys48-linked polyubiquitination and what is the functional significance of Lys377-independent ubiquitination in RIP. It has been shown that the NEMO-IKK complex can be recruited to the TNFα receptor complex through a RIP-independent but TRAF2-dependent mechanism (23Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that NEMO can directly associate with the intermediate domain of RIP (9Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Although the association of RIP-K377R with the IKK complex (NEMO subunit) is slightly decreased, RIP-K377R can still associate with NEMO (Fig. 6). Therefore, these results suggest that the association of RIP with IKK complex may not be completely dependent on the ubiquitination of Lys377, and suggest that RIP functions as an adaptor molecule to bring TAK1 and IKK together by the Lys377-dependent and Lys377-independent process following TNFα stimulation. In this complex, TAK1 induces the phosphorylation of IKKβ directly or indirectly, leading to NF-κB activation. Recruitment of signaling components to the lipid raft is required for the activation of NF-κB following the cross-linking of TNFR1 (20Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 25Lotocki G. Alonso O.F. Dietrich W.D. Keane R.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11010-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we have found that TNFR1 and other signaling components are colocalized with lipid rafts (10Blonska M. Shambharkar P.B. Kobayashi M. Zhang D. Sakurai H. Su B. Lin X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43056-43063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although RIP-K377R and wild type RIP were effectively recruited to lipid rafts following the stimulation of TNFR1, the recruitment of TAK1 to lipid rafts was defective in RIP-deficient cells expressing RIP-K377R. Together, our results indicate that Lys377-dependent ubiquitination of RIP is essential for the recruitment of TAK1 to the TNFR1 complex in the lipid raft following the stimulation of TNFR1 (Fig. 8D). In summary, our results provide the direct genetic and biochemical evidence that the ubiquitination of RIP is required for the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation through recruiting TAK1 to the TNFR1 complex. Importantly, we have found that Lys377 in the intermediate domain of RIP is the functional ubiquitination site. We thank Drs. Bryant Darnary, Zhijian Chen, and Brian Seed for reagents."

We have now examined the interplay between Akt activation, regulation of apoptosis, the unfolded protein response, and activation of NF-κBin α2M*-induced proliferation of 1-LN cells. Exposure of cells to α2M* (50 pm) induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt by phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 with a concomitant 60-80% increase in Akt-associated kinase activity. ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK were also activated, but there was only a marginal effect on JNK activation. Treatment of 1-LN cells with α2M* down-regulated apoptosis and promoted NF-κB activation as shown by increases of Bcl-2, p-BadSer-136, p-FOXO1Ser-253, p-GSK3βSer-9, XIAP, NF-κB, cyclin D1, GADD45β, p-ASK1Ser-83, and TRAF2 in a time of incubation-dependent manner. α2M* treatment of 1-LN cells, however, showed no increase in the activation of caspase -3, -9, or -12. Under these conditions, we observed increased unfolded protein response signaling as evidenced by elevated levels of GRP78, IRE1α, XBP-1, ATF4, ATF6, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, and GADD34 and reduced levels of GADD153. Silencing of GRP78 gene expression by RNAi suppressed activation of AktThr-308, AktSer-473, and IκB kinase α kinase. The effects of α2M* on the NF-κB activation, antiapoptotic signaling, unfolded protein response signaling, and proapoptotic signaling were also reversed by this treatment. In conclusion, α2M* promotes cellular proliferation of 1-LN prostate cancer cells by activating MAPK and Akt-dependent signaling, down-regulating apoptotic signaling, and activating unfolded protein response signaling. Binding of activated forms of the proteinase inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) to cell surface-associated GRP78 on 1-LN human prostate cancer cells causes their proliferation. We have now examined the interplay between Akt activation, regulation of apoptosis, the unfolded protein response, and activation of NF-κBin α2M*-induced proliferation of 1-LN cells. Exposure of cells to α2M* (50 pm) induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of Akt by phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 with a concomitant 60-80% increase in Akt-associated kinase activity.

Under these conditions, we observed increased unfolded protein response signaling as evidenced by elevated levels of GRP78, IRE1α, XBP-1, ATF4, ATF6, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, and GADD34 and reduced levels of GADD153. Silencing of GRP78 gene expression by RNAi suppressed activation of AktThr-308, AktSer-473, and IκB kinase α kinase. The effects of α2M* on the NF-κB activation, antiapoptotic signaling, unfolded protein response signaling, and proapoptotic signaling were also reversed by this treatment. In conclusion, α2M* promotes cellular proliferation of 1-LN prostate cancer cells by activating MAPK and Akt-dependent signaling, down-regulating apoptotic signaling, and activating unfolded protein response signaling. Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy of men (1Jemal A. Thomas A. Murray T. Thun M. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2002; 52: 23-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2934) Google Scholar). Its progression may be accompanied by acquisition of androgen independence, a poor prognostic indicator associated with a more metastatic phenotype (2Heinlein C.A. Chancy C. Endocr.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). Many growth factors play roles in the progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer. Ligand binding to growth factor receptors induces their autophosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, resulting in the assembly of multiprotein complexes, which activate the Ras/MAPK 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; α2M*, activated forms of the proteinase inhibitor α2-macroglobulin; GRP78, glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol-dependent protein kinase-3; UPR, unfolded protein response; IAPs, inhibitors of apoptosis; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiator factor-2α; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; RNAi, RNA interference; and PI 3-kinase signaling pathways, promoting tumor cell proliferation (4Schlessinger J.

Receptor-mediated activation of PI 3-kinase results in its recruitment to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, where it generates 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides. These lipids regulate downstream signal transduction by activating Akt, which is overexpressed in many forms of cancer, including prostate (5Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 6Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 7Shukla S.

Once activated, Akt both promotes cellular proliferation, and it phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, inducing translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, where it up-regulates the transcription of antiapoptotic genes, such as the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and Bcl-2 (8Kim A.H.

The molecular chaperone GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa) is important in the folding, maturation, and transport of proteins out of the cell. GRP78 is critical for the unfolded protein response (UPR) required to alleviate ER “stress,” maintain ER function, and protect cells against death (14Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar, 15Shen X. Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 16Ma Y.

Whereas GRP78 is constitutively expressed, its synthesis is induced by stressful conditions that perturb protein folding and assembly within the ER (14Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar, 15Shen X. Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 16Ma Y.

A small pool of this newly synthesized GRP78 translocates to the cell surface from the ER in association with MTJ-1 (18Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), where it functions as a co-receptor for viruses and major histocompatibility complex Class I antigen presentation and as a receptor for activated forms of the plasma proteinase inhibitor α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) (see Refs. 18Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Hart J.P. Johnson C.E. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

Biophys. 2001; 383: 135-141Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar and references therein). Activation of this receptor on the surface of 1-LN human prostate cancer cells by α2M* triggers proproliferative and antiapoptotic behavior; therefore, it could be argued that up-regulation of cell surface-associated GRP78 is part of the aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer (22Misra U.K. Deedwania R. Pizzo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26278-26286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, autoantibodies against GRP78 appear in the sera of prostate cancer patients, and they are a biomarker of aggressive behavior (23Mintz P.J. Kim J. Do K.-A. Wang X. Zinner R.G. Cristofanilli M. Arap A.M. Hong W.K. Troncoso P. Logethetis C.J. Pasqualini R. Arap W. Nat.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 275-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The circulating concentration of α2M is about 2-5 μm, and its proteinase activated form, α2M*, may comprise approximately a 200-500 nm concentration of this pool (25Pizzo S.V. Hart J.P. Coleman R.W. Clowes A.W. Goldhaber S.Z. Marder V.J. George J.N. 5th Ed. Hemostasis and Thromboses, Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore2006: 395-407Google Scholar). Prostate cancer cells themselves may produce prostate cancer-specific antigen, a proteinase that binds readily to α2M, converting it to α2M* (26Otto A. Bar J. Birkenmeier G. J. Urol. 1998; 159: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Zhang W.M. Finne P. Leinonen J. Vesalainen S. Hordling S. Rannikko S. Stenman U.H. Clin. Chem. 1998; : 2471-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Aggressive prostate cancers also produce matrix metalloproteinases, which readily convert α2M to α2M*. Therefore, it could be envisaged that under the conditions that exist in patients harboring prostate cancer, a substantial amount of α2M* is available to bind to cell surface-associated GRP78, thus triggering the activation of mitogenic signaling and promoting cellular proliferation. The activation of all three MAPK cascades (namely extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK) occurs in cells undergoing ER stress (28Matsukawa J.

ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) is a Ser/Thr kinase that activates both the p38 MAPK and JNK pathways by directly phosphorylating MKK3/MKK6 and MKK4/MKK7, respectively (28Matsukawa J.

On the other hand, overexpression of ASK 1 may induce not only apoptosis but cell differentiation and survival, depending on the cell type and cellular context (28Matsukawa J. Matsuzawa A. Takeda K.

These stimuli activate the IκB kinase (IKK) β subunit, which phosphorylates NF-κB-bound IκB and targets it for ubiquitin-dependent degradation, allowing liberated NF-κB dimers to translocate to the nucleus (53Viatour P. Merville M.-P. Bours V. Chariot A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). In an alternative pathway, the IKK α subunit of the IKK complex processes NF-κB2 precursor protein, which preferentially binds RelB in the cytoplasm, resulting in the release of RelB-p52 dimers (55Pomerantz J.L.

Persistent NF-κB activation is detected in many solid tumors, and its inhibition increases their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation (54Amiri K.I. Richmond A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2005; 24: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Overexpression of NF-κB suppresses apoptosis, whereas IκB-α mutants, which can no longer be phosphorylated, are resistant to ubiquitin-mediated degradation and suppress NF-κB activation, thus sensitizing cells to apoptotic insults (16Ma Y.

In the present report, we have examined the role of Akt activation, regulation of apoptosis, and the unfolded protein response in α2M*-induced growth of 1-LN prostate cancer cells. We report an increase in AktThr-308 and AktSer-473 kinase activities, up-regulation of UPR components, including IREIα, XBP-1, ATF6, GRP78, p-PERK, p-eIF2α, GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 34), and ATF4, as well as up-regulation of components of the anti-apoptotic machinery Bcl-2, p-FOXO1, NF-κB, GADD45β, and XIAP in 1-LN prostate cancer cells treated with α2M*. We have also studied the role of GRP78 in α2M*-induced activation of cell survival and antiapoptotic signaling by silencing GRP78 gene expression employing RNAi.

Western Blotting of Activated Akt in α2M*-stimulated 1-LN Prostate Cancer Cells—The highly metastatic prostate carcinoma cell line 1-LN, derived from less metastatic PC-3 cells, was a kind gift from Dr. Philip Walther (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). 1-LN cells in 6-well plates (500 × 103 cells/well) were allowed to grow to confluence in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (12.5 units/ml), streptomycin (6.5 μg/ml), 2 mm glutamine, and 10 nm insulin at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. At about 90% confluence, the medium was aspirated, the monolayers were washed with ice-cold Hepes-buffered Hanks' basic salt solution, pH 7.4, and a fresh volume of medium was added to the monolayers. The cells were exposed to α2M* (50 pm) for varying periods of time. The reaction was stopped by aspirating the medium, and a volume of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, and leupeptin (20 μg/ml) was added. The cells were lysed for 10 min over ice, scraped into tubes, and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and their protein contents were determined (58Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). In each case an equal amount of protein was used for electrophoresis. The immunoblottting of membranes with antibodies specific for phosphorylation of Akt in Thr-308 or Ser-473 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The detection and quantification of immunoblots were performed by ECF and phosphorimaging. The membranes were reprobed for the protein loading control actin. Measurement of Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 and Ser-473 and Their Kinase Activities in Cells Stimulated with α2M*—The p-AktThr-308 and p-AktSer-473 kinase activities in Akt immunoprecipitates of 1-LN prostate cancer cells stimulated with α2M* (50 pm/15 min) were assayed essentially according to Hill and Jennings (59Hill M.M.

https://openalex.org/W2125792150,"Artificial muscles and electric motors found in autonomous robots and prosthetic limbs are typically battery-powered, which severely restricts the duration of their performance and can necessitate long inactivity during battery recharge. To help solve these problems, we demonstrated two types of artificial muscles that convert the chemical energy of high–energy-density fuels to mechanical energy. The first type stores electrical charge and uses changes in stored charge for mechanical actuation. In contrast with electrically powered electrochemical muscles, only half of the actuator cycle is electrochemical. The second type of fuel-powered muscle provides a demonstrated actuator stroke and power density comparable to those of natural skeletal muscle and generated stresses that are over a hundred times higher."
https://openalex.org/W2138745567,"The role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the control of systemic blood pressure and volume homeostasis is well known and has been extensively studied. Recently, Ang II was suggested to also have a function in skin wound healing. In the present study, the <i>in vivo</i> function of Ang II in skin wound healing was investigated using Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) knock-out mice. Wound healing in these mice was found to be markedly delayed. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts play important roles in wound healing, and thus the effect of Ang II on the migration of these cells was examined. Ang II stimulated keratinocyte and fibroblast migration in a dose-dependent manner. It has been reported that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation induces epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) transactivation through the shedding of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). As AT1R is a GPCR, it was hypothesized that Ang II-induced keratinocyte and fibroblast migration is mediated by EGFR transactivation. Ang II induced EGFR phosphorylation, which was inhibited by an AT1R antagonist, HB-EGF neutralizing antibody, and an HB-EGF antagonist in both keratinocytes and in fibroblasts. Moreover, Ang II-induced migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts was also prevented by these inhibitors. Taken together, these findings clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that Ang II plays an important role in skin wound healing and that it functions by accelerating keratinocyte and fibroblast migration in a process mediated by HB-EGF shedding."
https://openalex.org/W2019465043,"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are heterodimeric transcription factors regulating the oxygen supply, glucose metabolism, and angiogenesis. HIF function requires the recruitment of p300/CREB-binding protein, two coactivators with histone acetyltransferase activity, by the C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-α (HIF-αCAD). Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAIs) induce differentiation or apoptosis and repress tumor growth and angiogenesis, hence being explored intensively as anti-cancer agents. Using combined pharmacological, biochemical, and genetic approaches, here we show that HDAIs repress the transactivation potential of HIF-αCAD. This repression is independent of the function of tumor suppressors von Hippel-Lindau or p53 or the degradation of HIF-α. We also demonstrate the sufficiency of low concentrations of HDAIs in repression of HIF target genes in tumor cells. We further show that HDAIs induce hyperacetylation of p300 and repress the HIF-1α·p300 complex in vivo. In vitro acetylation analysis reveals that the p300CH1 region, but not HIF-αCAD, is susceptible to acetylation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that a deacetylase activity is indispensable for the transactivation potential of HIF-αCAD and support a model that acetylation regulates HIF function by targeting HIF-α·p300 complex, not by direct acetylating HIF-α. The demonstration that HDAIs repress both HIF-1α and HIF-2α transactivation potential independently of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor and p53 function indicates that HDAIs may have biological effects in a broad range of tissues in addition to tumors.

HIF exerts its function by transcriptionally stimulating the coordinated expression of about 100 functionally related genes (2Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev.

Particularly, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptors directly contributes to angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (4Achen M.G. McColl B.K. Stacker S.A.

In addition, HIF-stimulated expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes ensures undisrupted energy metabolism under hypoxic or ischemic conditions. A combination of various conditions, including hypoxia, mitogenic signaling, loss of tumor suppressors, and activation of oncogenes, leads to enhanced HIF activity that promotes tumor growth. Because of the important role of HIF, blocking HIF function in tumors has become one of the major goals of cancer research (2Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev.

HIF-1 and HIF-2 share a common subunit HIF-β (also known as ARNT), but each has a unique α subunit. The structurally and functionally related HIF-1α and HIF-2α (collectively HIF-α) are the key determinants of the function of HIF-1 and HIF-2. HIF-α activity is controlled by two well known mechanisms (3Semenza G.L. Physiol. 2004; 19: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). First, HIF-α is rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions. When oxygen is available, de novo translated HIF-α is hydroxylated at two conserved prolyl residues (Pro-402 and Pro-564 in HIF-1α) located at the oxygen-dependent degradation domain by proline hydroxylases (11Bruick R.K.

Protein acetylation has been implicated in regulation of gene expression and protein-protein interactions. Two groups of enzymes, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) modulate the acetylation status of histones and nonhistone proteins (31Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Generally, acetylation is associated with active transcription, whereas HDACs are found in repressive complexes of transcription (31Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell.

However, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the pharmacological effects are not clear. Here we show that HDAIs at concentrations that do not affect HIF-1α levels efficiently repress the transactivation potential of HIF-αCAD and that this repression is independent of either p53 or VHL function. We further show that HDAIs repress HIF function by directly targeting the HIF-αCAD·p300 complex but do not involve a direct acetylation of HIF-1α.

HCT116 and Hep3B were cultured in McCoy's 5A and minimal essential medium, respectively. All culture media were supplemented with l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Hypoxic treatments were carried out by directly incubating cells in a Hypoxia work station equipped with a programmable controller of humidity and temperature and connected to an automatic gas mixer (InvivO2; Ruskinn Technology). Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Transient transfection was performed with Lipofectamine Plus or Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen) by following the low serum protocol recommended by the (p53 manufacturer. Cells were trypsinized 24 h after transfection, pooled, divided equally, and cultured in 12-well plates for reporter assays or in 100-mm dishes for Western blot analysis. pRL-CMV (0.1 μg) was cotransfected to normalize transfection efficiency and effects of special treatments on the promoters. Luciferase and dual luciferase assays were performed in triplicate with kits from Promega. Luminescence was measured in a TD20/20 luminometer (Promega), and relative light units (RLU) were standardized to Renilla luciferase activity expressed from cotransfected pRL-CMV. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad method. Antibodies, Cell Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, GST Pull-down, and Western Blotting—Monoclonal antibodies against Gal4DBD and p300 (NM11) were from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA).

Anti-HDAC1, anti-Hsp90, anti-acetyllysine, and anti-acetyl-H3 antibodies were from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada) and Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). To determine protein levels, cells were lysed in urea buffer (8 m urea, 10 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mix, pH 6.8) on ice with an Ultra-Turrax T8 homogenizer (IKA GmbH & Co.) for 5 s followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. For GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation studies, cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton 100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm desferrioxamine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mix, pH 7.5) with 500 mm NaCl and special drugs as they were used in cell culture, followed by two freeze-thaw-vortex cycles. After centrifugation, supernatants were 1:1 diluted with lysis buffer without NaCl. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (25Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 9: 2984-2992Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). GST fusion protein expression and pull-down assays were carried out as described (45Sang N. Giordano A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For in vivo GST pull-down, glutathione beads were equilibrated first with lysis buffer with 250 mm NaCl and then incubated with cell lysates for 1 h on a roller at 4 °C, followed by four washes with lysis buffer. Western blot analyses were performed as previously described (25Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 9: 2984-2992Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Sang N.

The cytoplasmic/nuclear fractionation was performed with an NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit from Pierce. Immunofluorescent Cell Staining—HeLa cells were cultured in chamber slides under normoxic or hypoxic conditions and treated with or without TSA (600 nm) for 8 h immediately before fixation in 0.3% gluteraldehyde in BRB80 buffer (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.9). After fixation, the slides were sequentially incubated with anti-HIF-1α (1:100) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:100) and mounted with mounting medium for fluorescein (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with 1.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to counterstain DNA. The slides were examined under a Nikon fluorescent microscopy equipped with Zeiss lens, laser source, multiple filters, and a digital CCD camera. On-bead Protein Acetylation Assays—Immobilized GST fusion proteins were rocked with HAT in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA (0.25 μCi, 4 nmol) (Amersham Biosciences), SBT (2 mm), and bovine serum albumin (2.5 mg/ml) in 300 μl of 1× HAT buffer (46Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 1 h. Immobilized protein substrates were collected by centrifugation and followed by four washes with 800 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer. Finally, the samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Coomassie Blue R250 staining, destaining, and autoradiography with either PhosphorImager screen or Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells with RNeasy kits from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Total RNA samples were digested for 2 h with RNase-free DNase (La Roche) followed by reverse transcription (RT kit from La Roche). The number of PCR cycles was optimized to exponential range for each individual mRNA target. Sequences of primers used in semiquantitative RT-PCR are described in the supplemental material. A Deacetylation Event Is Required for the Transactivation Potential of HIF-1αCAD—HDACs are described as repressors of transcription. An early finding implicated HDACs in the regulation of HIF-1 transactivation (30Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). We therefore addressed the question if the normoxic repression of HIF-1α transactivation involved the associated HDACs. As the first step, we tested the effects of TSA, an inhibitor of class I and class II HDACs, on the transactivation potential of HIF-1αCAD, which is the major determinant of the overall transactivation activity of HIF-1α (25Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 9: 2984-2992Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To minimize the effects of TSA on expression levels of Gal4-H1α, we subcloned the Gal4-H1α fragments in a mammalian expression vector with CMV promoter/enhancer. With this expression system, we observed that TSA at concentrations as low as 75 nm efficiently repressed the transactivation potential of Gal4-H1α744-826 under both normoxic (data not shown) and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1A). Western blot confirmed that after standardization with Renilla luciferase activity expressed from identical promoter/enhancer, the levels of Gal4-H1α744-826 in various samples were generally comparable (Fig. 1B). In initial experiments with SV40 promoter, TSA caused a dramatic increase in the levels of Gal4-H1α744-826, but to our surprise, its transactivation activity was clearly repressed (data not shown). We noticed that CMV promoter/enhancer was affected by TSA, but only 2-4 fold, contrasting with the 30-40-fold increase when SV40 promoter/enhancer was used (data not shown). TSA does not impair the DNA binding ability of Gal4, because the transactivation activity of all other Gal4 fusion constructs tested, including Gal4-VP16, was strongly enhanced by TSA under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1C and data not shown). The decrease in transactivation activity was not caused by cytotoxicity of TSA, because the cells did not change morphologically, and RLU had been normalized to an internal standard (Renilla luciferase), and, more importantly, the same concentration range of TSA stimulated other transcription factors, including MyoD and p53, under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1, D and E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that a deacetylase activity is indispensable for the transactivation potential of HIF-1αCAD. TSA Represses Both HIF-1αCAD and HIF-2αCAD Independently of the NRR—HIF-αNRR plays a key role in normoxic repression of the transactivation activity of HIF-αCAD (20Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). To explore whether TSA represses HIF-αCAD through HIF-αNRR, we examined effects of HDAIs on the transactivation potential of Gal4-H1α786-826, which lacks NRR, thus being constitutively active even under normoxic conditions (20Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 25Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 9: 2984-2992Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We observed that TSA repressed Gal4-H1α786-826 with a similar efficiency, if not better, demonstrating that TSA-mediated repression of HIF-1αCAD does not rely on NRR (Fig. 2A). Similarly, effects of TSA on a Gal4-H2αCAD (aa 819-870) lacking NRR were tested in cotransfection assays. The repression of transactivation potential of HIF-2αCAD also was evident (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that TSA represses both HIF-1α and HIF-2α through a common mechanism that is independent of NRR. Neither VHL nor p53 Function Is Indispensable for HDAIs to Repress HIF-1αCAD—VHL plays a key role in suppression of HIF activity by promoting the degradation of HIF-α. VHL also has been postulated to recruit HDA"

Hypoxia is a potent stimulator of VEGF expression, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is considered to be critical for this induction. However, we have previously demonstrated that induction of VEGF by hypoxia was preserved when HIF-1α was silenced. We sought to better define the molecular basis of this HIF-1-independent regulation. In colon cancer cells, hypoxia stimulated multiple K-ras effector pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. VEGF promoter deletion studies identified a novel promoter region between –418 and –223 bp that was responsive to hypoxia in a PI3K/Rho/ROCK-dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a fragment between –300 and –251 bp that demonstrated a unique shift only in hypoxic conditions. Inhibition of PI3K or ROCK blocked the formation of this complex. A binding site for c-Myc, a target of ROCK, was identified at –271 bp. A role for c-Myc in the hypoxic induction of VEGF was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of the VEGF promoter and silencing of c-Myc by small interfering RNA. Collectively, these findings suggest an alternative mechanism for the hypoxic induction of VEGF in colon cancer that does not depend upon HIF-1α but instead requires the activation of PI3K/Rho/ROCK and c-Myc.

Rapidly growing tumors routinely outstrip their supply of oxygen and nutrients, and the induction of new blood vessels is critical to sustain neoplastic proliferation (1Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar). New blood vessels can be stimulated to grow when factors that promote angiogenesis are up-regulated or those that inhibit angiogenesis are down-regulated (2Bergers G. Benjamin L.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 4The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. is a key pro-angiogenic factor, and therapeutic approaches that inhibit VEGF in human malignancies have been approved for clinical use (3Kerbel R.S.

Med. 2004; 350: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (9270) Google Scholar). The Wnt and K-ras signaling pathways are frequently activated in early stages of colon carcinogenesis, and we previously demonstrated their role in the regulation of VEGF expression (6Zhang X. Gaspard J.P. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6050-6054PubMed Google Scholar). An additional environmental factor that can enhance VEGF expression in advanced tumors is hypoxia. Most solid tumors develop regions of low oxygen tension caused by an imbalance in oxygen supply and consumption, and hypoxia is a potent stimulator of VEGF. This induction is considered to be primarily mediated through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (7Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor composed of two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β. HIF-1α is the key regulatory component, because it is rapidly degraded in normoxic conditions but stabilized and activated in hypoxia (8Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar, 9Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). The HIF-1 complex recognizes a consensus hypoxia response element in the promoter of a broad range of target genes (10Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar), and VEGF is a key transcriptional target. However, we and others have shown that HIF-1α is not the only regulator of the hypoxic induction of VEGF (11Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Kotch L.E. Iyer N.V. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 254-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Cells derived from HIF-1α “knock-out” embryos still demonstrated a significant, albeit reduced, induction of VEGF in response to hypoxia (13Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ryan H.E. Lo J. Johnson R.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3005-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). Also, colon cancer cell lines stably expressing an siRNA construct against HIF-1α exhibited significant levels of VEGF in hypoxia (11Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the VEGF promoter can be induced by hypoxia when canonical hypoxia response elements are mutated or deleted in human cancer cell lines (7Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F.

Cell. 2004; 15: 4841-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These findings imply the existence of alternative transcriptional mechanisms that do not depend upon HIF-1α. In the present study, we sought to characterize the molecular mechanisms independent of HIF-1 that may regulate hypoxic expression of VEGF in colon cancer. In particular, we sought to define the cis-regulatory elements and transcription factors that are critical for the hypoxic response as well as the upstream signaling pathways that regulate them. Hypoxia activated multiple K-ras effector pathways including ERK, PI3K/Akt, and Rho. Inhibition of PI3K, Rho, and ROCK, but not ERK or Akt, attenuated the hypoxic induction of VEGF. c-Myc is a target of the PI3K/ROCK signaling pathway, and it can regulate the VEGF promoter through a binding element at –271 bp. Plasmid Constructions—Human VEGF promoter luciferase constructs were prepared as previously described (6Zhang X. Gaspard J.P. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6050-6054PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter constructs, 0.75-, 0.56-, and 0.43-kb VEGF-luc, contained VEGF promoter sequences from –418 bp to +350 bp, –223 bp to +350 bp, and –90 bp to +350 bp relative to the transcription initiation site, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the 0.75-kb VEGF-luc construct. A Myc-Max-binding site at –271 bp was selectively mutated (5′-GCGGGCGCGTGTCTC → 5′-GCGGGCGAAAGTCTC) and is designated mut-271-luc. The previously described K-rasV12 (17Khokhlatchev A. Rabizadeh S.

Cell Culture—The human colon cancer cell lines Caco2 and DLD-1 (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in recommended growth medium. Two independent HIF-1α knock-down clones of each cell line (HIF-kd1470 and HIF-kd2192) as well as a control cell that was transfected with empty pSuper.retro (HIF-wt) were also utilized (11Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Hypoxic conditions were achieved by culturing cell lines in a sealed hypoxia chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) after flushing with a mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 (11Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To minimize the effect of serum growth factors, the cell culture medium was switched to serum-free UltraCulture (Chambrex) before the cells were subjected to hypoxia. The specific inhibitors PD98059, LY294002, and Y27632 (Calbiochem) were added 1–2 h prior to exposure to normoxia or hypoxia at the concentrations indicated. In selected experiments, the cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 (Calbiochem) for 12 h prior to incubation in hypoxic conditions. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Fifteen μg of total RNA was analyzed using a random prime-labeled 400-bp human VEGF cDNA (6Zhang X. Gaspard J.P. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6050-6054PubMed Google Scholar), and 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as a loading control. VEGF mRNA decay rates were analyzed utilizing cells that were cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 10 h prior to the addition of 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma). Total RNA was isolated at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h, and the level of VEGF mRNA was normalized to the amount of 18 S rRNA after densitometry of Northern blots. All of the time points were performed in triplicate. Transfections and Reporter Assays—Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. All of the experiments were performed in 24-well tissue culture plates with cells plated to reach 50–60% confluence on the day of transfection. The cells were allowed to recover in regular culture medium overnight after transfection, switched to UltraCulture medium, and then exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. 0.4–0.6 μg of VEGF-luciferase reporter constructs were co-transfected with 2 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega) as a transfection control. pRL-null, a promoter-less Renilla construct, was used when cells were co-transfected with a K-ras expression vector, because Ras has been shown to induce the pRL-CMV plasmid (22Behre G. Smith L.T. Tenen D.G. BioTechniques. 1999; 26 (28): 24-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As indicated, 0.2 μg of expression vector was co-transfected, and the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding corresponding empty plasmid. Luciferase activity was measured with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The experiments were performed in duplicate wells a minimum of three times. Western Blotting—Protein lysates were harvested from cells subjected to normoxia or hypoxia for the indicated periods. The cells were lysed in chilled lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm leupeptin) supplemented with the Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science). 20–30 μg of protein extracts were resolved on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were probed with a HIF-1α (Transduction Laboratories; 1:250), HIF-2α (Novus; 1:250), phospho- and total ERK1/2, phospho- and total Akt, phospho- and total p38, or phospho- and total JNK antibody (all from Cell Signaling; 1:1000). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). siRNA Analysis—To silence c-Myc, siRNA against c-Myc was utilized (SignalSilence c-Myc siRNA kit, Cell Signaling; sequences originally described and validated in Ref. 23Williams N.S. Gaynor R.B. Scoggin S. Verma U. Gokaslan T. Simmang C. Fleming J. Tavana D. Frenkel E. Becerra C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 931-946PubMed Google Scholar). A control siRNA that does not correspond to any known human gene (5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA) was also utilized. Caco2 cells were transfected with 200 nm siRNA duplexes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the silencing effect was confirmed by Western blotting 48 h after transfection. VEGF promoter reporter constructs were co-transfected to examine the effect of c-Myc on VEGF promoter activity, and dual luciferase assays were performed 48 h after transfection. Real Time PCR Assay—RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed using SuperScript III platinum Two-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen). The 18 S rRNA served as endogenous control. Primer sequences for VEGF and 18 S rRNA are available upon request. PCR cycles were: 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles with annealing temperature, 55 °C. A fluorogenic SYBR Green and MJ research detection system were used for real time quantification. The results were presented as parameter threshold cycle (CT) values. ΔCT was the difference in the CT values derived from the specific gene being assayed and 18 S rRNA, whereas ΔΔCT represented the difference between the paired samples, as calculated by the formula ΔΔCT =ΔCT of a sample –ΔCT of a reference. The amount of target, normalized to an 18 S and relative to a reference, was expressed as 2–ΔΔCT. GST-Rhotekin Pulldown Assay—The level of activated, GTP-bound Rho was assessed utilizing a Rho activation assay kit (Upstate). Briefly, 1 mg of whole cell lysate was incubated with GST-tagged recombinant Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin. Precipitated GTP-bound Rho was detected by Western blotting using a RhoA antibody. Twenty μg of lysates were used for Western blotting to determine expression levels of RhoA protein for each sample. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells cultured in either normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 10 h utilizing NE-PER nuclear extraction reagent (Pierce). Sequences of the VEGF promoter between –418 and –223 bp were divided into five fragments and utilized as oligonucleotide probes (Table 1). The 3′-ends of the oligonucleotides were labeled with biotin during synthesis, and complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to generate double-stranded fragments. EMSA was performed using LightShift chemiluminescent kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 20 fmol of biotinylated oligonucleotides in binding buffer including 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% glycerol, and 5 mm MgCl2, and the reaction mix was loaded onto 6% DNA retardation gels (Invitrogen). DNA-protein complexes were transferred onto nylon membranes (Roche Applied Science), and the mobility shift was detected using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and a chemiluminescent substrate. Specificity of shifts was confirmed by utilizing 200-fold molar excess of unbiotinylated oligonucleotides as a specific competitor. Mutagenesis was performed to further define the elements responsible for the specific shifts obtained, as described in Table 1. Oligonucleotide 4mut-271 includes mutations that disrupt a Myc-Max-binding site.TABLE 1Sequences of oligonucleotide probes used for EMSAOligonucleotidesSequences15′-CCAATAGATCTGTGTGTCCCTCTCCCCACCCGTCCCTGTCCGGCTCTCC25′-CTCTCCGCCTTCCCCTGCCCCCTTCAATATTCCTAGCAAAGAGGGA35′-AAGAGGGAACGGCTCTCAGGCCCTGTCCGCACGTAACCTCACTTTC45′-CTTTCCTGCTCCCTCCTCGCCAATGCCCCGCGGGCGCGTGTCTCTGGACA55′-GGACAGAGTTTCCGGGGGCGGATGGGTAATTTTCAGCT4mut-2715′-CTTTCCTGCTCCCTCCTCGCCAATGCCCCGCGGGCGAAAGTCTCTGGACA Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences were analyzed by Student's t test, and p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Effect of Hypoxia on Ras Effector Pathways—We previously demonstrated that hypoxia and signaling through oncogenic K-ras can synergistically up-regulate VEGF (11Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We thus sought to identify which K-ras effector pathways may be activated during hypoxia. In Caco2 cells, ERK and Akt, but not p38 and JNK, were activated by exposure to hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1A). The role of the PI3K pathway in hypoxia was examined utilizing the specific inhibitor LY294002. LY294002 blocked the induction of VEGF mRNA in hypoxia by 40% and did so without blocking the induction of HIF-1α (Fig. 1B). In contrast, MEK inhibition with PD98059 failed to suppress the hypoxic induction of VEGF. mRNA decay assays were performed to determine whether PI3K may regulate VEGF by increasing mRNA stability. Although hypoxia stabilized VEGF mRNA and significantly increased its half-life (3.7-fold), the addition of LY294002 failed to alter the decay pattern in hypoxia (data not shown). These results imply that the PI3K pathway can regulate VEGF expression in hypoxia and that this occurs primarily through transcriptional but not post-transcriptional mechanisms. To confirm the role of PI3K in the regulation of gene transcription, a VEGF promoter reporter construct was utilized. Hypoxia up-regulated the 2.3-kb VEGF-luc construct almost 3-fold (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the effects on endogenous mRNA levels, LY294002 blocked the hypoxic induction of VEGF promoter activity by 89%, whereas PD98059 had no inhibitory activity (Fig. 1C). Consistent results were also obtained when dominant negative PI3K or ERK, respectively, were expressed. We then sought to identify the downstream effectors of PI3K. Akt is an important target of PI3K and is activated by hypoxia (24Chen E.Y. Mazure N.M. Cooper J.A. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2429-2433PubMed Google Scholar). However, dominant negative-Akt, which was previously shown to inhibit VEGF promoter activity in normoxia (6Zhang X. Gaspard J.P. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6050-6054PubMed Google Scholar), did not block the hypoxic induction of VEGF (Fig. 1C). Rho is another downstream target of PI3K that is also upstream of ROCK (25Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 26Sahai E. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Treisman R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 136-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A Rho activation assay was performed to determine whether it may be a target of PI3K in hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 2A, hypoxia up-regulated the levels of GTP-bound Rho, and this was inhibited by LY294002, indicating that hypoxia can activate Rho in a PI3K-dependent manner. There was also a synergistic activation of Rho by hypoxia and K-rasV12 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that oncogenic K-ras can further enhance PI3K-Rho signaling induced by hypoxia. When Rho was inhibited by C3 exoenzyme or a dominant negative construct or when ROCK was inhibited by the specific inhibitor Y27632 (27Watnick R.S. Cheng Y.N. Rangarajan A. Ince T.A. Weinberg R.A. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the hypoxic induction of the VEGF promoter was strongly down-regulated (Fig. 2C). Thus, activation of Rho/ROCK is essential for the hypoxic induction of the VEGF promoter by PI3K. Identification of a Novel Regulatory Region of the VEGF Promoter Responsive to Hypoxia—To identify regions of the VEGF promoter that mediate its induction by hypoxia, we previously performed serial 5′ deletions (11Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although deletion of the consensus hypoxia response element at –975 bp failed to block the hypoxic induction, a dramatic reduction in the hypoxic induction was observed when the promoter region between –418 and –90 bp was deleted (11Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To further define the element responsible for this regulation, additional deletions were performed. 0.75-kb VEGF-luc, which contains the promoter region between –418 and +350 bp, responded with a 2.2-fold induction by hypoxia in Caco2 colon cancer cells (Fig. 3A). However, the hypoxic induction fell to 1.3-fold when sequences from –418 to –223 bp were deleted. The VEGF promoter fragment between –418 and –223 bp does not contain a consensus HIF-1-binding element (11Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and may thus contain a novel element that is activated by hypoxia. When Caco2 and DLD-1 cells deficient in HIF-1α were utilized (Fig. 3B and data not shown), similar results were obtained, confirming that transcription factors other than HIF-1 can also regulate VEGF in hypoxia. To verify that this hypoxic induction of VEGF in the absence of HIF-1 was not mediated by a compensatory up-regulation of HIF-2, immunoblots were performed. In Caco2 cells deficient in HIF-1α, the levels of HIF-2α were nearly undetectable, and no up-regulation of HIF-2α was observed in hypoxic conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). We next determined the effect of oncogenic K-rasV12 on this 195-bp promoter fragment. Hypoxia up-regulated the 0.75-kb VEGF promoter construct 2.3-fold, but there was a strong synergistic activation when K-rasV12 was also expressed (7-fold up-regulation) (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of either PI3K or ROCK attenuated this synergistic response. No such induction was observed with the 0.56-kb VEGF-luc construct. K-ras is thus a potent regulator of this promoter region during hypoxia, and the effect is mediated through the PI3K/ROCK pathway. Identification of a Critical Regulatory Element Responsive to Hypoxia at –271 bp—To further characterize the regulatory element in the VEGF promoter between –418 and –223 bp that is responsive to hypoxia, EMSAs were performed. The 195-bp region was divided into five fragments that were utilized as probes for EMSA (Table 1). Nuclear extracts were isolated from Caco2 cells growing in either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. A unique band shift was obtained only when nuclear extracts from cells grown in hypoxic conditions were incubated with oligonucleotide 4 (Fig. 4A). The shift was also observed utilizing extracts from Caco2 cells deficient in HIF-1α (Caco2-HIF-kd1470 cells) (Fig. 4B). There are several consensus transcription factor-binding sites for AP2, Egr-1, Ets-1, and c-Myc in this promoter fragment. We were particularly curious about c-Myc, because c-Myc is a known target of the Rho/ROCK pathway (27Watnick R.S. Cheng Y.N. Rangarajan A. Ince T.A. Weinberg R.A. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, there is a putative Myc-Max-binding site at –271 bp, 5′-GCGGGCGCGTGTCTC. When probes with specific mutations in these binding sites were utilized (5′-GCGGGCGAAAGTCTC), the novel bands obtained in hypoxic conditions were lost, suggesting that this element may play an important role in regulating the hypoxic response (Fig. 4C). To examine the functional interaction between PI3K/ROCK and c-Myc, Western blotting was performed to detect the activated, phosphorylated form of c-Myc (Thr58/Ser62). Incubation of Caco2 cells in hypoxia increased the phosphorylation of c-Myc, and this was blocked when both PI3K and ROCK were specifically inhibited (Fig. 4D). This suggests that c-Myc is a downstream effector of PI3K/ROCK during hypoxia. The effect of these chemical inhibitors on the gel shift patterns was evaluated (Fig. 4E). Both LY294002 and Y27632 blocked the formation of the novel band. To confirm the role of c-Myc in the formation of this unique band identified on gel shift assays, siRNA duplexes against c-Myc were transfected into Caco2 cells prior to harvesting nuclear extracts. Silencing of c-Myc completely blocked the formation of this shifted band (Fig. 4F). A second faster migrating band was also observed in hypoxic conditions, and formation of this band was similarly blocked by both LY294002 and Y27632. However, this band was still identifiable when a mutant probe was used (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the band was also present in normoxic conditions (Fig. 4, A and B), making its possible role in the hypoxic induction of VEGF less clear. Although we cannot rule out an independent factor that may also play a role in the hypoxic induction of VEGF, these results suggest that c-Myc may be the transcription factor that interacts with the element at –271 bp in hypoxia. Role of c-Myc in the Regulation of VEGF—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to selectively alter the putative c-Myc-binding site in the 0.75-kb VEGF-luc construct, referred to as mut-271-luc (Fig. 5A). There was a 62% reduction (p < 0.01) in the hypoxic induction of the VEGF promoter in Caco2 cells when the Myc-Max-binding site at –271 bp was mutated. To directly determine its role in the regulation of VEGF transcription during hypoxia, c-Myc was overexpressed in these cells. c-Myc induced the wild-type 0.75-kb VEGF-luc construct 1.6-fold, but there was no induction when the Myc-Max element at –271bp was mutated (Fig. 5A, right panel). To further verify its role, c-Myc was silenced by transient transfection of specific siRNA duplexes. There was a strong silencing effect on c-Myc 48 h after transfection (Fig. 5B). Hypoxia up-regulated the VEGF promoter 2.1-fold when 0.75-kb VEGF-luc was co-transfected with control siRNA, but the induction was attenuated 1.6-fold by c-Myc siRNA (56% reduction, p < 0.01) (Fig. 5B). The reduction in the hypoxic induction by siRNA directed against c-Myc was also demonstrated in HIF-1α-deficient Caco2 cells (HIF-kd1470). Finally, the effect of silencing c-Myc on endogenous levels of VEGF mRNA was determined. Transfection of the c-Myc siRNA resulted in a 43% reduction in VEGF mRNA levels in hypoxia, as measured by real time PCR (Fig. 5C). This level of inhibition was comparable with that achieved by the addition of LY294002 (38% reduction in VEGF mRNA) or Y27632 (29% reduction in VEGF mRNA). These findings indicate that c-Myc can regulate VEGF during hypoxia and can at least partially explain the hypoxic induction of VEGF that is independent of HIF-1. In previous studies, we evaluated the role of HIF-1 in the hypoxic induction of VEGF in colon cancer cells and demonstrated that HIF-1 is not necessary (11Mizukami Y. Li J. Zhang X. Zimmer M.A. Iliopoulos O. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although HIF-1 is generally considered to be a critical mediator of the hypoxic response (28Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M. Yu A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar), it appears not to be the only mediator. For example, others have shown that transcription factors including Sp-1 (29Kaluz S. Kaluzova M. Stanbridge E.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 917-922PubMed Google Scholar), AP-1 (30Minet E. Michel G. Mottet D. Piret J.P. Barbieux A. Raes M. Michiels C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), NF-κB (31Koong A.C. Chen E.Y. Mivechi N.F. Denko N.C. Stambrook P. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5273-5279PubMed Google Scholar), and Egr-1 (32Yan S.F. Fujita T. Lu J. Okada K. Shan Zou Y. Mackman N. Pinsky D.J. Stern D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) may also play a role in the regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes. We sought to characterize the HIF-1-independent signaling pathways that can regulate the hypoxic induction of VEGF in colon cancer. Our studies suggest a role for the activation of c-Myc by PI3K/Rho/ROCK signaling as an alternative, HIF-1-independent mechanism for the induction of VEGF in hypoxia. Because a synergistic effect between hypoxia and K-ras on VEGF expression has been observed, we were curious to define the roles that specific Ras effector pathways may play in hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia activated two major Ras effectors, ERK and PI3K/Akt. Although the ERK pathway appeared to regulate HIF-1, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 did not block VEGF mRNA expression or VEGF promoter activity in hypoxia. The effect of PD98059 may not be specific for ERK1/2, because it may potentially also inhibit ERK5, which has recently been shown to suppress the hypoxic induction of VEGF (33Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 34Sohn S.J. Sarvis B.K. Cado D. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43344-43351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, studies using dominant negative ERK1/2 also failed to demonstrate a role for ERK1/2 in the hypoxic induction of VEGF. In contrast, inhibition of PI3K strongly attenuated the hypoxic induction of VEGF. This appeared to be a transcriptional effect because PI3K inhibition suppressed VEGF promoter activity but did not alter VEGF mRNA stability. It should be noted that inhibition of PI3K did not suppress the induction of HIF-1α in hypoxia, indicating that the effects of PI3K on the regulation of VEGF are independent of HIF-1. Akt is a major effector of PI3K that can regulate the VEGF promoter in normoxic conditions (6Zhang X. Gaspard J.P. Chung D.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6050-6054PubMed Google Scholar), but, to our surprise, Akt was not an important regulator of VEGF in hypoxic conditions. Instead, we demonstrated that an alternative target of PI3K, the Rho/ROCK pathway, can mediate the hypoxic induction of VEGF. Hypoxia up-regulated the levels of GTP-bound Rho, and the combination of hypoxia and oncogenic K-ras was synergistic. Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 attenuated Rho activation in a dose-dependent manner. The precise mechanism of Rho activation remains to be defined, but one possible explanation could involve guanine exchange factors for Rho, because guanine exchange factors for Rho family GTPases have been shown to contain a pleckstrin homology domain that can interact with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (35Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Of note, preliminary microarray studies have indicated that hypoxia can up-regulate Rho-guanine exchange factor expression by 70.4% and down-regulate Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor by 64.8% in Caco2 cells (data not shown). Watnick et al. (27Watnick R.S. Cheng Y.N. Rangarajan A. Ince T.A. Weinberg R.A. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated the H-ras-mediated phosphorylation of c-Myc at Ser62 and Ser71 through a signaling cascade also involving PI3K, Rho, and ROCK. In our studies, phosphorylation of c-Myc at residues Thr58 and Ser62 was observed when Caco2 cells were incubated in hypoxia. This depended upon signaling through the PI3K/ROCK pathway, because the phosphorylation was almost completely attenuated by LY294002 and Y27632. Thus, this pathway can also explain the PI3K-mediated induction of VEGF in states of hypoxia. In contrast to previous studies with H-ras, our results demonstrated that the K-ras isoform that is most frequently mutated in human cancers enhanced signaling through this pathway. Thus far, there is no evidence showing a direct interaction between ROCK and c-Myc, and further studies are required to clarify whether ROCK can directly phosphorylate c-Myc or indirectly through another kinase. c-Myc can positively regulate VEGF expression (36Baudino T.A. McKay C. Pendeville-Samain H. Nilsson J.A. Maclean K.H. White E.L. Davis A.C. Ihle J.N. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2530-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In addition, c-Myc has been demonstrated to have a role in VEGF mRNA translation (37Mezquita P. Parghi S.S. Brandvold K.A. Ruddell A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 38Knies-Bamforth U.E. Fox S.B. Poulsom R. Evan G.I. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6563-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, there are some conflicting results, because inhibitory effects of c-Myc on VEGF expression have also been described (39Barr L.F. Campbell S.E. Diette G.B. Gabrielson E.W. Kim S. Shim H. Dang C.V. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 143-149PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated a role for Rho/ROCK signaling in the down-regulation of c-Myc by TGF-β signaling (40Kamaraju A.K. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1024-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We did not address the molecular events triggered by TGF-β but focused on the regulation by hypoxia. Our results indicated that c-Myc was activated by hypoxia, and we have identified a Myc/Max-binding element in the VEGF promoter that can up-regulate the gene in hypoxia. Its role was verified through the use of siRNAs specifically targeting c-Myc. Of note, c-Myc has been linked to tumor angiogenesis (41Ngo C.V. Gee M. Akhtar N. Yu D. Volpert O. Auerbach R. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar), and regulation of thrombospondin-1 expression is one possible mechanism (27Watnick R.S. Cheng Y.N. Rangarajan A. Ince T.A. Weinberg R.A. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that VEGF may also be an important target of c-Myc, particularly in conditions of hypoxia. This may be particularly relevant in colon cancer, because c-Myc is commonly overexpressed in this tumor type (42Erisman M.D. Rothberg P.G. Diehl R.E. Morse C.C. Spandorfer J.M. Astrin S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1969-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In summary, we present a novel alternative mechanism for the regulation of VEGF in hypoxic conditions (Fig. 6). This pathway does not depend upon HIF-1α and appears to be mediated through the activation of PI3K, Rho, ROCK, and c-Myc. Oncogenic K-ras can further enhance signaling through this pathway. These results demonstrate that hypoxia, an environmental stimulus frequently observed within solid tumors, can stimulate multiple signaling pathways that regulate tumor angiogenesis, some of which do not depend upon HIF-1.

SC displays numerous and various glycans, which are potential ligands for bacterial compounds. We first established that human SC (hSC) purified from colostrum (hSCcol) or produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (hSCrec) exhibits the same lectin reactivity. Both forms bind to Clostridium difficile toxin A and functionally protect polarized Caco-2 cell monolayers from the cytopathic effect of the toxin. The interaction is mediated by glycans present on hSC and involves galactose and sialic acid residues. hSCcol and hSCrec were also shown to bind enteropathogenic Escherichia coli adhesin intimin and to inhibit its infectivity on HEp-2 cells in a glycan-dependent manner as well. SC remained operative in the context of the whole secretory IgA molecule and can therefore enhance its Fab-mediated neutralizing properties. On the contrary, hSC did not interact with three different strains of rotavirus (RF, RRV, and SA11). Accordingly, infection of target MA104 cells with these rotavirus strains was not reduced in the presence of either form of hSC tested. Although not a universal mechanism, these findings identify hSC as a microbial scavenger contributing to the antipathogenic arsenal that protects the body epithelial surfaces.

This difficult task is achieved through a combination of innate or constitutive immunity (e.g. mucus, lysozyme, defensins, and lactoferrin) and by an induced specific immune response, which mainly relies at the antibody level on the secretion of secretory IgA (SIgA) 3The abbreviations used are: SIgA, secretory IgA; SC, secretory component; hSC, human SC; hSCcol, hSC purified from colostrum; hSCrec, recombinant hSC; pIgR, polymeric Ig receptor; pIgA, polymeric immunoglobulin A; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; TER, transepithelial electrical resistance; MEM, Earle's minimum essential medium; hSCdg, deglycosylated hSCrec; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; A/E, attachment and effacement; TLP, triple layer particle; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid; mAb, monoclonal antibody. (3Lamm M.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 311-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). SIgA, the major immunoglobulin found in secretions, consists of two or four monomeric IgA linked through a J chain in association with secretory component (SC) (4Woof J.M. Mestecky J. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 206: 64-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). SC is derived from the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) that ensures selective transport of polymeric IgA (pIgA) across the epithelium to the luminal side, where the complex is released through proteolytic cleavage (5Mostov K.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Once in secretions, SIgA binds to antigen(s) and thus prevents their attachment to epithelial surfaces, a process known as immune exclusion. SC plays a pivotal role in this process by conferring to SIgA a remarkable stability to acid and proteases (6Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by ensuring correct localization of the antibody within the lumen (7Phalipon A. Cardona A. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Edelman L. Sansonetti P.J. Corthésy B. Immunity. 2002; 17: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Besides SC comprised within the SIgA complex, a significant amount of SC is released as such in secretions (up to 25 μm in human milk) (8Cleveland M.G. Bakos M-A. Pyron D.L. Rajaraman S. Goldblum R.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 181-188PubMed Google Scholar). SC is constituted of five immunoglobulin-like domains decorated by carbohydrate residues, which constitute between 15 and 24% of the whole molecular mass and are dispatched among seven N-glycosylation sites of the polypeptide (9Hughes G.J. Reason A.J. Savoy L. Jaton J. Frutiger-Hughes S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The composition of these glycans includes bi- and triantennary or Lewis type structures constituting binding epitopes for bacterial adhesins (10Royle L. Roos A. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R. van Gijlswijk-Janssen D. el-Redwan R.M. Wilson I.A. Daha M.R. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20140-20153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The highly glycosylated nature of SC suggests that it might play an important role in the protection of the mucosal surfaces through nonspecific interactions with microbial antigens. The first evidence of such a role for SC was given by the observation that human SC (hSC) purified from colostrum binds to Clostridium difficile toxin A and limits its adherence on hamster brush border membranes (11Dallas S.D. Rolfe R.D. J. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 47: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Additionally, glycans associated to SIgA have been shown to interact with Helicobacter pylori (12Boren T. Falk P. Roth K.A. Larson G. Normark A. Science. 1993; 262: 1892-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). However, little is known as to the underlying mechanisms and whether this holds true for other gastrointestinal pathogens. Moreover, the relevance of binding data with respect to protection was not examined. Here, we provide biochemical characterization of the interaction between highly purified hSC, either obtained from colostrum or produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and (i) C. difficile toxin A, (ii) enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) adhesin intimin, and (iii) rotavirus triple layer particles. Further, using established in vitro infection models for each pathogen tested, we evaluate the biological significance of the observed interactions in terms of protective activity, substantiating the role of SC in innate immunity. Cells and Culture Conditions—Human colonic adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells (HTB-37) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5% glucose) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1% transferrin, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For establishment of polarized monolayers, Caco-2 cells cultivated to 80% confluence were seeded on Snapwell filters (diameter, 12 mm; pore size, 0.4 μm; Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2. The formation of a polarized Caco-2 cell monolayer at week 3 was established by morphology and monitoring of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) using a Millicell-ERS apparatus (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) (13Cottet S. Corthésy-Theulaz I. Spertini F. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33978-33986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HEp-2 cells (CCL-23) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Embryonic rhesus monkey kidney MA104 cells (CRL-2378.1) were grown in Earle's minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% humidified CO2 incubator. Proteins and Antibodies—Purified colostral hSC (hSCcol) was isolated from human milk as described (14Jones R.M. Schweikart F. Frutiger S. Jaton J.C. Hughes G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1429: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and recombinant hSC (hSCrec) was produced in a CHO cell clone (7Phalipon A. Cardona A. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Edelman L. Sansonetti P.J. Corthésy B. Immunity. 2002; 17: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Complete deglycosylation of hSCrec (hSCdg) was accomplished using N-Glycosidase F (EC 3.5.1.52; Roche Applied Science) as described previously (7Phalipon A. Cardona A. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Edelman L. Sansonetti P.J. Corthésy B. Immunity. 2002; 17: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Polymeric Ig receptor-containing Caco-2 whole cell extracts were prepared as described in Ref. 15Crottet P. Peitsch M.C. Servis C. Corthésy B. J. Biol.

Virology. 1996; 225: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were grown in a Celline-350 cartridge (Vitaris, Baar, Switzerland) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm folic acid, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The IgG antibody was purified by affinity chromatography on protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), whereas purified pIgA was prepared as described (20Favre L.I. Spertini F. Corthésy B. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fusion protein was generated by fusing the coding sequence for intimin from EPEC strain E2348/69 to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Following isolation by alkali lysis, bacterial DNA was used for PCR amplification. Primers were designed to hybridize to the bacteria pathogenicity island (GenBank™ number AF0022236) between nucleotides 26,610 and 26,635 (eaeA codons 588-596) and 27,845 and 27,873 (between eaeA and EscD). The PCR product was integrated into the plasmid vector pDEST™15 (Invitrogen) using the gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). Protein expression in the form of an N-terminal GST fusion was carried out in E. coli BL21-SI using 300 mm NaCl to induce gene expression. Recombinant protein was purified on Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Radiolabeling of C. difficile Toxin A—Toxin A was labeled by alkylation-reduction based on the protocol of Wallace and Corthésy (21Wallace C.J. Corthésy B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of toxin A was dissolved in 200 μl of 0.2 m sodium borate buffer (pH 9.0) containing 10 μg of NaBH4[3H] (specific activity 1,000 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Five additions of aqueous formaldehyde (Fluka, Wohlen, Switzerland) were made over a period of 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 0.1 m HCl. Excess of reagent was removed by passage on a PD-10 desalting prepacked column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and run in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Differential Deglycosylation of hSCrec—Treatment of hSCrec with carbohydrate-specific enzymes, including Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (EC 3.2.1.18; Roche Applied Science), β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23; Roche Applied Science), and α-1-(2,3,4)-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51; Sigma) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the exception that the denaturation step was omitted, and exposure of hSCrec to the different enzymes was for 4 h. Lectin Blotting—200 ng of purified hSCcol, hSCrec, and hSCdg were subjected to PAGE on 8% resolving gels under denaturing (0.1% SDS) and reducing (0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT)) conditions. Analysis of carbohydrate structures on hSCcol, hSCrec, and hSCdg was done using the DIG glycan differentiation kit from Roche Applied Science, which comprises lectins Datura stramonium agglutinin, Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, Maackia amurensis agglutinin, Sambucus nigra agglutinin, and peanut agglutinin. Reactivity toward biotinylated Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfer onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore), glycan detection was performed using the procedures and reagents provided in the kit. Exposure of Polarized Monolayers to Toxin A and SC—The sensitivity of Caco-2 monolayers to C. difficile toxin A was compared with that of T84 monolayers (17Stubbe H. Berdoz J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) by incubating Transwell filters with 3 × 10-10 m toxin A for 3 h and measuring TER (13Cottet S. Corthésy-Theulaz I. Spertini F. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33978-33986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In order to assess SC-mediated protection as a function of the amounts and presence of glycans, 3 × 10-10 m toxin A was preincubated with a range (1 nm to 1 μm) of hSCcol, hSCrec, or hSCdg for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 50 μl. Following apical administration in a final volume of 0.8 ml, TER were measured at 3 h using three independent replicate filters per experiment. To evaluate binding inhibition, radiolabeled toxin A was preincubated with various amounts of hSCcol, hSCrec, or hSCdg and added to the apical cell compartment, and filters were recovered after 3 h and finally placed in vials for scintillation counting (model 2500TR; Packard Instrument Co.). Controls were performed using protective pIgA PCG4 specific for toxin A (17Stubbe H. Berdoz J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The shielding effect of hSC preparations was examined upon the addition of increasing concentrations of the proteins to Caco-2 cell monolayers for 1 h, three washes with PBS, and subsequent incubation with 3 × 10-10 m toxin A. To evaluate the binding potential of hSC on polarized Caco-2 cells, 1 × 10-8 m hSCrec and hSCdg was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C on the cells in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Supernatants and sequential washes were recovered, and cells were collected in lysis buffer (15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 5% protease inhibitors Complete™ (Roche Applied Science)). The concentration of hSC was then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described (22Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14220-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the integrity of the protein was verified by Western blot analysis. SC Immunoblotting and Overlay Assay—Native or glycosidase-treated hSC (200 ng) as well as pIgR (70 ng) in Caco-2 cell extracts were subjected to PAGE on 8% resolving gels under denaturing (0.1% SDS) and nonreducing conditions, these latter allowing the recovery of both proteins with preserved pIgA binding properties after transfer onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (15Crottet P. Peitsch M.C. Servis C. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31445-31455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were saturated by incubation in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad); PBS-T), and the membrane was probed for 1 h at room temperature with the following reagents: toxin A at 500 ng/ml in PBS-T and GST-intimin at 200 ng/ml in PBS-T. Membranes were washed four times for 5 min in PBS-T. Toxin A was detected using PCG4 mAb (1:2,000 dilution in 0.5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T) (17Stubbe H. Berdoz J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (1:5,000; Sigma). GST-intimin was detected using mAb against GST (1:1,000 dilution in 0.5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), followed by goat antimouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (1:500; Sigma). Membranes were treated with the chemiluminescence reagent from Amersham Biosciences and exposed to autoradiography films (Konica, Hohenbrunn, Germany). Microwell Binding Assay—The wells of Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates were coated with 200 ng of hSCrec or hSCdg in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.6) for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were blocked with 200 μl of PBS-T containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. Toxin A (500 ng/ml) or GST-intimin (200 ng/ml) in 100 μl of PBS were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS-T, binding was detected using specific antibodies as for the overlay assay above and 1,2-phenylenediamine as a chromogene. Reactions were stopped with one volume of 2 m H2SO4, and the optical density was measured at 492 nm using 620 nm as reference wavelength. For reduction of coated proteins, DTT at the indicated final concentrations (Figs. 4 and 5) was added for 15 min prior to the blocking step.FIGURE 5The neutralizing property of hSC toward EPEC is mediated by direct interaction with the adhesion molecule intimin. A, binding experiments performed with HEp-2 cells incubated with wild type (wt) EPEC and the intimin deletion mutant (Int- EPEC). After overnight infection with 1 × 105 EPEC in the presence or absence of 6 μm hSCrec, cell-bound bacteria were plated for numbering. B, imaging by fluorescence microscopy of HEp-2 cells obtained after infection with 1 × 105 EPEC mixed with hSCrec or hSCdg for 3 h. The arrowheads indicate A/E lesions typical of infection. C, quantification in 50 different fields of the effect of hSCrec and hSCdg on A/E lesion occurrence. Data are expressed as a percentage of the value obtained without hSC (100%). D, hSCrec or hSCdg coated in wells of microtiter plates was treated with increasing concentrations of DTT prior to the addition of intimin-GST. SC-intimin-GST interaction was detected with anti-GST antiserum. Heat-treated hSCrec or hSCdg was coated in ELISA plates, and binding of intimin was tested as before. E, hSCrec and pIgR preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, blotted onto membranes, and incubated with E. coli intimin-GST, followed by detection with anti-GST.

Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4310-4317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); int-EPEC) in the presence of 6 μm hSCrec or without hSCrec in controls. Following four washes with PBS, HEp-2 cells were lysed in distilled water, and associated bacteria were plated onto LB-agar plates at serial dilutions for colony counting. Attachment/Effacement (A/E) Assay—HEp-2 cells (105 cells/ml) were seeded into 4-well microscope slides (Chamber Slide™, LabTek, Nalge Nunc International) and grown for 16 h. EPEC strain E2348/69 was cultivated overnight in brain-heart infusion medium and washed in PBS, and 1 × 105 colony-forming units were added to 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium buffered with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). EPEC were preincubated for 30 min with hSCrec or hSCdg (1.2-12 μm) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% relative humidity prior to the addition to HEp-2 cells. HEp-2 cells were further incubated for 3 h, washed three times with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad) in PBS, and actin was stained with phalloidin coupled with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (Sigma) to quantify A/E lesions (24Knutton S. Baldwin T. Williams P.H. McNeish A.S. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1290-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by microscopic observation. Cells harboring at least one colony with established A/E were counted as a positive A/E event. Microscopic observations were done with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 equipped with a Zeiss ×63 LD Achroplan objective (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Data are expressed as a percentage of untreated control for ease of comparison. Virus Propagation and Purification—The bovine RF strain, the simian SA11 strain, and the rhesus RRV strain were propagated in MA104 cells in the presence of trypsin as described previously (25Ciarlet M. Estes M.K. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Virus titers present in the lysed cell supernatant were determined by plaque assay and expressed as plaque-forming units/ml. For purification, the viral suspensions were frozen once at -20 °C and then submitted to centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The virus pellets were resuspended in 20 mm PIPES buffer (pH 6.6), and the remaining lipids were extracted with 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (Freon 113). The viral solution was complemented with CsCl to achieve a homogeneous density of 1.369 g/ml and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C. The band located at 1.36 mg/ml corresponding to triple layer particles (TLP) was recovered from the CsCl gradient and conserved at 4 °C until further use. For biochemical analyses, purified rotavirus solutions were desalted immediately before use by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 coarse beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Uptima; Interchim, Montluçon, France). ELISA and Overlay Assay for SC-Virus Interaction—For ELISA, 96-well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 200 ng of purified TLP rotavirus strains (RF, SA11, and RRV) in a final volume of 200 μl of 0.1 m carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3). Wells were blocked with 250 μl of PBS-T containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Diverse dilutions of hSCrec or hSCdg (60-600 nm) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 100 μl of PBS-T. The VP6-specific IgA 7D9 was used as a positive control. After extensive washing in PBS-T, bound ligands were detected with antibodies to hSC (22Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14220-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or mouse pIgA (20Favre L.I. Spertini F. Corthésy B. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the overlay assay, 50 ng of purified TLP rotavirus strains (RF, SA11, and RRV) were blotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes and blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS-T containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then incubated for 4 h at room temperature with various concentrations (0.1-1 μm) of hSCrec or hSCdg or pIgA 7D9 (2 nm). After extensive washing in PBS-T, bound ligands were detected as in ELISA, and the presence of adsorbed rotaviruses was confirmed using a sheep anti-rotavirus serum (a gift from Dr. I. Schwartz-Cornil, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, France). Virus Infectivity Assay—The virus infectivity assay was adapted from the cytopathic effect assay developed by Marchetti et al. (26Marchetti M. Longhi C. Conte M.P. Pisani S. Valenti P. Seganti L. Antiviral Res. 1996; 29: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, MA104 cells were grown in 96-well tissue culture microplates for 2 days, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated for 3 h with Earle's MEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 μg/ml trypsin, and 60 nm hSCrec or 60 nm hSCdg (hSC-EMEM). Cells were then infected with serial dilutions of the viral suspension for 1 h at 37 °C in hSC-EMEM. After removal of the viral inoculum, cells were incubated for 48 h in hSC-EMEM, and the cytopathic effect induced by rotavirus was measured by neutral red dye uptake. The measurement of infection was defined as the ratio of experimental optical density (OD) to noninfected OD. In order to benefit from a continuous source of pure SC capable of replacing hSCcol that can be obtained in limited amounts only, we produced hSCrec in CHO cells. We have previously shown at the biochemical level that hSCrec binds equally well to pIgA as hSCcol (6Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When used in in vitro and in vivo models of infection, hSCrec proved a valid tool to unravel several novel facets of the protein associated with pIgA or as a free polypeptide (7Phalipon A. Cardona A. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Edelman L. Sansonetti P.J. Corthésy B. Immunity. 2002; 17: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 27Lu L. Lamm M.E. Li H. Corthésy B.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 3026-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, a comparison of the respective glycosylation profiles was not performed. Since the aim of the work reported herein is to evaluate the intrinsic protective properties of SC and explore whether glycosylation plays a role in the process, we first mapped the lectin reactivity of hSCcol and hSCrec. Using a battery of lectins, we found that all major glycans that have previously been reported to be present on native hSC (9Hughes G.J. Reason A.J. Savoy L. Jaton J. Frutiger-Hughes S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) could be identically detected on the two proteins (Fig. 1). Both hSCcol and hSCrec were shown to display galactose-β(1-4)-N-acetylglucosamine (D. stramonium agglutinin-positive), α(1-3) terminally linked mannose (G. nivalis agglutinin-positive), terminally linked sialic acid in α(2-3) linkage to galactose (M. amurensis agglutinin-positive) or α(2-6) linkage to galactose (S. nigra agglutinin-positive), and α(1-2)-linked fucose residues (U. europaeus agglutinin-1-positive). As expected, no lectin binding was detected to hSCdg, and no reactivity with peanut agglutinin-recognizing galactose β (1-3)-N-acetylgalactosamine could be observed (data not shown). To investigate new properties of hSC and further compare both sources of protein, in vitro models were used. As a mimic of the intestinal epithelium, Caco-2 cells were grown on Transwell filters to form monolayers whose TER indicates both integrity and polarization. Upon incubation of cells with 0.3 nm C. difficile toxin A, a drastic and irreversible drop of TER values was observed within the first 3 h of challenge, indicating disruption of the tight Caco-2 cell monolayer. This cytopathic effect could be neutralized in a dose-dependent manner upon preincubation of the toxin A with increasing concentrations of hSC, resulting in maintenance of TER as observed with specific pIgA PCG4 (17Stubbe H.

Recently, an important role for catalytically competent peroxidase form of pentacoordinate cytochrome c (cyt c) in a complex with a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), has been demonstrated during execution of the apoptotic program. Because the cyt c·CL complex acts as CL oxygenase and selectively oxidizes CL in apoptotic cells in a reaction dependent on the generation of protein-derived (tyrosyl) radicals, we hypothesized that binding and nitrosylation of cyt c regulates CL oxidation. Here we demonstrate by low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy that CL facilitated interactions of ferro- and ferri-states of cyt c with NO and NO–, respectively, to yield a mixture of penta- and hexa-coordinate nitrosylated cyt c. In the nitrosylated cyt c·CL complex, NO chemically reacted with H2O2-activated peroxidase intermediates resulting in their reduction. A dose-dependent quenching of H2O2-induced protein-derived radicals by NO donors was shown using direct electron paramagnetic resonance measurements as well as immuno-spin trapping with antibodies against protein 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide-nitrone adducts. In the presence of NO donors, H2O2-induced oligomeric forms of cyt c positively stained for 3-nitrotyrosine confirming the reactivity of NO toward tyrosyl radicals of cyt c. Interaction of NO with the cyt c·CL complex inhibited its peroxidase activity with three different substrates: CL, etoposide, and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Given the importance of CL oxidation in apoptosis, mass spectrometry analysis was utilized to assess the effects of NO on oxidation of 1,1′2,2′-tertalinoleoyl cardiolipin. NO effectively inhibited 1,1′2,2′-tertalinoleoyl cardiolipin oxidation catalyzed by the peroxidase activity of cyt c. Thus, NO can act as a regulator of peroxidase activity of cyt c·CL complexes.

The electron transporting function of cyt c is effectively accommodated by its hexa-coordinate arrangement of heme iron, whereby Met80 and His18 represent the two axial ligands (1Oellerich S. Wackerbarth H. Hindelbrandt P. J. Phys. Chem. 2002; 106: 6566-6580Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The hexacoordinate organization of heme-iron, however, hinders binding and chemical interactions of cyt c with small molecules such as NO, O2, CO, and H2O2; therefore cyt c in solution exhibits only a marginal peroxidase activity (2Cooper C.E.

However, the studies were performed in model systems under conditions and/or treatments hardly compatible with known physiological or pathophysiological roles of cyt c. NO was shown to play an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration (16Goldenthal M.J. Marin-Garcia J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 262: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). One established mechanism of this regulatory function is reversible inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase (17Brunori M. Giuffre A. Forte E. Mastronicola D. Barone M.C. Sarti P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The discovery of mitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase emphasized the significance of NO in mitochondrial functions (18Ghafourifar P. Cadenas E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 190-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 19Haynes V. Elfering S. Traaseth N. Giulivi C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2004; 36: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although NO can also reach mitochondria from external sources because of its hydrophobic nature and facile diffusion in biomembranes (20Radi R.

An increased production of NO has been demonstrated during early stages of apoptosis indicating its potential involvement in regulation of programmed cell death (22Schonhoff C.M. Gaston B.

Res. 2004; 38: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One possible pathway is the interactions of NO with superoxide generated by disrupted electron transport yielding a very reactive oxidant, peroxynitrite, that may cause mitochondrial damage during apoptosis (20Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Quijano C. Castro L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1451-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 21Rubbo H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Kalyanaraman B. Barnes S.

However, the protective effects of NO in apoptosis also were demonstrated (25Kim P.K. Zamora R. Petrosko P. Billiar T.R. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 1421-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Our previous work has identified CL as a physiologically relevant regulator of peroxidase activity of cyt c markedly enhanced during apoptosis (5Kagan V.E. Tyurin V.A. Jiang J. Tyurina Y.Y. Ritov V.B. Amoscato A.A. Osipov A.N. Belikova N.A. Kapralov A.A. Kini V. Vlasova I.I. Zhao Q. Zou M. Di P. Svistunenko D.A. Kurnikov I.V. Borisenko G.G. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Specific peroxidation of CL catalyzed by the peroxidase activity of CL-bound cyt c molecules contributes to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the release of proapoptotic factors from the intermembrane space of mitochondria into the cytosol, a critical step in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The cyt c·CL complex has very different structural and catalytic properties than cyt c in solution. Therefore its interactions with NO may differ substantially from those of isolated cyt c. We were specifically interested in the NO regulation of peroxidase activity of cyt c·CL complex because of its role in induction of apoptosis. Although several recent studies indicate that CL-induced unfolding of cyt c is associated with the formation of its penta-coordinate state (5Kagan V.E. Tyurin V.A. Jiang J. Tyurina Y.Y. Ritov V.B. Amoscato A.A. Osipov A.N. Belikova N.A. Kapralov A.A. Kini V. Vlasova I.I. Zhao Q. Zou M. Di P. Svistunenko D.A. Kurnikov I.V. Borisenko G.G. Nat. Chem.

Here we report, for the first time, that CL facilitates the binding and chemical interactions of NO with cyt c and its reactive intermediates formed in the presence of H2O2. Thus, NO can act as a regulator of the H2O2-dependent peroxidase activity of the cyt c·CL complex. Horse heart cytochrome c (type C-7752), potassium phosphate, HEPES-Na, diethylentriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), ascorbate, etoposide (VP16, demethylepipodophyllotoxin-ethylediene-glucopyranoside), hydrogen peroxide, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB), 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), microperoxidase 11 (MP-11), phospholipase A2, and catalase were from Sigma-Aldrich. Amplex Red (N-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). HPLC grade solvents, fetal bovine serum, RPMI 1640 with and without phenol red, phosphate-buffered saline were purchased from Invitrogen. 1,1′2,2′-tetraoleoyl cardiolipin (TOCL), 1,1′2,2′-tertalinoleoyl cardiolipin (TLCL), and dioleoyl-l-α-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Albaster, AL). Anti-DMPO polyclonal antibody was from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and chemiluminescent substrate for the detection of alkaline phosphatase Lumi-Phos™ WB was purchased from Pierce. All of the buffers used contained 100 μm DTPA. The NO donors (Z)-1-[N-3-aminopropyl)-N-(n-propyl) amino] diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (PAPANONOate), 1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrozohydrazine (diethylamine NONOate; DEANOate), and anti-nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibody were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). The nitroxyl anion donor Angeli's salt was synthesized as described in Ref. 26Smith P.A.S. Hein G.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 5731-5740Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar. For reduction of cyt c to its ferrous form, 10 mm ascorbate was added to the solution of cyt c (4 mm) in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 μm DTPA and incubated for 20 min. The solution was then passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (HiTrap Desalting, 1.6 × 2.5 cm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The concentration of cyt c was determined spectrophotometrically (15Ascenzi P. Coletta M. Santucci R. Polizio F. Desideri A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 53: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Liposomes containing DOPC and cardiolipin were prepared by sonication of lipids suspension under N2 and used immediately after preparation. The optical measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu UV160U spectrophotometer; EPR spectra were recorded on a JEOL-REIX spectrometer. All of the original spectra are prototypical of at least three experiments. NO flux (concentration of NO produced in unit of time) was calculated according to the following equation, FluxNO=(ln2/t1/2)×[NOate]×NP×exp(−(ln2/t1/2)∗t) (Eq. 1) where [NOate] indicates the NO donor concentration, t indicates the time of the experiment, and NP indicates moles NO per moles of NO donor. DEANOate spontaneously released NP = 1.5 mol of NO/mol of donor molecule with a t½ of 16 min at 22–25 °C, and PAPANONOate spontaneously released NP = 2 mol of NO/mol of donor molecule with a t½ of 15 min at 37 °C. 1 mol of HNO was released per mol of Angeli's salt with a t½ of 17 min. NO concentration in the solution was estimated from the concentration of NO donor, assuming that NO oxidizes at a normal oxygen concentration ([O2] = 220 μm) via bimolecular process with a rate constant kNOox = 103 (m–1 s–1) (24Beckman J.C. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wink D.A. Darbyshire J.F. Nims R.W. Saavedra J.E. Ford P.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The corresponding equation is as follows, [NO]=FluxNO/kNOox (Eq. 2) where FluxNO was computed from Equation 1. The inhibition constant (IC50) was determined as the concentration of an NO donor (or Angeli's salt) that caused a 2-fold decrease of the cyt c activity. Corresponding half-inhibiting NO concentration was estimated from IC50 of NO donor according to Equation 2. Nitrosylation of cyt c was performed in the presence of DOPC·TOCL liposomes with different content of CL (total lipid, 8 mm) in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. For cyt c nitrosylation by NO donors, ferro-cyt c (100 μm) was incubated for 15 min with liposomes in the presence of 500 μm NO donor (DEANOate at room temperature or PAPANONOate at 37 °C) under N2. When Angeli's salt (750 μm) was used as a donor of nitroxyl (HNO, pKa = 11.4), it was incubated with ferri-cyt c (200 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen. The spectra were recorded at 77 K under the following instrumental settings: center field, 3200 G; scan range, 500 G; modulation amplitude, 5 G; microwave power, 10 milliwatt; time constant, 0.1 s; scan time, 4 min; receiver gain, 5 × 102. EPR spectra of protein-derived radicals were measured 20s after the addition of H2O2 (1 mm) to cyt c (200 μm) preincubated with DOPC·TOCL liposomes (1:1, total lipid 5 mm) for 1 min at room temperature. EPR spectra from frozen samples were detected at 77 K under the following conditions: center field, 3230 G; sweep width, 100 G; field modulation, 5 G; microwave power, 1 milliwatt; receiver gain, 2 × 103; time constant, 0.1 s; time scan, 4 min. Cyt c (5 μm) was incubated for 5 min with DOPC·TOCL liposomes (1:1; total lipid, 200 μm) in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 μm DTPA. Then 100 μm DEANOate was added, and the spectra were recorded in time intervals of 2 min (n = 10). Etoposide-based Assay—EPR spectra of etoposide phenoxyl radical were recorded at 25 °C in gas-permeable Teflon tubing (inner diameter, 0.8 mm; thickness, 0.013; Alpha Wire Corp., Elizabeth, NJ). The tubing (length, ∼6 cm) was filled with 60 μl of sample, double-folded, and placed in an open 3.0-mm-internal diameter EPR quartz tube. The spectra were recorded under the following EPR conditions: center field, 3350 G; sweep width, 50 G; microwave power, 10 milliwatt; field modulation, 0.5 G; receiver gain, 103; time constant, 0.03 s; scan time, 8 min. The time course of etoposide radical signal was obtained by repeated scanning of the field corresponding to a part of the EPR signal (sweep width, 5 G; the other instrumental conditions were the same). To obtain a solution of etoposide phenoxyl radicals free of the radical-generating system, horseradish peroxidase (40 μg/ml) was incubated with etoposide (200 μm) and H2O2 (100 μm) for 4 min; then the solution was quickly passed through an Amicon Ultra PL-30 filter (Millipore Co., France). The filtrate containing etoposide phenoxyl radicals was used immediately to monitor its interactions with reactive nitrogen species. Peroxidase-catalyzed Oxidation—Peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of DAB was monitored spectrophotometrically (absorbance at 470 nm) for 10 min in 20 mm HEPES-Na buffer at room temperature (28Babbs C.F. Salaris S.C. Turek J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H123-H129PubMed Google Scholar). Cyt c-Fe(III) (30 μm) was incubated with DOPC·TOCL liposomes in the presence of H2O2 (200 μm each 15 min). The peroxidase reaction was stopped by 1400 units/ml catalase. Then the loading buffer was added, and the samples were immediately loaded onto a gel. SDS-PAGE was run using 12.5% running gel and 4% stacking gel as described in Ref. 29Laemmli M. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205522) Google Scholar. The gels were stained with Coomassie R-250 Brilliant Blue. For blotting, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was incubated with anti-DMPO or anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies. Incubation with anti-DMPO antibodies was performed essentially as described in Ref. 30Ramirez D.C. Mason R.P. Curr. Protocols Toxicol. 2005; : 17.7.1-17.7.16Google Scholar. In the case of anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies, nonspecific binding was blocked by the incubation in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies (1:5000 in TBS-T with 1% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. After washing five times with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBS-T, the bands were visualized using chemiluminescent substrate for the detection of alkaline phosphatase, Lumi-Phos™ WB. NO was quantitated amperometrically using a NO-selective electrode (Iso-NO; 2-mm shielded sensor: WPI, Sarasota, FL). The samples were incubated at room temperature in a reaction chamber under continuous stirring. Changes in current output (pA) were recorded, and NO was quantified using a standard curve generated by the addition of NaNO2 in nitrite-free water under reducing conditions (KI/H2SO4). Lipids were extracted from liposomes using the Folch procedure (31Folch J. Lees M. Sloan-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were separated and analyzed by HPTLC (high performance thin layer chromatography) as previously described (32Kagan V.E. Ritov V.B. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 108: 71-87PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid phosphorus was determined as reported in Ref. 33Bottcher C.J.F. Van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (843) Google Scholar. Phospholipid hydroperoxides were determined by fluorescence HPLC of products formed in MP-11-catalyzed reactions with a fluorogenic substrate, Amplex Red, according to our newly developed protocol (5Kagan V.E. Tyurin V.A. Jiang J. Tyurina Y.Y. Ritov V.B. Amoscato A.A. Osipov A.N. Belikova N.A. Kapralov A.A. Kini V. Vlasova I.I. Zhao Q. Zou M. Di P. Svistunenko D.A. Kurnikov I.V. Borisenko G.G. Nat. Chem.

Oxidized phospholipids were hydrolyzed by porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (0.2 unit/μl) in 25 mm phosphate buffer containing 1.0 mm Ca2+, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm SDS (pH 8.0 at room temperature for 30 min). After that, 50 μm Amplex Red and MP-11 (1.0 μg/μl) were added, and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 40 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of a stop reagent (10 mm HCl, 4 mm butylated hydroxytoluene in ethanol). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, aliquots of supernatant (5 μl) were injected into Eclipse XDB-C18 column (5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm). The mobile phase was composed of 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, methanol (60:40, v/v). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The resorufin (an Amplex Red oxidation product) fluorescence was measured at 590 nm after excitation at 560 nm. Shimadzu LC-100AT vp HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector (RF-10Axl) and an autosampler (SIL-10AD vp) was used. The data were processed and stored in digital form with Class-VP software. ESI (electrospray ionization) tandem mass spectrometry of TLCL oxidation products was performed by direct infusion into a Finnigan MAT TSQ 70 mass spectrometer with a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry analyzer (Thermo Electron Co.). Sheath flow was adjusted to 5 μl/min, and the solvent consisted of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). The electrospray probe was operated at a voltage differential of –3.5 kV in the negative ion mode. Mass spectra for doubly and singly charged CL were obtained by scanning in the range of 400–950 and 1200–1800 m/z, respectively, every 1–1.5 s and summing individual spectra. The source temperature was maintained at 70 °C. The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. of at least triplicate determinations. Changes in variables were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. The differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Cyt c Heme Nitrosylation—We used low temperature (77 K) EPR spectroscopy to study the effects of CL on nitrosylation of cyt c. Only weak predominantly hexa-coordinate EPR signal was observed from a system in which cyt c-Fe(II) and an NO donor, DEANOate, were incubated with DOPC liposomes lacking TOCL. The spectrum of hexacoordinate NO-heme complex showed the characteristic shape with rhombic symmetry around the paramagnetic center. There were peaks at g = 2.068 and 1.986 and, in between, an “inverted S shape” (35Kon H. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4350-4357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the broadness of the peaks and their overlapping, the g values must be considered only as tentative. Incubation of ferro-cyt c with DOPC liposomes containing TOCL (at 1:1 molar ratio) in the presence of DEANOate resulted in a marked increase of the amount of nitrosylated cyt c, as well as the appearance of a signal from a penta-coordinate heme-iron complex. In the presence of TOCL, a new three-line signal with a splitting of 17 G emerged at g = 2.009, and a new low field peak also appeared at g =∼2.094. Based on the results presented on Fig. 1, the percentage of penta-coordinate cyt c can be estimated by subtraction of spectrum a from spectrum b or c. The estimate shows that ∼20% of NO-heme was penta-coordinate at cyt c:TOCL = 15 (TOCL = 1.5 mm, Fig. 1A, panel b), and its content increased to more than 40% at cyt c:TOCL = 40 (TOCL = 4 mm, Fig. 1A, panel c). Similarly, the incubation of a nitroxyl donor, Angeli's salt (26Smith P.A.S. Hein G.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960; 82: 5731-5740Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36Stoyanovsky D.A. Schor N.F. Nylander K.D. Salama G. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with ferri-cyt c·TOCL complexes caused the formation of typical EPR signals of heme-Fe(II)-nitrosylated species (Fig. 1B). In this case too, the increased amount of nitrosylated cyt c with markedly expressed signal of its penta-coordinate form was observed in the presence of TOCL (Fig. 1B, panels b–d). The complex of NO with ferri-cyt c is not detectable by EPR because the NO·ferri-porphyrin complex is EPR silent (37Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, optical absorption spectroscopy readily detected the interaction of cyt c-Fe(III) with NO (Fig. 2). The spectrum of fe"
https://openalex.org/W2070789450,"Uncoupling proteins have been ascribed a role in defense against oxidative stress, particularly by being activated by products of oxidative stress such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). We have investigated here the ability of HNE to activate UCP1. Using brown fat mitochondria from UCP1+/+ and UCP1–/– mice to allow for identification of UCP1-dependent effects, we found that HNE could neither (re)activate purine nucleotide-inhibited UCP1, nor induce additional activation of innately active UCP1. The aldehyde nonenal had a (re)activating effect only if converted to the corresponding fatty acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase; the presence of a carboxyl group was thus an absolute requirement for (re)activation. The UCP1-dependent proton leak was not increased by HNE but HNE changed basal proton leak characteristics in a UCP1-independent manner. In agreement with the in vitro results, we found, as compared with UCP1+/+ mice, no increase in HNE/protein adducts in brown fat mitochondria isolated from UCP1–/– mice, irrespective of whether they were adapted to thermoneutral temperature (30 °C) or to the cold (4 °C). The absence of oxidative damage in UCP1–/– mitochondria was not due to enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes. Thus, HNE did not affect UCP1 activity, and UCP1 would appear not to be physiologically involved in defense against oxidative stress. Additionally, it was concluded that at least in brown adipose tissue, conditions of high mitochondrial membrane potential, high oxygen tension, and high substrate supply do not necessarily lead to increased oxidative damage.

A generally accepted view of the molecular mechanism of UCP1 function and regulation has not been achieved (reviewed in Refs. 1Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem.

Roles for purine nucleotides as inhibitors and for fatty acids as (re)activators are generally accepted, but the issue has been raised as to whether alternative physiological activators exist and/or whether certain cofactors are necessary for UCP1 activity. These discussions may also be relevant concerning the phylogenetically related mitochondrial membrane proteins UCP2 and UCP3 (for review, see Refs. 5Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Exp.

EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Particularly, to explain the lack of constitutive uncoupling activity of uncoupling proteins reconstituted in liposomes, or the lack of basal uncoupling (inhibitable by GDP) in skeletal muscle mitochondria expressing UCP3 (9Cadenas S. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that non-fatty acid cofactors are required for activation, ubiquinone (10Echtay K.S.

Although the necessity for additional activators has been questioned in reconstituted systems (12Jaburek M. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25825-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), in isolated mitochondria (13Couplan E. del Mar Gonzalez-Barroso M. Alves-Guerra M.C. Ricquier D.

A series of compounds that are formed downstream of superoxide interaction with the mitochondrial membrane have been proposed to be the true activators of UCPs (or to be directly involved in the uncoupling mechanism). These include carbon-centered radicals (15Murphy M.P. Echtay K.S. Blaikie F.H. Asin-Cayuela J. Cocheme H.M. Green K. Buckingham J.A. Taylor E.R. Hurrell F. Hughes G. Miwa S. Cooper C.E.

The question of a cofactor necessity for UCP function has thus been linked to the earlier suggestion that UCP activity can control the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (18Negre-Salvayre A. Hirtz C. Carrera G. Cazenave R. Troly M. Salvayre R. Penicaud L. Casteilla L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). A much discussed (8Nedergaard J. Ricquier D. Kozak L.P. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) scheme has been proposed where conditions leading to increased oxygen stress lead to superoxide production, which results in the formation of compounds such as HNE that could activate UCPs. This should lower the mitochondrial membrane potential and, consequently, diminish the risk of oxidative damage (3Brand M.D. Affourtit C. Esteves T.C. Green K. Lambert A.J. Miwa S. Pakay J.L. Parker N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 6Esteves T.C. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1709: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Due to the broad implications of this hypothesis for pathological processes, we have here studied the proposed interaction between HNE and the originally identified uncoupling protein UCP1. The choice of UCP1 was made because it is uncontroversial that UCP1 functions as an uncoupling protein; the proton leak associated with UCP1 is thus easily observable. We have used the availability of UCP1-ablated mice (19Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) to enable us to dissociate the UCP1-dependent effects of HNE from UCP1-independent effects, which may occur in the mitochondria. We conclude that the reported HNE effects on brown fat mitochondria are UCP1-independent. In vivo studies confirm that no protective effect of UCP1 can be identified physiologically. Our results may have significance for the understanding of the regulation not only of UCP1 but also of the other uncoupling proteins and may also contribute to the identification of physiological conditions associated with the increased risk of oxidative damage. Animals—UCP1-ablated mice (progeny of those described in Ref. 19Enerbäck S. Jacobsson A. Simpson E.M. Guerra C. Yamashita H. Harper M.-E. Kozak L.P. Nature. 1997; 387: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) were backcrossed to C57Bl/6 mice for 10 generations and after intercrossing were maintained as UCP1–/– and UCP1+/+ strains. The mice were fed ad libitum (R70 Standard Diet, Lactamin), had free access to water, and were kept on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle, routinely at normal (24 °C) animal house temperature. Adult (8–12-week-old) male mice were routinely used for the experiments. For experiments on warm-acclimated animals, UCP1–/– and UCP1+/+ adult male mice were divided into age- (7–8-week-old) and body weight (23–24 g)-matched groups, one per cage, and acclimated at 30 °C (i.e. thermoneutral temperature for both wild-type and UCP1-ablated mice) 4H. Feldmann, B. Cannon, and J. Nedergaard, unpublished observations. for at least 1 month before the start of the experiment. For experiments on cold-acclimated animals, UCP1+/+ and UCP1–/– adult male mice were similarly either acclimated (one per cage) at 24 °C or successively acclimated to cold by first placing them at 18 °C for 4 weeks with the following 4 weeks at 4 °C (the intermediate 18 °C step was required to allow for survival of the UCP1–/– animals at 4 °C (20Golozoubova V. Hohtola E. Matthias A. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2048-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar)). The experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the North Stockholm region. Mitochondrial Preparation—Brown fat mitochondria were prepared principally as described (21Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 155: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications (22Shabalina I.G. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38236-38248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentration was measured using the fluorescamine method (23Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar), and the suspensions were diluted to stock concentrations of 25 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml of 125 mm sucrose with 0.2% (1% in experiments with warm-acclimated mice) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA). Oxygen Consumption—Isolated mitochondria, at final concentrations of 0.5 or 0.3 mg (indicated in figure legends) of mitochondrial protein/ml, were added to 1.1 ml of a continuously stirred incubation medium consisting of 125 mm sucrose, 20 mm K+-Tes (pH 7.2), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm potassium Pi, and 1.3 μg of oligomycin/ml. The substrates were 5 mm pyruvate plus 3 mm malate or 5 mm glycerol 3-phosphate in the presence of 2 μg of rotenone/ml. UCP1–/– and UCP1+/+ brown fat mitochondria exhibit identical oxidative capacities, estimated as maximal rates of FCCP-stimulated respiration (22Shabalina I.G. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38236-38248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The final concentration of fatty acid-free BSA was adjusted to 0.1% (w/v) for oxygen consumption measurements performed in mitochondria respiring on pyruvate plus malate. This was increased to 1% (w/v) in experiments where glycerol 3-phosphate was used as substrate (as indicated) (i.e. similarly to Ref. 24Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4103-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption rates were monitored with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.) in a sealed chamber at 37 °C, as described (22Shabalina I.G. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38236-38248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Data for GDP concentration-response curves were analyzed with the general fit option of the KaleidaGraph application for Macintosh for adherence to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, V(x) = Vmax – ΔVmax · (x/(Km + x)), where x is the concentration of GDP. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Measurements were performed in brown fat mitochondria with the dye safranin O (25Akerman K.E. Wikstrom M.K. FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were incubated with 2 μg/ml oligomycin, 5 μm safranin, 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA, and 5 mm glycerol 3-phosphate in the presence of 2 μg of rotenone/ml. The changes in absorbance of safranin O were followed at 37 °C in an Aminco DW-2 dual-wavelength spectrophotometer at 511–533 nm with a 3-nm slit. Signals were recorded every 0.5 s via a PowerLab/ADInstrument. The data were stored and analyzed using the Chart version 5.1.1 program. Calibration curves were made for each mitochondrial preparation in K+-free medium and were obtained from traces in which the extramitochondrial K+,[K+]out, was altered by addition of KCl in a 0.1–20 mm final concentration range. The change in absorbance then caused by the addition of 3 μm valinomycin was plotted against [K+]out. The intramitochondrial K+, [K+]in, was estimated by extrapolation of the line to the zero uptake point, as described in Ref. 26Nedergaard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. The absorbance readings were used to calculate the membrane potential (mV) by the Nernst equation according to: Δψm = 61 mV·log ([K+]in/[K+]out). To determine the basal proton leak, mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption measurements were performed in parallel using the same media and conditions, but in the presence of increasing amounts of antimycin A, as indicated. Western Blotting—For HNE-adduct detection, aliquots of freshly isolated mitochondrial suspension were stored under nitrogen at –80 °C after supplementation with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche). Protein concentrations of the thawed mitochondrial samples were requantified using the Lowry method. Equal amounts of mitochondrial protein were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. HNE protein adducts were detected with polyclonal antibodies from Alpha Diagnostics (HNE12-S, dilution 1:1000). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the membrane was incubated with detection reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and the chemiluminescence signal was detected with a CCD camera (Fuji). Quantifications were performed with the Image Gauge 3 software. For UCP1 determination, the membrane used for detection of the HNE adducts was stripped and blotted with UCP1 polyclonal antibodies (prepared in rabbit from the C-terminal decapeptide of mouse UCP1), dilution 1:3000. For cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 determination, the membrane used for detection of HNE adducts and UCP1 was blotted, after stripping, with cytochrome oxidase subunit 1-monoclonal antibodies (Molecular Probes), diluted 1:2000. Superoxide Measurement—Net superoxide release rates were assessed directly in isolated brown fat mitochondria by fluorescence measurements with the dye dihydroethidium (DHE) (Molecular Probes), the conversion of which to ethidium is superoxide-induced (14Silva J.P. Shabalina I.G. Dufour E. Petrovic N. Backlund E.C. Hultenby K. Wibom R. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Larsson N.-G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4061-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Benov L. Sztejnberg L. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emitted by the ethidium formed was followed on a spectrophotometer (Sigma ZES II) at 37 °C using an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and collecting the emission via a cutoff filter at 580 nm. The data were acquired, stored, and analyzed using the Chart 4.1.1 program (PowerLab/ADInstrument). Chemical and biological validations of this method were reported in Ref. 14Silva J.P. Shabalina I.G. Dufour E. Petrovic N. Backlund E.C. Hultenby K. Wibom R. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Larsson N.-G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4061-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar: generation of superoxide by the xanthine plus xanthine oxidase system or by mitochondria in the presence of DHE resulted in a significant increase in ethidium-emitted fluorescence, which was blocked by addition of recombinant SOD (14Silva J.P. Shabalina I.G. Dufour E. Petrovic N. Backlund E.C. Hultenby K. Wibom R. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Larsson N.-G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4061-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When estimated by this method, superoxide generation was diminished in brown fat mitochondria from hSOD2+ mice (i.e. mitochondrial superoxide dismutase-overexpressing mice) as compared with wild-type mice (14Silva J.P. Shabalina I.G. Dufour E. Petrovic N. Backlund E.C. Hultenby K. Wibom R. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Larsson N.-G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4061-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The assay thus detected mitochondrial superoxide release. Aconitase and Citrate Synthase Activities—Aconitase activity was measured spectrophotometrically as NADPH formation, monitored at 340 nm using a coupled assay (28Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The frozen mitochondrial samples (the same as those used for Western blotting) were rapidly thawed immediately prior to assay, and 2 μl of 10 times diluted sample were added to 500 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 5 mm sodium citrate, 0.2 mm NADP+, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.4 units/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase (Sigma)) pre-equilibrated to 30 °C. Each sample was assayed in duplicate; readings were taken at 15-s intervals over 7 min, and the resulting linear slopes were averaged to give a measurement of aconitase activity for that sample. Superoxide inactivates the Krebs cycle enzyme aconitase, whereas citrate synthase, another Krebs cycle enzyme, is insensitive to superoxide; therefore, the aconitase/citrate synthase ratio is a convenient measure of oxidative damage in mitochondria (28Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Citrate synthase activity was determined as in Ref. 29Alp P.R. Newsholme E.A. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar. To validate the assay and to induce extensive oxidative damage, brown fat mitochondria were also exposed to a superoxide-generating system (370 μm xanthine plus 23 μg/ml xanthine oxidase) for 15 min at 30 °C. Confirmation that this system provides a high level of superoxide was obtained in Ref. 14Silva J.P. Shabalina I.G. Dufour E. Petrovic N. Backlund E.C. Hultenby K. Wibom R. Nedergaard J. Cannon B.

Lipid Peroxidation—Interscapular brown adipose tissue was rapidly dissected from UCP1–/– and UCP1+/+ mice and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The wet weight of brown adipose tissue was measured and the left lobe of tissue was used for the lipid peroxidation assay and the right lobe for the determination of antioxidant enzyme activities. The amount of peroxidative reactants was estimated as the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (mainly the lipid peroxidation product, malonyl dialdehyde (MDA) (30Yagi K. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 108: 101-106PubMed Google Scholar)). Brown adipose tissue homogenates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) in a ratio of 1:50 (w/v). Basal MDA levels were measured in freshly homogenized samples. Inducible peroxidative reactions were stimulated by addition of 312.5 μm ascorbic acid and 6.25 μm FeSO4 (final concentrations) and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Spontaneous peroxidative reactions were analyzed in samples incubated in parallel without addition of ascorbic acid and FeSO4. Antioxidant Enzyme Assays—The right lobe of interscapular brown adipose tissue was homogenized in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2), in a 1:10 ratio (w/v) and sonicated three times at 100 watts for 20 s with 10-s pauses in a Bronson model B-12 sonicator. The samples were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 60 min. Supernatants were used for determination of manganese-containing mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (Mn-SOD), CuZn-containing cytosolic superoxide dismutase 1 (CuZn-SOD), and catalase. SOD activity was measured by the adrenaline method (31Misra H.P. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3170-3175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μl of acidified adrenaline solution was added to 3 ml of alkaline carbonate buffer (50 mm Na2CO3, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 10.2), and absorbance of adrenochrome at 480 nm was monitored for 4 min. The decrease in the rate of change of the absorbance caused by the samples was followed. One unit of SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme reducing the rate of autoxidation of adrenaline by 50%. Mn-SOD-specific activity was obtained by inhibiting CuZn-SOD for 20 min at room temperature with 4 mm KCN (final concentration) before the dismutase assay. CuZn-SOD activity was calculated by subtracting Mn-SOD activity from the total SOD activity. Catalase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by a method (32Beutler E. Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism, a Manual of Biochemical Methods. Grune and Stratton, New York1982: 105-106Google Scholar) based on the rate of hydrogen peroxide degradation by the catalase contained in the examined samples. Chemicals—Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, fraction V, was from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Germany). HNE was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Nonanoic acid and fluorescamine (4-phenyl spiro-[furan-2(3H),1-phthalan]-3,3′-dione) were from Fluka Chemie Gmbh. 2-Nonenoic acid was from CHEMOS Gmbh (Regenstauf). Other chemicals were all from Sigma. GDP was dissolved in 20 mm Tes (pH 7.2) and the pH of the solution readjusted. FCCP was dissolved in 95% ethanol and diluted in 50% ethanol; oligomycin and rotenone were dissolved in 95% ethanol. Nonanoic acid, 2-nonenoic acid, 2-nonenal, all-trans-retinal, and HNE were dissolved in 95% ethanol, divided into small aliquots, and stored under nitrogen at –80 °C. Ethanol in a final concentration of 0.1% did not in itself have any effects on the parameters measured. Statistics—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis for the comparison of two groups was performed using Student's t test. The Presence of a Carboxyl Group Is an Absolute Requirement for Compounds (Re)activating UCP1—HNE, 2-nonenal, and all-trans-retinal have been suggested as general UCP activators (24Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4103-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). We have examined their effects on UCP1, i.e. the uncoupling protein found in brown fat mitochondria and the only uncoupling protein with a verified physiological uncoupling ability. We recently demonstrated a role for fatty acids as kinetically competitive (re)activators of UCP1 in GDP-inhibited brown fat mitochondria (22Shabalina I.G. Jacobsson A. Cannon B. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38236-38248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our interpretation of those experiments was that fatty acids only function to overcome the GDP inhibition, in our hands in a kinetically simple competitive manner, and that fatty acids do not participate in the uncoupling function of UCP1 as such. We therefore initially examined the ability of HNE to reactivate GDP-inhibited UCP1, i.e. to have a mechanism of action similar to that of fatty acids. To identify the UCP1-dependent effects, we examined the effect of HNE in brown fat mitochondria isolated from both UCP1–/– and UCP1+/+ mice. For comparison of activating efficiency, we first determined the effects of the corresponding fatty acids 2-nonenoic and nonanoic acid. In brown fat mitochondria without UCP1, small uncoupling effects of these fatty acids were observed (Fig. 1, A–C, thin lines), indicating a minor UCP1-independent uncoupling mediated by these fatty acids. Both fatty acids were able to (re)stimulate oxygen consumption (preinhibited by GDP) in UCP1+/+ mitochondria (Fig. 1, B and C, thin lines). The UCP1-dependent effect was estimated as the difference between the fatty acid effects in the two mitochondrial preparations (UCP1+/+ and UCP1–/–) (Fig. 1D). As seen, the efficiency and apparent affinity were essentially identical for 2-nonenoic and nonanoic acid. The (re)activation ability was thus independent of the presence or absence of a double bond in the fatty acid. The activator candidate, the aldehyde HNE, had practically no effect in UCP1–/– mitochondria (Fig. 1, A–C, heavy lines). Similarly but notably, no ability to stimulate oxygen consumption was found in UCP1+/+ mitochondria (Fig. 1, B and C, heavy lines). Thus, there was no UCP1-dependent effect of HNE at all (Fig. 1D), i.e. HNE cannot (re)activate GDP-inhibited UCP1. Consequently, in contrast to the corresponding fatty acids, aldehydes were not able to reactive GDP-inhibited UCP1 in brown fat mitochondria. Because this inhibited state of UCP1 probably mimics the UCP1 state in unstimulated brown fat cells, it is not evident how HNE could activate UCP1 in situ. Oxidized Aldehyde Can Activate UCP1—Mammalian mitochondria possess several highly active pathways for HNE metabolism, and one, aldehyde dehydrogenase, has as its product hydroxy-nonenoic acid (33Siems W. Grune T. Mol. Aspects Med. 2003; 24: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because a fatty acid is thus a major product of HNE metabolism, we investigated the effect of supplying isolated UCP1+/+ mitochondria with aldehyde dehydrogenase (plus NAD+) when studying the effect of the aldehyde 2-nonenal (Fig. 2). Nonenal did not in itself reactivate GDP-inhibited UCP1 (Fig. 2A). The presence of aldehyde dehydrogenase plus NAD+ dramatically altered the response of the mitochondria to the aldehyde. Addition of 2-nonenal now stimulated UCP1-dependent oxygen consumption to the same extent as did 2-nonenoic acid (Fig. 2, B and C). This demonstrated that the aldehyde has a stimulatory effect only if converted to a fatty acid. Thus, HNE (Fig. 1), 2-nonenal (Fig. 2), or all-trans-retinal (data not shown) could not stimulate oxygen consumption in an UCP1-dependent manner in brown fat mitochondria. Conversion of the aldehyde into a fatty acid led to stimulation of oxygen consumption in UCP1+/+ mitochondria. The presence of a carboxyl group is thus an absolute requirement for compounds (re)activating UCP1. No HNE Activation of Uninhibited UCP1—Although the above experiments demonstrate that HNE cannot (re)activate GDP-inhibited UCP1, it would be possible that HNE could function as an activator for (or enhance the activity of) UCP1 when UCP1 is in its uninhibited state. Indeed, it has been reported by Echtay et al. (24Echtay K.S. Esteves T.C. Pakay J.L. Jekabsons M.B. Lambert A.J. Portero-Otin M. Pamplona R. Vidal-Puig A.J. Wang S. Roebuck S.J.

https://openalex.org/W1969205203,"Recent studies suggest that dysfunction of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is associated with a number of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson disease. We have shown previously that the single subunit rotenone-insensitive NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Ndi1) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria can restore NADH oxidation in complex I-deficient mammalian cells. The Ndi1 enzyme is insensitive to complex I inhibitors such as rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion, known as a metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). To test the possible use of the NDI1 gene as a therapeutic agent in vivo, we chose a mouse model of Parkinson disease. The NDI1-recombinant adeno-associated virus particles (rAAV-NDI1) were injected unilaterally into the substantia nigra of mice. The animals were then subjected to treatment with MPTP. The degree of neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal system was assessed immunohistochemically through the analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase and glial fibrillary acidic protein. It was evident that the substantia nigra neurons on the side used for injection of rAAV-NDI1 retained a high level of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells, and the ipsilateral striatum exhibited significantly less denervation than the contralateral striatum. Furthermore, striatal concentrations of dopamine and its metabolites in the hemisphere that received rAAV-NDI1 were substantially higher than those of the untreated hemisphere, reaching more than 50% of the normal levels. These results indicate that the expressed Ndi1 protein elicits resistance to MPTP-induced neuronal injury. The present study is the first successful demonstration of complementation of complex I by the Ndi1 enzyme in animals.

It has been known for many years that the structural and functional defects of this enzyme complex are involved in a number of human mitochondrial diseases (4Schapira A.H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Greenamyre J.T. Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Panov A.V.

Therefore, it is expected that a strategy to reestablish the function of complex I would lead to the treatment of human diseases caused by the defects of this enzyme complex. The respiratory chain of certain organisms in bacteria and fungi, but not in mammals, lacks the complex I-type enzyme. Instead, the functionality of complex I, namely oxidation of NADH and reduction of quinone, is performed by structurally simpler alternatives (collectively called NDH-2). Therefore, a simple question was asked: can the NDH-2-type enzyme be implemented in mammalian mitochondria, and can it supplement malfunctioning complex I? As a therapeutic method that works irrespective of the cause of complex I deficiencies, we have proposed using the Ndi1 protein, which is one of the NDH-2-type enzymes, found in the mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Kitajima-Ihara T.

The Ndi1 enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide of 53 kDa and contains noncovalently bound FAD and no iron-sulfur clusters. This enzyme is resistant to complex I inhibitors like rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium ion (MPP+) (9Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the Ndi1 protein (NDI1) has been cloned and sequenced (13Marres C.A.M. de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J.

By using a recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the NDI1 gene that encodes the Ndi1 protein (rAAV-NDI1), we were able to express the Ndi1 protein in cultured mammalian cells. The expressed Ndi1 protein was correctly imported to the mitochondria of host cells with its own leading sequence (10Seo B.B. Wang J. Flotte T.R. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. J. Biol.

A number of recent studies have indicated a reduced activity of complex I in Parkinson disease (PD) both in animal models and patients (15Dauer W. Przedborski S.

In fact, it has been suggested that environmental toxins known to inhibit complex I may be the primary cause of PD. Therefore, to further test the idea of using Ndi1 as a remedy for complex I defects (19Seo B.B. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Cruz P. Flotte T.R. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Hum. Gene Ther. 2004; 15: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we chose an animal model of PD to carry out in vivo experiments. Among the animal models available to date, mouse models involving the neurotoxin MPTP have been widely used. It is hypothesized that MPTP is oxidized to MPP+, which is then transported into dopaminergic neurons by the dopamine transporter. MPP+ is accumulated in the mitochondrial matrix and inhibits complex I. The damaged complex I appears to generate reactive oxygen species, which may induce death of neurons. Furthermore, in these models the activity of complex I is reported to be lowered (20Singer T.P. Ramsay R.R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and therefore they are suitable as our test system. In this paper, we report that the Ndi1 protein expressed in the substantia nigra (SN) of mouse brain offered protection against the neurodegeneration caused by MPTP administration. Recombinant AAV Vector Productions—rAAV serotype 2 (rAAV2) carrying the NDI1 gene (designated rAAV-NDI1) was prepared as described previously (10Seo B.B. Wang J. Flotte T.R. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37774-37778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, an rAAV proviral plasmid, pCB-NDI1, designed to express the full-length NDI1 gene was constructed using the cytomegalovirus/β-actin hybrid promoter and was packaged into rAAV2 virions by double transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The rAAV-NDI1 particles were then purified by iodixanol step-gradient centrifugation followed by heparin sulfate column chromatography. An rAAV carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (designated rAAV-GFP) was also prepared as reported earlier (21Zolotukhin S. Potter M. Zolotukhin I. Sakai Y. Loiler S. Fraites T.J. Chiodo V.A. Phillipsberg T. Muzyczka N. Hauswirth W.W. Flotte T.R. Byrne B.J. Snyder R.O. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 28: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The final particle titer of the rAAV-CMV-NDI1 was 1.8 × 1013 viral particles/ml (1.0 × 1011 IU/ml), and the rAAV-GFP was 1.1 × 1011 viral particles/ml (1.0 × 1011 IU/ml) as estimated by dot blot analysis. Animals—Eight-week-old male (22-25 g) C57BL/6 mice (obtained from our in-house breeding colony) were housed three to four per cage in temperature-controlled rooms under a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. The housing and treatment of the animals were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The Scripps Research Institute. Injection of AAV Vectors—For each surgical procedure described herein, mice received ketamine (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) before surgery. Anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane in O2 flow, and mice were placed into a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Anesthesia was then maintained with 1% isoflurane in O2 through a mouth tip fixed to the stereotaxic frame. All injections were made using a 5-μl Hamilton microsyringe with a 30-gauge beveled needle. The anterior-posterior and medial-lateral stereotaxic coordinates for the striatum and the SN were calculated from bregma, and the dorso-ventral coordinates were calculated from the dural surface. A burr hole was drilled in the skull over the target site, and the microsyringe was inserted vertically into the SN at the following coordinates: anterior-posterior -3.3 mm, medial-lateral 1.5 mm, dorso-ventral -3.9 mm; and anterior-posterior -3.3 mm, medial-lateral 1.0 mm, dorso-ventral -4.1 mm. Mice received stereotaxic injections of rAAV-NDI1 (1 × 1011 IU/ml) or rAAV-GFP (1 × 1011 IU/ml) suspended in PBS containing 0.1% fluorescent microspheres (v/v; Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) into the SN (2 μl/site, 4 μl total) at a rate of 0.5-1.0 μl/min. The microsyringe was left in place for an additional 5 min before retracting slowly. Animals that were used as controls received the same volume of solution, which contained 0.1% fluorescent microspheres (v/v) in PBS. MPTP Treatment—MPTP handling and safety measures were in accordance with the Chemical Hygiene Plan developed at The Scripps Research Institute. Approximately 4-5 months after the rAAV-NDI1 injection in the SN, mice were subjected to MPTP treatment. We followed the method reported by Sonsalla and Heikkila (22Sonsalla P.K. Heikkila R.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 129: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) for an acute MPTP mouse model. MPTP (0.1 ml in PBS; Sigma) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 15 mg/kg of body weight. A total of four injections were performed at 2-h intervals with a >90% survival rate. When the dose of MPTP was increased to 20 mg/kg, only 30-50% of MPTP-treated mice survived as described in the literature (22Sonsalla P.K. Heikkila R.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 129: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 23Lau Y.S. Meredith G.E. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 79: 103-116PubMed Google Scholar). Lower doses tended to be less effective with regards to DA loss in the striatum. Therefore, a dose of 15 mg/kg seems to be most appropriate to obtain the desired effects by MPTP. Each group consisted of 12 mice to allow for statistically reliable analysis between groups. Seven days after the MPTP administration, brain tissue was collected and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for the assessment of neuronal degeneration. Immunohistochemical Analysis—For histological studies, mice were perfused with PBS followed by cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4), and brains were post-fixed for 1 h in the same buffer at 4 °C. 30-μm coronal sections were cut using a cryostat and were collected onto slides and stored at -20 °C. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against Ndi1 (1:250; prepared in our laboratory), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:500; Calbiochem), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:250; Sigma) was carried out on slide sections as follows. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 20 min, the sections were washed three times with PBS and incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidases followed by permeabilization and blocking for nonspecific binding with 10% normal goat serum, 5% horse serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Sections were then incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. For TH and GFAP, sections were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) followed by three washes for 10 min each with PBS at room temperature. Secondary antibody was visualized using the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (Sigma). In all staining procedures, deletion of the primary antibody served as a control. The immunostained sections were examined using an epifluorescence or bright-field microscope. Ndi1 protein staining was done using the tyramide signal amplification-direct procedure following the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, the sections were incubated with the primary antibodies as described above and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Calbiochem) at room temperature for 2 h. The sections were then washed three times for 10 min each with PBS at room temperature and incubated with the fluorophore tyramide (1:100 dilution with amplification buffer) for 7 min at room temperature in a dark, moist chamber followed by three washes for 10 min each in PBS at room temperature and examined using a fluorescence microscope. To stain nucleic acid, the sections were treated with TO-PRO-3 iodide (1:750 dilution with amplification buffer) for 10 min at room temperature and washed three times for 5 min each in PBS. NADH Activity Staining—Histochemical staining for NADH dehydrogenase activity was based on the NADH-tetrazolium reductase reaction (24Allen D.L. Harrison B.C. Maass A. Bell M.L. Byrnes W.C. Leinwand L.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 1900-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Tissue sections were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in NADH-tetrazolium reductase reaction solution (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm NADH, and 1.5 mm nitro blue tetrazolium) and then washed three times with deionized water. HPLC Analysis—Striatal DA and its metabolite levels were determined by HPLC. The mice were sacrificed, and brains were quickly removed and placed in brain matrix (RBM 2000C; Activational Systems Inc.) on dry ice and sliced with a razor blade to 1-2-mm sections. Striatal regions from each side of the brain were isolated separately and weighed. Each sample was briefly sonicated in 4 volumes of ice-cold 0.4 m perchloric acid containing 0.15% sodium metabisulfite and 0.05% disodium EDTA and deproteinized by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Aromatic amines and their metabolites were separated using ion-paired reversed phase HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection according to Wagner et al. (25Wagner J. Vitali P. Palfreyman M.G. Zraika M. Huot S. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1241-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Samples (10 μl) kept at 4 °C were injected into an HPLC system equipped with an A-314 C18 column (5 μm, 300 × 6.0 mm; YMC). The flow rate was 0.55 ml/min through a pump (LC10AD; Shimadzu) at a pressure of 100-110 kg/cm2 at 30 °C. The mobile phase was composed of 75 mm sodium phosphate, 2.78 mm sodium octyl sulfate, 33 mm triethylamine, and 0.1 mm EDTA with the final pH adjusted to 3.43 prior to adding 25% (v/v) methanol. The signal was detected on a graphite carbon working electrode set at +0.75 V (against the Ag/AgCl reference) (ECD-300; Eicom). The data were collected through an EPC-500 processor (Eicom), and peak areas were calculated using the PowerChrom software and quantified from a standard curve. Linearity was maintained from 10 fmol to 100 pmol for standards. Materials—MPTP, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride, NADH, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma; anti-TH and horseradish peroxidase were from Calbiochem; 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing mounting medium and ABC Elite kit were from Vector Laboratories; fluorescent microspheres were from Polysciences Inc.; the tyramide signal amplification kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; nitro blue tetrazolium chloride monohydrate was from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ); Permount mounting medium was from Fisher. The OCT compound was from Sakura (Torrance, CA). Expression of the GFP in Mouse Brains—For a therapeutic agent to be useful, it is necessary to deliver the agent to the dopaminergic neurons in the SN. To test the efficacy of the virus in mouse brains, we used rAAV particles carrying the GFP gene (rAAV-GFP). The rAAV-GFP particles were injected unilaterally into the SN region of mice. After 6-8 weeks, a good level of GFP fluorescence was observed in the SN of the side of the brain where rAAV-GFP had been injected (Fig. 1). Furthermore, sections at the level of striatum also exhibited GFP fluorescence on the ipsilateral side but not on the contralateral side, indicating that the expressed protein was transported anterogradely to nerve terminals. It is therefore likely that the rAAV particles that were constructed could efficiently deliver the transgene in dopaminergic neurons of the mouse SN. Functional Expression of the Ndi1 Protein in the Mouse SN—The unilateral injection of rAAV-NDI1 particles into the SN of the brain was carried out using the same method as for rAAV-GFP (see above). As shown in Fig. 2, the Ndi1 protein was clearly detected in the SN. It was determined that the injection of rAAV-NDI1 into a slightly dorsal and posterior region of the SN results in a more effective expression of Ndi1 in dopaminergic neurons than a direct injection into the SN. To ascertain that the expressed Ndi1 is functioning, the NADH dehydrogenase activity assay was carried out on an adjacent section using NADH and tetrazolium dye as the substrates. A number of blue deposits were clearly seen in the areas where the Ndi1 expression was distinct (Fig. 2). The opposite side gave a low level of color development that was presumably ascribed to complex I. These results strongly suggest that the Ndi1 enzyme expressed in the mouse SN is biologically active. The expression of the Ndi1 protein in mouse brain was observed for at least 7 months, which was expected because of the long term nature of AAV-based gene delivery. One potential concern may arise from the fact that Ndi1 substitution reduces the P/O ratio from 3 to 2 because the Ndi1 enzyme is not a proton pump (9Seo B.B. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the animals that received rAAV-NDI1 did not show apparent health problems. MPTP Treatment and Immunohistochemical Assessment of Neurodegeneration—After having established experimental conditions for the Ndi1 expression in the SN, experiments were carried out that critically tested whether Ndi1 had protective effects against MPTP-induced neurodegeneration. The conditions for MPTP treatment were worked out by following the method reported in the literature (22Sonsalla P.K. Heikkila R.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 129: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It turned out that four injections of MPTP at a dose of 15 mg/kg were most appropriate to achieve the desired level of degeneration in a reproducible manner keeping the survival rate high. Brain sections at the level of the SN and of the striatum were collected, and dopaminergic cells were visualized immunohistochemically using the antibody against TH. Typical results of the TH staining are presented in Fig. 3A. As expected, MPTP-treated mice showed a significant loss of the TH immunoreactivity in the SN and denervation in the striatum. The decreased level of striatal TH was retained for at least a week. Similar results have been reported by Sugama et al. (26Sugama S. Yang L. Cho B.P. DeGiorgio L.A. Lorenzl S. Albers D.S. Beal M.F. Volpe B.T. Joh T.H. Brain Res. 2003; 964: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and Przedborski and colleagues (27Dauer W. Kholodilov N. Vila M. Trillat A.C. Goodchild R. Larsen K.E. Staal R. Tieu K. Schmitz Y. Yuan C.A. Rocha M. Jackson-Lewis V. Hersch S. Sulzer D. Przedborski S. Burke R. Hen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13972-13974Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 28Tieu K. Perier C. Caspersen C. Teismann P. Wu D.C. Yan S.D. Naini A. Vila M. Jackson-Lewis V. Ramasamy R. Przedborski S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 892-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) by using the same MPTP injection procedure (15 mg/kg/dose and a total of four injections at 2-h intervals). In the following experiment, 13 2-month-old mice received unilateral injections of the rAAV-NDI1 particles in the left SN region. About 5-6 months after the rAAV-NDI1 injection, MPTP was administered to mice as described above. Brains were collected 7 days after the MPTP treatment and were evaluated for the degree of neurodegeneration. As shown in Fig. 3B, the SN of the side where rAAV-NDI1 had been injected exhibited a higher number of TH-positive neurons with clearly visible processes. In contrast, the TH reactivity of the untreated side greatly diminished because of MPTP treatment. Moreover, TH staining of the ipsilateral striatum from the same brain was significantly stronger than that of the contralateral striatum. In addition to the TH reactivity, we examined the tissue for GFAP-immunopositive cells. GFAP is another marker commonly used for assessing central nervous system injury. In contrast to TH, staining of the GFAP in the striatum was denser on the contralateral side than the ipsilateral side, indicating less damage of neuronal terminals in the hemisphere that had received rAAV-NDI1. These results strongly suggest that the NDI1 gene delivered to the SN confers protection against nigral degeneration by compensating for complex I malfunction. Because the rAAV-NDI1 injection was performed unilaterally, the untreated side served as a control. This allows direct comparison between the two sides within each mouse, eliminating possible deviations that may arise from variations among the individuals in the effectiveness of MPTP treatment and virus injection. Of the 13 mice tested, 8 mice clearly exhibited the protective effect on the side of the rAAV-NDI1 injection and 2 mice to a lesser extent. Three mice showed the same degree of degeneration on both sides, but none had more neuronal damage on the rAAV-NDI1-treated side. Images of striatal sections from mice that had a positive response were subjected to statistical analysis for staining intensity (Fig. 3C). In both TH- and GFAP-stained sections, a clear difference was observed between the ipsilateral side and the contralateral side. The same images were further analyzed by image processing that allows visualization of the difference. Fig. 4A shows example images from four representative mice. As expected, the ipsilateral side exhibited a distinctively higher TH density than the opposite side. The degree of difference in the density between the two sides varied slightly among the mice presumably because of some variation in the expression of Ndi1 in the SN. Images on the right-hand side of Fig. 4A represent GFAP staining of the striatal sections from the same brain as that shown for TH staining on the left. The contralateral side consistently exhibited a higher degree of damage. Again, statistical analysis confirmed the protective effect of the Ndi1 enzyme on the ipsilateral striatum (Fig. 4B). MPTP Treatment and Levels of DA and Its Derivatives in the Striatum—In the animal model employed, MPTP administration can effectively cause rapid and drastic depletion of striatal DA. To confirm the immunochemical data, we have determined the concentrations of DA and its metabolites in the striatum. The procedures for rAAV-NDI1 injections and MPTP treatment were the same as those described for the histochemistry experiments except that the striata from the two hemispheres were sampled separately. As shown in Fig. 5, the concentration of DA in the striatum of the MPTP-treated mice was <10% of that of the control mice. Similarly, both 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid significantly diminished in the MPTP-treated group. In the group of mice that had received rAAV-NDI1, there was a clear difference between the two hemispheres. All values of the ipsilateral side were 2-4 times greater than those of the contralateral side and reached ∼60% of the normal level. The observed protective effect by rAAV-NDI1 is in total agreement with the immunochemical results. Gene replacement strategies have been explored for many years as an approach to correcting mtDNA-related disorders (29de Grey A.D.N.J. Trends Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 394-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Zullo S.J. Semin. Neurol. 2001; 21: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The first successful work reports using a yeast system in which subunit 8 of the ATP synthase is replaced by an artificial nuclear gene designed to code for this subunit (31Nagley P. Farrell L.B. Gearing D.P. Nero D. Meltzer S. Devenish R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). More recently, allotopic expression is achieved in human cell lines for two mitochondrially encoded subunits, which are able to partially correct respiratory defects caused by pathogenic mtDNA mutations (32Manfredi G. Fu J. Ojaimi J. Sadlock J.E. Kwong J.Q. Guy J. Schon E.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 33Guy J. Qi X. Pallotti F. Schon E.A. Manfredi G. Carelli V. Martinuzzi A. Hauswirth W.W. Lewin A.S. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Our earlier experiments for restoring NADH oxidation by the NDI1 gene were performed using complex I-deficient cell lines irrespective of defects of mtDNA- and nuclear DNA-encoded subunits. These achievements were limited to tissue culture cell lines or yeast. The present study is the first realization of such attempts using animals. The Ndi1 enzyme expressed in dopaminergic neurons of mouse brains elicits resistance to neuronal injury caused by MPTP, clearly indicating the complementation of complex I by the Ndi1 protein. Use of the Ndi1 protein has advantages over the allotopic strategy. First, the Ndi1 polypeptide is not as extremely hydrophobic as most of the mtDNA-encoded subunits, which may alleviate the problem of aggregation when it is expressed in the cytoplasm. Second, because Ndi1 complements functionality of complex I as a whole, issues such as proper integration of the expressed subunit and displacement of the defective subunit are not relevant. In addition, appropriate animal models of defects of complex I subunits are not available at the present time. The MPTP treatment, on the other hand, provided a good model in which to test the Ndi1 strategy. Although PD is not recognized as a mitochondrial disorder, reduced activity of complex I is no doubt involved in the early stage of the cellular events that would eventually trigger neuronal cell death. Consequences of complex I inhibition include bioenergetic disturbance such as a lowered level of cellular ATP, or more likely, an elevated production of reactive oxygen species. The principle of our strategy is to bypass complex I and to reestablish electron transfer from NADH to quinone by introducing the Ndi1 enzyme. It is apparent that this approach is effective in the MPTP mouse model tested, and the findings establish a key role of complex I in the neurodegenerative process. The protective effect reported here is obviously not optimal. First, we deliberately carried out unilateral injections of rAAV-NDI1 to obtain unequivocal assessment in each individual animal. We expect improved protection with bilateral injections, which are currently being assessed. Second, it may be necessary to refine the conditions for NDI1 delivery in the SN. Factors such as infectious titer of viral particles can be adjusted for better efficacy, and/or the use of AAV of different serotype (i.e. type 5) might boost the level of transgene expression (34Burger C. Nash K. Mandel R.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 2005; 16: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Third, we have thus far employed an acute model of PD, and the next step could be to examine chronic animal models that are currently available for mouse and rat (17Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar, 23Lau Y.S. Meredith G.E. Methods Mol.

It would be of interest to cause the degeneration in animals first and then inject the rescue gene. This set of experiments should mimic the real situation in which the protective treatment can only be applied after the damage to the nigrostriatal system has begun. At the present time, rodent models that resemble human PD more in terms of slow development are not available. However, in monkeys, parkinsonian features become manifest upon a chronic administration of MPTP over the period of several months and can be maintained for 2 months (36Muramatsu S. Fujimoto K. Ikeguchi K. Shizuma N. Kawasaki K. Ono F. Shen Y. Wang L. Mizukami H. Kume A. Matsumura M. Nagatsu I. Urano F. Ichinose H. Nagatsu T. Terao K. Nakano I. Ozawa K. Hum. Gene Ther. 2002; 13: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This model may provide us with a long term, progressive state of neuronal deficiencies in which to test the potency of rAAV-NDI1. The single subunit Ndi1 is capable of substituting for the mitochondrial complex I and thus might become a versatile tool in broader applications. The approach employed in this study may open a new avenue toward understanding disorders in which complex I is involved. We thank Drs. Mou-Chieh Kao, Tetsuo Yamashita, and Mathieu Marella for discussion and Dr. Jennifer Barber-Singh for discussion and critical reading of the manuscript."

To further elucidate the pathophysiology of this disorder, the zebrafish orthologue of human GLUT1 was identified, and expression of this gene was abrogated during early embryonic development, resulting in a phenotype of aberrant brain organogenesis consistent with the observed expression of Glut1 in the embryonic tectum and specifically rescued by human GLUT1 mRNA. Affected embryos displayed impaired glucose uptake concomitant with increased neural cell apoptosis and subsequent ventricle enlargement, trigeminal ganglion cell loss, and abnormal hindbrain architecture. Strikingly, inhibiting expression of the zebrafish orthologue of the proapoptotic protein Bad resulted in complete rescue of this phenotype, and this occurred even in the absence of restoration of apparent glucose uptake. Taken together, these studies describe a tractable system for elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Glut1 deficiency and provide compelling in vivo genetic evidence directly linking nutrient availability and activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic mechanisms during embryonic brain development.

Taken together, these studies describe a tractable system for elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of Glut1 deficiency and provide compelling in vivo genetic evidence directly linking nutrient availability and activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic mechanisms during embryonic brain development. The cellular uptake of glucose is dependent in part upon the GLUT family of polytopic membrane transporters that facilitate the passive diffusion of this essential nutrient across membranes (1Wood I.S. Trayhurn P. Br. J. Nutr. 2003; 89: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). GLUT1, the prototypic member of this protein family, is highly expressed in erythrocytes and the central nervous system and is believed to play an essential role in the homeostasis of brain glucose in the developing human infant (2Virgintino D. Robertson D. Benagiano V. Errede M. Bertossi M. Ambrosi G. Roncali L. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 123: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In support of this concept, infants with GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, a rare genetic disorder resulting from inherited heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding GLUT1, develop seizures, acquired microcephaly and profound developmental delay in association with profound hypoglycorrhachia (3Wang D. Pascual J.M. Yang H. Engelstad K. Jhung S. Sun R.P. De Vivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Despite considerable study of these patients, the neurochemical and neuropathologic consequences of GLUT1 deficiency during development are not well understood, and treatment of affected patients remains challenging. Although abundant in the extracellular milieu, the cellular uptake of glucose is precisely regulated by specific growth factors and signaling pathways (4Hammerman P.S. Fox C.J. Thompson C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 586-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cell culture studies reveal that inhibition of cellular glucose uptake dramatically increases apoptosis under conditions of growth factor restriction and that cell survival under such circumstances is dependent upon the regulation of glucose uptake and metabolism by the proto-oncogene Akt (5Rathmell J.C.

A biochemical link between glucose homeostasis and apoptosis was further suggested by studies demonstrating an interaction between the proapoptotic protein, Bad, and the glycolytic enzyme, glucokinase (8Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In support of these findings, a recent study now demonstrates a direct link between glucose metabolism and apoptosis in Xenopus laevis oocytes mediated by activation of caspase-2 (9Nutt L.K.

In the present study, we have utilized the developing zebrafish embryo to examine the mechanistic role of Glut1 deficiency in early brain development. We hypothesized that the ease of genetic manipulation, rapid development, and optical transparency of these embryos would provide a unique opportunity to dissect the cellular and biochemical mechanisms following the perturbation of glucose homeostasis associated with loss of function of this transporter (10Ackermann G.E. Paw B.H. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d1227-d1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Dooley K. Zon L.I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Our findings reveal the first in vivo data linking impaired nutrient availability and activation of apoptosis during early vertebrate development and provide new mechanistic insights relevant to the pathogenesis and treatment of affected patients. Zebrafish Maintenance and Analysis—Zebrafish were maintained and staged as described previously (12Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8773) Google Scholar, 13Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR2000Google Scholar). Wild-type zebrafish stocks were used throughout this study. Embryos were examined with an Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope. Differential interference contrast (DIC) 2The abbreviations used are: DIC, differential interference contrast; hpf, hour(s) postfertilization; MO, morpholino; 2-NBDG, 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose; 2-DOG, 2-deoxyglucose; CNS, central nervous system. images were obtained using an Olympus IX71 microscope fitted with a Nomarski objective, and images were acquired with a TH4-100 camera (Olympus) and Olympus microsuite software. Fluorescently labeled embryos were visualized utilizing a laser-scanning confocal microscope (BX61WI FV500; Olympus), equipped with argon 488 and krypton 568 lasers utilizing the ×10 objective. Representative fish were imaged using identical confocal settings, and serial Z stacks were acquired using a pinhole aperture of 150 μm. Images were collected with Fluoview software (Olympus). Identification and Cloning of Zebrafish glut1 Orthologue—The Ensembl zebrafish genome browser data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ensembl.org; zebrafish assembly version 4 (Zv4)) was searched using the human GLUT1 protein sequence and the BLASTP program. A genomic clone, AL772391.17, was identified on chromosome 23 that contained an annotated region with the highest level of sequence identity (maximum BLAST probability, e-20) predicted to encode for a member of the facilitative glucose transporter family. The predicted amino acid sequence was reciprocally compared against the National Center of Biotechnology Information human protein sequence data base using the BLASTX program (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The identification of human GLUT1 as the closest match in this reverse search confirmed this gene as the zebrafish glut1 orthologue. To generate a full-length cDNA, total RNA was extracted from 24-h postfertilization (hpf) embryos and reverse-transcribed to single-stranded cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed using glut1-specific primers (forward, 5′-GAGTCTAATAAAAAGGAGGTGACT-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGTTGTGAATCTGCCCC-3′), and five independent clones were sequenced. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake into X. laevis Oocytes—Stage V-VI oocytes were injected with 50 ng of mRNA prepared from zebrafish Glut1 cDNA, human GLUT1 cDNA, and zebrafish Glut1 inverse cDNA (negative control) (14Keller K. Strube M. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18884-18889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 48 h after injection, uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (Sigma) was measured as previously described (14Keller K. Strube M. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18884-18889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For inhibition experiments, oocytes were incubated with 20 μm cytochalasin B (Sigma) for 5 min prior to uptake. Experiments were repeated three times with at least 10 oocytes/experimental group. In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—To generate an in situ probe, an 894-bp PCR product was amplified from zebrafish glut1 (forward, 5′-GGCATCCTCATGGCACAGAT-3′; reverse, 5′-GGGGCAGATTCACAACTCTGA-3′) and used as template to prepare riboprobes using the DIG-labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Various stage embryos were collected and fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. Fixed embryos were dechorionated, dehydrated with an ascending methanol series (30, 50, and 100%), and stored in methanol at -20 °C overnight. In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (15Nusslein-Volhard C.D. Ralf Zebrafish. Oxford University Press Inc., New York2002Google Scholar). Antibody staining of whole-mounted embryos with anti-acetylated tubulin (Sigma), ZN-12 (antineuronal specific antigen) and 4D9 (antiengrailed) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) was performed as described previously, and staining was detected using the ABC method following the manufacturer's instructions (Vectastain). Morpholino Designs and Injections—To inhibit the expression of glut1, antisense morpholinos targeting the translational start site (5′-GGCCATCATCAGCTGAGGAGTCACC-3′) and the exon-splice acceptor site of exon 3 (5′-TGAGTTCCTCCTGTTGGAAGATCAC-3′) were synthesized (Gene Tools LLC, Philomath, OR). The inverse sequence of the glut1 translational start site (5′-GGTGACTCCTCAGCTGATGATGGCC-3′) and a nonspecific morpholino (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) (Gene Tools LLC) were used as negative controls. To inhibit the expression of zebrafish bad, a morpholino targeting the start methionine (5′-ATATGTGCCATGATTGAACGTCTTG-3′) and exon 2 splice donor site (5′-GGCACCAAATAATAGTTTCTCACC-3′) were designed. 2.5 ng of morpholinos were microinjected into embryos at the 1-2-cell stage. 1 ng/embryo of GLUT1 mRNA or control mRNA was co-injected with 2.5 ng/embryo of the morpholino targeting the translational start methionine. The bad morpholino was coinjected with control or glut1 morpholinos at 2.5 ng/embryo. Glucose Uptake—The yolk sac of 24-hpf MO-treated embryos was injected with 5 mg/ml 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG), a fluorescent glucose analog (N13195; Molecular Probes, Inc.) and incubated at room temperature. At 5 and 60 min after 2-NBDG injection, embryos were anesthetized with Tricaine and subjected to confocal immunofluorescent microscopy to visualize the transport of glucose into the embryos while embedded in 0.4% low melt agarose. Detection of Apoptotic Cell Death—Apoptosis was detected with the vital dye acridine orange (acridinium chloride hemizinc chloride; Sigma). MO-treated embryos were dechorionated and incubated with 5 μg/μl acridine orange for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The embryos were then washed three times for 5 min with egg water and immediately visualized using confocal microscopy utilizing the argon 488 laser. Contrast Brain Imaging— 48-hpf MO-treated embryos were incubated with CellTrace BODIPY TR methyl ester (MP 34556; Molecular Probes) at 0.1 mm for 1 h followed by three washes with egg water. Embryos were mounted in a thin layer of 0.4% low melt agarose, and 1000 pl of fluorescein dextran (Mr 70,000, Molecular Probes) was injected into the midbrain. Embryos were immediately imaged using confocal microscopy utilizing the argon 488 and krypton 568 lasers. Identification and Characterization of Zebrafish glut1 Orthologue—To identify a zebrafish glut1 orthologue, a bioinformatics search was performed using the amino acid sequence of human GLUT1. This search identified a 488-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 54 kDa that shares 74% sequence identity with human GLUT1 and contains the signature sequence motifs implicated in conferring glucose transport activity including a QLS motif in helix 7, glutamine 161 in helix 5, and tryptophan 388 in helix 10 (Fig. S1) (16Joost H.G. Thorens B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of this sequence revealed that this protein was more closely related to the GLUT1 homologs of other species, including humans and pufferfish (fugu) than with any of the other GLUT family members, including GLUT3, GLUT14, or GLUT4 (Fig. S2). Functional conservation of zebrafish Glut1 was confirmed by in vitro uptake of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) into Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 1). Uptake into oocytes injected with zebrafish Glut1 mRNA and human GLUT1 mRNA was much greater than control oocytes injected with inverse zebrafish Glut1 mRNA (56.7 ± 12.2 versus 32.6 ± 14.6 versus 0.5 ± 0.1 pmol of 2-DOG/oocyte/30 min, respectively), and uptake was inhibited by cytochalasin B (Fig. 1). In situ hybridization of 6-hpf embryos showed ubiquitous expression of glut1 within the developing blastoderm, whereas at 18 hpf, expression of glut1 was more restricted to cells of the pronephric ducts and the central nervous system (Fig. 2, A and B). At 24 hpf, expression was observed in the central nervous system surrounding the tectal and hindbrain ventricles with continued expression in the developing kidney (pronephric ducts) (Fig. 2, C-E).FIGURE 2Whole mount in situ hybridization with glut1.

As shown in Fig. 3, inhibiting the expression of glut1 with either MO resulted in a similar and dramatic phenotype. At 24 hpf, glut1 morphant embryos were characterized by increased tissue opacity in the head, resulting in the loss of key morphological markers in the CNS (Fig. 3, A, C, and E). In addition, we consistently observed a thinner/smaller yolk sac extension in the glut1 morphants as well as abnormalities within the fin fold. By 48 hpf, morphant embryos displayed enlargement of the tectal and hindbrain ventricles associated with anterior displacement of the telencephalon (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). These embryos did not survive past 96 h postfertilization. The morphant phenotype was observed in 97.0 ± 1.6% of embryos injected with the MO targeting the start methionine and 97.5 ± 2.8% in embryos injected with the MO targeting the splice site. Contrast brain imaging of control and morpholino-injected embryos at 48 hpf highlighted the observed ventricle enlargement and illustrated the loss of the midbrain/hindbrain boundary (Fig. 3, G and H). In support of the specificity of the morpholinos and the resulting phenotype, analysis of glut1 transcripts from MO-treated embryos revealed a marked decrease in glut1 expression following injection of the ATG MO and the appearance of an aberrant splice product, confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis, in embryos injected with the splice site MO (Fig. S3). To further demonstrate the specificity of the phenotype observed in glut1 morphants, we performed rescue experiments in which zebrafish glut1 mRNA, human GLUT1 mRNA, or control mRNA was co-injected into embryos with zebrafish-specific glut1 or control MO. This analysis revealed that both zebrafish glut1 mRNA and human GLUT1 mRNA were able to completely rescue the morphant phenotype as illustrated in Fig. 4. In addition, the ventral views illustrate a marked reduction in the overall head size of the glut1 morphants, which is also phenotypically rescued in the presence of either zebrafish or human GLUT1 mRNA (Fig. 4, B, D, F). The rescue was dose-dependent, achieving a maximum 94% phenotypic rescue at a dose of 250 μg/ml zebrafish glut1 mRNA (Table S1). To characterize the central nervous system in glut1 morphants, immunohistochemical analysis utilizing antibodies directed against neuronal specific antigens was performed. By 24 hpf, a simple axon scaffold has formed in the embryonic zebrafish brain, consisting of two bilaterally symmetrical longitudinal tracts connected by commissures, providing a template for subsequent development (Fig. 5, A and C) (17Wilson S.W. Ross L.S. Parrett T. Easter Jr., S.S. Development. 1990; 108: 121-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bernhardt R.R. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 137-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, the neuronal architecture of glut1 morphants was clearly altered, revealing thinner, poorly fasciculated longitudinal tracts and an apparent reduction in the trigeminal ganglion neurons as illustrated by staining with the neuron-specific antibody, antiacetylated tubulin (Fig. 5B). The disorganized neuronal architecture and hypothesized reduction in total neurons were further demonstrated by panaxonal staining with ZN-12, highlighting a reduction in the lateral and medial longitudinal fascicles (Fig. 5D). Additionally, a reduction in cells within the midbrain/hindbrain region was observed by staining for Engrailed, a transcription factor specifically expressed by cells within this region (Fig. 5, E and F) (19Scholpp S. Brand M. Genesis. 2001; 30: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Glucose Uptake Was Inhibited and Apoptosis was Enhanced When glut1 Expression Was Abrogated—To assess the functional impact of inhibiting Glut1 expression, glucose uptake experiments utilizing a fluorescently labeled nonmetabolizable glucose analog, 2-NBDG, were performed. Within 5 min after injection, fluorescently labeled 2-deoxyglucose was observed in embryos treated with control MO at a level 7-fold higher than that observed in glut1 morphant embryos (Fig. 6, A and B, and Fig. S4A). Whereas a minimal level of fluorescence was visible in the morphant embryos at the 60-min time point, there was still a qualitative increase in 2-NBDG uptake observed in control embryos compared with the glut1 morphants (Fig. 6, C and D). With increased tissue opacity in the head and the apparent reduction of neurons observed by immunohistochemistry, we hypothesized that inhibiting Glut1 expression may be affecting cell survival in these regions. Therefore, to assess the presence of increased programmed cell death in the CNS of glut1 morphants, apoptosis was assayed by staining with the vital dye acridine orange. At both 19 and 24 hpf, an overall increase in apoptosis was observed in morphant embryos compared with controls (Fig. 6, E-H). At 19 hpf, there was a generalized increase in apoptosis throughout the embryo, whereas at 24 hpf, apoptosis appeared to be localized primarily to the CNS, with concentrated areas observed in the head and tail. There was an average 2-fold increase in apoptosis in glut1 morphant embryos compared with control embryos (Fig. S4B). A similar pattern of apoptosis was observed using terminal dUTP nick end labeling, a method that specifically labels fragmented DNA, an established marker of programmed cell death (Fig. S5). Abrogation of the Proapoptotic Protein Bad Rescued the Neurodegenerative Phenotype in glut1 Morphant Embryos—Inhibiting glut1 expression and concomitant glucose transport into the developing embryo resulted in increased neuronal apoptosis. To determine if the proapoptotic protein Bad was playing a role in the glut1-dependent apoptosis, experiments inhibiting the expression of Bad in the context of decreased Glut1 expression were performed. Attenuating Bad expression utilizing an MO targeting the translational start site or one designed to interfere with splicing resulted in the complete rescue of the glut1-dependent neurodegenerative phenotype, which resulted in the survival of the embryos (Fig. 7, A-D). The characteristic CNS morphology that defines this stage in development was distinct in embryos simultaneously injected with the glut1 and bad MO compared with embryos injected with glut1 and control MO (Fig. 7, A and C). The enlarged hindbrain ventricles that distinguished the glut1 morphants at 48 hpf were no longer apparent in the embryos co-injected with bad MO. In addition, the enhanced apoptotic cell death observed in glut1 morphant embryos was not observed in embryos in which bad expression was also abrogated (Fig. S6, A-C). In control experiments, attenuation of bad alone had no observable effect on the structural or apoptotic phenotype of the embryos (data not shown). We observed an overall phenotypic rescue of 83.0 ± 0.7% in embryos simultaneously injected with the glut1 and bad start MO (Fig. S7). To confirm the specificity of the bad MOs, analysis of bad transcripts from MO-treated embryos revealed the appearance of an aberrant splice product, confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis, in embryos injected with the splice site MO (Fig. S6). Whereas the inhibition of bad expression reversed neuronal apoptosis and subsequent degeneration, the attenuation of bad expression did not rescue the impaired glucose uptake function conferred by abrogating glut1 expression alone (Fig. 7, E-G, and Fig. S6). Decreased expression of bad alone had no effect on glucose transport function of treated embryos (data not shown). The data in this study reveal a critical role for Glut1 in the development of the embryonic vertebrate brain. Bioinformatic and 2-deoxyglucose uptake analyses confirmed the identification of a functional zebrafish glut1 orthologue (Figs. S1, S2, and 1). Expression analysis by in situ hybridization revealed that this transporter is expressed throughout the brain tectum at 24 hpf (Fig. 2), and abrogation of this expression resulted in a phenotype of impaired brain organogenesis specifically rescued by human GLUT1 mRNA (Figs. 3, 4, 5). These findings are probably a direct consequence of impaired glucose homeostasis, as evidenced by the marked decrease in 2-deoxyglucose uptake from the yolk sac of affected embryos (Fig. 6). Whereas the predominant phenotype observed in this study is brain neurodegeneration, a role for Glut1 in other aspects of early development is suggested by the complex phenotype (Fig. 3) and excess apoptosis observed throughout the embryo (Fig. 6). Most importantly, our findings provide a direct in vivo link between glucose homeostasis and the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway during development as evidenced by the attenuation of glut1-dependent apoptosis and rescue of the neurodegenerative phenotype in the absence of bad expression (Fig. 7). Strikingly, this inhibition of apoptosis occurs without apparent restoration of glucose availability, suggesting that cell death in the absence of glut1 is driven not by the gradual decline of metabolism due to insufficient cellular fuel per se but rather by induction of the mitochondrial cell death pathway due to the sensing of in adequate nutrient availability. The concept that activation of glucose-dependent apoptosis is not the result of impaired metabolism but rather that the sensing of intracellular energy levels is acting to directly regulate the mitochondrial cell death pathway is strongly supported by recent elegant studies of X. laevis oocyte survival directly linking glucose metabolism and apoptosis via activation of caspase-2 (9Nutt L.K.

A role for glucose in cell survival is consistent with prior cell culture studies demonstrating that inhibition of cellular glucose uptake dramatically increases apoptosis under conditions of growth factor restriction and that cell survival under such circumstances is dependent upon the regulation of glucose uptake and metabolism by the proto-oncogene Akt (5Rathmell J.C.

The involvement of Bad in this process is supported by findings that Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and thus inhibiting the proapoptotic protein Bad (20Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X.

Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar) as well as biochemical studies revealing a physical interaction between Bad and the glycolytic enzyme, glucokinase (8Danial N.N.

The presented studies demonstrate that zebrafish provide a tractable system for elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of GLUT1 deficiency. This vertebrate model may allow further elucidation of the signaling events linking glucose homeostasis and apoptosis by analysis of a group of zebrafish mutants termed spacehead (22Abdelilah S. Mountcastle-Shah E. Harvey M. Solnica-Krezel L. Schier A.F. Stemple D.L. Malicki J. Neuhauss S.C. Zwartkruis F. Stainier D.Y. Rangini Z. Driever W.

Belak J. Boggs C. Development. 1996; 123: 37-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants, consisting of at least 30 independent complementation groups, have a phenotype that is identical to that observed in the glut1 morphants (Fig. 3), suggesting that at least some of these loci may encode genes in the signaling pathways critical for coupling glucose homeostasis and cell survival during development. Such findings will have important fundamental implications for understanding the role of metabolic intermediates as mediators of cell signaling and would extend the recently developed paradigm of metabolic intermediates as ligands in signal transduction pathways (24He W. Miao F.J. Lin D.C. Schwandner R.T. Wang Z. Gao J. Chen J.L. Tian H. Ling L. Nature. 2004; 429: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Our finding that vertebrate brain development is critically dependent upon Glut1 expression may also permit new approaches to elucidating the pathogenesis of human GLUT1 deficiency syndrome. Importantly, our current data are not yet a precise model for this disease, since affected patients retain one functional GLUT1 allele and present in the postnatal period with signs and symptoms reflecting the acute sensitivity of the central nervous system to impaired glucose homeostasis. However, further elucidation of the role of glucose homeostasis in regulating the mitochondrial death pathway during vertebrate brain development should provide insights into the cellular and molecular basis of the complex neurological phenotypes observed in these patients including mental retardation and impaired cognition. Furthermore, manipulation of Glut1 levels in the zebrafish embryo by adjusting morpholino dose or through the identification of a glut1 mutant as noted above are both feasible and may permit novel therapeutic approaches in affected patients, including a more thorough understanding of the efficacy of treatment with ketogenic substrates. Such an approach has been successfully employed utilizing a zebrafish model for pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, where neurological dysfunction was rescued using a ketogenic diet (25Taylor M.R. Hurley J.B. Van Epps H.A. Brockerhoff S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4584-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data provide the foundation for future studies that should provide new insights into the role of glucose homeostasis in the development of the mature nervous system.

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is essential for the development and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The pathways regulating apoptosis serve as important targets for many anti-cancer agents currently utilized for treatment of diverse malignancies. Recently, we reported identification of a novel perinuclear protein CARP-1, also known as CCAR1 (1Rishi A.K. Zhang L. Boyanapalli M. Wali A. Mohammad R.M. Yu Y. Fontana J.A. Hatfield J.S. Dawson M.I.

ERRP, a recently isolated pan-EGFR inhibitor, is a 53–55-kDa protein that possesses substantial homology to the extracellular ligand-binding domain of EGFR and its family members (13Yu Y. Rishi A.K.

However, the intracellular signaling pathways involved in ERRP-dependent inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis remain to be delineated. In light of the fact that CARP-1 regulates cell growth and that growth factors regulate CARP-1, we speculated that CARP-1 is a key intracellular transducer of growth factor receptor-dependent apoptosis signaling. To test our hypothesis, we investigated apoptosis-inducing pathways that are activated following inhibition of EGFRs. Herein we report that treatments of cells with ERRP that results in inhibition of constitutive activity of EGFR enhances expression of CARP-1 and apoptosis and that tyrosine phosphorylation of CARP-1 is essential for its regulatory function. Our studies also reveal that apoptosis induction by CARP-1 involves elevated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and activation of proapoptotic caspase-9.

A construct encoding the CARP-1-(1–198) protein having tyrosine at position 192 substituted with phenylalanine was generated by subcloning a 0.6-kb PCR-amplified CARP-1 cDNA fragment. This PCR amplification utilized CARP-1 sense oligonucleotide AS-6.1 (1Rishi A.K. Zhang L. Boyanapalli M. Wali A. Mohammad R.M. Yu Y. Fontana J.A. Hatfield J.S. Dawson M.I. Majumdar A.P.N. Reichert U.

The BamHI plus DraI fragment of plasmid clone 16.3 (Table 1) was then replaced with a >0.6-kb PCR-amplified CARP-1 cDNA fragment having a substitution of tyrosine 192 to phenylalanine to generate plasmid clone 60.1 for expression of Myc-His-tagged CARP-1-(1–1150Y192F) protein.

The plasmid 10.2 encodes for a mutant CARP-1 protein that has in-frame deletion of amino acids 151–197. Multiple, independent stable sublines were generated and characterized for expression of wild-type or mutant CARP-1 by Western immunoblots in conjunction with anti-Myc tag antibodies.

In addition, CARP-1 expression was knocked down utilizing an RNA interference (RNAi)-based methodology. Briefly, CARP-1 cDNA sequences from positions 1881–1899 (5′-ACCCTCTCCCGAGGATACA-3′) and 1901–1919 (5′-GCAGCAAGCTGGTCGAGAAG-3′) were directionally subcloned as double-stranded fragments at the unique BamHI and EcoRI sites of the vector plasmid pSIREN-RetroQ (BD Biosciences/Clontech). The plasmids along with the empty vector were transfected into PT-67 cells, and stable, puromycin-resistant sublines were obtained for production of CARP-1 RNAi retroviruses. The retroviral titers were determined as before (1Rishi A.K. Zhang L. Boyanapalli M. Wali A. Mohammad R.M. Yu Y. Fontana J.A. Hatfield J.S. Dawson M.I. Majumdar A.P.N. Reichert U. J. Biol.

For RNAi-mediated CARP-1 knockdown, HBC cells were transduced with retroviral supernatants for 5–7 days, and levels of CARP-1 were determined by Western immunoblotting. In addition, RNAi-transduced cells were either untreated or treated with purified ERRP for an additional 48 h, followed by determination of apoptosis as below. Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, Apoptosis, and Caspase-9 Assays—Logarithmically growing cells were either untransfected or transfected with various plasmids for 24 h, followed by their lysis to prepare protein extracts. In certain instances, cells were treated with immunoaffinity-purified ERRP or commercially available EGFR inhibitor Iressa. For immunoprecipitation, aliquots of cell lysates containing 1.0 mg of proteins were incubated with the indicated antibodies and Sepharose G at 4 °C for 3 h. Immunoprecipitates or the protein extracts were electrophoresed on 9–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by their transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were independently probed with the indicated antibodies per the manufacturer's guidelines and following previously published protocols (14Marciniak D.J. Moragoda L. Mohammad R. Yu Y.

For enrichment of phosphorylated proteins, the cells were first transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant CARP-1 proteins, followed by treatments of cells with immunoaffinity-purified ERRP for various times. Equal amounts (1 mg) of cell lysates were then applied to phosphoprotein enrichment columns; the complexes were washed and eluted following the manufacturer's suggested methodology. The enriched phosphoproteins along with the protein lysate from transfected cells were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer of proteins to the nitrocellulose membranes. Western immunoblot analyses of these complexes were carried out by first probing the membranes with anti-Myc tag antibodies followed by reprobing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In addition, cell lysates were prepared from untreated as well as treated cells to determine apoptosis by utilizing a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Diagnostics). The net absorbances at the suggested wavelengths (A405 nm – A495 nm) were obtained for the lysates derived from treated as well as untreated cells. The histograms indicating levels of apoptosis were generated either by plotting net absorbances or by calculating the “enrichment factor” as described (1Rishi A.K. Zhang L. Boyanapalli M. Wali A. Mohammad R.M. Yu Y. Fontana J.A. Hatfield J.S. Dawson M.I. Majumdar A.P.N. Reichert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33422-33435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Xu H.

In certain instances, cell death was measured by counting acridine orange-ethidium bromide-stained cells (18Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ1990Google Scholar), whereas viabilities of untreated and treated cells were also measured by utilizing a LIVE/DEAD viability/cytotoxicity assay (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). For caspase-9 activation, an equal number of cells from each sample was lysed to obtain cytosolic extracts as per the manufacturer's suggested protocols. The extracts were incubated with labeled substrate (LEHD-pNA), and caspase-9 activity was quantified by measuring light emission at 405 nm by the cleaved chromophore. ERRP Inhibits EGFR and Induces CARP-1 Expression and Apoptosis, whereas Loss of CARP-1 Inhibits Apoptosis by ERRP—Whether and to what extent ERRP inhibition of EGFRs causes apoptosis and the role of CARP-1 in regulating this event were first investigated. We utilized HBC cells that were either transduced with retroviruses expressing ERRP or treated with immunoaffinity-purified recombinant ERRP. PT-67 cells were transfected with pLNCX2-ERRP-Myc-His clone 1 or pLNCX2 vector plasmids followed by the selection of multiple, independent neomycin-resistant sublines. Expression of ERRP in 10 independent sublines was analyzed by Western immunoblot using anti-Myc tag antibodies (not shown). PT-67 ERRP clone 7 and 10 sublines were found to express the highest levels of ERRP and were chosen for further experiments. The retroviral titers were determined as detailed before (1Rishi A.K. Zhang L. Boyanapalli M. Wali A. Mohammad R.M. Yu Y. Fontana J.A. Hatfield J.S. Dawson M.I. Majumdar A.P.N. Reichert U. J. Biol.

Each PT-67 ERRP subline produced retroviruses with a titer of ∼0.5 × 104 colony-forming units/ml, whereas pLNCX2 vector subline 1 displayed a titer of ∼104 colony-forming units/ml. ERRP causes growth inhibition of a variety of cancer cells, and cell growth inhibition by ERRP involves, in part, induction of apoptosis (15Marciniak D.J. Rishi A.K. Sarkar F.H. Majumdar A.P. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1615-1621PubMed Google Scholar, 16Xu H. Yu Y. Marciniak D.J. Rishi A.K. Sarkar F.H. Kucuk O. Majumdar A.P.N. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Whether retroviral-mediated expression of ERRP causes apoptosis in HBC cells was investigated next. HBC cells were cultured in the absence or presence of retroviruses encoding vector or ERRP for 48 h, and cell lysates were utilized to determine apoptosis. Retroviral transduction of ERRP caused ∼5-fold higher apoptosis when compared with apoptosis noted in untreated or vector-transduced cells (Fig. 1A). In addition, HBC cells were either untreated or treated with 5 μg/ml of purified ERRP protein, and flow cytometric analyses were carried out at the end of the treatment periods to determine the number of live cells or cells undergoing apoptosis. Approximately 4- and 8-fold increased apoptosis was noted in cells treated with ERRP for 12 and 24 h, respectively, when compared with their untreated counterparts (not shown). Since ERRP is a pan-ErbB inhibitor, we further examined whether retroviral transduction of ERRP results in attenuation of constitutive activity of EGFR. HBC cells were cultured in the absence or presence of retroviruses encoding vector or ERRP for various times, followed by determination of activity and expression of EGFR by Western immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, transduction of HBC cells with ERRP results in reduced EGFR activity at as early as 6 h of treatment, whereas reduction of the constitutive EGFR levels was noted after 48 h of transduction with ERRP. Transduction with retroviruses expressing vector over a similar period did not affect either the activity or expression of EGFR. ERRP-dependent inhibition of EGFR activity was further ascertained by treating HBC cells with 5 μg/ml immunoaffinity-purified ERRP for various times followed by determination of constitutive activity and expression of EGFR. Similar to our observations in Fig. 1B, the data revealed time-dependent attenuation of EGFR activity in response to purified ERRP (Fig. 1C). Collectively, our data suggest that retroviral transduction of ERRP results in inhibition of EGFR and induction of apoptosis. These data corroborate our previous observations demonstrating attenuation of EGFR and stimulation of apoptosis of cancer cells by recombinant ERRP (14Marciniak D.J. Moragoda L. Mohammad R. Yu Y. Nagothu K.K. Aboukameel A. Sarkar F.H. Adsay V.N. Rishi A.K. Majumdar A.P.N. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1337-1347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Marciniak D.J. Rishi A.K. Sarkar F.H. Majumdar A.P. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1615-1621PubMed Google Scholar). Whether apoptosis induction by ERRP involves CARP-1 was investigated by transducing cells with ERRP or by treating cells with purified ERRP for various times. Western blot analysis revealed elevated levels of CARP-1 in cells that were either transduced with ERRP (Fig. 2A) or treated with purified ERRP (Fig. 2B). That CARP-1 expression is a target of EGFR signaling was further investigated by inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase activity with Iressa, a pharmacological inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase (12Ritter C.A. Arteaga C.L. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Western immunoblot analysis of proteins derived from cells that were treated with different doses of Iressa for various times revealed a time-dependent increase in CARP-1 expression in the presence of Iressa (Fig. 2C). Thus, data in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that inhibition of EGFRs by ERRP or Iressa results in elevated expression of CARP-1. The role of CARP-1 in regulating ERRP-dependent apoptosis was then examined as below. We first utilized multiple MDA-MB-468 HBC sublines that stably express CARP-1 antisense. They were transduced with retroviruses expressing vector or ERRP, and cell lysates were analyzed for apoptosis. Although treatments with ERRP retroviruses resulted in a modest but statistically significant increase in apoptosis of subline 9 cells when compared with their vector-transduced counterparts, overall ERRP-dependent apoptosis was significantly reduced in sublines 9 and 10 when compared with apoptosis noted in ERRP-transduced sublines 1 and 4 (Fig. 3A). Thus, apoptosis in the presence of ERRP was greatly inhibited in cells that had reduced levels of CARP-1 (sublines 9 and 10) when compared with those with normal levels of CARP-1 (sublines 1 and 4). Moreover, the above HBC sublines expressing reduced CARP-1 also displayed lower apoptosis in response to affinity-purified ERRP when compared with those that expressed normal levels of CARP-1 (not shown). To further validate role of CARP-1 in apoptosis, PT-67 cells were transfected with vector or CARP-1 RNAi plasmids followed by selection of multiple, independent puromycin-resistant sublines. One subline each encoding the vector, CARP-1 RNAi-1 or CARP-1 RNAi-2, was chosen, and viral titers were determined as before (1Rishi A.K. Zhang L. Boyanapalli M. Wali A. Mohammad R.M. Yu Y.

(2004) Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 88, 287–288). Here, we describe a possible mechanistic explanation for this correlation. Because hypoxia in tumors stimulates VEGF expression and secretion we hypothesized that altered BRCA1 protein levels in breast tumors could affect hypoxia-stimulated VEGF promoter activity. This possibility was tested in cells transfected with various combinations of expression plasmids for BRCA1, BRCA1 specific inhibitory RNAs (BRCA1-siRNAs), HIF-1α, and a VEGF promoter-reporter and then incubated in normoxia (21%, O2) or hypoxia (0.1%, O2). As predicted, increased BRCA1 levels enhanced both hypoxia-stimulated VEGF promoter activity and the amounts of VEGF mRNA, as determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real time PCR. Using the ChIP assay, we discovered that BRCA1 could be recruited to the endogenous human VEGF promoter along with HIF-1α following hypoxia. An interaction between BRCA1 and HIF-1α was found in human breast cancer cells. We also found that hypoxia-stimulated VEGF promoter activity and secretion was reduced in cells containing reduced amounts of endogenous BRCA1 protein (obtained by transfecting with BRCA1 siRNAs). A mechanistic explanation for these effects is provided by our finding a reduced half-life and reduced accumulation of HIF-1α in hypoxic cells transfected with BRCA1-siRNAs and that proteasome inhibitors blocked these effects of BRCA1-siRNAs. Thus, our results suggest that normal amounts of BRCA1 function in hypoxia to regulate HIF-1α stability, probably by interacting with HIF-1α.

Although somatic mutations inactivating BRCA1 are rare in sporadic breast cancers, BRCA1 levels are often decreased or undetectable in cells of these cancers.

Although the specific functions of BRCA1 that contribute to tumor suppression remain unknown, functions related to its roles in regulating the cell cycle, transcription and DNA damage repair have been suggested (reviewed in Ref. 4Rosen E.M.

Reports describing new roles for BRCA1 in regulating transcription activity continue to increase. The earliest evidence showed that a conserved acidic domain of BRCA1 can activate transcription in both yeast and mammalian cells when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (5Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Although BRCA1 is not known to bind directly to specific DNA sequences, it may regulate transcription through several indirect mechanisms; by interacting with components of the basal transcription factor (e.g. RNA helicase A and RNA pol II), by interacting with transcription coactivators and corepressors (e.g. p300 and its functional homolog CBP (the CREB-binding protein), retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), by interacting with RB-associated proteins (RbAp46/48), by interacting with several histone deacetylases (HDAC-1/2), and/or by interacting with sequence-specific transcription factors (e.g. p53, c-Myc, estrogen receptor, and other proteins)) (6Anderson S.F.

Crago A. Chung J. Wendt M.A. Shaw L.M. Robinson G. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5736-5740PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF expression is regulated by estradiol. A recent study shows that BRCA1 interacts with ER-α to inhibit estrogen-induced VEGF expression and secretion (20Kawai H. Li H. Chun P. Avraham S. Avraham H.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7730-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In response to hypoxia, HIF-1α, a major hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, becomes stabilized, translocates into the nucleus, binds to ARNT, forming HIF-1α·ARNT heterodimers (21Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). The heterodimeric complex acts as a transcription factor, regulating a variety of hypoxia-inducible target genes, including VEGF (22Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether and how BRCA1 affects hypoxia-induced VEGF expression or secretion. Cell Culture and Reagents—The human breast cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-10A, and T47D) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, and the human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T) was obtained from the Tissue Culture Shared Resource, at Georgetown University (Washington, D. C.). All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum (10%), l-glutamine (5 mm), non-essential amino acids (5 mm), penicillin (100 units per ml), and streptomycin (100 mg per ml). All cell culture reagents were obtained from Bio Whittaker (Walkersville, MD). Several proteasome inhibitors, including ALLN, MG115 and epoxomycin were purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Subcellular Fractionation—Biochemical fractionation of the cells was done using the Nuclear Extract kit (Panomics) following the manufacturer's protocol. MCF-7 cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates were transfected with siRNAs (control versus BRCA1) for 72 h and then incubated in hypoxia for 6 h, when the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice for 10 min in Buffer A mix (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 4% IGEPAL, 10 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture) with shaking. Cells were harvested and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected in a tube; the nuclear pellet remained. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in Buffer B mix (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture) was incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was collected. 25 μg of the cell fractions were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and probed with antibodies against BRCA1 and ARNT. Quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR)—qRT-PCR was performed using ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a standard temperature protocol and 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reagent (Applied Biosystems) in a 20-μl volume in triplicate as previously described (23Xu J. Fan S. Rosen E.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2031-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As a control, the mRNA level of β-actin was determined in the real time PCR assay for each RNA sample and was used to correct for experimental variations. The following primer sequences were used: VEGF121 forward primer was 5′-ccc tga tga gat cga gta cat ctt-3′, and VEGF121 backward primer was 5′-gcc tcg gct tgt cac att tt-3′. The VEGF121 forward primer was also used as the VEGF165 forward primer. The VEGF165 backward primer was 5′-agc aag gcc cac agg gat tt-3′. VEGF121 and VEGF165 are two most abundant VEGF mRNA isoforms. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays were performed as described previously (24Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). β-Actin, whose expression is unaffected by BRCA1 overexpression or hypoxia, was used as a loading control. The PCR products were loaded on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide (0.1 mg per ml), and photographed with a digital camera under UV illumination. Transient Transfection of DNA and Luciferase Assays—The HIF-1α expression vector (pCEP4-HIF-1α), the VEGF promoter-reporter plasmid (pVEGF-kpnI-Luc containing the 2.6-kb VEGF promoter in pGL2), p11wt (the VEGF promoter containing the wild-type HRE in the pGL2 vector), and p11mt (the VEGF promoter containing a mutated HRE in the pGL2 vector) were purchased from ATCC. For assaying promoter activity, subconfluent proliferating cells in 24-well plates were transfected with various expression vector(s) (125 ng per well) and luciferase reporter plasmid (125 ng per well), unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends, using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity values (minus background) were normalized to the control (reporter only) and expressed as means ± S.E. of quadruplicate wells. We repeated these promoter reporter experiments at least three times. Measured luciferase activity levels were normalized to relative transfection efficiencies, which were monitored using the control plasmid pCMV-β-gal as previously described (24Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Transfection of siRNAs—The BRCA1-siRNA-1, BRCA1-siRNA-3, and control (scrambled)-siRNA were previously described (24Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 25Xiong J. Fan S. Meng Q. Schramm L. Wang C. Bouzahza B. Zhou J. Zafonte B. Goldberg I.D. Haddad B.R. Pestell R.G. Rosen E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8668-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These siRNAs were chemically synthesized and provided by Dharmacon (Boulder, CO). For siRNA treatments, subconfluent proliferating cells were transfected with each siRNA (50 nm), using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were incubated with siRNA for 48 or 72 h prior to the start of the experiment (cotransfection with fresh siRNA and a reporter plasmid as described in the figure legends). The control siRNA had no effect on BRCA1 levels and siRNAs (BRCA1 or control) were not toxic to the cells under these experimental conditions, as determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays (data not shown). Alternatively, we used DNA-based siRNA (pKD-negative control (NC) empty vector and pKD-BRCA1 siRNA expression vector) (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western Blotting (WB)—All IP procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells grown on 100-mm dishes were washed twice with 1× PBS before lysis. Then, cells were lysed in a buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and immunoprecipitated with either anti-HIF-1α rabbit polyclonal antibody (H-206, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a combination of anti-BRCA1 mouse monoclonal antibodies against N- and C-terminal epitopes on BRCA1 (Ab-1 + Ab-2 + Ab-3, Oncogene Research Products) as previously described (11Fan S. Wang J.A. Ma Y.X. Yuan R.Q. Meng Q. Erdos M.R. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were run on SDS-PAGE gels, and Western blots were analyzed using anti-HIF-1α mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and anti-BRCA1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary antibodies. Anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Sciences, Inc) was also used for IP and WB to detect transfected GFP-HIF-1α. The membranes were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The bound secondary antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) detection kits using Fuji x-ray films. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was performed according to the protocol provided with the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). MCF-7 and HEK293T cells exposed to hypoxic gas (0.1%, O2) for the times indicated in the figure legends were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min. Then, cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated to yield DNA fragments ranging in size from 200 to 1000 base pairs. Sonicated samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C (13,000 rpm), supernatants recovered, diluted 10-fold into ChIP dilution buffer, and then precleared by incubating with 75 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose-50% slurry for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation to reduce the nonspecific interaction of chromatin DNA with the agarose. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with each antibody (ARNT, HIF-1α, BRCA1) or control IgG. The anti-ARNT rabbit polyclonal antibody was H-172 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The antibodies for HIF-1α and BRCA1 were the same as used for IPs (see above). Immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted from the beads (with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3), the DNA was separated from protein (as described in the ChIP kit), and used as templates for PCR reactions. The genomic primer sequences, designed to amplify the HRE element-containing region of the VEGF promoter, used as previously described (27Beischlag T.V. Taylor R.T. Rose D.W. Yoon D. Chen Y. Lee W.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54620-54628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), were: VEGF forward primer (5′-aca gac gtt cct tag tgt tgg-3′) and VEGF reverse primer (5′-agc tga gaa cgg gaa gct gtg-3′). As negative controls, we used two sets of primers for regions of the genomic VEGF promoter that do not have any known HRE sites, as follows: for NC-1 (negative control primer set 1): forward primer (5′-gga cac cat acc gat gga ac-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ccc ctt ttc ctc caa ctc tc-3′) and for NC-2 (negative control primer set 2): forward primer (5′-gaa ttc tgt gcc ctc act cc-3′) and reverse primer (5′-gta gac atc ttg ggg cag ga-3′). VEGF Secretion Assay—Cells were transiently transfected with either control (scrambled)-siRNA or BRCA1-siRNA as previously described (24Bae I. Fan S. Meng Q. Rih J.K. Kim H.J. Kang H.J. Xu J. Goldberg I.D. Jaiswal A.K. Rosen E.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7893-7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The next day the medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 48 h, cells were exposed to hypoxic gas (0.1%, O2) for an additional 16 h when the supernatants were collected for a VEGF secretion assay, which was measured using a Quantikine human VEGF ELISA immunoassay (R&D Diagnostics, Minneapolis, MN). The values obtained were normalized to the total protein concentration in the total cell extracts prepared from each dish. Hypoxic Treatment—Human cells were dispensed into a 100-mm culture dishes. The dishes were placed in a sealed hypoxia chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) equilibrated with a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere or with certified gas containing 0.1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 (28Yudoh K.

BRCA1 Mutants—The panel of BRCA1 mutant constructs are shown in Fig. 4A. The 5382insC mutant (Q1756term), which is commonly found in Ashkenazi Jews, a population with a significantly increased risk for BRCA1 mutant breast cancers (29Fodor F.H. Weston A. Bleiweiss I.J.

The C5365G mutant, (p1749R) encodes a full-length BRCA1 protein containing a point mutation in the C-terminal TAD region that abolishes TAD activity (5Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13595-13599Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The 5677insA mutant, (Y1853term), encodes a near full-length BRCA1 protein that is missing only the last 11 amino acids. This mutation reduces TAD activity. The T300G mutant (61Cys → Gly), encodes a full-length protein whose single point mutation inactivates the N-terminal RING finger domain function (11Fan S. Wang J.A. Ma Y.X. Yuan R.Q. Meng Q. Erdos M.R. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Statistical Methods—Statistical comparisons (of densitometer tracings of digital images (of either agarose gels or x-ray films) or of graphically determined half-lives from each of three independent experiments) were made using the two-tailed Student's t test where appropriate. The symbols used in the figures (*) and (**), indicate p < 0.05 and p < 0.005, respectively. Effects of BRCA1 on HIF-1α Transcriptional Activity—In this study, a concentration of 0.1% O2 was used to induce hypoxia. This hypoxic condition is physiologically relevant, for some breast cancer tissues have extremely low O2 concentrations (0 to 0.3% O2) (32Vaupel P. Schlenger K. Knoop C. Hockel M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3316-3322PubMed Google Scholar, 33Vujaskovic Z. Rosen E.L. Blackwell K.L. Jones E.L. Brizel D.M. Prosnitz L.R. Samulski T.V. Dewhirst M.W. Int. J.

To determine if BRCA1 affects hypoxia-induced VEGF expression, we used a VEGF promoter-reporter system. Following transient co-transfection with HIF-1α and pVEGF-kpnI-Luc, reporter plasmid activity was measured after 6 h of hypoxia. Higher reporter activity under our hypoxic conditions was observed in extracts of HIF-1α-transfected cells than in extracts of cells lacking the HIF-1α expression vector. Co-transfection of MCF-7 cells with BRCA1 and the HIF-1α expression vector further enhanced activity from the VEGF promoter construct (Fig. 1A). The amount of this effect depends on the amount of BRCA1 plasmid DNA (Fig. 1A). Thus, under hypoxia, a statistically significant effect on reporter activity was observed when only HIF-1α was overexpressed, and this effect was significantly more enhanced when BRCA1 was also overexpressed. To determine if this ability of BRCA1 to enhance HIF-1α-induced VEGF promoter activity requires the presence of a functional HRE (hypoxia response element) in the VEGF promoter, cells were co-transfected with three plasmids, BRCA1, HIF-1α, and a VEGF reporter plasmid containing either a wild-type HRE (p11wt) or an HRE containing a point mutation (p11mt) and then incubated under hypoxic conditions and assayed for luciferase reporter activity. The results show that exogenous BRCA1 has no independent ability to enhance activity from a VEGF promoter under hypoxic conditions when this promoter contains a mutation blocking its responsiveness to exogenous HIF-1α (Fig. 1B). This finding suggests that BRCA1 may alter VEGF promoter activity via protein-protein interactions rather than by protein-DNA interactions. To directly determine whether the BRCA1-enhanced, HRE-dependent VEGF reporter activity reflects, at least in part, increased transcription, we measured the effect of overexpressed BRCA1 on endogenous VEGF mRNA levels. For this test, HEK293T cells were transfected with BRCA1 or empty vector and exposed to hypoxic conditions for 6 h when total RNA was isolated and used for semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2, A and B) and quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 2C). As expected, we found that BRCA1 increased the amounts of the two most abundant endogenous isoforms of VEGF mRNA (VEGF121 and VEGF 165) in cells exposed to hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2) (p < 0.005 for comparisons of cells transfected with pCDNA3 versus BRCA1 under hypoxia).FIGURE 2Effects of BRCA1 on the endogenous levels of hypoxia-induced VEGF121 and VEGF165 mRNA. A, agarose gel analysis. Exponentially proliferating HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (pCDNA3) or the BRCA1 expression vector, incubated for 24 h and then exposed to hypoxia (0.1%, O2) for 6 h when total RNA was extracted used for semiquantitative RT-PCR. The gel image presented is representative of three independent experiments. B, quantitative analysis of agarose gel densitometry data. Each PCR band on photographs of the three agarose gels was quantitated using densitometry, and means ± S.E. of these values were calculated. BRCA1 overexpression significantly enhanced hypoxia-induced VEGF121 and VEGF165 mRNA expression (p < 0.005 for comparisons of cells transfected with or without BRCA1 in 0.1% O2). C, confirmation of PCR results. Real time PCR were performed in quadruplicate in three independent experiments to confirm the findings shown in A and B. β-Actin was used as the loading control for semiquantitative RT-PCR and to normalize the quantitative real time PCR results. The results were normalized to the control (reporter only) in 21% O2 and are presented as bar graphs showing the means ± S.E. The effect of overexpressing BRCA1 on hypoxia-induced VEGF expression is statistically significant for both VEGF mRNAs (p < 0.005).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) BRCA1 Is Recruited to VEGF Promoter Regions—ChIP was used to identify and quantitate interactions of proteins with specific genomic regions. Because BRCA1 is known to regulate transcriptional activity by directly interacting with various transcription factors, it is possible that BRCA1 (and other factors) are recruited to the endogenous VEGF promoter during hypoxia. Indeed, significantly increased binding of HIF-1α, ARNT, and BRCA1 to the promoter region of the endogenous (wild type, HRE-containing) VEGF promoter was found in both MCF-7 and HEK293T cells after either 6 or 16 h of hypoxia (Fig. 3, A and B)(p < 0.005 for each protein in cells incubated in hypoxia versus normoxia). The negative control, rabbit IgG, could not precipitate detectable amounts of chromatin containing VEGF promoter DNA. Combined, these results suggest that the observed enrichment of VEGF promoter sequences in ChIPs precipitated by specific antibodies reflect increased interaction between the targeted proteins and genomic VEGF promoter DNA. Our two sets of negative control primers (VEGF-NC1 and VEGF-NC2), from regions of the genomic VEGF promoter that do not have any known or putative HRE binding sites, did not yield detectable amounts of VEGF promoter DNA under any of the tested conditions (Fig. 3C). BRCA1 Sequences Important for Regulating the Enhanced VEGF Promoter Activity—To begin identifying regions(s) of BRCA1 important for regulating VEGF-reporter plasmid activity under hypoxic conditions we used the panel of BRCA1 mutant constructs shown in Fig. 4A. Two of the BRCA1 mutants (5677insA and C5365G) significantly (but only partially) impaired BRCA1 ability to enhance hypoxia-mediated VEGF expression (p < 0.005 or 0.05), one (T300G) was completely defective (p < 0.005) and one (5382insC) had no detectable defect in stimulating hypoxia-induced VEGF (Fig. 4B). These differences cannot be explained simply as differences in BRCA1 protein levels produ"
https://openalex.org/W2047778958,"The spokes are intermittently appearing radial markings in Saturn's B ring that are believed to form when micrometer-sized dust particles are levitated above the ring by electrostatic forces. First observed by the Voyagers, the spokes disappeared from October 1998 until September 2005, when the Cassini spacecraft saw them reappear. The trajectories of the charged dust particles comprising the spokes depend critically on the background plasma density above the rings, which is a function of the solar elevation angle. Because the rings are more open to the Sun now than when Voyager flew by, the charging environment above the rings has prevented the formation of spokes until very recently. We show that this notable effect is capable of stopping spoke formation entirely and restricting the size of the particles in the spokes."

https://openalex.org/W1975512387,"Insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells occurs by sequential cellular processes, including glucose metabolism, electrical activity, Ca2+ entry, and regulated exocytosis. Abnormalities in any of these functions can impair insulin secretion. In the present study, we demonstrate that inhibition of proteasome activity severely reduces insulin secretion in the mouse pancreatic β-cell line MIN6-m9. Although no significant effects on glucose metabolism including ATP production were found in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, both glucose- and KCl-induced Ca2+ entry were drastically reduced. As Ca2+-ionophore-induced insulin secretion was unaffected by proteasome inhibition, a defect in Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) is the likely cause of the impaired insulin secretion. We found that the pore-forming α-subunit of VDCCs undergoes ubiquitination, which does not decrease but slightly increases expression of the α-subunit protein at the plasma membrane. However, electrophysiological analysis revealed that treatment with proteasome inhibitors results in a severe reduction in VDCC activity in MIN6-m9 cells, indicating that VDCC function is suppressed by proteasome inhibition. Furthermore, insulin secretion in isolated mouse pancreatic islets was also decreased by proteasome inhibition. These results demonstrate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a critical role in insulin secretion by maintaining normal function of VDCCs.

These results demonstrate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a critical role in insulin secretion by maintaining normal function of VDCCs. Insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is regulated by a variety of extracellular stimuli and intracellular signals (1Wollheim C.B.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Regulated exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules is triggered by a rise in the intracellular (cytosolic) Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) 3The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+ concentration; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium channel; KATP, ATP-sensitive potassium; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; Cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 3The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+ concentration; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium channel; KATP, ATP-sensitive potassium; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; Cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5; BSA, bovine serum albumin. (3Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells, elevation of [Ca2+]i occurs by release of Ca2+ from intracellular pools such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and secretory granules and/or by influx of extracellular Ca2+ mainly through voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) (4Wollheim C.B.

However, insulin secretion is induced by many secretagogues including glucose, sulfonylureas, and glucose-dependent potentiators such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide-1, and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, all of which depend critically on Ca2+ entering the pancreatic β-cells through the VDCCs, as these secretions are abolished by specific VDCC channel blockers (4Wollheim C.B.

We previously established two different mouse pancreatic β-cell sublines from MIN6 cells, which facilitate study of the mechanisms of impaired insulin secretion (8Minami K. Yano H. Miki T.

One of them is MIN6-m9, a model of normal β-cells having insulin secretory properties similar to those of pancreatic islets, and the other is MIN6-m14, which exhibits abnormalities in glucose metabolism, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, and VDCCs that impair insulin secretion (8Minami K.

In the course of comparing these sublines, we found that several genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system are down-regulated in MIN6-m14 cells and that inhibition of proteasome activity impairs insulin secretion in MIN6-m9 cells (9Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Jatkoe T.A. Burant C.F. Seino S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: A336Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is an energy (ATP)-dependent and well regulated system of proteolysis (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). Misfolded or otherwise unnecessary proteins are subjected to degradation in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Many proteins and cellular functions are currently known to be regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that pathway(s) leading to insulin secretion are affected by the system. Recently, it was reported that KATP channels undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD) via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that proteasome inhibition increases the channel number at the plasma membrane (11Yan F.F. Lin C.W. Cartier E.A. Shyng S.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 289: C1351-C1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, that study did not investigate the effect of proteasome inhibition on insulin secretion. Functional expression of KATP channels is essential for normal insulin secretion, as they link glucose metabolism to insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells by depolarizing the plasma membrane and opening the VDCCs (12Seino S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 337-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified the target molecules responsible for impaired insulin secretion because of proteasome inhibition. We found that both glucose- and high KCl-induced Ca2+ entry are severely suppressed in the presence of proteasome inhibitors and that VDCC activity is diminished by proteasome inhibition. These results demonstrate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is critical in insulin secretion by maintaining normal function of VDCCs. Cell Culture and Treatment with Proteasome Inhibitors—MIN6-m9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum under humidified condition of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C (8Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.-Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.-I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 or epoxomicin (13Saito Y. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 120: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H.B. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) (both from Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan), for 6 h in culture medium. E-64-d (Peptide Institute), an inhibitor of cysteine proteases that does not inhibit proteasome (15Tamai M. Matsumoto M. Omura S. Koyama I. Ozawa Y. Hanada K. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1986; 9: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), was used as a negative control. Because these inhibitors were dissolved with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), all culture media including control condition (without inhibitors) contained Me2SO at 0.1% in final concentration. Measurement of Insulin Secretion—Cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were pre-exposed to proteasome inhibitors for 6 h. The cells then were washed with HEPES-balanced Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRH: 119 mm NaCl, 4.74 mm KCl, 2.54 mm CaCl2, 1.19 mm MgCl2, 1.19 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% BSA (BSA-KRH) and preincubated for 30 min in the same buffer containing 1 mm glucose. Incubation was performed with various concentrations of glucose or other stimuli as indicated for 1 h at 37°C. A calcium ionophore, A23187 (10 μm; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), was added to the incubation buffer in some experiments. Released and intracellular insulin were quantified as described (8Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.-Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.-I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of insulin secretion was normalized by cellular insulin content or total protein content. Measurement of Glucose Utilization—Glucose utilization was measured according to the method described by Ishihara et al. (16Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3081-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 500 μl of BSA-KRH with various concentrations of glucose (1, 10, 25 mm) containing 5 and 20 μCi/ml [5-3H]glucose for the lower (1 mm) and higher (10, 25 mm) glucose concentration, respectively. After incubation, 100 μl of incubation buffer was mixed with 20 μl of 1 n HCl in a microcentrifuge tube. The tubes were placed in 22-ml plastic scintillation vials containing 600 μlof distilled water to allow [3H]H2O in the tubes to equilibrate with the water in the vials. After a 36-h incubation at 37 °C, 10 ml of ACS II scintillation fluid (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the vials. The rate of glucose utilization was calculated as reported (16Ishihara H. Asano T. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Miyazaki J. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3081-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Cellular ATP Content—For measurement of ATP content, cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of 25 mm glucose. The cells then were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized. The amount of ATP was measured with ATP bioluminescent assay kit (Roche Diagnostics), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2 AM) (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 1 h in BSA-KRH. [Ca2+]i was measured by dual excitation wavelength method (340/380 nm) with a fluorometer (Fluoroskan Ascent CF, Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) (17Minami K. Yokokura M. Ishizuka N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25277-25282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i was calibrated using solutions containing known Ca2+ concentrations (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Construction of pCMV-α1C-FLAG and pCIneo-β3—cDNA for rabbit α1C (Cav1.2)-subunit of VDCC (18Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) was introduced into pCMV-Tag4 plasmid containing C-terminal FLAG epitope tag (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pCIneo-β3 was constructed with pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI) and the rat β3-subunit of VDCC (18Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were co-transfected with pCMV-α1C-FLAG and pCIneo-β3 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and cultured for 2 days. After exposure to proteasome inhibitors for 6 h, the cells were harvested and sonicated in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque) and centrifuged at 20,400 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). To collect FLAG-tagged protein, the cell lysate (750 μg of protein) was added to 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) to a total volume of 1 ml, and the reaction was gently rotated overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with Tris-buffered saline, proteins were eluted in 30 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%), and resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and probed with anti-ubiquitin antibody FK1 or FK2 (Nippon Bio-Test Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). Secondary antibodies used were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Alternatively, ubiquitinated proteins were collected by Ubiquitinated Protein Enrichment Kit (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and followed by immunoblotting with anti-Cav1.2 antibody (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel). Expression of the cellular Cav1.2-subunit was detected in both intact and transfected cell lysates. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were scraped into a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with protease inhibitors) and sonicated. The 700 × g pellet, which contained nuclei and undisrupted cells, was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min. The resultant pellet (plasma membrane-enriched fraction) was resuspended in the same volume of lysis buffer with 1% Triton X-100 (17Minami K. Yokokura M. Ishizuka N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25277-25282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Biotinylation and collection of cell surface proteins was carried out using a cell surface protein biotinylation and purification kit (Pierce). Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-Cav1.2 antibody (Alomone). Na+/K+-ATPase detected with anti-Na+/K+-ATPase antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was used as a marker for cell surface protein. Anti-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) was used to confirm the absence of intracellular proteins in the biotinylated protein fraction. Electrophysiology—Whole cell VDCC currents were recorded as described previously (8Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Wang C.-Z. Tanaka H. Miyazaki J.-I. Seino S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E773-E781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ba2+ was used as a charged carrier for measurement of VDCC currents. The extracellular solution contained 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 20 mm 4-aminopyridine, 110 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 140 mm methanesulfonate, and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained 10 mm CsCl, 130 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm MOPS, and 5 mm Mg-ATP, pH 7.2. The holding potential was –70 mV, and test pulses of 400 ms at potentials between –40 and +60 mV in steps of 10 mV were applied every 4 s. Recordings were performed using Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) at 37 °C. For normalization, the currents were divided by the membrane capacitance measured for each cell. Islet Isolation and Batch Incubation—Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion followed by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Isolated pancreatic islets were exposed to 1 μm MG-132 or 0.1 μm epoxomicin for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Islets were then washed and preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in BSA-KRH with 2.8 mm glucose. The islets were incubated in the buffer containing various stimuli for 30 min. Cellular insulin was extracted with acid-ethanol. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as means ± S.E. The significance of differences between test groups was evaluated by use of paired Student's t test or multiple analysis of Tukey-Kramer's test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Impairment of Glucose-induced Insulin Secretion by Proteasome Inhibition—Our preliminary data indicated that inhibition of proteasome activity impairs insulin secretion in mouse pancreatic β-cell line MIN6-m9 (9Minami K. Yano H. Miki T. Nagashima K. Jatkoe T.A. Burant C.F. Seino S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: A336Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects of proteasome inhibition in MIN6-m9 cells in detail. Proteasome activity was blocked by either MG-132 (13Saito Y. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 120: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or epoxomicin (14Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H.B. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), both of which are well established proteasome inhibitors. Optimum duration of exposure and concentrations of these inhibitors were determined by preliminary experiments (data not shown). When MIN6-m9 cells were exposed to 1 μm MG-132 for 6 h, glucose-induced insulin secretion was markedly reduced (Fig. 1A). The other proteasome inhibitor, epoxomicin at 0.1 μm, exerted similar effects (Fig. 1A). E-64-d, a thiol protease inhibitor that does not suppress proteasome activity (15Tamai M. Matsumoto M. Omura S. Koyama I. Ozawa Y. Hanada K. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1986; 9: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), showed no significant effects on insulin secretion in MIN6-m9 cells, even when an excessive concentration of the agent (100 μm) was applied (Fig. 1A). These data demonstrate that inhibition of proteasome activity causes impairment of glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Cellular insulin content also was influenced by proteasome inhibition. When MIN6-m9 cells were exposed to either MG-132 or epoxomicin, the insulin content of the cells was reduced to ∼70% of the levels in the control condition (Fig. 1B). However, the drastic suppression of insulin secretion by proteasome inhibitors cannot be explained by the moderate reduction of insulin content. Thus, these results indicate that inhibition of proteasome activity in pancreatic β-cells impairs cellular functions that lead to exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules. Effects of Proteasome Inhibitors on Glucose Utilization and Intracellular ATP Contents—In pancreatic β-cells, glucose is taken up by specific transporters and metabolized to generate ATP, leading to closure of the KATP channels and activation of VDCCs (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar). As a result, Ca2+ entry through the VDCCs triggers exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of proteasome inhibition on glucose utilization and intracellular ATP contents after glucose loading. As shown in Fig. 2A, the rate of glucose utilization was unaltered by the presence of MG-132 or epoxomicin at any of the glucose concentrations examined (1, 10, and 25 mm), indicating that proteasome inhibition does not exert a significant effect on glycolytic pathways in MIN6-m9 cells. We then measured intracellular ATP contents after 25 mm glucose stimulation in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitors. Neither MG-132 nor epoxomicin affected intracellular ATP contents (Fig. 2B), suggesting that proteasome activity is not required for glucose-stimulated ATP production in MIN6-m9 cells. These data indicate that the reduction of glucose-induced insulin secretion by proteasome inhibition in MIN6-m9 cells is not caused by impairment of glucose metabolism and suggest that the major defects lie in steps after glucose metabolism in the insulin secretion signaling pathway. Defect in Elevation of [Ca2+]i through VDCCs—To bypass glucose metabolism, glibenclamide and a high concentration of KCl (30 mm) were used to stimulate insulin secretion. Glibenclamide is the sulfonylurea widely used in treatment of type 2 diabetes, which binds to SUR1, a regulatory subunit of the KATP channels in pancreatic β-cells and depolarizes the β-cell membrane (19Miki T. Nagashima K. Seino S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 22: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although insulin secretion was markedly increased by 100 nm glibenclamide in the absence of proteasome inhibitors, pretreatment with MG-132 or epoxomicin nearly abolished the stimulation in MIN6-m9 cells (Fig. 3A). A high concentration of KCl directly depolarizes the β-cell membrane and activates the VDCCs, which allows Ca2+ influx. Insulin secretion was remarkably stimulated by the depolarizing concentration of KCl under control condition but was significantly reduced in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that Ca2+ influx through VDCCs is impaired by proteasome inhibition. To confirm this, we measured changes in [Ca2+]i in response to KCl. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, the KCl-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was significantly suppressed compared with that in the absence of inhibitors (Fig. 3B). The glucose-induced increase in [Ca2+]i also was reduced by proteasome inhibition (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that Ca2+ entry through VDCCs is impaired by proteasome inhibition in MIN6-m9 cells. We then investigated to determine whether a rise in [Ca2+]i when VDCCs are closed causes insulin secretion in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. We utilized A23187, a specific membrane carrier ionophore for divalent cations, which allows Ca2+ entry without the channels being open (20Reed P.W. Lardy H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6970-6977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When MIN6-m9 cells were treated with A23187, insulin secretion was increased at a low glucose concentration (3 mm) (Fig. 3C). A23187 also increased insulin secretion to the same extent from cells exposed to proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the Ca2+-responsive exocytotic machinery of insulin-containing granules is not severely impaired, if at all, by proteasome inhibition. Considered together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of proteasome activity in MIN6-m9 cells affects VDCC function. Ubiquitination of VDCCs—Proteasome inhibition can result in accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Many of the transporters and channel proteins are ubiquitinated, and, in some cases, subcellular localization and function are regulated by ubiquitination (21Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the pore-forming subunits of voltage-dependent sodium channels, the structures of which are closely related to VDCCs, are known to undergo ubiquitination (22Rougier J.S. van Bemmelen M.X. Bruce M.C. Jespersen T. Gavillet B. Apotheloz F. Cordonier S. Staub O. Rotin D. Abriel H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C692-C701Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), ubiquitination of VDCCs has not been reported. Accordingly, we examined the ubiquitination of α-subunits of VDCCs. MIN6-m9 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged α-subunit of VDCC (fCav1.2) together with β3 subunit (Caβ3), and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-FLAG antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies (FK1 and FK2). FK1 recognizes only polyubiquitinated proteins, whereas FK2 recognizes both mono- and polyubiquitinated proteins (23Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, ubiquitinated forms of fCav1.2 were detected at very low levels in the absence of proteasome inhibitors. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, the accumulation of ubiquitinated fCav1.2 protein was clearly detected by both antibodies (Fig. 4). To further confirm ubiquitination of Cav1.2, we immunoprecipitated polyubiquitinated proteins of the cell lysates with polyubiquitin affinity beads, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Cav1.2 antibody. Signals of fCav1.2 were detected by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that the α-subunits of VDCCs undergo polyubiquitination. Change in Quantity of VDCCs—The loss of Ca2+ entry might be because of either reduction in the quantity of the VDCCs (total or at plasma membrane) or the quality (intrinsic activity) of the channels. We first evaluated the total amount of α-subunits of VDCCs. Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Cav1.2 antibody. In both intact and transfected conditions, Cav1.2 protein signal intensity was not reduced but rather slightly increased by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 5A), probably because of a decrease in their degradation. We then examined the effects of proteasome inhibition on cell surface expression of VDCCs. Two different experiments were conducted to detect VDCCs in the plasma membrane. Subcellular fractionation by serial centrifugation (17Minami K. Yokokura M. Ishizuka N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25277-25282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) revealed a slight increase rather than a reduction in plasma membrane expression of VDCCs by proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 5A). In addition, we specifically labeled cell surface proteins with biotin, and the biotinylated proteins were collected using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads. We confirmed that pretreatment with proteasome inhibitors did not cause a reduction but did cause a slight increase in α-subunit protein levels in the cell surface protein fraction of MIN6-m9 cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the loss of Ca2+ entry is not because of reduction in quantity of VDCCs. Impairment of VDCC Activity by Proteasome Inhibition—We then evaluated activity of the VDCCs using patch clamp technique. The current-voltage relationships of VDCCs were recorded in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitors. VDCC currents were drastically decreased by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 6A). The peak currents of VDCCs in MIN6-m9 cells exposed to proteasome inhibitors were significantly lower than in control cells (Fig. 6B). These data demonstrate that inhibition of proteasome activity in MIN6-m9 cells results in a loss of VDCC activity that results in impaired insulin secretion. Effect of Proteasome Inhibition on Insulin Secretion in Isolated Islets—Isolated mouse pancreatic islets were used to determine whether proteasome activity also is involved in insulin secretion in normal pancreatic β-cells. Although cellular insulin content was decreased only slightly (Fig. 7A), both glucose- and high K+-induced insulin secretions were significantly suppressed by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 7B). A23187-induced insulin secretion was not affected by proteasome inhibition (Fig. 7B), as found in MIN6-m9 cells. These results indicate that the proteasome system is essential for normal regulation of insulin secretion in primary β-cells as well as in the β-cell line MIN6-m9. In the present study, we show that inhibition of proteasome activity causes a marked reduction of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Although it was previously found that glucose-stimulated proinsulin biosynthesis is reduced by proteasome inhibition (24Kitiphongspattana K. Mathews C.E. Leiter E.H. Gaskins H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15727-15734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), no studies have been reported concerning the roles of the proteasome system in signaling pathways of insulin secretion. As proper insulin secretory response requires multiple cellular functions including glucose-sensing, ATP production, metabolism-electrical activity coupling, and regulated exocytos"

IGFBP-5 is also found in the nuclei of cultured cells and has transactivation activity. Here we report the nuclear localization of endogenous IGFBP-5 in mouse embryonic skeletal cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that IGFBP-5 interacts with the nuclear histone-DNA complex. Using a series of deletion mutants, the transactivation domain of IGFBP-5 was mapped to its N-terminal region. Intriguingly, the transactivation activity of IGFBP-5 is masked by negative regulatory elements located in the L- and C-domains. Among the other IGFBPs, the N-domains of IGFBP-2 and -3 also had strong transactivation activity, whereas those of IGFBP-1 and -6 had no activity. The IGFBP-4 N-domain had modest activity. Sequence analysis revealed several amino acids in the IGFBP-5 N-domain that are not present in IGFBP-1. The activities of mutants in which these residues were changed to the corresponding IGFBP-1 sequence were determined. Mutations that changed acidic residues to neutral residues (e.g. E8A, D11S, E12A, E30S/P31A, E43L, and E52A) or a polar to a basic residue (e.g. Q56R) significantly reduced transactivation activity. The E8A/D11S/E12A triple mutant and E52A/Q56R double mutants showed further reduced activity. The combinatory mutants had essentially no transactivation activity. Taken together, our results indicate that there are several conserved residues in the IGFBP-5 N-terminal region that are critical for transactivation and that IGFBP-2 and -3 also have strong transactivation activity in their N-domains.

Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). The bioavailability and bioactivity of IGFs are regulated by their interactions with various members of the IGFBP family. IGFBPs all have a highly cysteine-rich N-terminal (N)-domain, a cysteine-rich C-terminal (C)-domain, and a middle linker (L)-domain with no cysteine residues except in IGFBP-4. The N- and C-domains are highly conserved within the IGFBP family, whereas the L-domain varies both within the family and across species. Besides binding to IGF and modulating its actions, IGFBP-5 has been reported to regulate cell proliferation (2Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. J. Biol.

Although the ligand-dependent actions of IGFBP-5 are attributed to its interactions with the IGF ligand and other proteins (1Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar), the mechanistic basis of the ligand-independent actions of IGFBP-5 is not yet understood. Andress et al. (12Andress D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E744-E750PubMed Google Scholar) used IGFBP-5 affinity chromatography to purify a 420-kDa membrane protein from human osteoblast cells and proposed that it was an IGFBP-5 receptor. The same study reported that IGFBP-5 stimulated serine/threonine phosphorylation of this putative receptor in vitro, which in turn phosphorylated casein, a known serine/threonine kinase substrate. However, the molecular nature of this putative IGFBP-5 receptor remains elusive, and whether this protein is present in other cell types is unknown. An additional mechanism underlying the actions of IGFBP-5 is suggested by its localization in the nucleus. When added to cultured human bone tumor and breast cancer cells, exogenous IGFBP-5 has been shown to be capable of cellular and nuclear entry (13Schedlich L.J. Young T.F. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18347-18352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Likewise, a peptide corresponding to the nuclear localization sequence of IGFBP-5 (residues 201–218) fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein to the nucleus (14Schedlich L.J.

These experimental observations are consistent with the presence of a consensus nuclear localization sequence in IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-3 (15Radulescu R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that IGFBP-5 may interact with Four and a Half LIM protein 2 (FHL2) and retinoid X receptor, nuclear proteins known to be involved in transcriptional regulation (16Amaar Y.G.

Leong G.M. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that 1) endogenous IGFBP-5 is localized in the nucleus of cultured porcine vascular smooth muscle cells; 2) several basic residues in the IGFBP-5 C-domain are necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization of the intact protein; and 3) the IGFBP-5 N-domain activates transcription independent of IGF (18Xu Q. Li S. Zhao Y. Maures T.J. Yin P. Duan C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: E46-E54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that IGFBP-5 is present in the nucleus and may affect gene expression independent of the IGF ligand. The objectives of this study are to 1) determine whether IGFBP-5 interacts with the histone-DNA complex; 2) define the IGFBP-5 transactivation domain and determine the specific amino acids critical for its transactivation activity; and 3) to investigate whether other IGFBPs have similar transactivation activity. Our results indicate a physical association of IGFBP-5 with the histone-DNA complex in the nucleus. We have identified several key residues in the IGFBP-5 N-terminal region that are critical for its transactivation activity. In addition to IGFBP-5, the N-domains of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-2 also possess strong transactivation activity. Materials—All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) unless noted otherwise. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, streptomycin, and trypsin were purchased from Invitrogen. The IGFBP-5 polyclonal antibody raised in guinea pig was a generous gift from Dr. David R. Clemmons, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The M2 anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma, and Cy3-conjugated second antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Plasmid Constructs—To generate Gal4DNA binding domain (DBD) and IGFBP fusion protein constructs, DNA fragments encoding various portions of human IGFBP-1, -2, -4, -5, and -6 and bovine IGFBP-3 were generated by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of the pBind vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to fuse the IGFBP in-frame to the C terminus of Gal4DBD. C-terminal deletion or point mutants were generated by PCR using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For this, pBind-IGFBP-5 or pBind-IGFBP-5N was used as template. 0.2 mm of each PCR primer, 0.2 mm of dNTP, 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase, and Pfu DNA polymerase reaction buffer were used to mutagenize the template DNA by PCR (95 °C for 1 min; 95 °C for 50 s, 60 °C for 50 s, and 68 °C for 7 min, for 18 cycles; and then 68 °C for 7 min) in a total volume of 50 μl. Each reaction was incubated with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. The names and sequences of the primers used are shown in Supplemental Table 1S. To generate the IGFBP-5:FLAG expression construct, DNA encoding mature human IGFBP-5 was amplified by PCR (forward primer: ATGCGGCCGCCACCATGGCACTGGGCTCCTTCGTGCAC; reverse primer: TAGGATCCCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCTCAACGTTGCTGCTGTC), and subcloned into pCMV-tag1 (Stratagene) using the NotI and BamHI sites. Similarly, a FLAG:IGFBP-5 expression construct was engineered by subcloning. The IGFBP-5 L+C:FLAG DNA (containing residues 81–252 of human IGFBP-5) was amplified by PCR using ATGGATCCACCATGCTCAACGAAAAGAGC (forward primer) and TAGGATCCCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCTCAACGTTGCTGCTGTC (reverse primer), and subcloned into pCMV-tag1 using the BamHI site to generate the IGFBP-5LC:FLAG plasmid. All purified plasmids were sequenced at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core Facility. Cell Culture and One-hybrid Transcription Activation Assay—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and U2 osteosarcoma (OS) cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in a humidified-air atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For transfection, 0.5 × 106 HEK293 cells were seeded into each well of 6-well plates (Falcon, Corning, NY). 500 ng of pBind or pBind-IGFBP DNA and 500 ng of Gal4 reporter (pG5-luc) DNA were transfected into cells as described previously (18Xu Q. Li S. Zhao Y. Maures T.J. Yin P. Duan C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: E46-E54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For co-transfection experiments, a mixture of pBind or Gal-IGFBP-5N (500 ng) and pCMV-tag1, IGFBP-5:FLAG, or IGFBP-5L+C: FLAG DNA (100, 200, or 500 ng) was used. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 500 μlof lysis buffer (Promega). Transcription activation was quantified using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Firefly luciferase activity was divided by Renilla luciferase activity to normalize for transfection efficiency. Transcriptional activity was expressed as -fold increase over the pBind (Gal4DBD alone) control group. Western Immunoblotting and Immunocytochemistry Analysis—For Western immunoblotting, equal amounts of protein were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45-μm pore size, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was performed following a published method (19Duan C. Liimatta M.B. Bottum O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37147-37153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine the possible nuclear localization of endogenous IGFBP-5, normal mouse embryo costal cartilage sections, obtained from the University of Michigan Transgenic Core facility, were subjected to immunocytochemical analysis using an IGFBP-5 polyclonal antibody (1:250 dilution) and Cy3-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson Immuno-Research). The sections were counterstained by SYTO13, a nuclear dye. To verify the nuclear presence of IGFBP-5:FLAG and IGFBP-5LC: FLAG, immunostaining was carried out in cells transfected with pCMV-tag1, IGFBP5:FLAG, or IGFBP5LC:FLAG. One day after the transfection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. They were then incubated with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated antimouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were washed, counterstained with 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—To determine the possible association of IGFBP-5 with the histone-DNA complex, wild-type or U2OS cells stably transfected with the FLAG:IGFBP-5 construct were fixed in fresh 5 mm dimethyl-3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate-2HCl for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing with 100 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, the cells were further fixed in 1% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 37 °C and lysed using nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). After breaking the chromatin into average length of 2 kb using a sonicator (Fisher Scientific model 60), the cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold using ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl) and precleared using 20 μl of protein G-agarose (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). Subsequently, 2 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-histone H3 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), mouse IgG, or rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, 20 μlof protein G beads was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h. The beads were spun down and rinsed twice. The immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western immunoblot using the anti-FLAG or anti-Histone H3 antibody. Statistical Analysis—Values are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significance difference test using Statview (Abacus Concept, Inc.). Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. IGFBP-5 Is Physically Associated with the Histone-DNA Complex in the Nucleus—To determine whether endogenous IGFBP-5 is present in the nucleus in an in vivo setting, immunocytochemical analysis was performed in mouse embryo costal cartilage sections using a specific IGFBP-5 polyclonal antibody. The sections were counterstained by SYTO13, a nuclear dye. As shown in Fig. 1A, IGFBP-5 immunoreactivity was clearly detected in the nuclei, indicating that endogenous IGFBP-5 is localized in the nuclei of cartilage cells in mouse embryos. To investigate whether IGFBP-5 interacts with DNA in the nucleus, ChIP assays were carried out in U2OS cells stably transfected with FLAG:IGFBP-5. When introduced into U2OS cells, FLAG:IGFBP5 signal was detected exclusively in the nucleus, co-localized with the histone H3 signal (Fig. 1B). As shown in the upper panel in Fig. 1C, the anti-histone H3 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate FLAG:IGFBP-5 (lane 4) in the FLAG:IGFBP-5 transfected but not the wild-type control cells (lane 8). This interaction was specific, because neither rabbit IgG nor mouse IgG was able to immunoprecipitate FLAG:IGFBP-5 (lanes 5 and 6) and the anti-FLAG antibody was able to pull down IGFBP-5 only in the transfected cells (lane 3). Likewise, the anti-FLAG antibody specifically pulled down histone 3 (Fig. 1C, lower panel) in the transfected cells (lane 4) but not in the control cells (lane 8). These results suggest that IGFBP-5 is localized in the nucleus and that the nuclear IGFBP-5 is physically associated with the histone-DNA complex. IGFBP-5 Transactivation Domain Is Located in the N-terminal Region and Is Masked by Negative Regulatory Elements in the L- and C-domains—To map the location of the transactivation domain in human IGFBP-5, a series of truncated IGFBP-5 fragments were generated and fused to Gal4DBD. The transactivation activities of these fusion proteins were measured after transfection into HEK293 cells together with a Gal4 reporter construct. As shown in Fig. 2, the human IGFBP-5 N-domain (IGFBP-5-(1–80)) fusion protein caused a Gal4-dependent transactivation 21.72 ± 1.07-fold greater than the pBind control group (n = 5, p < 0.01). pBind-IGFBP-5-(1–60) caused a similar increase (26.27 ± 1.49, n = 5, p < 0.01). This activity is evolutionarily conserved because zebrafish IGFBP-5 N-domain, but not human or zebrafish IGFBP-1 N-domain, had significant transactivation activity (18Xu Q. Li S. Zhao Y. Maures T.J. Yin P. Duan C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: E46-E54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the longer fragments of IGFBP-5-(1–100) and IGFBP-5-(1–120) only had modest transactivation activity (5- to 6-fold), whereas IGFBP-5-(1–169) had no transactivation activity. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed the expression of these fusion proteins (Fig. 2B). When the activity of full-length human IGFBP-5-(1–252) was tested, it had no transactivation activity. In fact, it significantly reduced the reporter activity to 0.17 ± 0.02-fold, equating to a 5.9-fold repression (p < 0.01, Fig. 3A). These data suggest that the IGFBP-5 transactivation domain is located within the N-terminal 60 amino acids and that transactivation activity is suppressed or masked by negative regulatory element(s) located in the L- and C-domains. To test this idea further, IGFBP-5 L-(amino acid 81–169) and C-domains (amino acid 170–252) were fused to Gal4DBD, and their activities were determined in the same assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, IGFBP-5 L-domain and C-domain both had significant repressing activity (3.04 ± 0.30-fold, and 3.22 ± 0.28-fold, both n = 5, p < 0.01). The expression levels of these fusion proteins were similar (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3IGFBP-5 L- and C-domains have transcriptional repression activity. A, full-length (hBP5), L-(hBP5L), and C-domain (hBP5C) of human IGFBP-5 were fused to the Gal4DBD and introduced into HEK293 cells together with a Gal4 reporter plasmid by transient transfection. Transcriptional activity was determined and the transcriptional repressor activity is expressed as -fold decrease over the pBind control group. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = 5). *, p < 0.01 compared with the pBind control group. The expression levels of various IGFBP-5-Gal4DBD fusion proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-Gal4 antibody and are shown in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the L- or C-domains of IGFBP-5 negatively regulate transactivation activity of the N-domain of IGFBP-5 an intermolecular interactions, the C-terminally FLAG-tagged IGFBP-5 and IGFBP-5L+C constructs were generated. When introduced into HEK293 cells, IGFBP-5:FLAG and IGFBP-5L+C:FLAG were detected exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4 (B and C), nuclear expression of neither IGFBP-5:FLAG nor IGFBP-5L+C:FLAG significantly inhibited the activity of pBind-IGFBP-5N. Several Conserved Residues in the IGFBP-5 N-terminal Region Are Important for Its Transactivation Activity—Although the N-domains of IGFBP-5 and -1 share high sequence identity, only the N-domain of IGFBP-5 has transactivation activity, and this activity is evolutionarily conserved (Ref. 18Xu Q. Li S. Zhao Y. Maures T.J. Yin P. Duan C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: E46-E54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig. 7). Taking advantage of this finding, we compared the amino acid sequences of these two highly homologous proteins to map the sequence determinants of the transactivation activity of the IGFBP-5 N-domain. Transactivation domains are often rich in acidic (20Abedi M. Caponigro G. Shen J. Hansen S. Sandrock T. Kamb A. BMC Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Ma J.

Hoeth M. Binder B.R. de Martin R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e80Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the N-terminal region of IGFBP-1 and -5 revealed several conserved proline and acidic residues unique to IGFBP-5 (Fig. 5A). For instance, Pro22 and Pro31 are conserved between human and zebrafish IGFBP-5, but are not present in human IGFBP-1. Pro22 in particular is located in a cluster of three proline residues, Pro19-Pro20-Ser21-Pro22. Several acidic residues, including Glu8, Asp11, Glu30, and Glu43, are found in human and zebrafish IGFBP-5, whereas the corresponding residues in human IGFBP-1 are neutral (Fig. 5A). Likewise, Glu12 and Glu52 in human IGFBP-5 are neutral amino acids in IGFBP-1. A polar amino acid in IGFBP-5, Gln56, corresponds to the basic Arg in IGFBP-1 (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5Several unique residues in human IGFBP-5 N-domain are important for its transactivation activity.

B, relative transactivation activities of various single or double mutants compared with that of the wild-type IGFBP-5 N-domain. Mutants E8A, D11S, E12A, P22S, E26S, E30S/P31A, E43L, E52A, and Q56R were generated by changing the human IGFBP-5 residues to the corresponding IGFBP-1 sequence. These mutant constructs were introduced into HEK293 cells together with a Gal4 reporter plasmid by transient transfection. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = 3 ∼ 5). *, p < 0.01 compared with the wild-type IGFBP-5 N-domain (hBP5N) group. The expression levels of these mutant fusion proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-Gal4DBD antibody and are shown in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether any of these residues unique to human IGFBP-5 are critical for its transactivation activity, we mutated each to the corresponding human IGFBP-1 sequence. The effects of these mutations on transactivation activity are shown in Fig. 5B. Mutation of Pro22 to Ser did not decrease transactivation activity, suggesting that this proline residue play little role in the transactivation activity. In contrast, mutation of Glu8 to Ala significantly decreased transactivation to 71.0 ± 7.1% of that of the wild-type IGFBP-5 N-domain (n = 5, p < 0.01). The transactivation activities of mutants D11S, E12A, E43L, and E52A were also significantly reduced relative to wild-type IGFBP-5 N domain (all p < 0.01, Fig. 5B). Mutation of the non-conserved Glu26 to Ser caused a modest reduction in transactivation activity, but this reduction did not reach statistical significance. Mutation of the polar amino acid Gln56 to Arg strongly reduced transactivation activity (46.4 ± 3.3%, n = 5, p < 0.01). These data indicate that several acidic residues and Gln56 are important for transactivation. Western immunoblot analysis revealed that expression levels of these mutant fusion proteins were similar (Fig. 5C), thus excluding the possibility that these changes were due to different levels of protein expression or degradation. We next generated several double and triple mutants. The E30S/P31A mutant had significantly reduced activity compared with that of the wild-type IGFBP-5 N-domain (79.4 ± 11.3%, n = 5, p < 0.01, Fig. 5B). The transactivation activities of the E8A/D11S/E12A triple mutant and E52A/Q56R double mutant were 19.3 ± 0.9% and 19.8 ± 1.4% of that of the wild type IGFBP-5 N-domain (both p < 0.01, n = 3, Fig. 6A). These values are significantly lower than those of the corresponding single mutations (p < 0.05). These results suggest that residues Glu8, Asp11,Glu12, Glu30/Pro31,Glu43,Glu52, and Gln56 are important for transactivation activity. The combinatory effects of mutating the acidic residues were examined by generating mutants E8A/D11S/E12A/E43L, E43L/E52A/Q56R, and E8A/D11S/E12A/E52A/Q56R. As shown in Fig. 6A, these mutants acted like the IGFBP-1 fusion protein in that they had essentially no transactivation activity (E8A/D11S/E12A/E43L: 7.8 ± 1.5%; E43L/E52A/Q56R: 9.5 ± 2.0%; E8A/D11S/E12A/E52A/Q56R: 5.2 ± 0.9%, all n = 5). Again, no marked differences were found in the expression levels of these mutant proteins (Fig. 6B). Transactivation Activity of Other IGFBPs—Because nuclear localization has also been reported for IGFBP-3 and -2 (13Schedlich L.J. Young T.F. Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. J. Biol.

We therefore investigated the activity of the other five members of the IGFBP gene family. As shown in Fig. 7A, the bovine IGFBP-3 N-domain caused a significant 17.39 ± 0.62-fold (p < 0.01, n = 3) increase over the pBind control. This activity was essentially the same as that of the human IGFBP-5 N-domain (17.44 ± 2.31, n = 5). Like IGFBP-5, the transactivation activity of IGFBP-3 appeared to be conserved, because zebrafish IGFBP-3 had strong activity (data not shown). Human IGFBP-2 N-domain also showed significant activity (10.90 ± 1.77-fold, n = 5, p < 0.01 compared with pBind control). In contrast, no activity was observed for human IGFBP-1 N-domain (1.70 ± 0.38-fold, n = 5) or IGFBP-6 N-domain (1.12 ± 0.26-fold, n = 5). The N-domain of human IGFBP-4 had modest transactivation activity (6.04 ± 0.98-fold, n = 5, p < 0.05). These results indicate that IGFBP-5, -3, -2, and possibly -4, but not IGFBP-1 or -6, possess a transactivation domain in their N-domains. Ligand-independent effects of IGFBP-5 on cell growth, migration, and apoptosis/survival have been documented in a number of cell types (2Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. J. Biol.

It hosts a number of genes mutated in specific cancers, movement disorders and, potentially, Alzheimer's disease. An analysis of the finished sequence of human chromosome 12 representing 4.5% of the human genome determines that chromosome 12 hosts a number of genes mutated in specific cancers, as well as movement disorders and potentially Alzheimer's disease. Human chromosome 12 contains more than 1,400 coding genes1 and 487 loci that have been directly implicated in human disease2. The q arm of chromosome 12 contains one of the largest blocks of linkage disequilibrium found in the human genome3. Here we present the finished sequence of human chromosome 12, which has been finished to high quality and spans approximately 132 megabases, representing ∼4.5% of the human genome. Alignment of the human chromosome 12 sequence across vertebrates reveals the origin of individual segments in chicken, and a unique history of rearrangement through rodent and primate lineages. The rate of base substitutions in recent evolutionary history shows an overall slowing in hominids compared with primates and rodents."

Considering that almost all the HNK-1 carbohydrate structures so far determined in the nervous system are sulfated, we hypothesized that GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S functionally associates with HNK-1ST, which results in efficient sequential biosynthesis of HNK-1 carbohydrate. In this study, we demonstrated that both GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S were co-immunoprecipitated with HNK-1ST with a transient expression system in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that these enzymes are mainly co-localized in the Golgi apparatus. To determine which domain is involved in this interaction, we prepared the C-terminal catalytic domains of GlcAT-P, GlcAT-S, and HNK-1ST, and we then performed pulldown assays with the purified enzymes. As a result, we obtained evidence that mutual catalytic domains of GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S and HNK-1ST are important and sufficient for formation of an enzyme complex. With an in vitro assay system, the activity of HNK-1ST increased about 2-fold in the presence of GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S compared with that in its absence. These results suggest that the function of this enzyme complex is relevant to the efficient sequential biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate.

Glycosylation is one of the major post-translational protein modifications, especially for cell surface proteins, that play important roles in a variety of cellular functions, including recognition and adhesion.

HNK-1 carbohydrate is expressed on several glycoproteins and glycolipids and is considered to be involved in cell migration, recognition, and adhesion. The unique structural feature of this carbohydrate is a sulfated trisaccharide (HSO3-3GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc) (3Voshol H. van Zuylen C.W. Orberger G. Vliegenthart J.F. Schachner M. J. Biol.

To investigate the biological function of HNK-1 carbohydrate in vivo, we generated GlcAT-P gene-deficient mice and revealed that HNK-1 carbohydrate is involved in synaptic plasticity (11Yamamoto S.

In the nervous system, however, all the HNK-1 carbohydrate structures identified so far are sulfated forms because of the presence of glucuronyltransferases (GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S) and HNK-1ST (13Gallego R.G. Blanco J.L. Thijssen-van Zuylen C.W. Gotfredsen C.H. Voshol H. Duus J.O. Schachner M. Vliegenthart J.F. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The fact that only the existence of HNK-1ST is sufficient for the sulfation of HNK-1 carbohydrate and that a nonsulfated form has not been detected in brain leads us to hypothesize that GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S interacts with HNK-1ST, resulting in sequential and efficient biosynthesis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate. Oligosaccharides expressed on glycoproteins and glycolipids are biosynthesized by glycosyltransferases in a stepwise manner. Recently, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi resident glycosyltransferases and related proteins, such as epimerase, sulfotransferase, and sugar-nucleotide transporters, were found to associate physically and functionally both for retention in the ER or Golgi and for regulation of their enzymatic activities (15de Graffenried C.L.

In many cases, the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, membrane-spanning domain, or stem region, but not the C-terminal catalytic domain, is needed and sufficient for formation of a complex. In this study, we investigated whether or not GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S interacts with HNK-1ST by using a transient expression system in CHO cells and by performing immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, we examined the effects of the interaction on their catalytic activities in vitro and in vivo. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) M6749 was a generous gift from Dr. H.

Rat HNK-1ST cDNA was amplified by PCR with the primer pair listed below using pBluescript/HNK-1ST as a template to create SalI sites at both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding sequence of HNK-1ST, and then cloned into the SalI site of multicloning site B in pIRES/P (pIRES/P+ST). Rat GlcAT-S cDNA was released from pEF-BOS/GlcAT-S (6Seiki T. Oka S. Terayama K. Imiya K. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The catalytic domain of human HNK-1ST (HNK-1STcat, from Leu63 to the C terminus) was cloned into pGIR201-prot.A using cDNAs amplified by PCR using the primers listed below. pGIR201-prot.A-HNK-1STcat was then digested with NheI. The NheI DNA fragment consisting of the insulin signal sequence, the IgG-binding domain of protein A, and HNK-1STcat was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pEF-BOS, that had been digested with XbaI (pEF-BOS-prot.A-STcat). Construction of plasmids for expression of FLAG-Pcat (from T58 to the C terminus) and FLAG-Scat (from A50 to the C terminus) was described previously (17Kakuda S. Oka S. Kawasaki T.

CHO cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C until 50-80% confluency. For transfection, cells were plated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes, grown overnight, and then transfected with various expression constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, a 2.5-fold volume of FuGENE 6 and 4 μgof each DNA were incubated with 300 μlof α-minimum Eagle's for 15 min at room temperature in a polystyrene tube, and then the mixture was added to the tissue culture dishes. Cells were collected 24 h after transfection and lysed with lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). After centrifugation, the clarified lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG rabbit pAb (Sigma) or anti-EGFP rabbit pAb (Clontech) for 1 h. The mixture was then incubated with protein G-Sepharose TM4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h with gentle shaking. The beads were precipitated by centrifugation (500 × g for 3 min) and then washed three times with an excess volume of wash buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were rinsed with PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol, and then incubated in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 mouse mAb (Sigma) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes). The cells were then visualized and digitized with a Fluoview laser confocal microscope system (Olympus, Japan). Proteins were separated by 5-20% gradient SDS-PAGE with the buffer system of Laemmli and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, and then protein bands were detected with ECL (Pierce) using a Luminoimage Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fuji). COS-1 cells plated on 100-mm tissue culture dishes were transfected with pEF-BOS-prot.A or pEF-BOS-prot.A-HNK-1STcat (10 μg each) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. After 6 h of incubation, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen), followed by incubation for another 3 days. Culture medium containing secreted proteins was applied to a normal human IgG-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Unbound proteins were washed out with more than 10 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and sequentially with 2 column volumes of 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 5.0. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.4, and then immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The catalytic domains of human GlcAT-P and human GlcAT-S were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (17Kakuda S. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Prot.A-STcat and protein A were purified from COS-1 cell culture media as described above. An aliquot (125 ng) of each protein was added to 250 μl of buffer (100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MnCl2), and then the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37°C. A fraction of the mixture was recovered for Western blot analysis, and normal IgG-Sepharose was added to the rest of the mixture followed by incubation for 2 h. The beads were precipitated by centrifugation (500 × g for 3 min) and then washed three times with an excess volume of buffer. Proteins bound to beads were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG M2 mAb. Glucuronyltransferase activity toward asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) was measured essentially as described previously (18Kakuda S. Sato Y. Tonoyama Y. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Before adding to the reaction mixture, FLAG-Pcat or FLAG-Scat was incubated with or without an equivalent amount of prot.A-STcat at 37 °C for 30 min for enzyme complex formation. Then the preincubated enzyme solution was added to the assay reaction mixture as described previously (18Kakuda S. Sato Y. Tonoyama Y. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For this assay, we prepared an acceptor substrate, GlcA-ASOR, by transferring glucuronic acid to ASOR with GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S. FLAG-Pcat and FLAG-Scat (750 ng each) were added to 3 ml of the reaction mixture (100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm ATP, 20 mm MnCl2, 3 mg of ASOR, 1.2 μmol of UDP-GlcA), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 6 h. 375 ng of FLAG-Pcat and FLAG-Scat were then added to the mixture, followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight. The prepared mixture was dialyzed against an excess volume of sterile water. FLAG-Pcat and FLAG-Scat were then removed with a Blue-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Under these conditions, about 9.1 mol of GlcA was transferred to 1 mol of ASOR. The purified prot.A-STcat was incubated with or without an equivalent amount of FLAG-Pcat or FLAG-Scat at 37 °C for 30 min for enzyme complex formation. The preincubated enzyme solution was then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a reaction mixture with a final volume of 50 μl consisting of 20 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 20 μg of GlcA-ASOR, and 100 μm [35S]adenosine 3′-phosphate, 5′-phosphosulfate (300,000 dpm). After incubation, the assay mixture was spotted onto a 2.5-cm Whatman No.1 disk. The disk was washed with a 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution three times, followed by ethanol/ether (2:1, v/v), and then with ether. The disk was air-dried, and then the radioactivity of [35S]HSO3-GlcA-ASOR was counted with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS-6000). Co-immunoprecipitation of GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S and HNK-1ST— HNK-1 carbohydrate is highly expressed in the nervous system. The HNK-1 carbohydrate structures on P0 and NCAM, which are major carrier glycoproteins in the peripheral and central nervous systems, respectively, have been determined (13Gallego R.G. Blanco J.L. Thijssen-van Zuylen C.W. Gotfredsen C.H. Voshol H. Duus J.O. Schachner M. Vliegenthart J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30834-30844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Liedtke S. Geyer H. Wuhrer M. Geyer R. Frank G. Gerardy-Schahn R. Zahringer U. Schachner M. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All the HNK-1 carbohydrate structures so far determined are sulfated, i.e. sulfoglucuronic acid attached to N-acetyllactosamine, a nonsulfated form of HNK-1 carbohydrate not having been found on such molecules. These results indicate that most of the HNK-1 carbohydrate in the nervous system is expressed as a sulfated form. These results suggest the possibility that the HNK-1 carbohydrate biosynthetic key enzymes, glucuronyltransferases (GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S) and sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST), associate with each other, which results in efficient sequential biosynthesis. To investigate the interaction between the glucuronyltransferases (GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S) and HNK-1ST, FLAG-tagged glucuronyltransferases (FLAG tag fused at N terminus of each glucuronyltransferase, FLAG-P or FLAG-S) and EGFP-tagged HNK-1ST (EGFP fused at C terminus of HNK-1ST, ST-EGFP) were transiently expressed in CHO cells. Western blot analysis using the cell lysates revealed that each enzyme was detected at around the position of the expected molecular weight with anti-FLAG mAb (40-50 kDa) and anti-EGFP mAb (70 kDa), respectively (Fig. 1A). However, one major band and a few minor bands were detected for each enzyme. The major band corresponded to a fully glycosylated enzyme and the minor bands to partially glycosylated enzymes because they converged as one band with N-glycosidase F digestion (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, bottom panel, HNK-1 carbohydrate was expressed on several glycoproteins in CHO cells co-expressing both FLAG-P or FLAG-S and ST-EGFP (lanes 4 and 5), indicating that these fusion enzymes have enzymatic activity. However, the immunoreactive bands for the cells expressing FLAG-S (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, lane 5) were weaker than for those expressing FLAG-P (lane 4), suggesting that the activity of FLAG-P is greater than that of FLAG-S and/or that the N-terminal FLAG tag may have a little effect on the GlcAT-S activity. Next, these enzymes in CHO cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG rabbit pAb or anti-EGFP rabbit pAb, and then Western blot analyses were performed with anti-FLAG mouse mAb and anti-EGFP mouse mAb, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B, both FLAG-P and FLAG-S were co-precipitated with ST-EGFP (upper panel, lanes 7 and 9) and vice versa (lower panel, lanes 8 and 10), indicating that each glucuronyltransferase bound with HNK-1ST and formed an enzyme complex in CHO cells. Co-localization of Glucuronyltransferases and HNK-1ST in CHO Cells—To investigate co-localization of glucuronyltransferases and HNK-1ST in CHO cells, we examined the immunofluorescence staining of the CHO cells. FLAG-P and FLAG-S were stained with anti-FLAG mAb (Fig. 2, A and D), and ST-EGFP was visualized according to its own EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 2, B and E). As shown in Fig. 2, C and F, both FLAG-P and FLAG-S were co-localized with HNK-1ST in CHO cells. These enzymes were mainly localized in the Golgi apparatus because they were co-localized with a Golgi marker, wheat germ agglutinin (data not shown). Binding Specificities as to Formation of These Enzyme Complexes—To investigate the binding specificities of these interactions, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using other glycosyltransferases instead of GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S. We used FLAG-tagged GlcAT-I (Fig. 3, A and B) involved in the biosynthesis of the linkage region of glycosaminoglycans, and GlcAT-I exhibits amino acid sequence similarity with GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S (19Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We expected that GlcAT-I would not bind to HNK-1ST, but FLAG-GlcAT-I (FLAG-I) was detected in the anti-EGFP pAb immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 5), and ST-EGFP was detected in anti-FLAG pAb immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3B, lower panel, lane 6), indicating that GlcAT-I also bound with HNK-1ST, as in the case of GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S. Next we used FLAG-tagged ST3GalIV (Fig. 3, C and D), which is a sialyltransferase and transfers sialic acid to the nonreducing terminal of N-acetyllactosamine residues on glycoproteins (20Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is thought to compete with GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S for the acceptor substrates, i.e. the nonreducing terminal of N-acetyllactosamine residues. As shown in Fig. 3D (upper panel, lane 5, and lower panel, lane 6), the interaction of ST3GalIV with HNK-1ST was almost negligible compared with that of GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S with HNK-1ST, indicating that ST3GalIV did not form a complex with HNK-1ST. These results suggest that GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S bind specifically with HNK-1ST and that the interaction of GlcAT-I with HNK-1ST may have some biological significance in vivo. To examine the binding specificity of sulfotransferases, we used two sulfotransferases, C4ST1 and GalNAc4ST1, both of which belong to the HNK-1ST family (21Yamauchi S. Mita S. Matsubara T. Fukuta M. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8975-8981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Okuda T. Mita S. Yamauchi S. Fukuma M. Nakano H. Sawada T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40605-40613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An EGFP tag was fused with these sulfotransferases at their C termini, and then they were co-expressed with FLAG-tagged GlcAT-P in CHO cells. By using these cell lysates, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses were carried out (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, FLAG-P was not detected in the anti-EGFP pAb immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4B, upper panel, lanes 3 and 5), and both C4ST1-EGFP and GalNAc4ST1-EGFP were barely detected in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4B, lower panel, lanes 4 and 6), suggesting that the interactions of both C4ST1 and GalNAc4ST1 with GlcAT-P are considerably weaker than that of HNK-1ST with GlcAT-P. We also confirmed that GlcAT-S was not co-immunoprecipitated with either C4ST1 or GalNAc4ST1 (data not shown). As described above, ST3GalIV, C4ST1, and GalNAc4ST1 did not bind or barely bound with HNK-1 biosynthetic enzymes (GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S and HNK-1ST). However, it is possible that these overexpressed enzymes showed the abnormal subcellular localization because of their fused tags; therefore, they may not have had the opportunity to encounter their counterparts in CHO cells. To exclude this possibility, we examined their intracellular localization by means of immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5). FLAG-I and FLAG-ST3GalIV were stained with anti-FLAG mAb (Fig. 5, A and D). C4ST1-EGFP and GalNAc4ST1-EGFP were visualized according to their own EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 5, H and K). As shown in Fig. 5, A, D, H, and K, they were mainly localized in the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that the fused tags had no influence on their intracellular transport. Even if they were considerably co-localized with their counterparts as shown in Fig. 5, C, F, I, and L, they would not interact with each other (Figs. 3D and 4B). These lines of evidence indicate the specific interaction of GlcAT-P or GlcAT-S with HNK-1ST. GlcAT-P (or GlcAT-S) and HNK-1ST Form a Complex through Their Catalytic Domains—As shown in Fig. 3, GlcAT-I as well as GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S interacted with HNK-1ST. These three glucuronyltransferases have a type II membrane topology as in the case of other glycosyltransferases, i.e. an N-terminal short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, a stem region, and a catalytic region. GlcAT-I exhibits amino acid sequence similarity with GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S, the highest homology being seen in the catalytic domain. Thus, we hypothesized that the C-terminal catalytic domain of these enzymes is involved in the interaction with HNK-1ST. To examine this hypothesis, we prepared truncated enzymes only consisting of their catalytic domains. The FLAG-tagged human GlcAT-P catalytic domain (FLAG-Pcat, T58 to C terminus) and FLAG-tagged human GlcAT-S catalytic domain (FLAG-Scat, A50 to C terminus) were expressed in E. coli cells, and then purified as described previously (17Kakuda S. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The protein A-tagged human HNK-1ST catalytic domain (prot.A-STcat, Leu63 to C terminus) was expressed in COS-1 cells and purified from the culture medium on a normal human IgG-Sepharose column. We then performed pulldown assays using the purified enzymes (Fig. 6). FLAG-Pcat or FLAG-Scat was mixed in a tube with prot.A-STcat or protein A (as a control), and then the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After the incubation, prot.A-STcat or protein A was precipitated with normal IgG-Sepharose, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG mAb (Fig. 6, bottom panel). An aliquot of the incubation mixture was taken before adding the IgG-Sepharose and was used for Western blot analysis to show the amounts of FLAG-Pcat, FLAG-Scat, prot.A-STcat, and protein A in the mixture (Fig. 6, top and middle panels). As shown in Fig. 6, bottom panel, no band was detected with anti-FLAG mAb when only FLAG-Pcat (lane 1), FLAG-Scat (lane 2), or prot.A-STcat (lane 3) was present in the mixture, as expected. However, when prot.A-STcat was mixed with FLAG-Pcat (Fig. 6, bottom panel, lane 4) or FLAG-Scat (lane 5), intense signals were clearly detected, suggesting that both FLAG-Pcat and FLAG-Scat bound with prot.A-STcat. Furthermore, no band was detected even if purified protein A instead of prot.A-STcat was used (lanes 6-8), indicating that the fused tags (i.e. FLAG and protein A) were irrelevant as to the binding. These results revealed that the catalytic domain was sufficient for formation of an enzyme complex and that the binding was direct because the pulldown assays were performed using the purified enzymes. Effect of the Interaction on the Glucuronyltransferase and Sulfotransfe"
https://openalex.org/W2104928345,"Reactive oxygen species, such as the superoxide anion, H2O2, and the hydroxyl radical, have been considered as cytotoxic by-products of cellular metabolism. However, recent studies have provided evidence that H2O2 serves as a signaling molecule modulating various physiological functions. Here we investigated the effect of H2O2 on the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling in rat cortical astrocytes. H2O2 triggered the generation of oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a concentration-dependent manner over the range 10–100μm. The H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and were prevented by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin. The H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were not inhibited by pretreatment with ryanodine but were prevented by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and caffeine, known antagonists of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. H2O2 activated phospholipase C (PLC) γ1 in a dose-dependent manner, and U73122, an inhibitor of PLC, completely abolished the H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. In addition, RNA interference against PLCγ1 and the expression of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sequestering “sponge” prevented the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations. H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations and PLCγ1 phosphorylation were inhibited by pretreatment with dithiothreitol, a sulfhydryl-reducing agent. Finally, epidermal growth factor induced H2O2 production, PLCγ1 activation, and [Ca2+]i increases, which were attenuated by N-acetylcysteine and diphenyleneiodonium and by the overexpression of peroxiredoxin type II. Therefore, we conclude that low concentrations of exogenously applied H2O2 generate [Ca2+]i oscillations by activating PLCγ1 through sulfhydryl oxidation-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that this mechanism underlies the modulatory effect of endogenously produced H2O2 on epidermal growth factor-induced Ca2+ signaling in rat cortical astrocytes.

H2O2 is a member of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), 6The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; PLCγ1, phospholipase Cγ1; [Ca2+], intracellular Ca2+i concentration; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SERCA, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase; PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase; PLCβ1, phospholipase C β1; DTT, dithiothreitol; DPI, diphenyleneiodonium; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; Prx II, peroxiredoxin type II; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PSS, physiological salt solution; 2-APB, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate; MEM, minimum essential medium; RNAi, RNA interference. which cause oxidative damage to cellular components such as lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. Therefore, H2O2 has generally been considered to be cytotoxic and hazardous to living organisms. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that H2O2 serves as an intracellular signaling molecule modulating various physiological functions (1Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7592) Google Scholar). Cells possess mechanisms that can rapidly synthesize and destroy H2O2 in response to receptor stimulation. For example, stimulation of membrane receptors of various growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-β1, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) triggers the rapid and transient production of H2O2 (2Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 3Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T.

H2O2 generated in response to receptor stimulation has been shown to play an important role in regulating various normal cell functions, such as cell proliferation, platelet aggregation, and vasodilation (6Sobey C.G.

In addition to this, exogenous addition of H2O2 at low concentrations affects the functions of various ion channels and other proteins involved in signal transduction (8Varela D. Simon F. Riveros A.

Lett. 2004; 356: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, H2O2 fulfills the prerequisites for being considered as a genuine intracellular messenger. Recently, a great deal of attention has focused on the sensitivity of the mechanisms responsible for Ca2+ mobilization in response to changes in the cellular redox state. Ca2+ plays a pivotal role in the regulation of a diverse range of cellular functions, such as muscle contraction, secretion, synaptic plasticity, cell proliferation, and cell death (11Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4486) Google Scholar). Many hormones and neurotransmitters increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) by mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular stores and by inducing an influx from the extracellular space (12Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar, 13Putney J.W. Jr-Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 has been shown to enhance the activity of L-type Ca2+ channels (10Akaishi T. Nakazawa K. Sato K. Saito H. Ohno Y. Ito Y. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 356: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Peroxide can also stimulate the mobilization of Ca2+ in many cell types by modifying Ca2+ release channels, such as TRPM2 (14Wehage E. Eisfeld J. Heiner I. Jungling E. Zitt C. Luckhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23150-23156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), ryanodine receptors (15Favero T.G. Zable A.C. Abramson J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25557-25563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca2+ channels (16Hu Q. Zheng G. Zweier J.L. Deshpande S. Irani K. Ziegelstein R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15749-15757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, H2O2 can modify the activity of Ca2+ pumps involved in Ca2+ homeostasis, such as the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) (17Redondo P.C. Salido G.M. Rosado J.A. Pariente J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (17Redondo P.C. Salido G.M. Rosado J.A. Pariente J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, enzymes involved in Ca2+ signaling pathways, such as phospholipase C (PLC) γ1 (18Wang X.T. McCullough K.D. Wang X.J. Carpenter G. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28364-28371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and phospholipase D (19Servitja J.M. Masgrau R. Pardo R. Sarri E. Picatoste F. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are also targets. However, most of the previous studies employed high concentrations of H2O2, and it is questionable whether such diverse actions of H2O2 on calcium signaling also occur under normal physiological conditions. Therefore, it will be of great value to identify the target molecules modulated by physiologically relevant concentrations of H2O2. Astrocytes, the major glial cell type in the mammalian brain, participate in a variety of important functions in the central nervous system. As in virtually all other cell types, astrocytes also use Ca2+ signaling to mediate a large spectrum of physiological responses. Elevation of [Ca2+]i in response to stimulation of various receptors causes the release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and ATP, and plays an important role in the exchange of information with neurons and the regulation of local blood flow (20Hansson E. Ronnback L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 21Newman E.A. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 536-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In contrast to Ca2+ signaling, much less attention has been given to redox signaling in astrocytes. Because ROS are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and astrocytes have been shown to possess high antioxidant activities, many studies have focused on the protective roles of astrocytes against oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death (22Tanaka J. Toku K. Zhang B. Ishihara K. Sakanaka M. Maeda N. Glia. 1999; 28: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 23Wang X.F. Cynader M.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1434-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 24Takuma K. Baba A. Matsuda T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 72: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, despite the lack of information about the physiological roles of ROS in astrocytes, NADPH oxidase was shown to be involved in the generation of H2O2 and cell survival in this cell type (25Liu Q. Kang J.H. Zheng R.L. Cell Biochem. Funct. 2005; 23: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Given the widespread involvement of H2O2 in modulating Ca2+ signaling cascades, it is tempting to speculate that astrocytes may also use redox signaling to modify their Ca2+ signaling. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to investigate the roles of H2O2 in Ca2+ signaling in cultured rat astrocytes. Our results indicate that a low, physiologically relevant concentration of H2O2 (30 μm) induces [Ca2+]i oscillations in a PLCγ1- and IP3-dependent manner. In addition, H2O2 produced endogenously by EGF receptor stimulation is involved in the modulation of Ca2+ signaling in rat astrocytes. Materials—H2O2, dithiothreitol (DTT), thapsigargin, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), ryanodine, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), caffeine, histamine, EGF, U73122, U73343, and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF) were purchased from Sigma. Minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 100 mg/liter sodium succinate and 75 mg/liter succinic acid, trypsin-EDTA, Opti-MEM, penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester was purchased from Teflabs (Austin, TX). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. The polyclonal antibody against PLCγ1 and monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (PY783) of PLCγ1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-PLCβ1 polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Shmuel Muallem (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). Cell Cultures—Primary cultures of cortical astrocytes were prepared from neonatal (12–24 h) Wistar rats. Briefly, cortices were dissected, and the tissues were minced and mechanically dissociated. Then the isolated cells were plated on 60-mm culture dishes and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air for 2–3 weeks. For [Ca2+]i measurements, cells were cultured on 0.01% poly-l-lysine-coated cover glasses in 60-mm dishes for 7–10 days. The culture medium consisted of MEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 25 mm glucose, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 25 ng/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The culture medium was replaced every 3 days. Cells were serum-starved for 2 days before each experiment. Expression of IP3 Sponge and Peroxiredoxin Type II (Prx II)—Astrocytes were transiently transfected with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged high affinity (R441Q) or low affinity (K508A) IP3-sequestering sponge (26Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), or were cotransfected with Prx II (1 μg/ml; kindly provided by Professor S. W. Kang, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea) and eGFP-N1 (1.2 μg/ml; Clontech) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with saturated humidity to allow expression of the construct before the experiment. The expression of each protein was confirmed by GFP fluorescence. Transfections of siRNA-PLCγ1—Construction of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) for PLCγ1 (siRNA-PLCγ1) was described before (27Lee I.H. You J.O. Ha K.S. Bae D.S. Suh P.G. Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26645-26653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The pSUPER vector for siRNA was purchased from OligoEngine (Seattle, WA). Cells were cotransfected with siRNA-PLCγ1 (1 μg/ml) and eGFP-N1 (1.2 μg/ml) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent and cultured for 48 h in serum-free MEM. Depletion of endogenous PLCγ1 by siRNA was confirmed by immunoblot or GFP fluorescence. Western Blot Analysis—Astrocytes transfected with or without siRNA-PLCγ1 and eGFP-N1 were stimulated with H2O2 or EGF for the indicated times in the physiological salt solutions (PSSs) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). Cells were then lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with specific antibodies against PLCγ1, phosphospecific tyrosine 783, PLCβ1, and actin, and the proteins were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of bands was quantified using MetaMorph Analysis System (Universal Imaging Co., Downingtown, PA). [Ca2+]i Measurements—For [Ca2+]i measurements, attached cells were loaded with fura-2 by incubation with 3.5 μm fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester in PSS equilibrated with 100% O2 for 40 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice and rested for at least 20 min before use. The fura-2-loaded cells were mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) for imaging. The cells were superfused at a constant perfusion rate with the PSS. In Ca2+-free solutions, CaCl2 was omitted, and 1 mm EGTA was added. The excitation wavelength was alternated between 340 and 380 nm, and the emission fluorescence was monitored at 510 nm with a CCD camera using MetaFluor system (Universal Imaging Co., Downingtown, PA). Fluorescence images were obtained at 4-s intervals. Background fluorescence was subtracted from the raw signals at each excitation wavelength, and the values of [Ca2+]i were calculated using the equation described previously (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ROS Imaging—ROS levels were measured using the fluorescence probe DCF. In brief, cells were incubated for 5 min in the presence of 5μg/ml DCF and washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution. DCF fluorescence was measured using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, Buffalo, NY) with an excitation wavelength at 488 nm and an emission at 525 nm. To avoid photo-oxidation of DCF, the fluorescence images were collected using a single rapid scan, and identical settings were used for all samples. Data Analysis—The results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t test. p values lower than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. H2O2 Mobilizes Ca2+ in Cultured Rat Cortical Astrocytes in a Concentration-dependent Manner—The effect of H2O2 on Ca2+ mobilization was examined in fura-2-loaded cultured rat astrocytes. Exposure of the cells to H2O2 at concentrations lower than 3 μm failed to increase [Ca2+]i at least for 20 min (Fig. 1A). However, 10 μm H2O2 was shown to induce [Ca2+]i oscillations in 34.7 ± 8.4% of the 18 tested cells, and the number of the responding cells increased concentration-dependently (60.9 ± 5.8% for 30 μm, 84.9 ± 10.2% for 100 μm, and 93.1 ± 1.7% for higher than 300 μm H2O2; Fig. 1D, n = 18–20). In general, as shown in Fig. 1, B and C, concentrations of H2O2 less than 30 μm induced oscillations of [Ca2+]i, whereas doses higher than 300 μm caused spike and plateau type [Ca2+]i increases. However, in some cases, 30 μm H2O2 also caused spike and plateau signals. The average lag time between exposure to 10 μm H2O2 and the generation of Ca2+ responses was 7.4 ± 1.0 min, and it tended to decrease as the concentration of H2O2 was increased (5.1 ± 0.5 min for 30 μm, 4.0 ± 0.4 min for 100 μm, and 3.2 ± 0.4 min for 300 μm). Because 30 μm H2O2 did not induce cell death (data not shown) and generally produced reliable and reversible [Ca2+]i oscillations, we chose this concentration to analyze the mechanism by which peroxide-stimulated Ca2+ signaling occurred in subsequent experiments. Thapsigargin-releasable, IP3-sensitive Ca2+ Stores Are Responsible for H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i Oscillations—To identify the source of the Ca2+ mobilization, Ca2+ was removed from the bath solution and then 30 μm H2O2 was added. As shown in Fig. 2A, [Ca2+]i oscillations persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (n = 18), suggesting that intracellular Ca2+ stores were the main source for H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. Depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of SERCA, prevented H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations (n = 20), indicating that the intracellular Ca2+ stores responsible for the [Ca2+]i oscillations were thapsigargin-sensitive (Fig. 2B). To examine whether the thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store was releasable by IP3 receptors or ryanodine receptors, cells were exposed to 75 μm 2-APB, 20 mm caffeine (IP3 receptor antagonists), or 100 μm ryanodine (a ryanodine receptor antagonist), prior to the addition of 30 μm H2O2. As shown in Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S1, 2-APB (n = 17) and caffeine (n = 13) completely prevented the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations evoked by H2O2. In contrast to this, ryanodine failed to inhibit the H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations (n = 15), although it effectively blocked the [Ca2+]i increases induced by 500 μm caffeine, a ryanodine receptor agonist (n = 16; Fig. 2, D and E). These results suggest that thapsigargin-releasable, IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores are responsible for H2O2-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Activation of PLCγ1 Is Essential for the Generation of H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i Oscillations—Because H2O2 has been shown to activate PLCγ1 in some cell types (29Qin S. Inazu T. Yamamura H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Tokmakov A.A. Sato K.I. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we investigated whether PLCγ1 was phosphorylated following H2O2 stimulation of cultured rat astrocytes. PLCγ1 possesses three tyrosine residues, Tyr-771, Tyr-783, and Tyr-1254. Among them, Tyr-783 is known to be essential for IP3 formation (31Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Ziberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Therefore, a phosphospecific tyrosine 783 antibody was used to detect the H2O2-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ1. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, exposure of the astrocytes to various concentrations of H2O2 for 10 min induced PLCγ1 phosphorylation on tyrosine residue 783 in a dose-dependent manner (n = 6). To clarify further the involvement of PLCγ1 in the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations, we used the PLC inhibitor U73122 and as control its inactive analogue U73343. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, 10 μm U73122, but not 10 μm U73343, prevented the H2O2-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations. The frequencies of H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were 6.5 ± 1.2 peaks/20 min (n = 14) in the presence of U73343 and 0.8 ± 0.8 peaks/20 min (n = 16) in the presence of U73122. The effect of U73122 and U73343 on the H2O2-induced PLCγ1 phosphorylation was also examined. As shown in Fig. 3, E and F, the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 induced by H2O2 was inhibited by 10 μm U73122 but not by 10 μm U73343 (n = 3). The involvement of PLCγ1 was further investigated by using RNA interference (RNAi). As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, transfection of siRNA-PLCγ1 suppressed the PLCγ1 expression level, although that of PLCβ1 expression was not affected (n = 5). To examine the functional consequences of depletion of PLCγ1 by RNAi, cells were transfected with pSUPER (empty vector) or siRNA-PLCγ1 prior to measurement of [Ca2+]i. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, transfection with GFP and siRNA-PLCγ1 resulted in the prevention of Ca2+ responses to H2O2 (n = 10). The frequencies of H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations were 6.8 ± 0.26 peaks/20 min in GFP/PLCγ1-negative cells and 0.5 ± 0.2 peaks/20 min in GFP/PLCγ1-positive cells. Transfection with GFP and pSUPER had no effect on H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations (data not shown). To confirm whether the transfection of siRNA-PLCγ1 had any effect on the Ca2+ response elicited by a PLCβ-activating agonist, we stimulated the cells with histamine. As shown in Fig. 4, E and F, the cotransfection of GFP and siRNA-PLCγ1 did not prevent the Ca2+ responses to histamine (n = 6). These results indicate that PLCγ1 is necessary for the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to H2O2. In addition, we also observed that expression of the IP3 sponge completely abrogated [Ca2+]i oscillations in response to H2O2 (n = 8; see Fig. 5, A and B), although the expression of low affinity IP3 sponge did not prevent the H2O2-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations (n = 6; Fig. 5, C and D). This result strongly suggests that IP3 production through the activation of PLCγ1 is a critical step for the H2O2-induced generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations. Oxidation of a PLCγ1-associated Signaling Component Is Responsible for H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i Oscillations—To examine whether the H2O2-induced PLCγ1 phosphorylation and [Ca2+]i oscillations were attributed to the sulfhydryl oxidation-dependent mechanisms, we treated cells with 1 mm DTT, a sulfhydryl-reducing agent, 4 min prior to the addition of H2O2. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, the phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by H2O2 was prevented by pretreatment with 1 mm DTT (n = 5). Furthermore, the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations by 30 μm H2O2 was also inhibited by 1 mm DTT (n = 16; Fig. 6C). These data suggest that oxidation of a PLCγ1-associated signaling component is responsible for the activation of PLCγ1 and generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations by H2O2. H2O2 Might be Involved in the EGF-induced Activation of PLCγ1 and Ca2+ Mobilization—Because it has been known that EGF elevates [Ca2+]i and produces H2O2 in fibroblasts (32Lee Z.W. Kweon S.M. Kim S.J. Kim J.H. Cheong C. Park Y.M. Ha K.S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we investigated whether H2O2 was produced in response to EGF and if the endogenously produced H2O2 was involved in PLCγ1 activation and [Ca2+]i increases in cultured rat cortical astrocytes. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, EGF at a concentration of 10 ng/ml induced an increase in DCF fluorescence intensity that was prevented by 5 mm NAC, indicating that EGF increased an accumulation of ROS (n = 5). The DCF fluorescence intensity was also decreased by 10 μm DPI (an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase), suggesting that NADPH oxidase, at least in part, participated in the EGF-triggered generation of ROS (n = 5). EGF induced a rapid transient peak increase in [Ca2+]i that subsequently declined (n = 15; Fig. 8A). However, pretreatment with 5 mm NAC or 10 μm DPI attenuated the EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increases, and removal of NAC and DPI in the continued presence of EGF increased [Ca2+]i again (n = 16–20; Fig. 8, B and C). The effect of NAC and DPI on the EGF-induced activation of PLCγ1 was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 8, D and E, the immediate strong activation of PLCγ1 followed by a sustained weak activation was observed following EGF stimulation, but in the presence of 5 mm NAC or 10 μm DPI the activation of PLCγ1 was greatly reduced (n = 3). Because Prx II is a cellular peroxidase that eliminates endogenous H2O2 produced in response to growth factors such as EGF (33Choi M.H. Lee I.K. Kim G.W. Kim B.U. Han Y.H. Yu D.Y. Park H.S. Kim K.Y. Lee J.S. Choi C. Bae Y.S. Lee B.I. Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Nature. 2005; 435: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we examined whether the overexpression of Prx II also attenuated EGF-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. As shown in Fig. 8, F and G, overexpression of Prx II decreased the amplitude of EGF-induced [Ca2+]i increase by about 57% (n = 6). These data suggested that H2O2 is generated by the activation of NADPH oxidase and is subsequently involved in the activation of PLC and the elevation of [Ca2+]i during EGF stimulation in cultured rat astrocytes. In this study, we report that exogenous addition of low concentrations of H2O2 triggers [Ca2+]i oscillations through the activation of PLCγ1 in cultured rat cortical astrocytes. H2O2-mediated elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels has been shown previously in various cell types (32Lee Z.W. Kweon S.M. Kim S.J. Kim J.H. Cheong C. Park Y.M. Ha K.S. Cell.

Physiol. 2004; 286: C129-C137Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, in many cases, [Ca2+]i increases were induced by relatively high concentrations of H2O2, which are generally considered cytotoxic. The physiologically relevant concentration range of H2O2, which causes an acceleration of cellular functions in a variety of cell types, is considered 1–100 μm, although it depends on cell type (1Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7592) Google Scholar, 37Gamaley I.A. Klyubin I.V. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 188: 203-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our system, we used 30 μm H2O2; it did not cause cell death (data not shown), and its effect on [Ca2+]i was reversible, suggesting that 30 μm H2O2 is close to the physiological concentration that modulates calcium signaling in astrocytes. Cellular Ca2+ signals generally encode information in two different modes as follows: frequency-modulated and amplitude-modulated signals (38Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Frequency-modulated Ca2+ signaling (i.e. [Ca2+]i oscillation"

Decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a protein that protects epithelial cells from complement-mediated lysis, also functions as a receptor for several microbial pathogens. In this study, we investigated whether H. pylori utilizes DAF as a receptor and the role of DAF within H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa. In vitro studies showed that H. pylori adhered avidly to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human DAF but not to vector controls. In H. pylori, disruption of the virulence factors vacA, cagA, and cagE did not alter adherence, but deletion of DAF complement control protein (CCP) domains 1-4 or the heavily O-glycosylated serine-threonine-rich COOH-terminal domain reduced binding. In cultured gastric epithelial cells, H. pylori induced transcriptional up-regulation of DAF, and genetic deficiency of DAF attenuated the development of inflammation among H. pylori-infected mice. These results indicate that DAF may regulate H. pylori-epithelial cell interactions relevant to pathogenesis.

Helicobacter pylori induces an inflammatory response in the stomach that persists for decades and biological costs incurred by chronic infection include an increased risk for peptic ulceration, gastric adenocarcinoma, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma of the stomach (1Peek R.M. Jr-Blaser M.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 2Moss S.F. Sood S. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 16: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, most colonized individuals remain asymptomatic, and increased disease risk is related to bacterial strain differences, epithelial responses governed by host diversity, and/or specific interactions between host and microbial determinants. While the vast majority of H. pylori in colonized hosts are free-living, ∼20% bind to gastric epithelial cells, and this adherence is required for induction of injury. The H. pylori cag pathogenicity island encodes a type IV secretion system that, following adherence, translocates peptidoglycan and CagA into host cells (3Odenbreit S. Puls J. Sedlmaier B. Gerland E.

CagA subsequently undergoes Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and activates a eukaryotic phosphatase (SHP-2), eventuating in dephosphorylation of host cell proteins and cellular morphological changes (6Backert S.

Recently, CagA has also been shown to activate β-catenin and induce NF-κB-mediated interleukin-8 release from gastric epithelial cells (11Brandt S. Kwok T. Hartig R. Konig W. Backert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9300-9305Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 12Franco A.T. Israel D.A. Washington M.K. Krishna U. Fox J.G. Rogers A.B. Neish A.S. Collier-Hyams L.

The presence of the cag island influences the topography of colonization, as H. pylori cag- strains predominate within the mucus gel layer, while cag+strains are found immediately adjacent to epithelial cells (13Camorlinga-Ponce M. Romo C. Gonzalez-Valencia G. Munoz O. Torres J. J. Clin. Pathol. 2004; 57: 822-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Concordant with these properties, H. pylori strains that harbor a functional cag island are associated with an increased risk for ulcer disease and gastric cancer compared with cag- strains (1Peek R.M. Jr-Blaser M.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Another H. pylori locus linked with pathologic outcomes is vacA, which encodes a bacterial toxin (VacA) that induces vacuolation and apoptosis of epithelial cells (14Leunk R.D. Johnson P.T. David B.C. Kraft W.G. Morgan D.R. J. Med. Microbiol. 1988; 26: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 15Peek R.M. Jr-Blaser M.J. Mays D.J. Forsyth M.H. Cover T.L. Song S.Y. Krishna U.

VacA binds to a unique receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPζ, a member of a family of receptor-like enzymes that regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion (17Fujikawa A. Shirasaka D. Yamamoto S. Ota H. Yahiro K. Fukada M. Shintani T. Wada A. Aoyama N. Hirayama T. Fukamachi H. Noda M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Another virulence factor, an adhesin termed BabA (encoded by the H. pylori strain-selective gene babA2), binds the blood group antigen Lewisb on gastric epithelial cell membranes (18Solnick J.V.

Finally, genetic ablation of parietal cells in mice induces gastric epithelial progenitor cells to synthesize NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4 glycan, which serves as a receptor for H. pylori, and this is accompanied by an expansion of bacterial colonization and inflammation within the glandular epithelium (20Syder A.J.

Collectively, these results indicate that dynamic and specific interactions between H. pylori and host receptors legislate pathologic outcome.

Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 264-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is a 70-kDa glycoprotein containing 4 contiguous 60-amino acid-long repeats termed complement control protein repeats (CCPs) followed by a serine-threonine-rich heavily O-glycosylated COOH-terminal domain that elevates the molecule at the membrane surface (22Servin A.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 264-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). DAF is membrane-linked by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. DAF protects self cells from complement activation on their surfaces by dissociating membrane-bound C3 convertases that are required for cleaving C3 and initiating further propagation of the complement cascade. Previous work has shown that DAF is utilized as a cellular receptor for several pathogenic organisms including uropathogenic diffusely adhering Escherichia coli, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses (22Servin A.L.

Studies by other investigators have shown that expression of DAF is increased within H. pylori-infected human gastric tissue compared with uninfected mucosa, and this increase is directly related to the density of H. pylori colonization and severity of inflammation (33Sasaki M.

It has also been shown that increased DAF expression is present in gastric cancer precursor lesions such as intestinal metaplasia and gastric adenomas, and in gastric adenocarcinoma specimens compared with non-transformed gastric mucosa (36Kiso T.

Since DAF is overexpressed within H. pylori-associated premalignant and malignant lesions, we investigated whether H. pylori utilizes DAF as a receptor in vitro and the role of DAF within H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa to define a potential pathogenic response toward this organism. Recombinant Cell Lines—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectant clones that stably express human DAF cDNA (DAF/A9), cDNA CCP deletion constructs (DAFΔCCP1/029-6B, DAFΔCCP2/043-7A, DAFΔCCP3/044-2D, DAFΔCCP4/054-5 × 4), a cDNA serine/threonine (S/T)-rich region deletion construct (DAFΔS/T), a cDNA S/T region deletion construct containing an in-frame fusion of the cDNA encoding the amino-terminal region of DAF with the carboxyl terminus of HLA-B44 (DAFΔS/T + HLA), or vector alone were used as described previously (37Coyne K.E.

Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 50 units of penicillin/ml, 50 μg of streptomycin/ml, 2 mm l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and 250 μg of G418/ml when indicated. AGS (ATCC CRL 1739) or MKN28 (kindly provided by Dr. Robert Coffey, Vanderbilt University) human gastric epithelial cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml gentamicin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Bacterial Strains Used in Vitro—Experiments were performed with the cag cag+ toxigenic H. pylori strain J166, as well as eight additional (5+ toxigenic, 3 cag- non-toxigenic) well characterized clinical strains. Clinical strains were selected from a larger population of isolates that have been previously described as part of an ongoing prospective study designed to study mechanisms of H. pylori pathogenesis (15Peek R.M.

Since we sought to analyze the importance of H. pylori genes related to disease, we selected strains that varied in cag status and toxin production. Isogenic cagA, cagE, and vacA null mutants were constructed within strain J166 by insertional mutagenesis, using aphA (conferring kanamycin resistance) as described previously (15Peek R.M.

H. pylori were grown in Brucella broth with 10% FCS for 18 h, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 1010 colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and added to cells at a bacteria:cell ratio of 10:1 (39Israel D.A.

Serial 10-fold dilutions of 1-ml aliquots of cell extracts were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar plates and incubated for 3-5 days under microaerobic conditions before H. pylori colonies were counted. Results are expressed as cfu/ml. Immunofluorescence—CHO or gastric cells were cultured on glass cover slides, and cells treated with or without H. pylori for 4 h (multiplicity of infection = 100) were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, incubated in 0.1% PBST (1× PBS, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% milk for 1 h, and then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-DAF antibody 1H4 (1:100) (37Coyne K.E.

For dual immunofluorescence, slides were stained with mouse monoclonal anti-DAF antibody 1H4 (1:100) and rabbit anti-H. pylori antibody (1:100, DakoCytomation). Washed slides were then incubated with either goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated antibody (1:100; Molecular Probes) for single immunofluorescence or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:100, Molecular Probes) for dual immunofluorescence at room temperature for 1 h. Nuclei were stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and immunofluorescence was observed using a fluorescence microscope (40Gupta R.A. Polk D.B. Krishna U.

For antibody inhibition studies, CHO cells were preincubated with anti-DAF monoclonal antibodies 11D7 (directed against CCP domain 1), 1H4 (directed against CCP domain 3), 8D11 (directed against CCP domain 4) (37Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Anstee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2906-2913PubMed Google Scholar), or ascites fluid containing the monoclonal antibody IF7 (directed against CCP domain 2) (25Guignot J. Peiffer I. Bernet-Camard M.F. Lublin D.M. Carnoy C. Moseley S.L. Servin A.L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3554-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for 30 min prior to infection with H. pylori. Western Analysis—Transfected CHO cells or gastric cells from H. pylori:AGS or H. pylori:MKN28 cell co-cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), and protein concentrations were quantified by the Bradford assay (Pierce) (38Crawford H.C.

Proteins (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). DAF levels were measured in gastric cells by Western blotting using anti-DAF (1:1000, 1H4) antibodies (38Crawford H.C. Krishna U.S. Israel D.A. Matrisian L.M. Washington M.K. Peek Jr., R.M. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were detected using goat anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR—MKN28 and AGS gastric epithelial cells were grown to confluence, serum-starved for 24 h, and then co-cultured with H. pylori for 2, 6, 12, and 24 h (multiplicity of infection = 100). RNA was prepared from H. pylori:gastric cell co-cultures using TRIzol Reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and contaminating DNA was removed using the RNeasy RNA purification kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems), which was followed by real-time quantitative PCR using the TaqMan gene expression assay and a 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). DAF cDNA was quantitated using a DAF TaqMan gene expressions primer set purchased from Applied Biosystems and expression levels were normalized to levels of 18 S rRNA. Mice, Bacteria, and Experimental Infections—Daf1 knock-out mice were developed as described previously (41Lin F. Fukuoka Y. Spicer A. Ohta R. Okada N. Harris C.L. Emancipator S.N. Medof M.E. Immunology. 2001; 104: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Daf1 gene on one chromosome was inactivated by homologous recombination and Cre/LoxP-mediated deletion in murine GK129 embryonic stem cells. The recombined embryonic stem cells were microinjected into blastocytes, chimeras were generated, and the chimeric mice were then bred with the C57BL/6 strain. Eight- to 12-week knock-out mice and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used. All experiments were approved by the Case Western Reserve Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Brucella broth containing 2 × 107 cfu of the H. pylori rodent-adapted strain SS1 was used as inoculum and was delivered by gastric intubation as described previously (42Garhart C.A. Redline R.W. Nedrud J.G. Czinn S.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3529-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Eight weeks post-challenge, mice were euthanized. At necropsy, linear strips extending from the squamocolumnar junction through proximal duodenum were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin-embedded, cut at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Indices of inflammation and injury in the gastric cardia, corpus, and antrum were scored on an ordinal scale from 0 to 5 in increments of 0.5 by a single veterinary pathologist blinded to treatment groups as described previously (42Garhart C.A. Redline R.W. Nedrud J.G. Czinn S.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3529-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For quantitative culture, gastric tissue was homogenized, plated, and incubated under microaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 5-6 days as described previously (42Garhart C.A. Redline R.W. Nedrud J.G. Czinn S.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3529-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). After verification by Gram's stain, urease, catalase, and oxidase reactions, colonies were counted and comparisons between groups were based on the log cfu/gram of stomach tissue as described (42Garhart C.A. Redline R.W. Nedrud J.G. Czinn S.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3529-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analyses of intergroup comparisons. Significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Expression of Human DAF Increases Cellular Binding of H. pylori in Vitro—To determine whether DAF mediates H. pylori binding to host cells, we used CHO cells stably transfected with a human DAF cDNA or vector alone (Fig. 1A) and co-cultured the transfectants with a well characterized H. pylori strain, J166, which is easily transformable and binds well to gastric epithelial cells (15Peek R.M. Jr-Blaser M.J. Mays D.J. Forsyth M.H. Cover T.L. Song S.Y. Krishna U. Pietenpol J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6124-6131PubMed Google Scholar, 43Peek R.M. Jr-Thompson S.A. Donahue J.P. Tham K.T. Atherton J.C. Blaser M.J. Miller G.G. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 531-544PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed binding by quantitative culture. Compared with cells lacking DAF, H. pylori strain J166 bound more avidly to DAF-expressing cells and recoverable colony-forming units were >1 log-fold higher following only 4 h of co-culture (Fig. 1B). To further assess DAF binding by H. pylori, we used immunofluorescence. For this, strain J166 was co-cultured with CHO cells that either did or did not express DAF. A significantly greater number of H. pylori adhered to DAF+versus DAF- CHO cells (Fig. 1C). To ensure that H. pylori binding to DAF was a specific interaction rather than a nonspecific bacterial response of the cells to bacteria, we incubated DAF- CHO cells with equivalent numbers of non-diffusely adhering E. coli or C. jejuni for 4 h and measured binding by quantitative culture. Adherence of E. coli or C. jejuni did not differ between CHO cells that either expressed or did not express DAF (Fig. 1B). Thus, the DAF interaction specifically mediated adherence of H. pylori to host cells. Binding to DAF Is Independent of H. pylori Virulence Constituents Encoded by the cag Pathogenicity Island or vacA—The H. pylori cag island and vacA induce epithelial responses that may lower the threshold for disease. Consequently, we examined the effects of these virulence determinants on binding of H. pylori to DAF-expressing cells. To do this, we co-cultured DAF+ and DAF+ or DAF- CHO cells with H. pylori wild-type cag+ toxigenic strain J166 or isogenic cagA, cagE, or vacA null mutant derivatives. Compared with the parental wild-type strain, loss of cagA had no effect on binding to DAF (Fig. 2A). Inactivation of cagE or vacA decreased the extent of bacterial binding compared with the wild-type strain; however, the level of reduction was similar in DAF-expressing and DAF-deficient CHO cells (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that, although cagE and vacA may contribute to binding of H. pylori to host cells, these effects do not involve DAF. The Extent of H. pylori Binding to DAF-expressing Cells Varies among a Population of Clinical Isolates—Most persons infected with H. pylori cag+toxigenic strains remain asymptomatic, suggesting that additional microbial and/or host factors influence disease. Therefore, we next investigated DAF binding patterns among a population of clinical H. pylori isolates. Although absolute levels varied between different isolates, all nine strains tested (6 cag- non-toxigenic) displayed at least a 10-fold increase in binding affinity to DAF DAF+ toxigenic, 3 cag+ versus- CHO cells (Fig. 2B). Levels of binding did not segregate with cag genotype or toxigenicity, confirming the results from isogenic mutant experiments (Fig. 2A). Binding of H. pylori to CHO Cells That Express Mutant DAF—DAF is composed of four CCPs, and microbial pathogens vary in their utilization of CCP domains for binding. Based on this, we next localized the sites on DAF that H. pylori utilize by studying CHO cells stably transfected with deletion mutants of each of the four DAF CCP domains. Each deletion mutant expresses an amount of DAF at least equal to cells expressing wild-type DAF (37Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Anstee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2906-2913PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of CCP domains 1, 2 or 3 completely abolished H. pylori binding to DAF (Fig. 3A), whereas removal of CCP4, the domain in closest apposition to the cell surface, resulted in an approximate 60-70% reduction in binding. To further confirm the role of CCP domains for H. pylori binding, DAF- CHO cells were pretreated with the DAF CCP-specific monoclonal antibodies 11D7, IF7, IH4, and 8D11 prior to infection with H. pylori strain J166. Preincubation with each individual monoclonal antibody alone did not significantly reduce H. pylori binding to DAF+ and DAF+ cells (data not shown). However, preincubation with an equal mixture of the four CCP domain-specific monoclonal antibodies completely blocked adherence of H. pylori to DAF-expressing cells (Fig. 3B), confirming the results using cells transfected with DAF CCP deletion mutants (Fig. 3A). DAF CCP domains are linked to a S/T-rich heavily O-glycosylated COOH-terminal domain that elevates the molecule at the membrane surface. Since H. pylori can bind to carbohydrate residues on cell surfaces (1Peek R.M. Jr-Blaser M.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 2"

Ynt1 protein is degraded in response to glutamine in the growth medium. Ynt1 disappears independently of YNT1 glutamine repression as shown in strains where YNT1 repression is abolished. Ynt1-green fluorescent protein chimera and a mutant defective in vacuolar proteinase A (Δpep4) showed that Ynt1 is degraded in the vacuole in response to glutamine. The central hydrophilic domain of Ynt1 contains PEST-like sequences whose deletion blocked Ynt1 down-regulation. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Lys-253 and Lys-270, located in this sequence, were involved in internalization and subsequent vacuolar degradation of Ynt1. Ynt1-ubiquitin conjugates were induced by glutamine and not nitrate. We conclude that glutamine triggers Ynt1 down-regulation via ubiquitinylation of lysines in the central hydrophilic domain, and proteolysis in the vacuole.

Nitrate is a nitrogen source used by plants, fungi, certain yeasts, and bacteria. In most nitrate assimilation organisms, nitrate induces a set of genes encoding the enzymatic machinery involved in its own assimilation. The nitrate assimilation pathway involves its uptake by a specific transporter, followed by its reduction to nitrite and ammonium by consecutive action of nitrate and nitrite reductases. This pathway demands a high investment of energy per mole of nitrate assimilated because it must be reduced to ammonium to be utilized. As a result, most organisms restrict the use of nitrate to those environments not containing “preferred nitrogen sources” such as ammonium, asparagine, or glutamine (1Crawford N.M. Arst H.N. Ann. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 115-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Kaiser W.M. Huber S.C. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 3Lin J.T. Stewart V.

Furthermore, organisms have evolved molecular mechanisms, termed Nitrogen Catabolite Repression (NCR), 4The abbreviations used are: NCR, nitrogen catabolite repression; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type. by which preferred nitrogen sources repress genes involved in the assimilation of non-preferred nitrogen sources (4Marzluf G.A.

Isolation of genes involved in assimilation of nitrate and construction of the corresponding null mutants makes the yeast Hansenula polymorpha a valuable tool for studying different issues related to nitrate assimilation (5Siverio J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 277-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This yeast presents a single high affinity bispecific nitrate/nitrite transporter called Ynt1 that contains 12 putative transmembrane domains (7Machin F. Medina B. Navarro F.J. Perez M.D. Veenhuis M. Tejera P. Lorenzo H. Lancha A. Siverio J.M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Perez M.D. Gonzalez C. Avila J. Brito N. Siverio J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). YNT1, YNR1 and YNI1, encoding, respectively, nitrate and nitrite reductases, are induced by nitrate and repressed by the preferred nitrogen sources ammonium or glutamine (5Siverio J.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 277-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ynt1 has been included in the NNP (nitrate/nitrite porter) family that is involved in high affinity nitrate and/or nitrite transport (9Forde B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (10Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ynt1 shows high similarity to NrtA (formerly designated CRNA) and NrtB from Aspergillus nidulans (11Unkles S.E. Zhou D. Siddiqi M.Y. Kinghorn J.R. Glass A.D.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6246-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), NIT10 from Neurospora crassa (12Gao-Rubinelli F. Marzluf G.A. Biochem.

However, there have been no detailed studies exploring posttranslational modifications of nitrate transporters in response to nitrogen sources (17Daniel-Vedele F. Filleur S. Caboche M. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 1998; 1: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The little evidence available suggests the posttranslational down-regulation of the Nicotiana plumbaginifolia NRT2.1 in response to ammonium (18Fraisier V. Gojon A. Tillard P. Daniel-Vedele F. Plant J. 2000; 23: 489-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis thaliana, phosphorylation of the nitrate transporter CHL1 at residue Thr-101, stimulated by low nitrogen concentration, switches the transporter from a low to a high affinity form (19Liu K.H. Tsay Y.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In H. polymorpha, preliminary studies indicate that Ynt1 undergoes proteolytic degradation in response to the presence of preferred nitrogen sources in the medium (7Machin F. Medina B. Navarro F.J. Perez M.D. Veenhuis M. Tejera P. Lorenzo H. Lancha A. Siverio J.M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinylation is an internalization signal for endocytosis and subsequent degradation in the vacuole of most yeast integral plasma membrane proteins (20Dupre S. Urban-Grimal D.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Gap1 permease that is involved in amino acids transport loses its uptake activity when cells are transferred to ammonium. Inactivation results from polyubiquitinylation followed by vacuolar degradation (22Soetens O. De Craene J.O. Andre B. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitinylation pattern of yeast integral plasma membrane proteins ranges from the multiubiquitinylation of the α-factor receptor Ste2 (24Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 1: 193-202Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and the galactose transporter Gal2 (25Horak J. Dieter W.H. J.

The sequence (D/E)XK(S/T) is considered a potential ubiquitinylation site of yeast plasma membrane proteins (20Dupre S. Urban-Grimal D. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Biochim. Biophys.

Alternative ubiquitinylation sites have been mapped within or near the PEST-like sequences of Fur4, Ste3, and Mal61 (20Dupre S. Urban-Grimal D. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Biochim. Biophys.

PEST sequences are hydrophilic stretches of variable length containing Pro, Ser, Asp, or Glu residues that tag certain short-lived proteins (30Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Although in some cases degradation of PEST-tagged proteins proceeds via polyubiquitinylation and later proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome (31Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar), PEST-tagged yeast plasma membrane proteins are ubiquitinylated and degraded in the vacuole (21Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation sites were mapped either within or very close to PEST-like sequences of Fur4, Ste3, and Mal61 (27Marchal C.

The putative secondary structure for fungal nitrate transporters predicts 12 transmembrane domains with short N- and C-terminal tails oriented to the cytoplasm. A large central hydrophilic domain of ∼90 residues facing into the cell connects two sets of six transmembrane domains (8Perez M.D. Gonzalez C. Avila J. Brito N. Siverio J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In all these transporters, Ynt1, NrtA, NrtB, TbNrt2, (32Montanini B. Viscomi A.R. Bolchi A. Martin Y. Siverio J.M. Balestrini R. Bonfante P. Ottonello S. Biochem.

Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar) defines a proper PEST sequence. In the PEST-like sequences of Ynt1 and fungal nitrate transporters the numerous Lys, Ser and Thr residues are remarkable, which could constitute ubiquitinylation and phosphorylation sites. In this work we have studied the effect of preferred nitrogen sources on Ynt1 levels and the role of the central hydrophilic domain in this issue. Ynt1 down-regulation is not a direct consequence of YNT1 gene repression; instead, nitrogen sources trigger Ynt1 ubiquitinylation, in a PEST-like sequence, and sorting to the vacuole for degradation. Microorganisms and Growth Conditions—The H. polymorpha strains used in this work are listed in supplemental Table S1. All strains are derivatives of NCYC495 leu2 ura3 strain. Yeast cells were grown at 37 °C in YPD medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose) or synthetic medium containing 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose, and the nitrogen source indicated in each experiment. For expression of Ynt1 under the control of the methanol-inducible MOX1 promoter in MDP100 strain, cells were grown in synthetic medium with 5 mm ammonium chloride and transferred to synthetic medium with 0.5% (w/v) glycerol and then to 0.5% (v/v) methanol. To repress the expression from MOX1 promoter, cells were transferred to synthetic medium containing 4% (w/v) glucose (7Machin F. Medina B. Navarro F.J. Perez M.D. Veenhuis M. Tejera P. Lorenzo H.

Single point mutations were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers used are indicated in supplemental Table S3. Mutagenesis was carried out on pNT0 plasmid and checked by restriction analysis. To avoid undesired mutations the short EcoRV-EcoRV fragment (165 bp) containing the mutations was subcloned into the same sites of pNT1. Point mutations generated in vitro were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Electrotransformation of yeast cells was performed according to Ref. 34Faber K.N. Haima P. Harder W. Veenhuis M. AB G. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar. A pop-in/pop-out strategy, depicted in supplemental Fig. S1, was used to integrate mutated versions of YNT1 into the genome. Yeast Cell Extract Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—50 mg of cells were resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 15 mm EDTA, 15 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm Na2P2O7, 10 mm NaF plus Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 0.5 mm Ø glass-beads were added to cell suspension for homogenization in a FastPrep homogenizer device (Thermosavant LifeSciences, Hampshire, UK) for 20 s at 6.0 m/s. Supernatant was clarified by two consecutive centrifugations at 820 × g for 1 min. The resulting supernatant was routinely centrifuged at 20,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C except for immunodetection of Ynt1 ubiquitinylation, for which the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,500 × g for 45 min. In both cases pellets were resuspended in 70 μl of 0.25 mg/ml of Triton X-100 and then mixed with 4× sample buffer (4× 12% (w/v) SDS, 6% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) Serva blue G, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7). Finally, samples were heated at 40 °C for 30 min and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. For Yn1-Ub conjugate form determination experiments, cells were processed as described above except that they were harvested with 10 mm NaN3 and lysis buffer supplemented with freshly prepared 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) to prevent deubiquitinylation. Ynt1 immunoprecipitation was carried out from protein extracts prepared essentially as described above. The membrane-enriched fraction obtained from 250 mg of cells was resuspended in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 140 mm NaCl) + Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) + 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein extracts were incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 2.5 h with 0.5 μl of anti-Ynt1 antiserum and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) previously incubated for 3 h at 4°C with rotation. Immunoprecipitate was washed once with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer + protease inhibitors and resuspended in 30 μl of 1× sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and Ynt1 immunodetection were performed as described in Ref. 7Machin F. Medina B. Navarro F.J. Perez M.D. Veenhuis M. Tejera P. Lorenzo H. Lancha A. Siverio J.M.

Expression of Ynt1-GFP Fusion and Fluorescence Microscopy—To follow Ynt1 cellular localization, the chromosomal copy of YNT1 was fused to GFP. Plasmid pGYF1 was linearized to transform wild-type (WT) and Ynt1 mutant strains. To follow GFP fluorescence, samples of 3 μl were withdrawn from the culture and imaged under an epifluorescence Leica DMRXA microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany) equipped with a Photometric CCD camera SenSys (Photometrics, Ltd., Tucson, AZ). To stain vacuolar membranes the culture was concentrated to an A660 of 40 and incubated with 10 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 15 min at 37 °C with shaking before the incubation in nitrate-containing medium. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) and cDNA produced by RET-ROscript™ kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) using random primers. Real-time PCR over YNT1 and ACT1 genes (control) was performed using primers Q-YNT1-R and -F and Q-ACT1-F and -R (supplemental Table S3). Glutamine Causes Posttranslational Down-regulation of Ynt1—Incubation of H. polymorpha cells in a medium containing nitrate as sole nitrogen source brings about the synthesis of Ynt1 concomitantly with the appearance of nitrate uptake (7Machin F. Medina B. Navarro F.J. Perez M.D. Veenhuis M. Tejera P. Lorenzo H. Lancha A. Siverio J.M. Yeast. 2004; 21: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When cells are transferred to a medium containing Gln, a marked decrease in nitrate transport and Ynt1 protein levels is observed (Fig. 2, A and B); ammonium produced the same effect as Gln on nitrate uptake and Ynt1 (data not shown). Although nitrate reductase activity also decreases when cells are transferred to a Gln-containing medium (Fig. 2A), this decrease does not account for the drop in nitrate uptake. To evaluate the role of transcriptional versus posttranscriptional regulation of Ynt1 levels by nitrogen sources, YNT1 gene was expressed under the control of the nitrogen-insensitive promoter of H. polymorpha MOX1 gene. Transcription from PMOX1 is induced by methanol and repressed by glucose (36Godecke S. Eckart M. Janowicz Z.A. Hollenberg C.P. Gene. 1994; 139: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ynt1-disrupted strain harboring the PMOX1-YNT1 fusion was incubated in methanol to produce Ynt1. Subsequently, when the cells were transferred to glucose to repress PMOX1-YNT1, Ynt1 degraded faster in Gln than in nitrate (Fig. 2C). These results indicate the nitrogen source controls Ynt1 at a level beyond transcription. Further evidence for posttranscriptional regulation of Ynt1 was compiled using H. polymorpha Δure2 mutant, where NCR of nitrate assimilation genes is abolished. 5P. Tejera and J. M. Siverio, manuscript in preparation. A similar S. cerevisiae mutant has been described in which NCR control of nitrogen assimilation genes is lost (6Cooper T.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 223-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WT and Δure2 strains were incubated in a medium containing nitrate or nitrate plus ammonium (Fig. 2D). In nitrate alone, Ynt1 protein levels, nitrate transport activity, and YNT1 transcript levels were about the same in WT and Δure2. When ammonium was present and NCR activated in WT, Ynt1 protein, activity, and transcript fell dramatically in 90 min. In contrast, in the Δure2 mutant, where NCR is lost, YNT1 transcript was expressed, but Ynt1 protein levels and transport activity fell to the same degree as WT in 90 min. These results contrast with those shown in Fig. 6B. Thus, it is clear that YNT1 transcript level is not a factor controlling short-term Ynt1 down-regulation. As can be seen in Fig. 2C and in other figures throughout this work, Ynt1 protein was resolved in SDS-PAGE as a set of bands with slight differences in electrophoretic mobility. We have shown that this pattern is due to Ynt1 phosphorylation (data not shown), which is in agreement with the putative phosphorylation sites present in the central cytosolic domain of the nitrate transporter (Fig. 1A). Although the regulatory significance of Ynt1 phosphorylation is unknown, preliminary evidence indicates that Ynt1 phosphorylation is not involved in Ynt1 down-regulation. We are currently investigating the precise role of Ynt1 phosphorylation. Ynt1 Degradation in the Vacuole—To study possible cellular redistribution of Ynt1 during down-regulation triggered by Gln, a strain containing the Ynt1-GFP fusion was used. Cells expressing Ynt1-GFP retained nitrate uptake activity, and the fusion protein was correctly delivered to the plasma membrane (data not shown). Ynt1-GFP cellular fate in response to Gln was monitored over time by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A). Vacuolar membranes were located using FM4-64 (37Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). For cells in nitrate, bright fluorescence was observed mainly at the cell surface. During incubation in Gln, fluorescence became less intense at the cell surface and concentrated inside the cell, co-localizing with the vacuole. Redistribution of fluorescence was observed as early as 30 min after Gln addition; at 60-90 min fluorescence was more intense in the vacuole than at the cell surface. At 120 min, fluorescence was very faint and only present in vacuoles. Clearly, Ynt1 is removed from the plasma membrane in response to Gln and sorted to vacuoles where it is very likely degraded. To test that proteolysis of Ynt1 occurs in vacuoles, we analyzed the effect of a mutation in the vacuolar proteinase PEP4 on Ynt1 down-regulation (mutant kindly provided by Jan A. K. W. Kiel, Groningen). Western blots of extracts from cells incubated in Gln clearly showed that degradation of Ynt1 in the Δpep4 mutant is diminished relative to WT containing the PEP4 gene (Fig. 3B). Although plasma membrane protein internalization is not expected to be impaired in Δpep4, it was for Ynt1 as can be deduced from the nitrate uptake, which decreased less than WT (Table 1). This could be a result of the endocytic pathway breakdown due to protein accumulation in vacuoles. A S. cerevisiae Δpep4 mutant strain also shows impaired degradation of permeases in vacuoles (38Springael J.Y. Andre B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 39Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol.

To test whether this region is involved in nitrate transporter down-regulation, a DNA fragment encoding 55 residues was deleted from YNT1 to produce the Ynt1Δ232-286 mutant strain. This strain maintained the ability to transport nitrate with high affinity and high rate (Table 1). However, Ynt1Δ232-286 mutant retained a high level of nitrate transport and Ynt1 protein after 60 min of incubation of the cells with Gln, whereas WT did not (Table 1 and Fig. 4). Thus, it is clear that the portion of the central domain deleted in this mutant is involved in down-regulation of Ynt1. Ubiquitinylation of Ynt1 Protein—One possible cellular mechanism for modifying the central domain of Ynt1 that would lead to its degradation is the ubiquitin system (21Horak J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 139-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether ubiquitin conjugates of Ynt1 were present in H. polymorpha cell extracts, denaturing gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were employed (Fig. 5A). When cells were incubated in nitrate for an extended period, a pair of faint higher Mr bands relative to Ynt1 was detected with anti-Ynt1 antiserum by extended development of the immunoblot (Fig. 5A, lane 1). The molecular size of these protein bands corresponds to the conjugation of 1 and 2 ubiquitin molecules to Ynt1. In the deletion strain Δynt1 these bands were not detected even when the blot was developed for longer times (Fig. 5A, lane 2). These higher Mr bands were not detected when the central domain was deleted (data not shown). To further analyze for the presence of Ynt1-ubiquitin conjugates, the core of the central domain, residues 236-286, was fused to the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of Ynt1Δ232-286 and called Ynt1Δ232-286+Ct236-286 (Fig. 1B). In this mutant strain, Ynt1 internalization and degradation are blocked, but formation of ubiquitin conjugates is possible. Ynt1Δ232-286+Ct236-286 internalization blockage could be due to the absence of Ile-232 and Leu-233 in this mutant; di-Leu motifs in Gap1 and Mal61 impair endocytosis but not ubiquitinylation (28Medintz I. Wang X. Hradek T. Michels C.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4518-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Hein C. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When Ynt1Δ232-286+Ct236-286 was incubated in nitrate for 2 h, two intense bands with the same molecular size as in WT were detected (Fig. 5A, lane 3). The putative ubiquitin-Ynt1 conjugate protein amount in the Ynt1Δ232-286+Ct236-286 strain was higher in cells incubated in glutamine than in nitrate (Fig. 5B). To test whether nitrate triggers Ynt1 ubiquitinylation, the strain Ynt1Δ232-286+Ct236-286 Δynr1, lacking nitrate reductase and therefore unable to assimilate nitrate, was incubated in nitrate for 2 h and then transferred for 1 h to Gln (Fig. 5D). Cells incubated in nitrate showed much less Ynt1-ubiquitin conjugate than those cells incubated in glutamine. Thus, it appears that Ynt1 becomes modified with ubiquitin during down-regulation as result of nitrate assimilation or the shift to a preferred nitrogen source. Two further steps in the analysis were taken to confirm that ubiquitin is conjugated to Ynt1 during down-regulation. First, myc-ubiquitin was expressed under the control of the H. polymorpha nitrate reductase gene promoter (41Perdomo G. Navarro F.J. Medina B. Machin F. Tejera P. Siverio J.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in the Ynt1Δ232-286+Ct236-286 strain, which showed an increase of Ynt1-ubiquitin conjugate Mr bands over that expected for Ub (Fig. 5D). Second, Ynt1-ubiquitin conjugate was identified using a monoclonal antibody for ubiquitin after immunoprecipitation of Ynt1Δ232-286+Ct236-286 with anti-Ynt1 (Fig. 5E). Here the monoclonal anti-ubiquitin appears to detect only the higher Mr Ynt1-ubiquitin conjugate, probably because of epitope display problems in the conjugates. Nevertheless, these results make it clear that ubiquitin is conjugated to Ynt1 during down-regulation. Role of Central Domain Lys Residues in Ynt1 Down-regulation—The pattern of Ynt1 ubiquitinylation is consistent with a mono-ubiquitinylation of two Lys residues or a di-ubiquitinylation of one Lys residue. To evaluate whether Lys residues in the central hydrophilic domain participate in Ynt1 down-regulation, Lys-243, Lys-253, and Lys-270 were replaced by Arg using site-directed mutagenesis. Arg is a chemically conservative replacement for Lys, but it cannot form ubiquitin conjugates. A set of six strains, three with single Arg replacements for central domain Lys residues, two double replacements, and one triple mutant, were constructed. All these mutants had similar or higher nitrate uptake rates than wild type, but most of the mutants were quite different in response to Gln as a Ynt1 down-regulation signal (Table 1, Fig. 6A). These results made it clear that the K243R mutant did not alter the regulation of Ynt1, whereas all mutants with K253R and K270R replacements had altered down-regulation of Ynt1. Whereas the double mutant K253R/K270R and the triple mutant K243R/K253R/K270R (Ynt13K → R) had similar properties, further studies were focused on the triple mutant, which exhibited almost the same resistance to Gln-triggered down-regulation as Ynt1Δ232-286 (Table 1). As expected, in the triple mutant no ubiquitinylation was observed (Fig. 5A, lane 4). This indicates that the central domain Lys residues are responsible by themselves for Ynt1 degradation and that the rest of the residues present in the central domain would act as auxiliaries in the ubiquitinylation process. In the strain expressing the triple mutant, the transfer to a Gln-containing medium did not trigger the drop in nitrate transport activity observed in WT (Table 1). This indicates that the triple Ynt1 mutant remained in the plasma membrane and was fully active despite the presence of Gln in the medium. When the triple Ynt1 mutant was expressed in the Δure2 strain and incubated in nitrate plus ammonium, nitrate uptake and Ynt1 levels were similar to WT in nitrate (Fig. 6B). These results support the conclusion that at least two of the three Lys in the central domain are necessary for the posttranslational down-regulation of Ynt1. Fluorescence microscopy of a strain with the triple mutant Ynt1 fused to GFP showed that after Gln treatment for 120 min, Ynt1 failed to be internalized from the plasma membrane and consequently was not delivered to the vacuole for degradation (Fig. 6C). This behavior was completely different from that found for Ynt1-GFP (Fig. 3A). Ynt1 is degraded in response to preferred nitrogen sources such as ammonium or glutamine. The use of Δure2 mutant strain, lacking nitrogen catabolite repression, and that expressing YNT1 under the control of the nitrogen non-regulable MOX1 promoter provided evidence that the drop in Ynt1 levels is not a consequence of glutamine-YNT1 gene repression (Fig. 2, C and D)."

Zhang H.Y. Xie C.H. Xue H.W. Dijkhuis P. Liu C.M. Plant J. 2005; 42: 743-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The zygote-lethal phenotype is characterized by developmental arrest at the 8-16-cell stage and mutant embryo shriveling 2-3 days after fertilization. The Arabidopsis FAC1 locus encodes an AMP deaminase (AMPD; EC 3.5.4.6), which is a eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of AMP to IMP. AMPD has also been identified as the intracellular target for a class of herbicides that are produced by fungal pathogens. Carbocyclic coformycin was initially discovered in Saccharothrix (2Bush B.D. Fitchett G.V. Gates D.A. Langley D. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 737-739Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and plant cells can take up this diffusible nucleoside and 5′-phosphorylate it to produce a potent transition state inhibitor of AMPD (3Dancer J.E. Hughes R.G. Lindell S.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Exposure to carbocyclic coformycin results in cessation of seedling growth, followed by paling and necrosis at the apical meristem (3Dancer J.E. Hughes R.G. Lindell S.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Coformycin, a structurally related compound produced by a number of microbes (4Nakamura H. Koyama G. Iitaka Y. Ohno M.

(Tokyo). 1991; 44: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the intracellular metabolism of this compound in plants has not been examined, its mode of action is presumably similar because coformycin 5′-phosphate is a transition state inhibitor of rabbit muscle AMPD (6Frieden C. Kurz L.C. Gilbert H.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5303-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both herbicides are inhibitors of mammalian adenosine deaminase (ADA) (3Dancer J.E. Hughes R.G. Lindell S.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Frieden C. Kurz L.C. Gilbert H.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5303-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but the lack of this enzyme in plants (3Dancer J.E. Hughes R.G. Lindell S.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Le Floc'h F. Lafleuriel J. Guillot A. Plant Sci.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) supports the argument that AMPD is the intracellular target for their nucleotide derivatives. Taken together, these observations suggest that AMPD is essential throughout the plant life cycle. However, the underlying basis for lethality of a FAC1 null phenotype and for herbicidal toxicity related to the catalytic inhibition of this enzyme is not known. AMPD catalyzes the initial step in adenine to guanine ribonucleotide conversion and also in one of the four identified pathways of AMP catabolism that are illustrated in Fig. 1. Each catabolic route differs in the order by which the phosphate, ribose sugar, and 6-amino group are removed from the purine ring structure, then all routes rejoin at the level of hypoxanthine (Hx), which is then further catabolized. Most organisms contain the necessary enzymes for more than one of these pathways. For example, AMP catabolic flow in eukaryotes of the animal kingdom proceeds along pathways 1 and 2. Pathways 3 and 4 are unique to prokaryotes, but these organisms also use pathway 2. Conversely, plants use only pathway 1 because they lack ADA and adenase (ADEase) (7Le Floc'h F. Lafleuriel J. Guillot A. Plant Sci. Lett. 1982; 27: 309-316Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consequently, in plants AMPD is absolutely required for catabolism of AMP to hypoxanthine, which is then oxidized and linearized to form the recyclable ureides, allantoin and allantoic acid. Although not as well characterized as orthologs in the animal kingdom, endogenous plant AMPD enzymes reportedly exhibit unique physical and regulatory behaviors. Sequence analysis of available cDNA for the single A. thaliana gene (At2g38280) identifies motifs that could play structural and regulatory roles in plant-specific properties of AMPD. For example, a putative N-terminal helical transmembrane domain (residues 6-31) may be responsible for the particulate distribution of plant enzymes, as reported in pea seeds (3Dancer J.E. Hughes R.G. Lindell S.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Turner D.H. Turner J.F. Biochem. J. 1961; 79: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), spinach leaves (11Yoshino M. Murakami K. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1980; 99: 331-338Crossref Google Scholar), and artichoke tubers (7Le Floc'h F. Lafleuriel J. Guillot A. Plant Sci.

This behavior results in poor yields and impedes further purification efforts. In addition, a putative ATP/GTP binding motif (Walker A ((A,G)X4GK(S,T)), residues 289-296) may be involved in a dramatic Km and Vmax effect of ATP, as observed with the Catharanthus roseus enzyme (13Yabuki N. Ashihara H. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 1905-1909Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). AMPD is one of more than 1000 documented enzymes in the amidohydrolase superfamily (14Seibert C.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6383-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The most recognizable feature across the 16 unique members for which high-resolution x-ray crystal structures are available, including the functionally related ADA (15Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 16Wang Z. Quiocho F.A.

It has long been proposed that the functional conformation of AMPD would resemble that of ADA due to similarity of the catalyzed reactions and the potent inhibition of both enzymes by deoxycoformycin derivatives (6Frieden C. Kurz L.C. Gilbert H.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5303-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although there is very little overall sequence homology between these two enzymes, many of the essential catalytic residues in the active site of ADA (15Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 16Wang Z. Quiocho F.A.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This study explores the relationship between a putative N-terminal transmembrane domain in the A. thaliana FAC1 polypeptide and the particulate behavior of this plant enzyme. Physical and catalytic properties of FAC1 are also measured using purified soluble N-truncated enzymes. Polyclonal antiserum raised against one of these purified enzymes is used to examine the subcellular fractionation and the membrane extraction of FAC1 in Arabidopsis T87 protoplasts. Finally, because of its central role in nucleotide metabolism and the lack of sequence homology to any structure in the Protein Data Bank, the Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics undertook a structure determination. The x-ray crystal structure of the globular catalytic domain of FAC1 is presented with bound herbicide-based transition state inhibitors to reveal connections of function with structure. Expression and Purification of FAC1 Recombinant Enzymes—Recombinant plasmids containing wild type and N-truncated (ΔL31M and ΔI139M) FAC1 cDNA sequence (see supplementary Materials and Methods) were co-transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells together with a modified baculoviral genome (BaculoGold; BD Pharmingen) and the recombinant viral plaques were purified and amplified. Recombinant virus was used to infect 12 confluent T-185 flasks of Sf9 cells and recombinant enzymes were purified by phosphocellulose chromatography using a previously described protocol (18Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Sabina R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, leupeptin was included in all extraction and storage buffers to minimize N-terminal proteolysis, as previously described (19Haas A.L. Sabina R.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation Analysis of FAC1 Distribution in Arabidopsis T87 Protoplasts—Subcellular fractionation of Arabidopsis suspension cultured cells was performed as described (20Rancour D.M. Dickey C.E. Park S. Bednarek S.Y. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in membrane isolation buffer (MIB: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KOAc, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 250 mm sorbitol) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mm p-aminobenzamidine, 1 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml E64. The subcellular distribution and activity of FAC1 were analyzed by immunoblotting and enzyme assay, which included 1 mm ATP to achieve maximal enzyme activity. To characterize the membrane association of FAC1, 223 μg of protein in the P150 fraction was diluted (10-fold) into MIB containing 1 mm DTT (MIBDTT), or MIBDTT supplemented with either 2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5, or Triton X-100 (1% (v/v)). Samples were incubated for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation (Beckman TLA100.1, 90,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C). Pellet fractions were washed with MIBDTT and 20 μg of protein equivalents of supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using antisera specific for FAC1 (see supplementary Materials and Methods), cytosolic (PUX1) (21Rancour D.M.

Prior to immunoblotting, the nitrocellulose membrane was analyzed by Ponceau S staining to confirm protein recovery and equal loading. Crystallization and Structure Determination of ΔI139M FAC1 Recombinant Enzyme in Complex with a Transition State Inhibitor— Crystals of ΔI139M FAC1 recombinant enzyme in complex with a transition state analogue inhibitor, coformycin 5′-phosphate (Fig. 6C), were obtained by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 22 °C. The precipitant solution contained 0.4 m monoammonium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1 m trisodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 10% (v/v) ethanol, as previously described (23Han B.W. Bingman C.A. Mahnke D.K. Sabina R.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Native and a mercury derivative data set (thimerosal), respectively, were collected at synchrotron beamlines 22-ID and 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source of the Argonne National Laboratory as previously described (23Han B.W. Bingman C.A. Mahnke D.K. Sabina R.L. Phillips Jr., G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The data sets of diffraction images were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 suite (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). ΔI139M FAC1 structure was phased using the molecular replacement method with the rabbit AMPD1 structure (25Bazin, R. J., McDonald, G. A., and Phillips, C. (September 23, 2003) UK Patent GB2373504.Google Scholar) as a phasing model by MolRep (26Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The model was improved using alternate cycles of manual building in Xfit (28McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and refinement in REFMAC5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), and the final structure was refined with the Crystallography & NMR System (CNS) (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) of ΔI139M FAC1 Dimer—The dynamical domains in the ΔI139M FAC1 dimer were determined using NMA (31Hinsen K. Thomas A. Field M.J. Proteins. 1999; 34: 369-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) in the Molecular Modeling ToolKit (32Hinsen K. J. Comp. Chem. 2000; 21: 79-85Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A deformation measure was calculated for the carbon α (Cα) atom in each residue followed by normal mode calculations. The two lowest frequency non-trivial normal modes were combined and the results were scaled with a heuristic scaling factor. AMPD Enzyme Assay—AMPD activity was measured in 100-μl reactions containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 150 mm ammonium sulfate, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm AMP. Substrate and product were resolved and quantified by anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography as previously described (33Swain J.L. Sabina R.L. McHale P.A. Greenfield Jr., J.C. Holmes E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: H818-H826PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bausch-Jurken M.T. Mahnke-Zizelman D.K. Morisaki T. Sabina R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22407-22413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic studies were conducted under the assay conditions described above using ∼40 milliunits of enzyme per assay, variable substrate concentrations (0.017-106 mm AMP), and initial velocity conditions (product not exceeding 15% of substrate). Kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting data to the following equation: log v = log[VA/(K + A)], where A was AMP concentration and V was the rate. A log fit was called for because data measurement errors were proportional to the velocities. Residual (difference between experimental and calculated V) did not exceed 2.6 σ (the 99 percentile criterion for throwing out a point and refitting) for any fit. Coordinates—The coordinates and diffraction data of the ΔI139M FAC1 structure in complex with coformycin 5′-phosphate have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2A3L). Expression and Purification of FAC1 Recombinant Enzymes—FAC1 recombinant enzymes were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using baculoviral technology. Expression of the full-sized FAC1 cDNA produces a robust activity that partitions predominantly into the particulate fraction of insect cells, as evidenced by the low recovery from a freshly prepared sonicate following a 10,000 × g spin (see supplementary Table 1). However, there is a time-dependent increase in recovery when the sonicate is stored at 4 °C in the absence of protease inhibitors prior to centrifugation. SDS-PAGE analysis of the peak fraction eluting from a phosphocellulose column following adsorption of crude extract derived from a sonicate stored at 4 °C for 93 h reveals a series of bands between 70 and 95 kDa (see supplementary Fig. 1). These combined data suggest that proteolytic events occur in the sonicate over time at 4 °C and remove a region of the 95-kDa FAC1 polypeptide that is responsible for the particulate distribution of this enzyme. Furthermore, this occurs without any substantial loss of catalytic activity, as evidenced by similar total sonicate activities over this period of time (see supplementary Table 1). To test this hypothesis, two N-truncated enzymes, ΔL31M and ΔI139M, were constructed and expressed. Both enzymes are soluble and have robust activities (see supplementary Table 1), and phosphocellulose chromatography purification in the presence of protease inhibitor (leupeptin) followed by SDS-PAGE fractionation yields single bands of approximate 92 and 80 kDa (see supplementary Fig. 1), the predicted masses of the ΔL31M and ΔI139M polypeptides, respectively. Notably, the specific activities of these purified preparations are 3 orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported for endogenous plant AMPD enzymes (120-458 milliunits/mg of protein) (3Dancer J.E. Hughes R.G. Lindell S.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Yoshino M. Murakami K. Z.

Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 1905-1909Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The combined results demonstrate that up to 31 N-terminal amino acids in the FAC1 polypeptide are responsible for partitioning of the wild type enzyme into the particulate fraction. Subcellular Fractionation Analysis of FAC1 Distribution in Arabidopsis T87 Cells— Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against purified ΔI139M antigen and this reagent was used to examine FAC1 distribution and membrane extraction in T87 cells. AMPD enzyme activity and immunoreactive polypeptide are located exclusively in the microsomal membrane fraction (P150) of these cells (Fig. 2). Furthermore, high salt (2.5 m NaCl), high pH (Na2CO3, pH 11.5), and anionic detergent (Triton X-100) all remove a portion of FAC1 from the P150 fraction, but the majority of immunoreactive polypeptide is not extracted into the soluble fraction under any of these conditions. Conversely, an integral membrane protein with a single transmembrane domain, AtSEC12, is extracted by anionic detergent, but not by either high salt or pH. In addition, a peripheral membrane protein, AtCDC48, is extracted by high pH and partially extracted by high salt. Effect of ATP on the Kinetic Properties of FAC1 Recombinant Enzymes— As reported for isolated pea seed AMPD (10Turner D.H. Turner J.F. Biochem. J. 1961; 79: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the ΔL31M and ΔI139M FAC1 recombinant enzymes prefer sulfate anion for maximal activity (data not shown), rather than chloride, which is typically used to study the catalytic behaviors of animal orthologs. Therefore, sulfate anions were included in the assay buffer for the kinetic analysis of these two recombinant enzymes. In the absence of ATP, Km(app) and Vmax values for the ΔL31M enzyme are 6.7 ± 0.8 mm and 68 ± 6 units/mg of protein, respectively, and 12 ± 3 mm and 17 ± 3 units/mg of protein, respectively, for the ΔI139M enzyme. Vo versus [S] plots presented in Fig. 3 show that 1 mm ATP exerts a combined Km and Vmax effect on both enzymes. Km and Vmax values for the ΔL31M enzyme are 0.26 ± 0.03 mm and 375 ± 25 units/mg of protein, respectively, and 0.15 ± 0.02 mm and 113 ± 7 units/mg of protein, respectively, for the ΔI139M enzyme. Overall Structure of ΔI139M FAC1 in Complex with Coformycin 5′-Phosphate—The ΔI139M FAC1 recombinant enzyme was crystallized with bound coformycin 5′-phosphate. The crystals belong to space group P6222, with unit cell parameters a = b = 131.3, c = 208.3 Å. The final model, one per asymmetric unit, was refined using data to a resolution of 3.3 Å, and comprises 616 residues (212-273 and 286-839), one coformycin 5′-phosphate, and one phosphate ion. Statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in Table 1. An anomalous difference Fourier map generated with the mercury data set revealed six mercury atoms positioned adjacent to the sulfur atoms of six cysteine residues, Cys254, Cys299, Cys348, Cys397, Cys470, and Cys764, confirming the amino acid sequence alignment with the electron density map.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionΔI139M FAC1 in complex with coformycin 5′-phosphateMercury derivative (thimerosal)Space groupP6222P6222Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)131.3, 131.3, 208.3132.6, 132.6, 207.6 α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 12090, 90, 120 Resolution (Å)a50.00–3.34 (3.42–3.34)50.00–4.05 (4.12–4.05) RmergeaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell,bRmerge = ΣhΣi|Ii(h) – I(h)ñ|/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the intensity of an individual measurement of the reflection and 〈I(h) 〉 is the mean intensity of the reflection0.06 (0.49)0.12 (0.36) I/σIaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell30.6 (4.1)26.5 (10.3) Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell99.5 (99.6)99.9 (100) RedundancyaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell6.1 (5.7)17.0 (17.8)Refinement Resolution (Å)50.00–3.34 No. reflections15,038 RcrystcRcryst = Σh||Fobs| –|Fcalc||/Σh|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively/RfreedRfree was calculated as Rcryst using 5.0% of the randomly selected unique reflections that were omitted from structure refinement0.237/0.323No. atoms Protein5050 Ligand/ion30 Water24B-factors Protein73.47 Ligand/ion77.27 Water75.90Root mean square deviations Bond lengths (Å)0.016 Bond angles (°)2.40a Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shellb Rmerge = ΣhΣi|Ii(h) – I(h)ñ|/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the intensity of an individual measurement of the reflection and 〈I(h) 〉 is the mean intensity of the reflectionc Rcryst = Σh||Fobs| –|Fcalc||/Σh|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectivelyd Rfree was calculated as Rcryst using 5.0% of the randomly selected unique reflections that were omitted from structure refinement Open table in a new tab The structure shows an incomplete triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) (α/β)8 barrel fold characterized by irregular loops in place of the 5th and 6th strands (Fig. 4). The space group has several 2-fold rotation axes, one of which leads to an obvious dimer interface. This interface buries 2,514 A2 or 9.5% of the total monomeric surface and 62% of the atoms in the interface are non-polar, supporting the hypothesis that FAC1 is a dimeric protein (35Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). This conclusion is further supported by gel filtration chromatography data for the ΔI139M enzyme (see supplementary Results and supplementary Fig. 2A). A possible crystallographic tetramer contact interface comprises 727 Å2, which is only 2.7% of the total monomeric surface, and 69% of the atoms in the interface are non-polar (see supplementary Fig. 3). This weak dimer-dimer contact likely results from the high protein concentration in the crystal and may also explain why chemical cross-linking captures tetrameric species of this enzyme (see supplementary Fig. 2B). The apparent physiological dimer exhibits 2-fold symmetry, at the edge of which is an unusually flat and wide surface that is predominantly positively charged (Fig. 5, A and C).FIGURE 5Electrostatic surface view of FAC1 dimer. A, positively charged flat surface: bottom view with the 10 basic residues labeled; B, vector representation of normal mode analysis showing the putative direction of motion in the two-lowest frequency normal mode; C, side view before (dimer orientation identical to that in Fig. 4B); and D, side view after normal modes applied. With the normal mode perturbation, the basic surfaces of each monomer can become quite flat in the region of positive charge.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The active site of FAC1 with bound coformycin 5′-phosphate is positioned on the C-terminal side of the imperfect (α/β)8 barrel, surrounded by multiple helices and loops. The catalytic zinc ion is coordinated to the coformycin 5′-phosphate, an aspartic acid (Asp736) and three histidine (His391, His393, and His659) residues (Fig. 6A). There are 7 identified variations of the metal ligand centers in the amidohydrolase superfamily (14Seibert C.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6383-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and this configuration is referred to as subtype III. A fourth histidine (His681) not ligated to the zinc resides on loop 6 and is positioned to function in catalysis as a general base during proton abstraction from a water molecule that is complexed with this ion. Alternatively, a glutamate residue (Glu662) is similarly positioned and could perform this catalytic role. Residues Phe463 and Tyr467 are important in positioning the inhibitor in the FAC1 active site by causing the ribose ring to assume a different orientation compared with the coformycin base (Fig. 6B). The phosphate group of the inhibitor is located in a polar environment consisting of residues Lys462, Lys466, Arg476, Asp737, and Gln740 (Fig. 6B). All are within 6 Å of the phosphate, and even closer to the associated oxygen atoms. Other notable structural features of FAC1 are the putative Walker A motif and a bound phosphate ion (Fig. 4). The ATP/GTP binding motif is located 28 Å from the catalytic zinc and spans residues 289-296 (AHYPQGKS) that comprise part of a loop structure exposed to solvent in both subunits of the physiological dimer. The phosphate ion is located at the N-terminal side of the imperfect TIM barrel 30 Å from the catalytic zinc and is surrounded by several basic residues (Arg380, Arg386, and Lys506; not shown). NMA of ΔI139M FAC1 Dimer—NMA of the ΔI139M FAC1 dimer shows that it likely moves with an opening and twisting hinge motion (Fig. 5B) that would make the basic surface of each monomer flat with respect to each other (compare Fig. 5, C and D; see supplementary Movie 1). The distance between the α-carbon atoms of residue Arg351,a basic residue located in the middle of helix 3, would increase from 50 Å in the crystal structure to 71 Å in the flattened form.

Here, we describe the molecular basis of a novel phenotype of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID), a disaccharide malabsorption disorder of the human intestine in which several structural features and functional capacities of the brush-border enzyme complex sucrase-isomaltase (SI) are affected. The cDNA encoding SI from a patient with CSID reveals a mutation in the isomaltase subunit of SI that results in the substitution of a cysteine by an arginine at amino acid residue 635 (C635R). When this mutation is introduced into the wild type cDNA of SI a mutant enzyme, SIC635R, is generated that shows a predominant localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Nevertheless, a definite localization of SIC635R in the Golgi apparatus and at the cell surface could be also observed. Epitope mapping with conformation-specific mAbs protease sensitivity assays, and enzymatic activity measurements demonstrate an altered folding pattern of SIC635R that is responsible for a substantially increased turnover rate and an aberrant sorting profile. Thus, SIC635R becomes distributed also at the basolateral membrane in contrast to wild type SI. Concomitant with the altered sorting pattern, the partial detergent extractability of wild type SI shifts to a complete detergent solubility with Triton X-100. The mutation has therefore affected an epitope responsible for the apical targeting fidelity of SI. Altogether, the combined effects of the C635R mutation on the turnover rate, function, polarized sorting, and detergent solubility of SI constitute a unique and novel pathomechanism of CSID.

The utilization of misfolding-related diseases has proven to be invaluable in dissection of the molecular mechanisms of protein transport and has unraveled several intriguing cell biological phenomena, such as in cases of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). 3The abbreviations used are: CSID, congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency; SI, sucrase-isomaltase (all forms); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; pro-SI, uncleaved sucrase-isomaltase; SIh, mannose-rich SI; SIc, complex glycosylated SI; DRMs, detergent-resistant membranes; mAb, monoclonal antibodies; SIC635R, mutant sucrase-isomaltase; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; endo H, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. This intestinal autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by the absence of the sucrase and most of the maltase digestive activity within the sucrase-isomaltase (SI) enzyme complex. The isomaltase activity varies from absent to normal (1Kerry K.R. Townley R.R. Aust. Paediatr. 1965; 1: 223-235Google Scholar). Clinically, the disease is manifested as an osmotic-fermentative diarrhea upon ingestion of disaccharides and oligosaccharides (2Treem W.R. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1995; 21: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Analysis of this disorder at the molecular and subcellular levels has unraveled a number of phenotypes of CSID, which are characterized by perturbations in the intracellular transport, polarized sorting, aberrant processing, and defective function of SI (3Fransen J.A.

A few examples have been also reported, in which the misfolded protein products may escape the quality control system, instead of being either degraded or retained in the ER. A mutation at the position 620 of SI (L620P), for example, has been identified as one of the possible genetic modifications occurring in the CSID (6Ritz V. Alfalah M. Zimmer K.P. Schmitz J. Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1678-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although this mutant is mainly found to be localized in the ER, it can be at least partially expressed also on the cell surface. Moreover, Propsting et al. (7Propsting M.J. Jacob R. Naim H.Y. J.

In fact, the protein can exit the ER and reach the cis-Golgi compartment eluding partially the quality control in the ER. SI is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein of two highly homologous subunits, sucrase and isomaltase (5Naim H.Y. Roth J. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M. Milla P. Schmitz J. Hauri H.P. J. Clin.

The two subunits are generated from a single polypeptide precursor, pro-SI, by trypsin cleavage in the intestinal lumen. The initial mannose-rich glycosylated pro-SI form exits the ER to the Golgi apparatus at a relatively slow rate (t1/2 ∼ 65 min) and is processed to a complex glycosylated mature protein that is heavily N- and O-glycosylated (11Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7242-7253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Particularly O-glycosylation is essential for the targeting of the protein to the apical membrane (12Matter K. Brauchbar M. Bucher K. Hauri H.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 429-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In fact, O-glycans that are located in the Ser/Thr-rich stalk domain proximal to the transmembrane region constitute an essential component of the apical sorting signal of SI that functions through direct association with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) (13Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe a new variant of CSID characterized by an exchange of a cysteine by an arginine at position 635 of the isomaltase subunit (C635R). We demonstrate that this mutant SI is transported to the cell surface at a substantially slower rate than its wild type counterpart, primarily because of an initial block in the ER. Moreover, an increased turnover, a reduced enzymatic activity, as well as partial missorting of the mutant to the basolateral membrane altogether account for the generation of CSID phenotype. Antibodies—Four epitope-specific anti-SI monoclonal antibodies (mAb), obtained from the hybridoma cell lines HBB 1/691, HBB 2/614, HBB 2/219, and HBB 3/705 (14Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and anti-lactase-phlorizin hydrolase and anti-aminopeptidase N mAbs were provided by H.P. Hauri (Biocenter, Basel, Switzerland) and E.E. Sterchi (University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland). Processing of Biopsy Samples—Intestinal biopsy specimens were obtained from a 20-year-old male patient. Pieces of comparable size from the same tissue were used for RNA isolation and biosynthetic labeling of the endogenous SI in organ culture according to Naim et al. (15Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biopsy specimens were continuously labeled for 4 h with 100 μCi of l-[35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 3.5 ml of methionine-free medium, homogenized, and processed to immunoprecipitate SI as well as lactase-phlorizin hydrolase and aminopeptidase N as control proteins (data not shown). Cloning and Mutagenesis of a cDNA Encoding SI—Total mRNA was isolated from biopsy specimens by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized by using the First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) with random hexamer nucleotide primers. The cDNA obtained from the patient was compared with the cDNA encoding the wild type SI by PCR. Seven different pairs of primers (16Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P. Ginsel L.A. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were used to amplify different fragments of the SI-cDNA in the presence of Isis-DNA polymerase (Qbiogene, Heidelberg, Germany) having 3′-5′-exonuclease activity. Sequencing of the PCR products revealed a T/C exchange at the nucleotide 1903 corresponding to substitution of the cysteine 635 by an arginine in the isomaltase subunit. This mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the wild type SI cloned in the vector pSG8-SI (17Moolenaar C.E. Ouwendijk J. Wittpoth M. Wisselaar H.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. Fransen J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 557-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SI mutant will be denoted hereafter as SIC635R. For confocal microscopic analyses of the mutation, the pEYFP-SI (18Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was used. This vector encodes the chimeric form of wild type SI fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The YFP-chimeras used in this study are denoted hereafter as SI-YFP (wild type) and SIC635R-YFP (mutant). They were obtained by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GAATACCTTTGGTTGGAGCAGATATCCGTGGATTTGTGGCTGAAACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTTCAGCCACAAATCCACGGATATCTGCTCCAACCAAAGGTATTC-3′. Synthesis of oligonucleotides and DNA sequencing was performed by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). Transfection of COS-1 and MDCK-II Cells—COS-1 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously by Naim et al. (15Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the stable expression of SI-YFP and SIC635R-YFP in polarized cells, MDCK-II cells were transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine) containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) for 21 days. Biosynthetic Labeling of COS-1 Cells, Immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE—Transiently transfected COS-1 cells, expressing either wild type SI or SIC635R, were labeled with 100 μCi of l-[35S]methionine in the presence of 3.5 ml of methionine-free medium. In pulse-chase experiments, after pulse labeling for 30 min to 2 h at 37 °C, cells were incubated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for different time intervals. SI was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by using a combination of anti-SI mAb and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (19Jacob R. Weiner J.R. Stadge S. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10630-10637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were finally detected by using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). Cell surface immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (21Jacob R. Brewer C. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2712-2721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were labeled with 100μCi of l-[35S]methionine for 6 h. Wild type SI or mutant C635R expressed on the cell surface was selectively detected by anti-SI mAbs added to the medium at 4 °C. After lysis, SI proteins were isolated by protein A-Sepharose. When required, immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to enzymatic digestion with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) according to a method described previously (22Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To investigate the sensitivity of both wild type SI and the SIC635R mutant to trypsin, immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated at 37 °C with either 35 or 500 μg of trypsin for 15 or 60 min, respectively. The reaction was stopped by addition of 250 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Preparation of Detergent-resistant Microdomains—DRMs were essentially prepared according to Alfalah et al. (13Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected COS-1 cells were biosynthetically labeled with 100 μCi of l-[35S]methionine for 4 h and lysed for 2 h on ice with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. A postnuclear supernatant of the detergent extracts was ultracentrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant and pellet fractions obtained were separately immunoprecipitated with anti-SI mAb and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal laser microscopy of COS-1 cells and of MDCK-II stable cell lines was performed with a Leica TCS SP2 microscope and a ×63 water planapochromat lens (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany). For indirect immunofluorescence, COS-1 cells expressing wild type SI or mutant SIC635R were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The expression of SI proteins at the cell surface was analyzed using a anti-SI mAb followed by an anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488. Biosynthesis and Processing of SI in the Cells of the Patient—The biosynthetic features of SI were first investigated in intestinal biopsy specimens obtained from a patient with CSID. The control utilized intestinal tissue from an individual who was biopsied for routine diagnostic purposes and most importantly did not suffer from malabsorption caused by enzyme deficiencies. The tissue specimens were labeled for 4 h with [35S]methionine, and SI was detected by immunoprecipitation from the total cell lysates. Fig. 1A shows the band pattern of the precursor forms of SI (pro-SI) expressed in the specimen of the patient and that of a control individual. The relative intensity of the mannose-rich (SIh) versus the complex glycosylated (SIc) form of pro-SI differs significantly in the tissue from the patient as compared with the control sample. Here, the ratio of the mature pro-SI to the ER-located mannose-rich protein is severalfold lower than that in the wild type counterpart. This could reflect substantial differences in the conversion rates of the immature pro-SI into its complex glycosylated counterpart in the patient affected by CSID. Identification of an Amino Acid Substitution C635R and Assessment of Its Function—Previous reports have shown that point mutations in the coding region of the SI gene are responsible for misfolding and alteration in the trafficking of SI along the secretory pathway (5Naim H.Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23506-23510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We therefore isolated the cDNA encoding SI from the biopsy specimen of the patient and analyzed its sequence in comparison to the wild type cDNA. One nucleotide exchange was revealed, which was mapped in the region encoding the isomaltase subunit. This mutation, T → C at nucleotide 1903, results in a substitution of a cysteine by an arginine at amino acid residue 635 (C635R). Table 1 compiles the SI primary sequence in different species and demonstrates that the Cys-635 of isomaltase is conserved. This together with the possible implication of cysteine in a disulfide bond formation suggests that this residue may play a crucial role in the context of a folding determinant. We therefore set out to investigate the role of the residue Cys-635 in sorting and trafficking events of newly synthesized SI by highlighting possible differences between wild type SI and SI bearing the C635R mutation. For this, the mutation C635R was introduced into wild type SI to generate the mutant indicated thereafter SIC635R.TABLE 1Comparison of an amino acid stretch encompassing the mutation C635R An alignment of the amino acids 628–647 of the SI from different species shows a high conservation of cysteine at position 635, indicting an important function of this domain.CSID (patient)P L V G A D I R G F V A E T T E E L C RSI (human)P L V G A D I C G F V A E T T E E L C RSI (rabbit)P L V G A D I C G F L A E T T E E L C RSI (mouse)P L V G A D I C G F V A D T T E E L C RSI (rat)P L V G A D I C G F V A D T T E E L C R Open table in a new tab Structural features and intracellular processing of SIC635R were first compared with those of wild type SI in biosynthetic labeling experiments combined with endo H treatment to assess the mannose-rich and complex glycosylated forms. Fig. 1B shows that SIC635R comprised two biosynthetic forms similar to its wild type counterpart: the mannoserich endo H-sensitive and complex glycosylated endo H-resistant forms. This indicated that the biosynthetic forms of the wild type and the mutant proteins are similar. The relationship of these two biosynthetic forms to each other, however, varied substantially in the mutant protein as compared with wild type SI. Here, mannose-rich SIC635R was the predominant form at this time point and constituted almost 90% of the total synthesized mutant protein. By contrast, wild type SI contained almost equal proportions of SIh (55%) and SIc (45%). The substantial reduction in the proportion of the complex glycosylated SIC635R is compatible with an effect of the C635R substitution on the conversion rate of the mannose-rich species to the mature protein. We delineated therefore the trafficking kinetics of SIC635R in comparison to the wild type protein in a pulse-chase experiment. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the conversion of the mannose-rich form of SIC635R to the complex form occurs at a slow rate with a half-life of over 6 h (Fig. 2B) with substantial proportions of the mannose-rich form persisting even after 6 h of chase. The wild type SI on the other hand is more rapidly processed as has been previously shown (13Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and ∼70% is converted into the 245-kDa complex form with increasing chase time points. Altogether these findings support a direct correlation between the pathologic phenotype of SI and its altered trafficking because of the C635R mutation. Moreover, the reduced rate of complex glycosylation of SIC635R suggests a prolonged intracellular localization of the mutant species. In light of the biochemical analyses we compared the subcellular and cell surface localization of mutant SIC635R with that of the wild type using chimeras of both proteins that have been fused to the yellow fluorescent protein. Fig. 3 demonstrates a predominant intracellular localization of the mutant protein. Most notably the ER is strongly labeled as assessed by an ER marker (Fig. 3A). Regions of the Golgi apparatus were also colabeled with galactosyltransferase and the mutant, however, to a lesser extent than with the wild type protein (Fig. 3B). The cell surface localization of SIC635R was also compared with that of the wild type protein employing cell surface immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled cells. At 6 h of chase both proteins acquired complex glycosylation and were isolated from the cell surface (Fig. 4A). However, the proportion of the mutant SIC635R protein at the cell surface as compared with its endogenous counterpart was almost half that of cell surface wild type SI. This suggests that the trafficking rate of complex glycosylated mutant SIC635R from the Golgi to the cell surface differs from that of the wild type protein and raises the question of a possible role of mechanisms that control protein transport in the Golgi. The C635R Alters the Folding of Mutant SIC635R—It is likely that the C635R mutation has induced folding alterations in the mutant SI that are subsequently the underlying cause of these differences in trafficking and processing rates. We therefore followed three approaches to determine whether the C635R substitution has induced gross structural alterations in SI. In the first approach, epitope mapping of mutant and wild type SI with conformation-specific antibodies was performed. The second utilized probing the folding of the mutant and comparing it with the wild type species by a protease-sensitivity assay using trypsin. Finally, the enzymatic activity of the mutant SI protein was compared with its wild type counterpart. The previously described antibodies, HBB 1/691, HBB 2/614, HBB 2/219, and HBB 3/705 (14Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) were used in the epitope mapping. Fig. 5 shows that the antibodies HBB 2/219, HBB 2/614, and HBB 1/691 recognized the mannose-rich and complex forms of the wild type and mutant proteins, albeit with varying affinities. Remarkably, however, the binding capacity of the HBB 3/705 antibody varied substantially between the SIC635R and the wild type protein. This antibody bound avidly the mannose-rich form of SIC635R mutant, whereas it reacted weakly with the wild type protein. It has been demonstrated that this antibody preferentially binds early forms of SI before they have reached the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, it recognizes denatured forms of SI on Western blots (14Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The characteristics of this antibody and its strong binding to the SIC635R mutant are clearly compatible with an altered folding pattern of the mutant as a consequence of the mutation. The epitope mapping data were further corroborated by a protease-sensitivity assay employing trypsin. In the intestinal lumen pancreatic trypsin cleaves mature SI when it is delivered to the brush-border membrane. The two generated subunits, sucrase and isomaltase, thereafter acquire trypsin resistance. As such trypsin is a quite convenient protease that could be used to probe possible folding alterations, whereby variations in the tryptic digestion pattern are synonymous for a conformational change in the SI protein. First, trypsin was applied at concentrations that are capable of cleaving wild type SI to the two subunits, which thereafter maintain resistance to further cleavage by the protease. Wild type and mutant SI were isolated from cells that have been labeled for 1 or 4 h to isolate the mannose-rich and complex glycosylated forms of SI and to assess their respective sensitivities toward trypsin. As shown in Fig. 6A two bands corresponding to the mannose-rich isomaltase and sucrase subunits were derived from the mannose-rich wild type SI and remained resistant toward trypsin as assessed by quantification of the total protein in the digested and non-digested samples. By contrast, the SIC635R mutant was readily degraded by trypsin. Similarly the complex glycosylated wild type SI, the predominant form in the 4 h pulse time point, was cleaved to sucrase and isomaltase that together appear as a diffuse band because of their close apparent molecular mass and heavy N- and O-linked glycosylation (13Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). SIC635R, on the other hand, was hardly detectable after trypsin digestion. The marked difference in the reactivity of the two proteins toward trypsin is indicative of altered folding patterns. The observation that the mutant protein acquires complex glycosylation in the Golgi, albeit at reduced rates, suggests that this mutant attains a partial conformational maturation sufficient for its exit from the ER to the Golgi. We therefore utilized milder digestion conditions to determine whether partial resistance to trypsin can be observed and intermediate folding determinants can be detected. Fig. 6B demonstrates that wild type SI was hardly digested at a lower trypsin concentration. By contrast, multiple digestion products of SIC635R were detected during several biosynthetic intervals comprising the sucrase and isomaltase subunits indicative of maturation of the mutant SI. The mutation C635R therefore did not completely prevent the protein from being correctly folded, but it has affected the maturation kinetics by delaying the acquisition of a native structure. Finally, the enzymatic activities of the mutant toward the substrates sucrose and isomaltose were analyzed. Here, a substantial decrease in the activity of sucrase was observed, whereas the activity of isomaltase was below detection limit. These measurements are indicative of an altered folding at least around the activity centers of the isomaltase and sucrase subunits (Fig. 7). The Mutation C635R Increases the Turnover Rate of the Mutant SI— Further we addressed the question whether the observed changes in the folding pattern are associated with an altered turnover rate. For this the turnover of the mutant SIC635R was compared with that of the wild type protein in pulse-chase experiments. It became obvious in these experiments that mutant SI started to disappear steadily throughout the chase time points and was no more detectable after 48 h of chase. By contrast, wild type SI was still persistent, predominantly in its complex glycosylated form at the same time point. This finding is in agreement with the folding analyses, which altogether show that the mutation C635R destabilizes the protein by impairing the folding and promoting a faster turnover (Fig. 8). The more rapid turnover of the SI mutant contributes, therefore, together with the reduced enzymatic activity to the CSID phenotype. Random Distribution of the Mutant SI in Polarized Cells—Although the mutant protein partially matures in COS-1 cells, acquires activity in its sucrase subunit and is delivered to the cell surface, its possible distribution at the cell surface in polarized cells has still to be assessed. This is important in view of the possibility that missorting could also contribute to the CSID phenotype. We therefore analyzed the sorting of the mutant in MDCK cells that have been transfected with a chimera of the mutant to which the yellow fluorescent protein has been fused. Confocal laser microscopy revealed an almost random distribution of the SIC635R mutant on both the apical and the basolateral cell surfaces. Wild type SI, on the other hand, reproduced the expected distribution profile of the protein on the apical surface of MDCK cells (18Jacob R. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1444-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 9A). The mutation C635R therefore does not only induce a slower cellular transport of SI, but has also affected or destroyed putative sorting elements in the SI protein leading to a protein missorting in polarized MDCK cells. The confocal data were corroborated by the cell surface immunoprecipitation of wild type and mutant SI from cells that have been grown on membrane filters. Fig. 9B shows that SI was predominantly isolated from the apical compartment in this filter system, whereas the mutant SIC635R was immunoprecipitated almost to the same extent from the apical and basolateral membranes. The observation that the mutant SI has lost its sorting fidelity due to the C635R mutation is also corroborated by the finding that it was not found to be associated with DRMs. Association with Triton X-100 DRMs has been demonstrated to be a crucial and an essential event along the apical sorting pathway of SI (13Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and several other proteins (25Alfalah M. Jacob R. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10683-10690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

Biol. 1990; 113: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fig. 10 shows that mutant SIC635R was entirely extracted with Triton X-100 because the DRM pellet was devoid of immunoprecipitable protein. On the contrary and as shown before, wild type SI was found also in the detergent-resistant pellet. Concluding Remarks—The current phenotype of CSID reveals unique and novel characteristics related to protein sorting and turnover and hitherto differs entirely from the known CSID cases (5Naim H.Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23506-23510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, retarded trafficking, an increased turnover rate, partial missorting, and partial enzymatic activity of SI are elicited by the C635R mutation and act together in concert to generate the deficiency phenotype. Of particular interest is the role of the mutation in converting SI from an exclusive apical targeting to a randomly distributed protein over the apical and basolateral membranes. The altered sorting behavior is primarily because of the complete solubility of the SIC635R mutant with Triton X-100 in contrast to the wild type SI, which is partially retained in DRMs. The lack of association with DRMs offers an explanation for the reduced delivery of mutant SIC635R to the cell surface in non-polarized COS-1 cells. In silico analysis of the domain containing the substituted amino acid reveals an alteration in the secondary structure represented by a loop protruding out of the affected domain in the vicinity of the O-glycosylated stalk region. We have previously demonstrated that an efficient apical sorting of SI requires two essential structural features in SI: an O-glycosylated stalk region (13Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and a membrane-anchoring domain for clustering SI into microdomains (28Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An active recognition of O-glycans in the stalk region by a lectin-like protein and efficient interaction are required for association of SI with lipid microdomains and subsequent apical sorting (24Spodsberg N. Jacob R. Alfalah M. Zimmer K.P. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23506-23510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is conceivable therefore that an altered structure in the vicinity of the stalk region, such as the hypothetical loop in this case of CSID, interferes with the binding and recognition of O-glycans in the SI protein and prevents efficient sorting to the apical membrane. The mutant SIC635R reveals two further important characteristics, an increased turnover rate and altered folding that together provide another explanation for the substantial increase in the distribution of the mutant SIC635R at the basolateral membrane. Along this, the altered folding of the protein may render it more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage at the apical membrane than at the basolateral membrane. Consequently, the steady state distribution of the mutant SI will shift from an almost exclusive apical location toward a more random distribution at both sides of the membrane concomitant with an overall more rapid turnover. Several protein hydrolases, e.g. endopeptidases, aminopeptidases and peptidases, are largely abundant at the apical, but not the basolateral membrane, of many epithelial cells and may contribute to the cleavage of mutant SI at the apical membrane. Polarized protein sorting in simple epithelial cells, such as in MDCK, Caco-2 or HT-29 cells, is predominantly achieved by selective signal-mediated targeting. The random distribution of mutant SI in this case is likely because of its stabilization at the basolateral surface by, for example, interactions with the submembrane cytoskeleton. Monoclonal antibodies against brush-border membrane proteins were kindly provided by Drs. Hans-Peter Hauri (University of Basel, Switzerland) and Erwin Sterchi (University of Bern, Switzerland)."

Together with previous findings in vertebrates and flies, these new results establish conserved function of Wnts in A-P guidance. Despite their enormous numbers and complexity, axonal networks are extremely carefully organized. Much of the scaffold of the network is established during earlier developmental stages, when growth cones navigate in embryonic structures. Remarkably, early growth cone navigation largely follows the logic of embryonic patterning along the same major body axes: anterior-posterior (A-P) and dorsal-ventral. Axon guidance cues along the dorsal-ventral axis are relatively well understood. For example, Netrins and Slits are conserved cues that play roles in directing growth cones along the dorsal-ventral axis as they grow toward or away from the midline (Dickson, 2002Dickson B.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Little has been known about the identity of the cues axons recognize along the A-P axis. This gap in understanding has begun to be filled with the realization that Wnt family proteins act as directional guidance cues in the A-P axis of the vertebrate spinal cord (Lyuksyutova et al., 2003Lyuksyutova A.I. Lu C.C. Milanesio N. King L.A. Guo N. Wang Y. Nathans J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Zou Y. Science. 2003; 302: 1984-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, Imondi and Thomas, 2003Imondi R.

Ascending sensory axons are attracted to higher concentration of Wnts anteriorly via Frizzled 3, a seven transmembrane domain receptor, and conversely, descending corticospinal tract axons are repelled from higher levels of Wnts via Ryk (Derailed), a Wnt receptor first found to mediate Wnt repulsion in Drosophila. A guidance role for Wnts is conserved in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord, where Wnt5 determines the pathway choice during midline crossing, allowing a subset of commissural axons to cross the midline only through the anterior commissure in each segment because they avoid Wnt5 in the posterior commissure via the Derailed receptor (Yoshikawa et al., 2003Yoshikawa S. McKinnon R.D. Kokel M. Thomas J.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Whether Wnts have a global A-P guidance role in Drosophila in addition to this intrasegmental A-P role is unknown. In the current issue of Developmental Cell, two elegant papers provide compelling evidence that multiple Wnts act as directional cues to control the A-P migration of growth cones and neuronal cell bodies as well as the initial polarity of neuronal processes in C. elegans (Hilliard and Bargmann, 2006Hilliard M.A. Bargmann C.I. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 379-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Pan et al., 2006Pan C.-L. Howell J.E. Clark S.G. Hilliard M. Cordes S. Bargmann C.I. Garriga G. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A third independent study also led to the finding that Wnt signaling controls neuronal polarity in the A-P axis in C. elegans (Prasad and Clark, 2006Prasad, B.C., and Clark, S.G. (2006). Development, in press.Google Scholar). These new exciting findings not only establish a conserved role of Wnt family signaling proteins in axon patterning along the long axis in animals but also provide intriguing new insights into the diverse mechanisms neurons adopt to utilize the directional information provided by Wnts. Given the number of Wnt proteins and receptors and their multitude of mechanisms, this family of guidance cues may play a major role in circuit assembly along the A-P axis. The search for A-P guidance mechanisms in C. elegans was first conducted by investigating neuronal cell migration along the A-P axis. Cynthia Kenyon's laboratory identified wnt/egl-20 as a gene required for normal A-P migration of the QL and QR neuroblasts, which give rise to sensory neurons on the left and right sides of the worm. frizzled/lin-17 and frizzled/mig-1 were also shown to be part of this regulatory system (Harris et al., 1996Harris J. Honigberg L. Robinson N. Kenyon C. Development. 1996; 122: 3117-3131PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses established that QL and QR cells respond differently to EGL-20 in a dose-dependent manner, such that QL is more sensitive to EGL-20 than QR. High levels of EGL-20 promote posterior migration by activating the canonical Wnt gene expression pathway in QL, inducing expression of the Hox gene mab-5 and a change in cell identity and A-P position (Maloof et al., 1999Maloof J.N. Whangbo J. Harris J.M. Jongeward G.D. Kenyon C. Development. 1999; 126: 37-49PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of EGL-20 promote anterior migration of QR through a different and unknown pathway (Whangbo and Kenyon, 1999Whangbo J. Kenyon C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 851-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because the QR descendents do not require a localized source of EGL-20 to migrate anteriorly, EGL-20 was thought to be a permissive cue rather than a directional guidance cue for A-P cell migration (Whangbo and Kenyon, 1999Whangbo J. Kenyon C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 851-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the wealth of mutant wnt and frizzled strains available in C. elegans, Gian Garriga's group from the University of California, Berkeley systematically analyzed the function of Wnts and Frizzled receptors in neuronal migration and axon guidance along the A-P axis in C. elegans. Remarkably, they found that all five Wnts and four Frizzleds in C. elegans function in neuronal migration and a subset of Wnts control anterior axon guidance, and at least Wnt/EGL-20 can function as a repellent that is sensed by Frizzled proteins. The hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs), a pair of motor neurons that control egg laying, are born at the posterior end of the worm body and migrate anteriorly. Wnt/EGL-20 and Frizzled/MIG-1 are required for this anterior migration: mutations in either gene cause HSNs to terminate their migration posterior to their normal positions. Although single mutants of four other wnt genes, cwn-1, cwn-2, lin-44, and mom-2, showed few or no posteriorly displaced HSNs, double mutants significantly enhanced egl-20 mutant phenotypes. Through an impressive series of genetic analyses, involving a sensitized background that eliminated another signaling cell, the Garriga lab convincingly showed that EGL-20 expressed in the tail of embryos and larvae serves as a repellent for the HSN cell bodies. Similarly, single mutations of the frizzled genes, mom-5 and cfz-2, and the Derailed/Ryk gene lin-18, had no effect on HSN on their own but enhanced the HSN migration defects of mig-1/frizzled mutants. Interestingly, another Frizzled gene, lin-17, appeared to antagonize mig-1, suggesting that Frizzled signaling has unexpected and unexplored complications. Building on this observation, the Garriga lab found that redundant Wnts and Frizzleds direct axon pathfinding along the A-P axis. The AVM and PVM mechanosensory neurons each extend a single process that initially projects ventrally and enters the ventral nerve cord then turn anteriorly and grow along the A-P axis. None of the Wnt, Frizzled, or lin-18/Ryk single mutants showed significant defects in AVM and PVM axon guidance, but double Wnt and Frizzled mutants displayed several A-P guidance defects, including premature stopping, abnormal branching at the ventral nerve cord, and posterior turning at the ventral nerve cord. The repulsion of AVM and PVM growth cones by these Wnts is mediated by two Frizzled receptors, MIG-1 and MOM-5. Importantly, overexpression of EGL-20 showed that a localized source of EGL-20 is important for AVM/PVM process guidance. Ectopic anterior expression of EGL-20 from a lim4 promoter caused AVM and PVM axon stopping and turning away from the EGL-20-expressing cells. Therefore, multiple Wnts may act as directional cues for axon and cell migrations along the A-P axis of the C. elegans. Looking into the A-P patterning of two other mechanosensory neurons, PLM and ALM, Cori Bargmann's group at the Rockefeller University found a distinct and novel function of Wnt signaling in regulating neuronal polarity. The PLM neuron has a longer anterior process and shorter posterior process that extend directly from the cell body. The ALM neuron has one single anterior process that extends from the cell body. Wnt signaling is again important for the A-P disposition of these processes. However, rather than acting as either attractive or repulsive directional cues, Wnts appear to control neuronal polarity along the A-P axis and thus affect the A-P orientation of the processes. In both lin-44 and lin-17 mutants, the PLM anterior process was severely shortened, whereas the posterior process became much lengthened. Analyses of the synaptic vesicle protein SNB-1 indicated that the entire PLM neuron was reversed along the body axis, sending its synapses into the wrong process. In addition, lin-44 and lin-17 double mutants showed similar defects to single mutants, suggesting that lin-44 and lin-17 are in the same genetic pathway. The gene lin-17 appears to function autonomously in the PLM, an important control for a frizzled gene that has many effects on cell fate patterning. What is interesting is that, in contrast to EGL-20 in HSN migration and AVM/PVM migration, the localization of LIN-44 appears to be relatively unimportant to the A-P orientation of the processes, for which LIN-44 might therefore act as a permissive cue. Alternatively, other Wns may also contribute to polarizing neuronal cell bodies along the A-P axis, because Wnt signaling was suggested to play an instructive role in polarizing nonneuronal cells along the A-P axis in C. elegans (Goldstein et al., 2006Goldtein B. Takeshita H. Mizumoto K. Sawa H. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 391-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). An elegant protein localization experiment from the Bargmann lab revealed a promising clue as to how Wnt signaling regulates neuronal polarity: a LIN-17-mRFP translational fusion protein was enriched in the PLM posterior process, suggesting that the Frizzled protein is distributed asymmetrically along the A-P axis. The asymmetric distribution of LIN-17 is dependent on LIN-44, although LIN-44 overexpression and misexpression had little effect on PLM neurons. For the ALM, located on the anterior side of the worm body, LIN-17 and LIN-44 are not important, but the redundant wnts, cwn-1 and egl-20, have an analogous polarity-reversing effect on ALM development. It is currently unknown which Frizzled is involved in ALM, because lin-17 mutants showed normal A-P polarity. However, overexpression of LIN-17 caused reversed ALM morphology. It is interesting that the A-P polarity phenotype appears reversed rather than randomized, suggesting that Wnt signaling may act as a balancing factor against another polarizing activity along the A-P axis. These new studies help to establish that Wnt signaling is an ancient strategy in patterning axonal connections along the A-P axis, from mammals to nematodes. Meanwhile, several new insights have emerged from these results. First, Frizzleds are diverse in function. So far, vertebrate studies have only identified attractive function of Frizzleds: Frizzled 3 mediates the attraction of commissural axons to Wnt4 and, probably, Wnt7b, during the anterior turning after midline crossing (Lyuksyutova et al., 2003Lyuksyutova A.I. Lu C.C. Milanesio N. King L.A. Guo N. Wang Y. Nathans J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Zou Y. Science. 2003; 302: 1984-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and several Frizzleds mediate the attractive response of dorsal retinal ganglion cell axons to low concentrations of Wnt3 in retinotopic mapping (Schmitt et al., 2006Schmitt A.M. Shi J. Wolf A.M. Lu C.C. King L.A. Zou Y. Nature. 2006; 439: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); similarly, in Drosophila, DFrizzled 2 mediates an attractive response of photoreceptor axons to DWnt4 in ventral lamina (Sato et al., 2006Sato M. Umetsu D. Murakami S. Yasugi T. Tabata T. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Conversely, in Drosophila, Derailed mediates Wnt5 repulsion during midline pathway selection (Yoshikawa et al., 2003Yoshikawa S. McKinnon R.D. Kokel M. Thomas J.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and vertebrate Ryk mediates repulsion of corticospinal tract axons from Wnt1 and Wnt5a and the repulsion of retinal ganglion cell axons from Wnt3 (Liu et al., 2005Liu Y. Shi J. Lu C.C. Wang Z.B. Lyuksyutova A.I. Song X. Zou Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, Schmitt et al., 2006Schmitt A.M. Shi J. Wolf A.M. Lu C.C. King L.A. Zou Y. Nature. 2006; 439: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, it appears that two Frizzled receptors, MIG-1 and MOM-5, actually mediate repulsion by EGL-20. Therefore, Frizzleds can mediate repulsion as well as attraction. Furthermore, another Frizzled receptor, LIN-17, antagonizes the function of MIG-1. These interactions may add to the repertoire of Frizzled receptor functions in nervous system wiring. It will be informative to compare the sequence differences of these different Frizzled receptors in both C. elegans and in vertebrates to discern the molecular mechanisms of this diversity. In a new piece of cell biology reminiscent of planar cell polarity, Frizzleds control neuronal cell polarity along the A-P axis, which has major implication in the studies of neuronal polarity. The diversity of Frizzled function suggests that interesting results will come from analysis of intracellular signaling cascades downstream of Frizzled in the nervous system. Second, Frizzled proteins can be asymmetrically localized in neurons. The asymmetric localization of the Frizzled proteins may determine the initial A-P neuronal polarity and potentially the direction of further growth along the A-P axis. Although guidance cues are known to cause directional turning of growth cones, it is still unknown what intracellular asymmetry allows growth cones to turn along a certain direction in response to a guidance cue. In the case of cell polarity, a mechanism involving Frizzled protein localization provides a possible insight. However, this is the first example where a guidance receptor is differentially distributed in the direction of polarity and growth. It will be of great interest to test how other Frizzled proteins, such as MIG-1 and MOM-5, are distributed during the guidance of the AVM and PVM processes along the A-P axis. Third, the direction of the Wnt gradients can be opposite in different animals. In mammals, Wnt-Frizzled signaling appears to respond to an anterior high, posterior low Wnt gradient (Lyuksyutova et al., 2003Lyuksyutova A.I. Lu C.C. Milanesio N. King L.A. Guo N. Wang Y. Nathans J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Zou Y. Science. 2003; 302: 1984-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, high posterior Wnt expression was observed. In the fly midline, Wnt5 is enriched in the posterior commissural in each embryonic segment, in a posterior high gradient, the same direction as in C. elegans. Therefore, although Wnt signaling has a conserved role in controlling A-P directionality, the direction of gradients can be distinct. In retinotectal map formation, vertebrate Wnt3 is expressed in a dorsal high, ventral low gradient and repels most of the retinal ganglion cell axons via Ryk (Schmitt et al., 2006Schmitt A.M. Shi J. Wolf A.M. Lu C.C. King L.A. Zou Y. Nature. 2006; 439: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The Drosophila visual system also appears to use Wnt signaling for retinotopic mapping along the dorsal-ventral axis, except that DWnt4 is enriched in the ventral target and attracts photoreceptor axons via DFrizzled 2 (Sato et al., 2006Sato M. Umetsu D. Murakami S. Yasugi T. Tabata T. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In recently years, the question of axon guidance along the A-P axis has received increasing attention. With the identification of these molecular cues, many new questions can be addressed. Wnt signaling has been suggested as a conserved mechanism to convey A-P directionality. In addition, Shh was proposed to regulate A-P guidance in the chick (Bourikas et al., 2005Bourikas D. Pekarik V. Baeriswyl T. Grunditz A. Sadhu R. Nardo M. Stoeckli E.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, Stoeckli, 2006Stoeckli E.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is interesting to ask whether all axons are guided by Wnts and Shh or whether there are additional guidance cues. Along the vertebrate dorsal-ventral axis, Netrin and Shh pull axons ventrally, and BMPs push axons from the dorsal side (Schnorrer and Dickson, 2004Schnorrer F. Dickson B.J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R19-R21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Along the A-P axis, Wnts appear to be one major force to direct A-P growth. Are there any other forces that push and pull axons together with Wnts along this axis? Do Wnts and Shh act together on the same axons, or on different axons? In the case of cell polarity control in C. elegans, loss of Wnt signaling appears to reverse the anterior and posterior processes, suggesting that there is another opposing force and that, once the Wnt activity is eliminated, the other force, which is likely weaker, takes over. What is the other competing force? This unidentified force could be another A-P guidance mechanism. Yet another important question is how these axons stop in the right A-P position. Certainly, understanding these guidance systems along the long axis will significantly advance our knowledge of how the nervous system is wired into highly organized networks. In human spinal cord, there are over 40 different longitudinal tracts. Knowing how they are guided along the A-P axis will likely benefit the efforts of therapeutic design for spinal cord injury and regeneration. Converging studies in mammals, flies, and C. elegans point to a common mechanism whereby directionality along the A-P axis may be conveyed by Wnt concentration gradients. Much remains to be done to explore the mechanisms of gradients in axonal guidance. Questions like how steep these gradients are in vivo, how they are detected to allow directional response of the growth cone, and how they are established will continue to stimulate investigation in years to come. Wnt Signals and Frizzled Activity Orient Anterior-Posterior Axon Outgrowth in C. elegansHilliard et al.Developmental CellMarch, 2006In BriefSecreted proteins of the Wnt family affect axon guidance, asymmetric cell division, and cell fate. We show here that C. elegans Wnts acting through Frizzled receptors can shape axon and dendrite trajectories by reversing the anterior-posterior polarity of neurons. In lin-44/Wnt and lin-17/Frizzled mutants, the polarity of the PLM mechanosensory neuron is reversed along the body axis: the long PLM process, PLM growth cone, and synapses are posterior to its cell body instead of anterior. Similarly, the polarity of the ALM mechanosensory neuron is reversed in cwn-1 egl-20 Wnt double mutants, suggesting that different Wnt signals regulate neuronal polarity at different anterior-posterior positions.

Recently, Wnt glycoproteins have been shown to guide axons along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis of the mammalian spinal cord. Here, we show that, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, multiple Wnts and Frizzled receptors regulate the anterior migrations of neurons and growth cones. Three Wnts are expressed in the tail, and at least one of these, EGL-20, functions as a repellent. We show that the MIG-1 Frizzled receptor acts in the neurons and growth cones to promote their migrations and provide genetic evidence that the Frizzleds MIG-1 and MOM-5 mediate the repulsive effects of EGL-20.
