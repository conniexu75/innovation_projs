https://openalex.org/W2114834688,"Speciation often involves the evolution of incompatible gene interactions that cause sterility or lethality in hybrids between populations. These so-called hybrid incompatibilities occur between two or more functionally divergent loci. We show that the nucleoporin 160kDa (Nup160) gene of the fruitfly Drosophila simulans is incompatible with one or more factors on the D. melanogaster X chromosome, causing hybrid lethality. Nup160 encodes a nuclear pore complex protein and shows evidence of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, the protein encoded by Nup160 directly interacts with that of another hybrid lethality gene, Nup96, indicating that at least two lethal hybrid incompatibility genes have evolved as byproducts of divergent coevolution among interacting components of the Drosophila nuclear pore complex."

Hexosaminidase assay may facilitate the early diagnosis of individuals homozygous for Tay-Sachs disease."
https://openalex.org/W1570319355,"Abstract The turnover of the protein constituents of the endoplasmic reticulum and certain cell fractions of rat liver has been examined by following the decay in specific radioactivity after a single administration of either uniformly labeled 14C-l-arginine or 14C-guanidino-l-arginine. Significantly shorter half-lives were obtained for all cell fractions when proteins were pulse-labeled with the guanidino-labeled arginine. The mean half-life for both rough and smooth microsomal membrane fractions was 2.0 to 2.1 days with guanidino-labeled arginine compared to 5.2 to 5.8 days with uniformly labeled arginine. We ascribe such differences to differing degrees of isotope reutilization. A new technique using two administrations of the same amino acid but labeled with different isotopes was developed to examine relative rates of degradation of proteins of the microsomal membranes. Proteins of the membrane, including NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome b5, and protein fractions solubilized by detergent and separated on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, had different rates of degradation. The administration of phenobarbital to rats induces proliferation of endoplasmic reticulum in the liver. Phenobarbital increased the rate of synthesis of some but not all proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum. The rate of synthesis of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was increased 3- to 4-fold over the basal rate; the rate of cytochrome b5 synthesis was increased to an insignificant extent. The rate of synthesis of some membrane proteins was decreased during phenobarbital administration. Phenobarbital had no effect on the rate of degradation of total membrane protein. These results indicate that the endoplasmic reticulum is a dynamic system with a rapid rate of renewal and are consistent with a mosaic model of membrane biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1582289324,"Abstract To study mechanisms whereby lytic proteins disrupt biomembranes, artificial phospholipid spherules (liposomes) were exposed to melittin, a cationic peptide in which sequences of hydrophobic (Positions 1 to 20) and hydrophilic (Positions 21 to 26) amino acids are unequally distributed. At concentrations above 10-6 m, melittin, which is the major toxin of bee venom, released marker anions (CrO4=) or glucose from the model structures. Release of marker ions was equivalent whether liposomes were prepared with a net negative (dicetyl phosphate) or net positive (stearylamine) charge. Nor was the presence of cholesterol in the model membranes necessary for the action of melittin. Spherules with net negative charges competed approximately 10 times more effectively for melittin's lytic activity on erythrocytes than did spherules with positive charges. Studies with lipid monolayers indicated that melittin had a remarkable affinity for the air-water and more so for the lipid-water interface, for it spread as a film readily from water and penetrated lipid monolayers avidly, irrespective of the surface charge of the lipid film. Negatively stained preparations of liposomes in the electron microscope showed that melittin-treated spherules lost the integrity of their concentric lamellae, which became beaded, frayed, and finally fragmented. These studies indicate that the lytic effects of melittin upon biological membranes may be due to a similar reaction with structural phospholipids. Since ionic interactions between the cationic peptide and charged lamellae were not crucial for lysis, and since melittin has an extraordinary affinity for lipid membranes, it is suggested that the surface activity of melittin and convenient apolar associations between hydrophobic portions of melittin and the acyl chains of phospholipid could account for disruption of the spherules."
https://openalex.org/W1562155085,"To determine the mechanism by which denervation leads to atrophy of skeletal muscle, the fate of previously labeled protein was studied in denervated and contralateral control muscles of hypophysectomized rats. To label muscle proteins, a single injection of 3H-leucine was given to the animals 2 days prior to section of the sciatic nerve. On subsequent days, the animals received unlabeled leucine and a high protein diet. Protein degradative rates were estimated from the disappearance of radioactivity from muscle proteins. Protein synthetic rates were estimated from the decrease in specific activity of these proteins, caused by the dilution of labeled proteins with newly synthesized (unlabeled) material. Ten days after denervation, atrophic muscles contained less total radioactivity than contralateral controls. This result suggests increased protein degradation. Nevertheless, the specific activity of muscle proteins remained unchanged. Protein synthesis therefore must also have decreased following nerve section. The loss of muscle weight following denervation appeared to be directly proportional to the increase in protein degradation. The increase in catabolism of myofibrillar proteins was especially marked, and this finding accounts for the relative loss of myofibrillar material in the denervated muscles. Analogous experiments were carried out to determine the mechanisms through which cortisone induces muscle atrophy. Two days after injection of labeled leucine, animals received daily injections of cortisone acetate (10 mg per day) or 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Cortisone caused marked atrophy of the plantaris muscle. Although the hormone decreased appreciably the amount of labeled proteins per muscle, it did not alter their specific activity. Thus cortisone both increased protein degradation and decreased protein synthesis. In contrast to denervation atrophy, cortisone-atrophy affected the breakdown of myofibrillar and soluble proteins similarly. Cortisone did not cause appreciable loss of weight of the soleus muscle, in which the hormone did not significantly increase protein degradation. However, upon denervation the soleus became susceptible to cortisone-induced atrophy, and in the denervated soleus cortisone further accelerated protein catabolism and reduced protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1585550871,"Abstract We report measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the nuclear magnetic spin lattice relaxation rate T1-1 of solvent protons in solutions of the diamagnetic protein apotransferrin, as a function of temperature, concentration, and pH. The bulk of the data were taken over a range of magnetic field (4 Oe to 1000 Oe) much lower than that traditionally used in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The major result in that T1-1 is highly magnetic field-dependent; it is very large below 10 Oe, and decreases monotonically as the magnetic field is increased. The data are compared with the predictions of several models for the interaction of solvent protons with the protein molecules, among them the model (Daszkiewicz, O. K., Hennel, T. W., Lubas, B., and Szczepkowski, T. W., Nature, 200, 1006 (1963)) in which water molecules bind irrotationally to the protein surface. The theory for all of the models is very similar. The conclusions are that proton exchange between the bulk water and the protein surface occurs via the exchange of water molecules in the pH range 5 to 8. At higher pH values, direct proton exchange with basic amino acid residues may be important. The theory shows that exchanging water molecules need not be irrotationally bound to the protein; it is sufficient that the water molecules be restricted to rotate about an axis that maintains a fixed geometry with respect to the protein molecule. The number of water molecules involved is a small fraction of the number usually considered to be in the first hydration shell. From the temperature dependence of the data, it is shown that the variation of T1-1 with magnetic field is related to the rotational diffusion relaxation time of the protein molecules, for all models considered. Additionally, the lifetime on the protein molecules of the exchanging entities, whether entire water molecules or individual protons, is in the range 0.1 to 10 µsec."
https://openalex.org/W1585077733,"Abstract The kinetics of oxidation of d-mannose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and d-glucose by glucose oxidase from Penicillium notatum has been studied in the pH range from 3 to 8 at 25°, in the presence of 0.2 m KCl. The pH dependence of the individual steps in the catalytic mechanism was determined by stopped flow spectrophotometric measurements of each half-reaction, in conjunction with conventional steady state kinetic measurements of the over-all reaction. The following scheme, originally deduced by Gibson, Swoboda, and Massey (J. Biol. Chem., 239, 3927 (1964)) for the enzyme from Aspergillus niger at pH 5.6 and 25°, was found to accommodate the results at any value of pH in the range examined. [see PDF for equation] where Eo, Er, S, and P are, respectively, oxidized enzyme, reduced enzyme, substrate, and product. The pH dependence and other characteristics of each step in turn are as follows. 1. The pH profile for k1 is sigmoid, and indicates that the combination of substrate with Eo is dependent upon a basic group (pK1 = 5.00 for mannose and glucose; pK1 = 5.35 for 2-deoxyglucose) in the enzyme. There is a small solvent deuterium isotope effect on k1. Halides have a specific effect on pK1, causing it to increase markedly, but have no effect on k1. 2. Flavin reduction, controlled by k2 and measured with 2-deoxyglucose, is relatively insensitive to pH in the range from 3 to 8. Halides also specifically decrease the rate of flavin reduction. 3. The pH profile for k4 is sigmoid and indicates that the combination of O2 with Er is dependent upon an acidic group (pK4 = 6.90) in the enzyme. 4. The pH profile for k5 is bell shaped and indicates that this terminal, first order process (which may consist of more than one step) is dependent upon an acidic (pK'5 = 7.40) and a basic (pK5 = 4.10) group in the enzyme. Based on these findings, a kinetic scheme is presented which accounts for the pH dependence of the steady state velocity of oxidation of the three sugars in the pH range from 3 to 8. Analogue simulation of the partition of the enzyme between oxidized and reduced forms during turnover at different values of pH, with experimentally determined values of acid dissociation and rate constants, agreed with turnover patterns obtained in stopped flow spectrophotometric experiments at 450 mµ."
https://openalex.org/W1621414326,"Abstract Species-specific differences in the distribution of lysine-rich histones were investigated in spleen tissue of three mammalian (calf, cat, and rat) and one avian (chicken) species. Tissue-specific differences in the distribution of the lysine-rich histones were studied in liver, kidney, spleen, and thymus tissues of the rat; liver, spleen, and thymus of the calf; and liver, spleen, and erythrocytes of the chicken. The lysine-rich histone fractions were extracted with aqueous trichloracetic acid from 0.14 m NaCl-washed tissue homogenates and isolated nuclei. The extracts were fractionated by gradient elution chromatography on Amberlite IRC-50 with a linear gradient of guanidinium chloride. Species-specific lysine-rich histone components were observed in the elution profiles for the spleen of calf, rat, cat, and chicken which showed three, five, four, and five distinct components, respectively. Studies on the electrophoretic mobility of the whole lysine-rich histone fractions in polyacrylamide gels showed that the rat spleen fraction contained a component not found in either calf spleen or chicken spleen. In addition, the chicken spleen fraction contained a component not found in the calf spleen fraction. Amino acid analysis of the individual chromatographic components of four different species showed that the over-all compositions were remarkably similar except for a single component found in four tissues of the rat. Treatment of this component with cyanogen bromide indicated that methionine was an integral part of the primary structure. This is the first report of the presence of methionine in a purified lysine-rich histone from any source. Quantitative differences were found between a number of corresponding lysine-rich histones of different tissues of the same species, both mammalian and avian, but the complement of histones for a given species was identical in all tissues studied. Planimetric analysis of duplicate chromatographic profiles of three separate preparations of the rat thymus, spleen, liver, and kidney fractions showed that the thymus fraction contained a 4- to 7-fold greater amount of Component 1 compared to the liver, spleen, and kidney fractions. The kidney fraction contained about one-half the amount of both Components 2 and 5 compared to the thymus, liver, and spleen fractions. All four tissues contained similar relative proportions of Component 3, but the kidney fraction contained approximately twice as much of Component 4 compared to the other three fractions. Absorbance profiles of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of the lysine-rich histone fractions of rat thymus, spleen, and liver provided similar results. However, precise quantitative determination of minor components was not possible because of the relatively small differences in mobility between certain components."
https://openalex.org/W1532181980,"Rates of protein catabolism were compared in nongrowing skeletal muscle, in muscles undergoing work-induced hypertrophy, and in muscles growing in response to treatment with pituitary growth hormone. Hypophysectomized rats were injected initially with 3H-leucine, and on subsequent days received unlabeled leucine and a high protein diet to minimize reutilization of the 3H-leucine. Rates of protein degradation were estimated from the loss of radioactive proteins. Rates of protein synthesis were estimated from the amount of dilution of previously labeled proteins with newly synthesized unlabeled material (decrease in specific activity). Two days after injection of 3H-leucine, hypertrophy of the soleus of one limb was induced by sectioning the tendon of the gastrocnemius muscle. During compensatory growth, the soleus retained more of the labeled proteins than its contralateral control muscle. Nevertheless, the specific activity of the proteins decreased. It is concluded that during hypertrophy there is decreased protein catabolism as well as increased synthesis of new proteins. In addition, the degradation of sarcoplasmic (soluble) proteins decreased more markedly than that of myofibrillar proteins, resulting in a relative increase in the sarcoplasmic proteins during compensatory growth. Treatment of the hypophysectomized rats with bovine growth hormone (1 mg per day) was initiated 2 days after injection of 3H-leucine. Ten days later, the content of labeled proteins in the soleus of hormone-treated animals was indistinguishable from that in the smaller muscles of control rats. However, the specific activity of protein from muscles was significantly lower in the hormone-treated rats. These results indicated that unlike work-induced hypertrophy, growth hormone increased protein synthesis in muscle without changing protein degradative rates."

https://openalex.org/W1499054486,A study has been made of the fluorescence and absorption changes that occur when Cu++ and Fe+++ bind to transferrin. Calculations of the overlap integrals and critical transfer distances involved show that the large fluorescence quenching produced by this binding is consistent with Forster long range energy transfer from tryptophan to absorption bands produced by the metal-protein interaction. A nonlinear dependence of fluorescence on metal binding was observed for iron but not for copper. This is also consistent with the Forster mechanism. Agreement between the experimental fluorescence results for iron binding and a phenomenological treatment with a random binding model is presented as evidence for independent and equivalent metal-binding sites in transferrin. Difference absorption spectra were obtained for the 250 to 600 mµ spectral range. Characteristic peaks in the region of tyrosine and tryptophan absorption indicated perturbation of these chromophores by the binding of metal ions.
https://openalex.org/W1573203666,"Abstract Several metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway, together with related intermediates of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, were measured in cerebral tissue of mice after periods of ischemia, anesthesia by phenobarbital, hyperthermia, hypothermia, and iodoacetate and fluoroacetate poisoning. Normal levels (micromoles per kg) were found to be 6-P-gluconate, 10; ribulose-5-P, 7; xylulose-5-P, 14; and erythrose-4-P, less than 2. The sum of ribose-5-P and sedoheptulose-7-P was 64 µmoles per kg. During 5 min of complete ischemia, 6-P-gluconate decreased 30% and xylulose-5-P fell 80%. Ribulose-5-P was also sharply reduced. Anesthesia resulted in increases of 40 to 50% for ribulose-5-P and xylulose-5-P without change in 6-P-gluconate. Anesthesia also prevented or greatly diminished the changes in phosphate intermediates induced by ischemia. Hypothermia resulted in decreases in ribulose-5-P and xylulose-5-P, and an increase in 6-P-gluconate. Conversely, hyperthermia exactly reversed the pattern of these changes. Iodoacetate intoxication resulted in marked increases in ribulose-5-P and xylulose-5-P, but glucose-6-P and 6-P-gluconate fell below control values. There did not appear to be any direct correlation between the magnitude of the pentose phosphate increases and those of the triose phosphates. In fluoroacetate-treated mice glucose-6-P levels increased approximately 3-fold, whereas intermediates in the pentose phosphate pathway and triose phosphates remained near control levels or fell slightly. The results are compatible with a regulatory mechanism at both of the dehydrogenase steps with some effect of glyceraldehyde-P and fructose-6-P concentrations on the levels of intermediates of the pentose pathway below 6-P-gluconate."

https://openalex.org/W1493077871,"Abstract Equations are set up to calculate the observed standard free energy change for the hydrolysis of ATP (namely, ΔGobs, the quantity evaluated on the basis of total ATP, ADP, and orthophosphate concentrations at equilibrium, irrespective of the state of ionization or complex formation, or both) as a function of pH and Mg2+ ion concentration. The variation of ΔGobs is analyzed in terms of ΔG, the standard free energy change with respect to the 1 molal standard states for the H+ and Mg2+ ions, and the driving force due to the prevailing H+ and Mg2+ ion concentrations with data extrapolated to zero ionic strength so that the standard free energy, enthalpy, and entropy changes are free from minor contributions arising from unspecific ionic interactions. The variation of ΔG is then discussed in terms of the component enthalpy and entropy changes for the individual hydrolysis equilibria which predominate over the pH range 6 to 9 as first the ATP, then the ADP, and finally the orthophosphate are converted into Mg2+ complexes. The calculations, based on data for the glutamine synthetase and hydrolysis reactions, lead to a revised value for ΔGobs at pH 7.5, 25°, and µ = 0.2 of -10.7 kcal per mole. Series of values are listed in an appendix for various ionic strengths at 25° and 37° over the pH range 6 to 9 with Mg2+ concentrations up to 50 mm, from which ΔGobs for other reaction conditions can be obtained by interpolation."
https://openalex.org/W1506041395,"Abstract A procedure is described for the isolation of fig lysozyme from dried fig latex. The pure enzyme has a molecular weight of 29,000 and consists of a single polypeptide chain with amino-terminal glycine and carboxyl-terminal isoleucine residues. With Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells as substrate, the enzyme exhibits a sharp pH optimum at pH 4.5. Fig lysozyme is considerably more active toward chitin and tetra-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine than egg-white lysozyme. The enzyme shows a strong ionic strength dependence, maximal activity being attained at an ionic strength of 0.02 to 0.03. The physical and enzymatic properties of fig lysozyme are strikingly similar to those of papaya lysozyme, although the amino acid compositions of the two enzymes show many differences. Fig lysozyme, just as papaya and egg-white lysozymes, is powerfully inhibited by histamine. A mechanism for this inhibition is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W1497966777,"Abstract Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with lysozyme at 13° and 20°, 0.15 ionic strength, and near pH 8 have shown that the presence of N-acetylglucosamine and of the disaccharide (GlcNAc-GlcNAc) and trisaccharide (GlcNAc-GlcNAc-GlcNAc) greatly reduces the extent of reversible dimerization of lysozyme reported previously (Sophianopoulos, A. J., and Van Holde, K. E., J. Biol. Chem., 239, 2516 (1964)). This indicates that the enzymatically active region of lysozyme is one of the sites of contact for the formation of dimer in solution or is near such a site. The dimer dissociation constant of lysozyme in the absence of saccharide at 20° and under the conditions described above is Kd = (P)2/(PP) = (2.71 ± 0.24) x 10-3 m. If it is assumed that saccharide (S) can bind to the monomer protein species (P) to form a complex (PS) but that the dimer species (PS·PS) cannot be formed, the values for the dissociation constant of the PS complex Ks = (P)(S)/(PS) can be calculated indirectly, by using exclusively results from sedimentation equilibrium experiments in the presence and absence of the saccharides. Two distinct sets of values of Ks are obtained, depending on whether it is assumed that the reversible dimerization is a to tail process (Case 1) or a to head one (Case 2). The average values of Ks obtained for the GlcNAc-protein complex are: assuming Case 1 at 20°, (2.1 ± 0.7) x 10-2 m and at 13°, (1.0 ± 0.4) x 10-2 m; for Case 2 at 20°, (7.5 ± 2.8) x 10-2 m and at 13°, (4.8 ± 1.7) x 10-2 m. The saccharides GlcNAc-GlcNAc and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-GlcNAc are hydrolyzed slowly during sedimentation equilibrium so that equilibrium, presumably, was not reached. The values of Ks calculated for GlcNAc-GlcNAc and GlcNAc-GlcNAc-GlcNAc were approximately an order of magnitude larger than those obtained by dialysis. The values of Ks obtained when Case 1 is assumed for GlcNAc agree much better with the ones obtained from equilibrium dialysis. Previous studies indicated that a group with a pKa of 6.2 is affected by the dimerization of lysozyme and that this group is probably a carboxylate. Since the present study indicated that the active site is involved in the dimerization of lysozyme and crystallographic studies indicate that glutamic acid residue 35 lies in the cleft of the active region and that it probably has a high pKa, a reasonable conclusion is that the ionizable group with a pKa of 6.2 which is involved in dimerization is glutamic acid residue 35."

https://openalex.org/W1526970130,"Abstract The labeling of the methylated phospholipids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied with methionine-methyl-14C, serine-3-14C, and choline-1,2-14C as precursors. It was found that inclusion of 1 mm choline in the growth media greatly lowered the rate of labeling of the methylated phospholipids by methionine and serine; sterol labeling was unaffected. It is suggested that this is a result of repression of synthesis of the specific N-methyl transferases involved in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine. A study in vitro with methyl-14C-S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor showed that particles prepared from cells grown in the absence of choline had a much higher rate of phospholipid methylation than the particles prepared from choline-grown cells.

The purified polymerase was free of endonuclease but contained an exonuclease whose activity was proportional to the polymerase activity throughout the purification. Exonuclease activity, as reflected by loss of template, was not evident under conditions of synthesis, but was easily detected in the absence of DNA synthesis. The enzyme was inactivated by heat in the absence of DNA. In the presence of activated DNA, a transitory enhancement of activity was observed upon heating. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of native DNA showed poor affinity of the enzyme for native DNA.

Relationships between the two types of molecule are discussed and it is suggested that proteinpolysaccharide structures involving subunits with molecular weights near 2 to 3 x 105 should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1486321911,"Senescent yellow leaves of Ricinus communis L. rapidly metabolize exogenous ricinine (N-methyl-3-cyano-4-methoxy-2-pyridone) which is present in all R. communis tissues except the one mentioned. Identity of the metabolic product was examined by mass spectrometry, ultraviolet, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra; it proved to be N-demethylricinine (3-cyano-4-methoxy-2-pyridone). N-Demethylricinine is not present in green leaves but when supplied as an exogenous source it is rapidly methylated yielding ricinine. Thus, it also appears to be the immediate precursor of the alkaloid in green leaves. These N-methylation and N-demethylation reactions may have a role in ricinine translocation during senescence. This is the first report describing: (a) a specific alkaloid catabolic reaction occurring in the plant that produced it; (b) the fact that the catabolic product formed in yellow leaves can also serve as a precursor in green leaves; and (c) the fact that alkaloid catabolism may be related to the aging process."

The first diffraction pattern from single crystals of human biological apatite was obtained from the plaque material of a freshly excised plaque when it was equilibrated with its aqueous environment. As the plaque material dried, the discrete spots characteristic of single crystal diffraction disappeared, leaving only the powder pattern of apatite."
https://openalex.org/W1594086349,"A chymotryptic digest of the human κ Bence-Jones protein Ag was prepared to enable the ordering of its tryptic peptides and the determination of its amino acid sequence. Thirty-five chymotryptic peptides were purified by column chromatography, paper chromatography, and paper electrophoresis and their amino acid compositions were determined. The partial or complete amino acid sequence was determined for 15 peptides. The complete sequence is given for 6 of the chymotryptic peptides totalling 66 residues from positions 33 through 98 where tryptic peptides were unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W2083490135,Partial charge distribution on first and second neighbor atoms to nitrogen in choline and ethanolamine have been calculated. Coulombic and steric parameters were then utilized to evaluate the interaction of a negative test charge with the two molecules. Both the position and the magnitude of the maximum of interaction energy in the two systems were significantly different. The results suggest that ethanolamine interacts more strongly with anions than choline does. This is due principally to steric repulsion of the negative charge by the methyl groups in choline.

Another group received a dose of acetyl strophanthidin which was nontoxic in controls, but which resulted in a ventricular arrhythmia in six of seven animals on antibiotic treatment. Enhancement of loss of potassium ion from the myocardium by the antibiotic was presumed to be related to the altered cardiac rhythm."
