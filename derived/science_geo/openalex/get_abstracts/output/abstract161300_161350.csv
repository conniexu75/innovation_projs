https://openalex.org/W2164354034,"In PC12 cells, epidermal growth factor (EGF) transiently stimulates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, and provokes cellular proliferation. In contrast, nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation leads to the sustained activation of the MAPKs and subsequently to neuronal differentiation. It has been shown that both the magnitude and longevity of MAPK activation governs the nature of the cellular response. The activations of MAPKs are dependent upon two distinct small G-proteins, Ras and Rap1, that link the growth factor receptors to the MAPK cascade by activating c-Raf and B-Raf, respectively. We found that Ras was transiently stimulated upon both EGF and NGF treatment of PC12 cells. However, EGF transiently activated Rap1, whereas NGF stimulated prolonged Rap1 activation. The activation of the ERKs was due almost exclusively (>90%) to the action of B-Raf. The transient activation of the MAPKs by EGF was a consequence of the formation of a short lived complex assembling on the EGF receptor itself, composed of Crk, C3G, Rap1, and B-Raf. In contrast, NGF stimulation of the cells resulted in the phosphorylation of FRS2. FRS2 scaffolded the assembly of a stable complex of Crk, C3G, Rap1, and B-Raf resulting in the prolonged activation of the MAPKs. Together, these data provide a signaling link between growth factor receptors and MAPK activation and a mechanistic explanation of the differential MAPK kinetics exhibited by these growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2161954110,"The endogenous ligand of CB1cannabinoid receptors, anandamide, is also a full agonist at vanilloid VR1 receptors for capsaicin and resiniferatoxin, thereby causing an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in human VR1-overexpressing (hVR1-HEK) cells. Two selective inhibitors of anandamide facilitated transport into cells, VDM11 and VDM13, and two inhibitors of anandamide enzymatic hydrolysis, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and methylarachidonoyl fluorophosphonate, inhibited and enhanced, respectively, the VR1-mediated effect of anandamide, but not of resiniferatoxin or capsaicin. The nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside, known to stimulate anandamide transport, enhanced anandamide effect on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Accordingly, hVR1-HEK cells contain an anandamide membrane transporter inhibited by VDM11 and VDM13 and activated by sodium nitroprusside, and an anandamide hydrolase activity sensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and methylarachidonoyl fluorophosphonate, and a fatty acid amide hydrolase transcript. These findings suggest the following. (i) Anandamide activates VR1 receptors by acting at an intracellular site. (ii) Degradation by fatty acid amide hydrolase limits anandamide activity on VR1; and (iii) the anandamide membrane transporter inhibitors can be used to distinguish between CB1 or VR1 receptor-mediated actions of anandamide. By contrast, the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A inhibited also the VR1-mediated effect of anandamide and capsaicin on cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, although at concentrations higher than those required for CB1 antagonism.

Since its discovery, several observations have supported the hypothesis that AEA is an endocannabinoid, i.e. a functional activator of CB1 receptors (see Refs. 3Di Marzo V. Melck D. Bisogno T.

Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-212PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor is a ligand-gated, nonselective cation channel and was recently cloned and named VR1 (16Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6940) Google Scholar). It is most abundant in sensory neurons but is also found in select areas of the central nervous system of rats and men (17Mezey E. Toth Z.E. Cortright D.N. Arzubi M.K. Krause J.E. Elde R. Guo A.

AEA, at concentrations similar or higher than those necessary to activate CB1 cannabinoid receptors, elicits typical VR1-mediated functional responses, such as endothelium-independent vasodilation of small arteries (11Zygmunt P.M.

The selective antagonist of vanilloid receptors, capsazepine (18Bevan S. Hothi S. Hughes G. James I.F. Rang H.P. Shah K. Walpole C.S. Yeats J.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) strongly reduces these effects. Furthermore, AEA activates VR1-mediated cation currents in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells or Xenopus oocytes overexpressing either rat or human VR1 (11Zygmunt P.M. Petersson J. Andersson D.A.

Chambers J.K. Randall A.D. Davis J.B. Br. J.

Gibson T.M. Brockie H.C. Leslie M. Pashmi G. Craib S.J. Di Marzo V. Pertwee R.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 132: 631-640Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These data indicate that, along with its proposed role as an endocannabinoid, AEA might also function as an endovanilloid. However, whether or not AEA behaves as a physiological ligand for VR1 is still being debated (19Szolcsanyi J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 203-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,20Zygmunt P.M. Julius D. Di Marzo V. Högestatt E.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 43-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and further studies need to be performed to give an answer to this question.The possible regulation of the activity of AEA at VR1 receptors by biochemical events leading to the physiological inactivation of AEA and by agents that pharmacologically or physiologically modulate these events, could be taken as evidence in favor of a possible role for this compound also as an endovanilloid. Furthermore, the use of antagonists for either CB1 or VR1 receptors, such as SR1417161 (21Rinaldi-Carmona M. Barth F. Haulme M. Shire D. Calandra B. Congy C. Martinez S. Mariuani J. Neliat G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Soubrie P. Breliere J.-C. Le Fur G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar) and capsazepine (18Bevan S. Hothi S. Hughes G. James I.F. Rang H.P. Shah K. Walpole C.S. Yeats J.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), respectively, should help in discriminating between those effects of AEA that are mediated by either receptor. Therefore, in the present study we have addressed the question of whether the mechanisms previously shown to cause the inactivation of AEA, i.e. uptake by cells facilitated by a selective AEA membrane transporter (AMT), followed by either hydrolysis catalyzed by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) or oxidation by enzymes of the arachidonate cascade such as lipoxygenases (LOXs) (see Refs. 4Hillard C.J. Campbell W.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2383-2398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Hillard C.J. Jarrahian A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 23Ueda N. Puffenbarger R.A. Yamamoto S. Deutsch D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar for specific reviews), also modulate the effect of AEA on VR1 receptors. Furthermore, based on previous reports showing that SR141716A, particularly at high concentrations, is not selective for the CB1 receptor (24White R. Hiley C.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Chaytor A.T. Martin P.E. Evans W.H. Randall M.D. Griffith T.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we have investigated the effects of this compound on a typical vanilloid-like, and non-CB1-mediated, effect of AEA, to assess whether it can be used to discriminate between VR1- and CB1-mediated AEA actions. Our results suggest that AEA interacts with VR1 at an intracellular site, and, hence, its activity at either VR1 or CB1 receptors can be regulated via the AMT and is significantly limited by intracellular enzymatic hydrolysis. Moreover, our data show that SR141716A can act as an inhibitor of VR1-mediated signaling, albeit at concentrations higher than those required for CB1 receptor antagonism and as such should be used with some caution to distinguish between AEA as an endocannabinoid or endovanilloid.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTransfected CellsExpression of hVR1 cDNA into HEK 293 cells was carried out as described previously (26Hayes P.

Cells were grown as monolayers in minimum essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.2 mm glutamine and maintained under 95:5% O2/CO2 at 37 °C.CompoundsCapsaicin, AEA, and methylarachidonoyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). VDM11 and VDM13 (Fig. 1; Ref. 27De Petrocellis L. Bisogno T. Davis J.B. Pertwee R.G Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) were synthesized from the corresponding amines and arachidonoyl chloride (all from Sigma) in dimethylformamide, in the presence of 1.1 equivalents of triethylamine for 18 h at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding water and by extracting the products with diethyl ether. The compounds were purified by direct phase-high pressure liquid chromatography, and chemical structures were confirmed by means of proton nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy. [14C]AEA (5 mCi/mmol) was synthesized from [14C]ethanolamine and arachidonoyl chloride as described (1Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin G. Gibson D. Mandelbaum A. Etinger A. Mechoulam R. Science. 1992; 258: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (4616) Google Scholar). SR141716A was kindly donated by Sanofi Recherche, Montpellier, France. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), arachidonic acid, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) and caffeic acid (CA) were purchased from Sigma. Capsazepine and resiniferatoxin were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. The unselective AMT inhibitor AM404 was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbour, MI). The 5(S)-, 11(S)-, and 15(S)- hydroperoxy derivatives of AEA (Fig. 1) were generated by incubating 40 μm AEA with soybean lipoxygenase-1 (sLOX) or barley lipoxygenase-1 (bLOX), purified as reported (sLOX, Ref. 28Finazzi-Agrò A. Avigliano L. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Boldingh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 326: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; bLOX, Ref. 29van Aarle P.G.M. de Barse M.M.J. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). AEA was incubated with lipoxygenase (1 unit per 3 μmol of substrate) in 100 mmsodium borate buffer (pH 9.0 for sLOX and pH 7.0 for bLOX), following the reaction spectrophotometrically at 236 nm. After completion (15 min), the pH was lowered to 4, and the products were purified with SPE columns (Bakerbond 500 mg, J.T. Baker) and then with reverse phase-HPLC as described (30van Zadelhoff G. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Reverse phase-HPLC was carried out on a Cosmosil 5C18 AR column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) using tetrahydrofuran/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:40:35:0.1, v/v/v/v) as eluent, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 15-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoylethanolamide (HETEE) was the major product (∼95%) of sLOX, whereas 11- and 5-HEA were the major products (∼70% and ∼15% respectively) of bLOX. The enantiomeric ratio (S/R) of each hydroperoxide was found to be 95:5 by chiral separations and CD spectroscopy (30van Zadelhoff G. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Cytosolic Ca2+ Concentration (CCC) AssaysThe effect of the substances on CCC (27De Petrocellis L. Bisogno T. Davis J.B. Pertwee R.G Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) was determined by using Fluo-3, a selective intracellular fluorescent probe for Ca2+. One day prior to experiments, hVR1-HEK cells were transferred into 6-well dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and grown in the culture medium mentioned above. On the day of the experiment, the cells (50,000–60,000 per well) were loaded for 2 h at 25 °C with 4 μm fluo-3 methylester (Molecular Probes) in Me2SO containing 0.04% pluoronic. After the loading, hVR1-HEK cells were washed with Tyrode pH = 7.4, trypsinized, resuspended in Tyrode, and transferred to the cuvette of the fluorescence detector (Perkin-Elmer LS50B) under continuous stirring. Experiments were carried out by measuring cell fluorescence at 25 °C (λEX = 488 nm, λEM = 540 nm) before and after the addition of the test compounds at various concentrations. Capsazepine and SR141716A or EGTA (4 mm), MAFP, PMSF, SNP, ETYA, and CA were added 30 or 10 min, respectively, before AEA or capsaicin or resiniferatoxin, whereas the AMT inhibitors were added 5 min before. Data are expressed as the concentration exerting a half-maximal effect (EC50). The efficacy of the effect was determined by comparing it to the analogous effect observed with 4 μm ionomycin. The inhibitory effects of AMT inhibitors and of antagonists were expressed as IC50 calculated by GraphPad software. For the antagonists, Ki values at approximately half-saturating concentrations of agonists were calculated by means of the Cheng-Prusoff equation.Kc values for competitive antagonism were calculated by means of the following equation:Kc = [ant]/{(EC 50+ /EC 50−) − 1}, where [ant] is the concentration of SR141716A (2.5 μm) and EC 50+ and EC 50− are the EC50 values obtained for agonists in the presence and absence of 2.5 μm SR141716A, respectively.AEA Hydrolase Activity AssayshVR1-HEK cells were cultured as described above. The effect of VDM11, VDM13, PMSF, and MAFP on the enzymatic hydrolysis of AEA was studied as described previously (31Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) by using cell membranes incubated with either of the two compounds at different concentrations and [14C]AEA (9 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, for 30 min at 37 °C. [14C]Ethanolamine produced from [14C]AEA hydrolysis was measured by scintillation counting of the aqueous phase after extraction of the incubation mixture with 2 volumes of CHCl3/CH3OH 2:1 (v/v).Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for FAAHAnalysis of the RNA from hVR1-HEK cells for the presence of a FAAH transcript was carried out by means of RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells (10 × 106/test) as described (32Bouaboula M. Rinaldi M. Carayon P. Carillon C. Delpech B. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesis was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTPs, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 5 μg of total RNA, 0.125A260 units of hexanucleotide mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for random priming and 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then at 42 °C for 50 min, and the reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by lowering the temperature at 4 °C. RT-PCR amplification was performed by means of a combination of hot-start and touch-down PCR, and using 2 μl of the cDNA and 1.25 units of Taq GOLD (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 μl of its buffer containing 3 mm MgCl2, 250 μm of each dNTPs, and 0.5 μm each of 5′ and 3′ primers. Reactions were performed in a Gene Amp PCR System 9600 thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amplification profile consisted of an initial denaturation of 10 min at 92 °C and 15 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 66 °C (annealing) and 1 min at 68 °C (with an annealing temperature stepping down of 1 °C every 3 cycles, from 66 to 61 °C), followed by 25 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 61 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. A final extension of 15 min was carried out at 72 °C. The primers used were: FAAH sense primer, 5′-GCCTGGGAAGTGAACAAAGGGACC-3′ and FAAH antisense primer, 5′-CCACTACGCTGTCGCACTCCGCCG-3′. The expected sizes of the amplicon was 202 bp. β2-microglobulin was used as the housekeeping gene (32Bouaboula M. Rinaldi M. Carayon P. Carillon C. Delpech B. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). PCR primers for FAAH were selected on the basis of the sequence of the FAAH human gene (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF098012) by including the intron 497–722. In the presence of contaminant genomic DNA, the expected size of the amplicon would be 425 bp. PCR products (15 μl) were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel (MS agarose, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 1× TAE buffer at 4 V/cm for 4 h. Ethidium bromide (0.1 μg/ml) was included both in the gel and electrophoresis buffer, and PCR products were detected by UV visualization. No PCR product was detected in the absence of cDNA, primers, or Red-hot DNA polymerase. DNA ladder (100-bp molecular ruler, Bio-Rad) was run as a marker.AEA Transporter AssaysThe time- and temperature-dependent uptake of [14C]AEA by intact hVR1-HEK cells was studied as described previously for RBL-2H3 cells (31Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The effect of compounds on the uptake of AEA was studied by using 3.6 μm (10,000 cpm) [14C]AEA. Cells were incubated with [14C]AEA for 5 min at 37 °C, with or without varying concentrations of the inhibitors. Residual [14C]AEA in the incubation medium after extraction with CHCl3/CH3OH 2:1 (v/v), determined by scintillation counting of the lyophilized organic phase, was used as a measure of the AEA that was taken up by cells. Data are expressed as the concentration exerting 50% inhibition of AEA uptake (IC50).Receptor Binding AssaysDisplacement assays for CB1 receptors were carried out by using [3H]SR141716A (0.4 nm, 55 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the high affinity ligand and the filtration technique previously described (33Di Marzo V. Breivogel C. Bisogno T. Melck D. Patrick G. Tao Q. Szallasi A. Razdan R.K. Martin B.R. Eur. J.

Specific binding was calculated with 1 μm SR141716A (a gift from Sanofi Recherche, France) and was 84.0%. The Ki value for capsazepine was calculated by applying the Cheng-Prusoff equation to the IC50 value (obtained by GraphPad) for the displacement of the bound [3H]SR141716A by increasing concentrations of the test compounds.RESULTSEffect of AMT Modulators on AEA Action at VR1 ReceptorsIn agreement with previous studies (11Zygmunt P.M.

Pertwee R.G Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), we found that AEA, capsaicin, and AM404 are full agonists at human VR1 receptors overexpressed in HEK cells in as much as they elicited a typical VR1 response, i.e. the increase of CCC. The EC50 for AEA, capsaicin, and AM404 were 0.52 ± 0.12, 0.019 ± 0.009, and 0.035 ± 0.011 μm, respectively. These effects were blocked by EGTA (4 mm, not shown) and by increasing concentrations of the VR1 antagonist capsazepine (see below) and were not observed in nontransfected HEK cells (data not shown).Two selective and recently developed inhibitors of the AMT, VDM11, and VDM13 (Ref. 27De Petrocellis L. Bisogno T. Davis J.B. Pertwee R.G Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, Fig. 1) strongly inhibited the AEA effect on CCC in hVR1-HEK cells (Fig.2, Table I). The IC50for VDM11 with a 5-min preincubation was 3.9 ± 1.1 μm, a value similar to that for VDM11 inhibition of the AMT in rat C6 glioma and basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells (IC50 ∼10 μm, Ref. 27De Petrocellis L. Bisogno T. Davis J.B. Pertwee R.G Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). VDM11 (4 μm) did not affect the efficacy and potency of capsaicin or resiniferatoxin on CCC (Table I). This compound, at a 10-μm concentration, did inhibit the capsaicin effect if preincubated 5 min prior to the VR1 agonist, but it was inactive when preincubated 30 min before capsaicin (data not shown). It is noteworthy that VDM11 and VDM13 alone (10 μm) (i) exhibited a negligible stimulatory effect on CCC (14.1 ± 5.9 and <5% of the effect of ionomycin, respectively); (ii) had little effect on [3H]SR141716A specific binding from rat brain membranes (11.6 ± 1.8 and 29.1 ± 2.3% displacement, respectively;Ki>20 μm in both cases); and (iii) did not significantly inhibit [14C]AEA hydrolysis by hVR1-HEK cells (<5% and 15.3 ± 4.5% inhibition, respectively) (see also Ref. 27De Petrocellis L.

Hyaluronidase (HAase), an endoglycosidase, degrades HA into small angiogenic fragments. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assay, we found increased HA levels (3–8-fold) in prostate cancer (CaP) tissues when compared with normal (NAP) and benign (BPH) tissues. The majority (∼75–80%) of HA in prostate tissues was found to exist in the free form. Primary CaP fibroblast and epithelial cells secreted 3–8-fold more HA than respective NAP and BPH cultures. Only CaP epithelial cells and established CaP lines secreted HAase and the secretion increased with tumor grade and metastasis. The pH activity profile and optimum (4.2; range 4.0–4.3) of CaP HAase was identical to the HYAL1-type HAase present in human serum and urine. Full-length HYAL1 transcript and splice variants were detected in CaP cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, cloning, and sequencing. Immunoblotting confirmed secretion of a ∼60-kDa HYAL1-related protein by CaP cells. Immunohistochemistry showed minimal HA and HYAL1 staining in NAP and BPH tissues. However, a stromal and epithelial pattern of HA and HYAL1 expression was observed in CaP tissues. While high HA staining was observed in tumor-associated stroma, HYAL1 staining in tumor cells increased with tumor grade and metastasis. The gel-filtration column profiles of HA species in NAP, BPH, and CaP tissues were different. While the higher molecular mass and intermediate size HA was found in all tissues, the HA fragments were found only in CaP tissues. In particular, the high-grade CaP tissues, which showed both elevated HA and HYAL1 levels, contained angiogenic HA fragments. The stromal-epithelial HA and HYAL1 expression may promote angiogenesis in CaP and may serve as prognostic markers for CaP.

The majority of newly diagnosed prostate cancer (CaP)1 patients have clinically organ-confined disease. The limited knowledge about which CaP is aggressive and likely to progress, as well as when it will recur, severely impedes individualized selection of therapy and subsequent prediction of outcome (1Pettway C.A. Tech. Urol. 1998; 4: 35-42PubMed Google Scholar). Routine biochemical (i.e. prostate-specific antigen levels) and surgical and pathologic parameters (i.e. Gleason sum, margin, and node status and seminal vesicle invasion) offer a glimpse of the biological potential of the tumor (2Veltri R.W.

However, many of the CaP patients (∼50–60%) with clinically localized disease have prostate-specific antigen levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml and a biopsy Gleason score between 6 and 7, which limits the prognostic capability of these markers (1Pettway C.A.

Cancer. 1998; 15: 2233-2238Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that both tumor-associated hyaluronic acid (HA) and tumor-derived hyaluronidase (HAase) possibly play a role in tumor progression. HA is a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan made up of repeating disaccharide units, d-glucuronic acid andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine (8Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). HA is a component of extracellular matrix and is present in various tissues and tissue fluids. It performs several functions in normal physiology. Concentration of HA is elevated in several cancers including bladder, colon, breast, and lung and Wilms' tumor (9Delpech B. Girard N. Bertrand P. Chauzy C. Delpech A. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Wang C. Tammi M. Guo H. Tammi R. Am. J.

We have previously shown that the urinary HA levels are 2.5–6.5-fold elevated in bladder cancer patients and serve as a highly sensitive and specific marker for detecting bladder cancer, regardless of the tumor grade (14Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 57 (; Correction: (1998) Cancer Res.58, 3191): 773-777Google Scholar, 15Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In tumor tissues, HA expands upon hydration and opens up spaces for tumor cell migration. Tumor cells migrate on HA-rich matrix that is mediated by cell surface HA receptors (e.g. CD44 and RHAMM; see Refs.16Ichikawa T. Itano N. Sawai T. Kimata K. Koganehira Y. Saida T. Taniguchi S. J.

HA may also offer tumor cells some protection against immune surveillance and chemotherapeutic agents (20Hoborth K. Meir U. Marberger M. Eur. Urol. 1992; 21: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Small fragments of HA (3–25 disaccharide units) are angiogenic (21West D.C. Kumar S. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 183: 179-196Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We have previously isolated such angiogenic HA fragments from the urine of high-grade bladder cancer patients and shown that these fragments induce endothelial cell proliferation (14Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 57 (; Correction: (1998) Cancer Res.58, 3191): 773-777Google Scholar). Furthermore, HA fragments of the same length also induce endothelial cell migration and lumen formation (22Banarjee S. Tool B.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrate that angiogenic HA fragments interact with RHAMM on the surface of human endothelial cells and induce the MAP kinase pathway (23Lokeshwar V.B. Selzer M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27641-27649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24Zhang S. Chang M.C.Y. Zylka D. Turley S. Harrison R. Turley E.A. J. Biol.

Thus a regulated degradation of HA in tumor tissues may be important for both tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. HAases are a family of enzymes which degrade HA (25Roden L. Campbell P. Fraser R.E. Laurent T.C. Petroff H. Thompson J.N. Ciba Found. Symp. 1989; 143: 60-86PubMed Google Scholar). Initially termed as a “spreading factor,” the presence of HAase is crucial to the spread of bacterial infections and toxins present in bee, snake, and other venoms (26Tu A.T. Hendon R.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 1983; 76: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Pukrittayakamee S. Warrell D.A. Desakorn V. McMichael A.J. White N.J. Bunnag D.

These genes cluster in two tightly linked triplets on human chromosomes 3p21.3 (HYAL1, HYAL2, and HYAL3) and 7q31.3 (HYAL4, PH20, and HYALP1) (32Csóka A.B. Scherer S.W. Stern R. Genomics. 1999; 60: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Among these, HYAL1, HYAL2, and PH20 are relatively well studied at the protein level. HYAL1 gene encodes a HAase that is present in human serum, however, its cellular origin is unknown (31Csóka T.B. Frost G.I. Heng H.H.Q. Scherer S.W. Mohapatra G. Stern R. Genomics. 1998; 48: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HYAL2 gene encodes a lysosomal HAase (30Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Keril G. J. Biol.

Sagan S. Ketter S. Kreil G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In establishing the association of HAase to tumor biology, we initially showed that HAase levels are elevated in CaP and these levels correlate with CaP progression (i.e. metastatic > high-grade ≫ low-grade > benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)/normal) (33Lokeshwar V.B. Lokeshwar B.L. Pham H.T. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 651-657PubMed Google Scholar). In cell culture studies, we observed that, primary explant cultures of CaP cells secrete elevated levels of HAase. The elevated levels of HAase have now been demonstrated in metastatic breast tumors and in several carcinoma lines (34Liu D. Pearlman E. Diacnou E. Guo K. Mori H. Haqqi T. Markowitz S. Wilson J.

However, the identity of the type of HAase expressed in most cancer tissues and cells is still unknown. In bladder cancer we observed that, elevated urinary HAase levels indicate the presence of G2 and G3 bladder cancer (41Pham H.T. Block N.L. Lokeshwar V.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 778-783PubMed Google Scholar, 42Lokeshwar V.B. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. Cancer Lett. 1998; 131: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, we purified the first tumor-derived HAase from the urine of bladder cancer patients and showed its similarity to HYAL1 (43Lokeshwar V.B. Young M.J. Goudarzi G. Iida N. Yudin A.I. Cherr G.N. Selzer M.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4464-4470PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed the expression of HYAL1 at the transcript and protein levels, in invasive bladder cancer cell lines, which secrete high levels of a HAase in their conditioned media. This HAase activity has a pH optimum in the range 4.1–4.3 (43Lokeshwar V.B. Young M.J. Goudarzi G. Iida N. Yudin A.I. Cherr G.N. Selzer M.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4464-4470PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, using biochemical and molecular biology techniques, we have examined the expression of HA and HAase in prostate tissues and cell culture. Furthermore, we have been able to identify and characterize the type of HAase expressed in prostate cancer cells. In addition, we have localized these molecules in prostate tissues by immunohistochemistry. We also attempted to understand the function of the tumor-associated HA-HYAL1 system. Normal prostate (NAP) tissues from adults (21–50 years) were obtained from organ donors. Neoplastic and BPH tissues (∼1 g) were obtained from patients undergoing open prostatectomy. The tissue specimens were split and the mirror segment was fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned; then hematoxylin and eosin staining evaluated the histologic grades of these tumors. In this study, we have included data from only those specimens, which were histologically confirmed as normal, benign, and malignant. Fresh or frozen (∼0.5–1 g) specimens were suspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (5 mmHepes pH 7.2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized for 30 s in a tissue homogenizer. The tissue extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min (14Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L.

The supernatants were designated as “Hepes extracts.” The tissue pellets were re-extracted in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.8), 6 m guanidine HCl, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following clarification by centrifugation, the supernatants were designated as “guanidine extracts.” Both Hepes and guanidine extracts were assayed for HA and protein concentration. Primary cultures from prostate tissues were set up as described previously (33Lokeshwar V.B. Lokeshwar B.L. Pham H.T. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 651-657PubMed Google Scholar). For culturing fibroblasts, collagenase-digested tissue fragments were cultured in RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum medium. The fibroblast growth in cultures was confirmed by anti-vimentin staining. During second passage, when the fibroblast cultures became ∼60% confluent, the cultures were washed extensively in PBS and incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS solution, Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The serum-free conditioned medium (SF-CM) was collected after 2–3 days. The prostatic epithelial explant cultures were set up in a prostate epithelial cell growth medium, PrEGM (Prostate Epithelial Growth Medium, BioWhitaker/Clonetics, San Diego, CA) as described before (33Lokeshwar V.B. Lokeshwar B.L. Pham H.T. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 651-657PubMed Google Scholar). PrEGM is a serum-free growth medium. The epithelial cell growth in cultures was confirmed by anti-cytokeratin staining (33Lokeshwar V.B. Lokeshwar B.L. Pham H.T. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 651-657PubMed Google Scholar). The SF-CM from primary cultures was collected at second passage, 3 days after subculturing, and concentrated 10-fold. Prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP, bladder cancer line HT1376, and human embryonic lung fibroblast (HL fibroblast; passage 11) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The prostate cancer line PC3-ML was a gift from Dr. M. E. Stearns, Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, and the bladder cancer cell line 253J-Lung was kindly provided by Dr. Colin Dinney, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX. All of these cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin. At ∼60% confluence, the cultures were washed three times in PBS and incubated in serum-free RPMI + ITS. The SF-CM from these cultures was collected after 2–3 days. Alternatively, CaP fibroblast and HL fibroblast were grown in the culture medium (i.e. RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin) to 80–90% confluence and the conditioned medium was collected. This medium was designated as S-CM, since it contained 10% fetal bovine serum. The S-CM were collected from fibroblast cultures to examine HAase activity, such S-CM have been used previously to demonstrate HAase activity in fibroblast cultures at pH 3.7 (44Stair-Nawy S. Cs∴ka A.B. Stern R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HA levels in tissue extracts and SF-CM were measured using an ELISA-like assay originally developed by Fosang et al. (45Fosang A.J. Hey N.J. Carney S.L. Hardingham T.E. Matrix. 1990; 10: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), with modifications (14Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L.

Urol. 2000; 163: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 25 μg/ml human umbilical cord HA (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). The HA-coated wells were incubated with various amounts of tissue extracts or SF-CM (unconcentrated) from different cell types, in the presence of a biotinylated HA-binding protein. The HA-binding protein was isolated from bovine nasal cartilage according to the method described by Tengblad (46Tengblad A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 578: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which utilizes HA affinity chromatography and trypsinization to isolate the HA binding part of the proteoglycan monomer. The purified HA-binding protein was biotinylated usingN-hydroxysuccinamido biotin (Sigma). The amount of biotinylated HA-binding protein bound to the microtiter wells was determined using an avidin-biotin detection system (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The amount of HA present in each sample (ng/ml) was determined using a standard graph. We routinely normalize the amount of HA in biological fluids (e.g. urine) or in culture CM to total protein. Normalization of HA levels in biological fluids such as urine to total protein eliminates the influence of the hydration status of an individual on HA levels (15Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For each sample, 3 different amounts, each in duplicate, were tested. The results are expressed as mean ± S.E. HAase levels present in tissue extracts and SF-CM/S-CM were measured using an ELISA-like assay similar to that developed by Stern and Stern (47Stern M. Stern R. Matrix. 1992; 12: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), with modifications (15Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J.

Briefly, 96-well microtiter wells were coated with 200 μg/ml human umbilical cord HA. The HA-coated wells were incubated with various amounts of culture CM at 37 °C for 16 h in HAase assay buffer (0.1 m sodium formate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 4.2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA; ELISA-grade; Sigma). The HA remaining on the wells after incubation was determined using the same biotinylated HA-binding protein that is used in the HA-ELISA-like assay, and an avidin-biotin detection system. In the avidin biotin detection system, we do not include anti-keratan sulfate monoclonal antibody to enhance the signal and routinely normalize the amount of HAase activity (milliunits/ml) in any sample (CM, in this case) to total protein (mg/ml). We also routinely normalize the amount of HAase in biological fluids (e.g. urine) to eliminate the influence of the hydration status of an individual on HAase levels. This is especially important when determining urinary HAase levels of patients with hematuria (i.e. blood in urine; Ref. 15Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The pH activity profile of HAase present in various CM was determined as follows: 1) pooled serum from 3 normal adults (0.5 μl); 2) human urine (2.0 μl) collected from 4 normal individuals (3 adults: 2 females and 1 male: age 25–40 years and 1 child: 7 years); 3) CM (4 μl, 10-fold concentrated) from Du145 (SF-CM), CaP fibroblasts (established from a Gleason 7 CaP; SF-CM and S-CM), and HL fibroblast cultures (SF-CM and S-CM). The indicated amounts of various samples were added to HA-coated wells containing HAase assay buffer at different pH values (2.5–7.0). Between pH 3.5 and 5.0, the HAase activity was tested in buffers differing by 0.1 pH unit (i.e. pH 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 … 5.0). The control wells received the buffers of specified pH, identical to those added to the sample wells. In addition, 10-fold concentrated RPMI + ITS (SF-medium control) and RPMI + 10% fetal bovine serum + gentamycin (S-medium control) were also tested at different pH values. These media served as controls for SF-CM and S-CM collected from different cell types. The results are expressed as (control − sample)A 405; the control represents buffer only. A method described by Gutenhoneret al. (48Gutenhoner N.W. Pogrel M.A. Stern R. Matrix. 1992; 12: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was used to detect the presence of HAase activity in various samples (48Gutenhoner N.W. Pogrel M.A. Stern R. Matrix. 1992; 12: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Aliquots (1.2 ml) of SF-CM and S-CM were collected from DU145, CaP fibroblast, and HL fibroblast cultures. These CM and S-medium control were concentrated ∼10-fold (100 μl). A 20-μl aliquot of each concentrated SF-CM, S-CM, S-medium control, human serum (1.5 μl), 20 μl of 10-fold concentrated normal human urine and ELISA-grade BSA (10 μg) were separated on an 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1 mg/ml HA. Four such gels were prepared and simultaneously electrophoresed. Following electrophoresis, the gels were soaked in 3% Triton X-100, to renature the HAase present in various samples. Each gel was then incubated in HAase assay buffer of pH 3.0, 3.7, 4.2, or 4.5 without BSA. Following incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the gels were stained sequentially with 0.5% Alcian blue and 0.15% Coomassie Blue solutions and then destained. Total RNA was extracted from CaP cell lines, a Gleason 7 CaP primary epithelial explant culture and bladder cancer lines, HT1376 and 253J-Lung using a RNA extraction kit (Quiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA (1 μg) was subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using the SuperscriptTM preamplification system and oligo(dT) primers (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The cDNA was amplified using three different HYAL1-specific primer pairs. The primers were designed based on the HYAL1 cDNA sequence deposited in the GenBankTM data base (accession number HSU03056). The sequences of the first primer pair were the following: (a) HYAL1-L1 (the sequence between nucleotides 214 and 233), 5′-CTGGTGGAAGAGACAGGAAG-3′; (b) HYAL1-R1 (the reverse complementary sequence between nucleotides 564 and 583), 5′-GGAGGCAGAGCTGAGAACAG-3′. The second primer pair was designed to amplify the entire coding region of HYAL1. The sequence of the second primer pair was the following: (a) HYAL1-L2 (the sequence between nucleotides 594 and 613), 5′-TTGTCCTCGACCAGTCCCGT-3′; (b) HYAL1-R2 (the reverse complementary sequence between nucleotides 1,906 and 1,925), 5′-ATCACCACATGCTCTTCCGC-3′. The sequence of the third primer pair was designed to amplify both the long and short forms of HYAL1 transcript. The primer sequences were the following: (a) HYAL1-L3, this sequence is between nucleotides 27,274 and 27,294 in a human cosmid clone LUCA13 from 3p21.3 (GenBankTM accession number AC002455). The cDNA clones, GenBankTM accession numbers AF173154(spliced form) and HSU03056, which contain the entire HYAL1coding sequence, lack the nucleotide base “C” present at the 5′ end in the HYAL1-L3 primer, and begin with the following T, as their first nucleotide. Therefore, the sequence between nucleotides 2 and 21 of the HYAL1-L3 primer matches with the sequence between nucleotides 1 and 20 of the cDNA sequences AF173154 and HSU03056. The sequence of the HYAL1-L3 primer is, 5′-CTTCCTCCAGGAGTCTCTGGT-3′. (b) HYAL1-R3, the reverse complementary sequence between nucleotides 247 and 267 in clone AF173154 and between nucleotides 732 and 752 in clone HSU03056. This primer sequence is, 5′-TCTCCAGGCACCACTGGGTGT-3′. The PCR conditions for HYAL1-L1/R1 primer pair were the following: (a) initial melting at 94 °C for 5 min; (b) 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; (c) 72 °C for 10 min. For PCR analysisTaq polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was used. The PCR conditions for HYAL1-L2/R2 and HYAL1-L3/R3 primers were the following: (a) 95 °C for 10 min (hot start); (b) 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s (70–60 °C) for 30 s, i.e. annealing temperature dropping by 1 °C at each cycle, 72 °C for 1 min; (c) 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min; (d) 72 °C for 7 min, final extension. The PCR mixture contained 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and Ampli-TaqGoldTM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wellesley, MA). Prostate epithelial cell culture SF-CM were separated on an 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, under nonreducing conditions, and then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blotted membrane was stained with 0.15% Coomassie Blue in 30% methanol for 1 min and then destained to visualize and compare total protein profile in each lane as described previously (23Lokeshwar V.B. Selzer M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27641-27649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This method rules out the possibility that any differences observed in the intensity of the HYAL1 band among various samples is simply due to differences in sample loading and protein transfer (23Lokeshwar V.B. Selzer M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27641-27649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Following visualization of the total protein profile, the blot was completely destained, rehydrated, and blocked with 3% BSA in 20 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The blot was probed with 5 μg/ml anti-HYAL1 antibody at 4 °C for 16 h. The anti-HYAL1 antibody was purified as the IgG fraction using protein G-Sepharose, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was then washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:7500 dilution; Sigma), at room temperature for 2 h. The blot was then washed and developed using an alkaline phosphatase color detection system, involving nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate substrates (Bio-Rad).

Members of this family are characterized by a tandem repeat structure, which comprises most of the protein backbone and is the scaffold for a large number of complex O-linked carbohydrate side chains. Twelve human epithelial mucin genes have been identified to date, and it is now clear that there are two structurally and functionally distinct classes of mucins: secreted gel-forming mucins and transmembrane mucins.Gel-forming mucins are secreted by goblet cells and are the major constituent of mucus, which protects and lubricates epithelial surfaces, particularly those of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and reproductive tracts. These mucins undergo homo-oligomerization and are clearly the critical contributors to the biophysical properties of mucus (1Herrmann A. Davies J.R. Lindell G. Martensson S. Packer N.H. Swallow D.M. Carlstedt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15828-15836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The gel-forming mucins are encoded by a cluster of four mucin genes (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, andMUC6) on chromosome band 11p15.5 (2Pigny P. Guyonnet Duperat V. Hill A.S. Pratt W.S. Galiegue-Zouitina S. D'Hooge M.C. Laine A. Van Seuningen I. Degand P. Gum J.R. Kim Y.S. Swallow D.M. Aubert J.P. Porchet N. Genomics. 1996; 38: 340-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The MUC7gene encodes a relatively small secreted salivary mucin (3Bobek L.A. Tsai H. Biesbrock A.R. Levine M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20563-20569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MUC9 is a relatively small secreted mucin expressed only in the Fallopian tube (4Arias E.B. Verhage H.G. Jaffe R.C. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The MUC8 cDNA, expressed in respiratory tissue, has not been well characterized (5Shankar V. Gilmore M.S. Elkins R.C. Sachdev G.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).It has recently emerged that there is a large family of epithelial transmembrane mucins, many members of which are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the large intestine. The MUC1 gene encodes a transmembrane mucin expressed by almost all human glandular epithelial tissues and throughout all regions of the gastrointestinal tract (6Patton S. Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 407-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). TheMUC3 and MUC4 genes were initially thought to encode secreted mucins; however, it has recently been shown that these genes encode transmembrane mucins as their dominant isoforms (7Williams S.J. Munster D.J. Quin R.J. Gotley D.C. McGuckin M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Moniaux N. Nollet S. Porchet N. Degand P. Laine A. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). There is a newly identified cluster of transmembrane mucin genes located on chromosome band 7q22 (9Williams S.J. McGuckin M.A. Gotley D.C. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Antalis T.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4083-4089PubMed Google Scholar). Members of this cluster include the closely related MUC3 and MUC12 genes (10Gum J.R. Ho J.J.L. Pratt W.S. Hicks J.W. Hill A.S. Vinall L.E.

Sutherland G.R. Antalis T.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4083-4089PubMed Google Scholar).MUC3 is most highly expressed in the small intestine, whereas MUC12 is most highly expressed in the colon (9Williams S.J. McGuckin M.A. Gotley D.C. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Antalis T.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4083-4089PubMed Google Scholar). Further genes may also lie in this cluster, and the genomic organization of these genes should be clarified shortly by the Human Genome Project. The MUC4 gene located on chromosome band 3q29 appears to be related to genes in the 7q22 cluster, as the mucin it encodes contains a similar domain structure and, although most highly expressed in the tracheobronchus, is also present in the intestine (8Moniaux N. Nollet S. Porchet N. Degand P. Laine A. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 11Audie J.P. Janin A. Porchet N. Copin M.C. Gosselin B. Aubert J.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 1479-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar).Common structural features shared by all the identified transmembrane mucins include C-terminal cytoplasmic domains with motifs suggestive of a role in signal transduction, a SEA module in the extracellular domain (12Bork P. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and a large mucin domain at the N terminus of the extracellular subunit. The two mucins studied biochemically to date, human MUC1 and rat Muc4, undergo cleavage and non-covalent reassociation during biosynthesis, with disruption of this association allowing shedding of the mucin domain from the cell surface (13Hilkens J. Buijs F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the ability to shed a large mucin protein from the cell surface and the ability to transmit signals have both been heavily conserved. In addition, MUC3, MUC4, and MUC12 all contain two cysteine-rich EGF1-like domains, one to either side of the SEA module. The function of EGF-like motifs in these mucins is unclear, although there is evidence implicating these domains in epithelial growth modulation (15Carraway K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A. Huang D. Guy P.M. Carvajal M.E. Fregien N. Carraway C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).In the present investigation, we have used data base mining to identify a novel human transmembrane mucin gene that has been designatedMUC13 by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. The rodent orthologues of MUC13 have been previously identified and were thought to be restricted to expression in hemopoietic precursor cells in bone marrow (16Dougherty G.J. Kay R.J. Humphries R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6509-6514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We describe the cDNA sequence of humanMUC13 and show that the putative protein has the same domain organization as MUC3, MUC4, and MUC12, and similarities to MUC1. We also demonstrate that both the human and mouse genes are expressed predominantly in epithelial tissues, particularly those of the gastrointestinal tract, and demonstrate the human protein on the epithelial apical membrane and within goblet cell thecae of gastrointestinal epithelia. Initial biochemical characterization indicates that MUC13 is cleaved into two subunits and that the subunit containing the cytoplasmic tail undergoes homodimerization.DISCUSSIONThe human MUC13 gene encodes an epithelial and hemopoietic transmembrane mucin. MUC13 is the orthologue of a murine glycoprotein initially called 114/A10 or mouse cell surface antigen and herein referred to as mMuc13. mMuc13 was initially identified by expression cloning using an antibody produced against a murine bone marrow-derived multipotential cell line (24Dougherty G.J. Dougherty S.T. Kay R.J. Landsdorp P. Humphries R.K. Exp. Hematol. 1989; 17: 877-882PubMed Google Scholar). mMuc13 had previously been found to be highly expressed in primary myeloid progenitor cells, the myelomonocytic leukemia cell line WEHI-3, and various interleukin 3-dependent cell lines (22Quin R.J. McGuckin M.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Spleen, liver, muscle, and brain tissues were assessed as not expressing mMuc13; however, epithelial tissues were not examined.The MUC13 gene is most highly expressed in epithelial tissues, particularly those of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. In the large intestine, MUC13 is expressed on the apical cell surface of both goblet and columnar cells deep in the crypts, confirming its role as a transmembrane mucin. Presence on the apical membrane of crypt epithelium mirrors the expression of two other cell surface mucins, MUC1 and MUC4, which also predominate in the crypts and are expressed by both major cell types (25Biemer-Huttmann A. Walsh M.D. McGuckin M.A. Ajioka Y. Watanabe H. Leggett B.A. Jass J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast,MUC3 (26Weiss A.A. Babyatsky M.W. Ogata S. Chen A. Itzkowitz S.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), andMUC12 2S. J. Williams and M. A. McGuckin, unpublished observations. appear to be most highly expressed by cells of the surface epithelium. MUC13 also appears to be secreted, as we have demonstrated its presence within goblet cell thecae and in secreted material in the large intestine and stomach, and within supranuclear vacuoles, but not on the apical membrane surface, of absorptive cells in the small intestine. This is consistent with the previous demonstration, at both light and electron microscope levels, of MUC1 associated with goblet cell secretory granules in the intestine (27Winterford C.M. Walsh M.D. Leggett B.A. Jass J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).It is now apparent that there is considerable multiplicity of expression of these cell surface glycoproteins, especially in the gastrointestinal tract and, in particular, the large intestine. In fact, MUC1 and MUC13 appear to be co-expressed, both intracellularly and on the same cell surfaces, in many places of the gastrointestinal tract. However, there is evidence of differential regulation of cell surface mucins throughout the gastrointestinal tract. For example, although MUC1 and MUC13 appear to be expressed similarly in the colon (27Winterford C.M. Walsh M.D. Leggett B.A. Jass J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in the stomach (28Carrato C. Balague C. Debolos C. Gonzalez E. Gambus G. Planas J. Perini J.M. Andreu D. Real F.X. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 160-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), staining of serial sections with a MUC1-reactive antibody revealed differing patterns of expression of MUC13 and MUC1 in gastric tissue (data not shown). As an additional example, in the surface epithelium MUC3 is expressed most highly in the small intestine and decreases distally with only low expression in the distal large intestine (26Weiss A.A. Babyatsky M.W. Ogata S. Chen A. Itzkowitz S.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MUC12expression increases progressively from small intestine to rectum2; similarly, MUC13 mRNA expression increases from small intestine to rectum.In addition to multiplicity of expression, it is now apparent that there is considerable dynamism of cell-surface mucin expression in the gastrointestinal tract. For example, as cells in the large intestine migrate from deep in the crypts to the surface, they must undergo a major switch in their dominant cell surface mucin proteins from MUC1, MUC4, and MUC13 to MUC3 and MUC12. MUC13 is also very highly expressed in the trachea, where it is also now apparent that there is considerable multiplicity of expression with MUC1 andMUC4 also being expressed. The expression of multiple cell-surface mucins with similar functional roles may explain whyMuc1 null mice show no obvious signs of epithelial pathology (29Spicer A.P. Rowse G.J. Lidner T.K. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30093-30101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), although these mice are also yet to be tested comprehensively with epithelial challenges. Interestingly, when Muc1 null mice were removed from a pathogen-free environment, they developed ocular and reproductive tract bacterial infections, implicating cell surface mucins in protection from epithelial bacterial infections (30Kardon R. Price R.E. Julian J. Lagow E. Tseng S.C.G. Gendler S.J. Carson D.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 1328-1335PubMed Google Scholar,31DeSouza M.M. Surveyor G.A. Price R.E. Julian J. Kardon R. Zhou X. Gendler S. Hilkens J. Carson D.D. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 45: 127-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).In addition to expression in epithelial cells, in situhybridization in murine tissues demonstrated substantial expression ofMUC13 in lymphoid tissue associated with the large intestine. Lymphoid tissue expression could have contributed toMUC13 RNA detection in human RNA samples derived from normal and malignant intestinal tissues. However, at the protein level, there was only limited histochemical reactivity of MUC13 in human gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue, demonstrating clearly that protein expression levels of MUC13 are highest in epithelial cells.Our initial biochemical characterization in two colorectal cancer cell lines demonstrates that MUC13 is predominantly a cell surface molecule, that it undergoes N- and O-glycosylation, and that the mucin domain is cleaved from the transmembrane subunit, as occurs for both MUC1 and MUC4 (13Hilkens J. Buijs F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal subunit containing the cytoplasmic tail is hereto referred to as the β-subunit using the terminology introduced for MUC4 (8Moniaux N. Nollet S. Porchet N. Degand P. Laine A. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The β-subunit appears to undergo homodimerization that is dependent on intrachain disulfide bonds. The predicted mass of the entire MUC13 polypeptide minus the signal peptide is ∼53 kDa. Western blotting shows that the 55–58-kDa β-subunit contains the A, B, and C peptide epitopes. The predicted mass of a minimum C-terminal polypeptide containing these three epitopes is 31 kDa and contains three potential sites for N-glycosylation. The immunoprecipitated and reduced MUC13 β-subunit was ∼55 kDa and was reduced to 49- and 38-kDa bands following PNGase F treatment to removeN-linked sugars. Taken together, this suggests the 55-kDa band represents the N-glycosylated β-subunit of MUC13 containing the cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain, the C-terminal EGF-like domains, and at least part of the SEA module (see Fig. 2 for a diagrammatic representation).The apparent cleavage of MUC13 needs to be confirmed by biosynthetic studies. The 120-kDa immunoprecipitated band reactive with HPA and PNA is most likely to represent the N-terminal mucin domain containing α-subunit of MUC13. This band was only just visible in immunoprecipitates of biotinylated cell surface proteins, perhaps due to a tendency for the α-subunit to disassociate from the β-subunit in detergents, as has been shown for MUC1 (22Quin R.J. McGuckin M.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The α-subunit may also show poor binding to nitrocellulose due to extensiveO-glycosylation. Furthermore, the α-subunit would not be highly biotinylated inasmuch as, compared with 14 lysine residues in the extracellular domain C-terminal of the A peptide, there are only five lysine residues N-terminal to the A peptide, and these lie between EGF1 and the A peptide. The observation that the α-subunit is weakly biotinylated suggests the cleavage occurs between the lysine in EGF1 (amino acid 190) and the A peptide. The predicted mass of an N-terminal MUC13 α-subunit terminating at the A epitope is 22 kDa, the majority of which comprises the mucin domain. If the 120-kDa band is this N-terminal α-subunit, then it must be over 80% carbohydrate by weight, which is not unexpected for a mucin glycoprotein. Other post-translational modifications could contribute to the mass of this subunit; for example, a YYY motif near EGF1 (amino acids 203–205) may represent a site of tyrosine sulfation.The 520-kDa immunoprecipitated band observed under non-reducing conditions may represent oligomers of intact MUC13 molecules. These complexes also appear to contain another cell surface protein as when reduced a 70–72-kDa biotinylated band was observed. The 70-kDa protein was PNGase F-resistant (not N-glycosylated) and did not react with the HPA or PNA lectins (not O-glycosylated) or with the A, B, or C MUC13 antisera (not the MUC13 β-subunit). The 70-kDa protein may be an important constituent of the 520-kDa protein complex, and requires further investigation. Additional antibodies reactive with α-subunit epitopes need to be generated to confirm these conclusions. However, it is clear that the MUC13 β-subunit undergoes homo-oligomerization into dimers and that oligomerization is dependent on intrastrand disulfide bonds.The role of cell surface mucins in epithelial tissues is not clearly understood. The complexity and level of expression is greatest in epithelial surfaces exposed to antigenically and chemically complex luminal environments. Based on knowledge of their structure and expression patterns, it is likely that these molecules play an important role in barrier function. In addition to presenting large extended heavily glycosylated mucin domains on the cell surface, highly conserved structural features suggest that an ability to shed the extracellular mucin domain and to report via cytoplasmic domain signaling are important facets of these cell-surface molecules. The signaling pathways triggered by cell surface mucins such as MUC13 remain to be elucidated, although it appears that MUC1 can activate theras pathway via Grb2 (32Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4000-4003PubMed Google Scholar) and interact with β-catenin, an important modulator of cell adhesion and growth (33Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12492-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 34Li Y.Q. Bharti A. Chen D.S. Gong J.L. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Interactions between secreted mucins and bacteria have been well characterized (35Slomiany B.L. Murty V.L.N. Piotrowski J. Slomiany A. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and it is possible that interaction with bacteria is an important part of cell surface mucin function. In fact, a recent study utilizing CHO cells stably expressing Muc1 mucin (36Lillehoj E.P. Hyun S.W. Kim B.T. Zhang X.G. Lee D.I. Rowland S. Kim K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L181-L187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has demonstrated phosphorylation of the Muc1cytoplasmic domain following adhesion ofPseudomonas aeruginosa to the extracellular domain of this mucin. 3K. C. Kim, personal communication.It has been proposed that cell surface EGF-like domain containing mucins can modulate epithelial cell growth via modulation of the c-erbB family of growth factor receptors. Rat Muc4 has been shown to interact with the c-erbB-2 receptor and promote receptor kinase activity, and cell proliferation, both in the presence and absence of the c-erbB-2 ligand, neuregulin-1 (15Carraway K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A. Huang D. Guy P.M. Carvajal M.E. Fregien N. Carraway C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). MUC4, like MUC13, is expressed deep in the crypts of the colon where cell proliferation occurs.MUC13 mRNA was expressed by most colorectal cancers examined, although generally at equivalent or lower levels of expression than adjacent normal tissue. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated heterogeneous expression of MUC13 within individual cancers. MUC13 may influence tumor growth and metastasis, as has been shown for both MUC1 (6Patton S. Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 407-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and MUC4 (37Komatsu M. Tatum L. Altman N.H. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Expression of MUC13 on the surface of colorectal cancer cells may influence growth characteristics via interactions with c-erbB growth factor receptors, modulate adhesion and interfere with immune recognition. It has been suggested that mMuc13 expressed on platelets is involved in interaction of platelets with endothelial cells (38Duan Y. Naruse T. Nakamura M. Yamaguchi Y. Kawashima T. Morikawa Y. Kitamura T. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and, by the same mechanism, MUC13 on cancer cells may interact with endothelial ligands during metastasis. MUC1 is shed/secreted into the blood by cancers, particularly those of the breast, lung, and ovary, and is the antigen measured in several different clinically utilized serum diagnostic tests such as Truquant BR, CA15.3, MCA, CA549, and CASA (39McGuckin M.A. Devine P.L. Tumor Diag. Ther. 1995; 16: 1-6Google Scholar). MUC13, like MUC1, may be released from the surface of cancer cells and may therefore be a useful serum diagnostic target in patients with gastrointestinal cancers.MUC13 may also play an important modulatory role in epithelial responses to damage and infection, and in non-malignant epithelial diseases where barrier function and/or mucin secretion are important, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, cystic fibrosis (CF), and chronic respiratory diseases. Interestingly, the MUC1 mucin has been demonstrated in animal models to have a critical influence on gastrointestinal mucus obstruction in CF (40Parmley R.R. Gendler S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1798-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previously, it had been thought that the gel-forming mucins were the major contributors to mucus accumulation in CF. MUC13 has a similar gastrointestinal expression pattern as MUC1 and is also highly expressed in tracheal tissue and therefore also warrants investigation as a potential modulator of mucus accumulation in CF.It is now apparent that some epithelial transmembrane mucins, like MUC13, are expressed in hemopoietic cells. MUC1 (CD227) is expressed by activated T cells (41Agrawal B. Krantz M.J. Parker J. Longenecker B.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4079-4081PubMed Google Scholar), activated dendritic cells (42McGuckin M.A. MacDonald K.P.A. Tran M. Wykes M. Hart D.N.J. Mason D. Leukocyte Typing VII. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2001Google Scholar), and bone marrow mononuclear precursor cells (43Brugger W. Buhring H.J. Grunebach F. Vogel W. Kaul S. Muller R. Brummendorf T.H. Ziegler B.L. Rappold I. Brossart P. Scheding S. Kanz L. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Muc1 null mice have major disturbances to T cell development and function. 4S. J. Gendler, personal communication. Previous studies demonstrated rodent Muc13 expression in bone marrow precursor cells, and we have shown expression in spleen, consistent with expression in hemopoietic precursor cells. It has been shown that spleen and bone marrow-derived mMuc13-positive cells selectively proliferate in vitro in response to pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cell-conditioned medium or recombinant IL-3 (24Dougherty G.J. Dougherty S.T. Kay R.J. Landsdorp P. Humphries R.K. Exp. Hematol. 1989; 17: 877-882PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse Muc13 was also identified as being associated with megakaryocyte maturation and platelet formation (37Komatsu M. Tatum L. Altman N.H. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of mMuc13 in a murine megakaryoblastic cell line, L8057, when differentiating into a megakaryocytic lineage, suggested mMuc13 could be involved with cell differentiation and maturation. Overexpression of mMuc13 was found to inhibit cell adhesion to fibronectin, suggesting it could act as a negative regulator of cell adhesion in the megakaryocytic lineage. We also observed strong expression of mMuc13 in intestine-associated lymphoid tissue, and weaker expression in lymphoid cells in both the red pulp and follicles of the spleen.MUC13 is clearly expressed by mature lymphoid cells, and this requires further characterization.In summary, we have determined the complete cDNA sequence of a novel human mucin gene, MUC13, and shown that this gene encodes a cell surface and secreted mucin that is most highly expressed in epithelial tissues but is also found in some hemopoietic cells. Our future research will concentrate on the role of the MUC13 mucin protein in non-malignant and malignant epithelial diseases, particularly those of the gastrointestinal tract. The epithelial mucins are a family of secreted and cell-surface glycoproteins expressed by ductal and glandular epithelial tissues. Members of this family are characterized by a tandem repeat structure, which comprises most of the protein backbone and is the scaffold for a large number of complex O-linked carbohydrate side chains. Twelve human epithelial mucin genes have been identified to date, and it is now clear that there are two structurally and functionally distinct classes of mucins: secreted gel-forming mucins and transmembrane mucins. Gel-forming mucins are secreted by goblet cells and are the major constituent of mucus, which protects and lubricates epithelial surfaces, particularly those of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and reproductive tracts. These mucins undergo homo-oligomerization and are clearly the critical contributors to the biophysical properties of mucus (1Herrmann A. Davies J.R. Lindell G. Martensson S. Packer N.H. Swallow D.M. Carlstedt I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15828-15836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The gel-forming mucins are encoded by a cluster of four mucin genes (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, andMUC6) on chromosome band 11p15.5 (2Pigny P. Guyonnet Duperat V. Hill A.S. Pratt W.S. Galiegue-Zouitina S.

https://openalex.org/W2095727654,"To identify the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) 1-42-degrading enzyme whose activity is inhibited by thiorphan and phosphoramidon in vivo, we searched for neprilysin (NEP) homologues and cloned neprilysin-like peptidase (NEPLP) alpha, NEPLP beta, and NEPLP gamma cDNAs. We expressed NEP, phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X chromosome (PEX), NEPLPs, and damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase (DINE) in 293 cells as 95- to 125-kDa proteins and found that the enzymatic activities of PEX, NEPLP alpha, and NEPLP beta, as well as those of NEP and DINE, were sensitive to thiorphan and phosphoramidon. Among the peptidases tested, NEP degraded both synthetic and cell-secreted Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 most rapidly and efficiently. PEX degraded cold Abeta1-40 and NEPLP alpha degraded both cold Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, although the rates and the extents of the digestion were slower and less efficient than those exhibited by NEP. These data suggest that, among the endopeptidases whose activities are sensitive to thiorphan and phosphoramidon, NEP is the most potent Abeta-degrading enzyme in vivo. Therefore, manipulating the activity of NEP would be a useful approach in regulating Abeta levels in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1736447480,"In the classical signaling pathway, the estrogen receptor (ER) binds directly to estrogen response elements (EREs) to regulate gene transcription. To test the hypothesis that the nonclassical pathway involves ER interactions with other proteins rather than direct binding to DNA, mutations were introduced into the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the mouse ERα. The effects of these DBD mutations were examined in DNA binding assays using reporter constructs containing either EREs (classical) or AP1 (nonclassical) response elements. Using the AP1 reporter, there was a reversal of ER action relative to that seen with the ERE reporter. Estradiol induced suppression, and the antiestrogen ICI 182,780 stimulated transcription of the AP1 reporter. DBD mutations in the proximal (P-box) of the first zinc finger of the ER (E207A/G208A and E207G/G208S) eliminated ERE binding. These mutants were inactive using the ERE reporter but retained partial or full activity with the AP1 reporter. The DBD mutant ERs interacted with Jun when tested in mammalian cell two-hybrid assays. Two mutations (K366D and I362R) in the ER ligand binding domain known to alter coactivator interactions impaired transcriptional responses using either the ERE or AP1 reporters. We concluded that ER action through the AP1 response element involves interactions with other promoter-bound proteins instead of, or in addition to, direct binding to DNA. Interactions with coactivators were required for both pathways. These data supported a model in which ER-mediated transcriptional activation or repression is dependent on the ligand and the nature of the response element in the target gene."

Because of the hydrophobic nature of the seven trans-plasma membrane helices of GPCR family members, care must be taken, however, to exclude nonspecific interactions between GPCR pairs resulting from detergent dissolution of cellular membranes. More recent studies have employed various forms of either fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (13Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Sasi R. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. J. Biol.

Herein we use each of co-immunoprecipitation, BRET, and time-resolved FRET to examine constitutive homo-oligomerization of the human δ-opioid receptor and its possible regulation by agonist and inverse agonist ligands. We demonstrate that such constitutive oligomerization can be observed for this GPCR using each of the three approaches but that ligands do not regulate these interactions appreciably. We also demonstrate that it is possible to detect a hetero-oligomeric interaction between the human δ-opioid receptor and the human β2-adrenoreceptor in co-immunoprecipitation studies. However, the energy transfer approaches indicated such interactions to be less prevalent than homo-oligomerization between either of the two receptor types. As the time-resolved FRET assays were designed to detect only cell surface oligomers, these studies also demonstrate for the first time the presence of δ-opioid receptor homo-oligomers at the plasma membrane. All materials for tissue culture were supplied by Life Technologies Inc (Paisley, United Kingdom). [3H]DADLE (55.3 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol (64 Ci/mmol), [3H]diprenorphine (66 Ci/mmol), [3H]adenine, and [3H]cAMP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Coelenterazine was from Prolume (Pittsburgh, PA). Eu3+ and APC-labeled antibodies for time-resolved fluorescence were from Wallac or Packard. Antisera for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Wembley, UK) or Sigma. All other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisons plc (Loughborough, UK) and were of the highest purity available. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Cruachem Limited (Glasgow, UK). The human δ-opioid receptor in pcDNA4 was used as the starting point for the construction of the opioid receptor plasmids used in this study. Primers were made to introduce an ApaI site, followed by the FLAG™ epitope tag at the 5′ end (5′-AAAAAAGGGCCCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGATAAGGAACCGGCCCCCTCCGCC-3′) and to remove the stop codon and add an XbaI site at the 3′ end (5′-TGCTCTAGAGGCGGCAGCGCC-3′) of the receptor. The resulting fragment was cloned into pcDNA3.1(−) (Stratagene). PCR of bothRenilla reniformis luciferase and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) was performed to construct the fusion plasmids using primers, which introduced an XbaI and anXhoI site at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The primers were as follows: Renilla luciferase (forward, 5′-GCGTCTAGAACTTCGAAAGTTTATG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCGCTCGAGTTATTGTTCATTTT-3′), eYFP (forward, 5′-TGATCTAGAATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGA-3′; reverse, 5′-AGACTCGAGTTACTTGTACAGCTCGTC-3′). The resulting products were cloned into the plasmid containing the FLAG epitope-tagged δ-opioid receptor to give the plasmids pδORluc and pδORYFP. All plasmids were sequenced to ensure fidelity of the PCR amplification and the maintenance of the correct open reading frame. Equivalent constructs containing an N-terminal c-Myc epitope tag sequence were generated in a similar fashion. FLAG™- and fluorescent protein-tagged forms of the human β2-adrenoreceptor were produced as described previously (16McLean A.J. Bevan N. Rees S. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol... 1999; 56: 1182-1191Google Scholar, 17McLean A.J. Milligan G. Br. J. Pharmacol... 2000; 130: 1825-1832Google Scholar). A positive control vector for BRET was constructed by linking together Renilla luciferase and eYFP as previously described by Xu et al. (18Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 151-156Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Transient transfections were performed on cells that were at 70–80% confluence with LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared. The cells were washed three times with 6 ml of PBS, followed by resuspension in 800 μl of RIPA buffer (RIPA: 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NaPO4, 5% ethylene glycol). The cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel before removal of the cell debris by a 10-min spin on a benchtop centrifuge at 13,000 rpm. 500 μg of cell lysate protein was mixed with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h before removal of the protein G-Sepharose and its replacement by protein G-Sepharose with the appropriate antibody for the immunoprecipitation (1.6 μg of anti-c-Myc antibody (A14, Santa Cruz), 6.8 μg of anti-FLAG™ (M5 monoclonal, Sigma), or 1.6 μg of anti-β2-adrenoreceptor (polyclonal, Santa Cruz). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The protein G-Sepharose was then washed with RIPA buffer before resuspending the pellet in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7% Tris acetate gels (Novex, Frankfurt, Germany) before being transferred onto nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. For Western blotting M5 anti-FLAG™ antibody was diluted 1:2000, the A14 anti-c-Myc antibody was diluted 1:1000, and the anti-β2-adrenoreceptor antibody diluted 1:2000. Immunoreactivity was detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse (1:5000 dilution) for anti-FLAG™ or anti-rabbit (1:10,000 dilution) for anti-β2-adrenoreceptor or anti-c-Myc (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by ECL detection (Pierce). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Media were removed from cell culture dishes, and cells were washed twice with PBS before cells were detached using TEM buffer (75 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 12 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4). All samples were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis to confirm the presence of eYFP in cells transfected with acceptor-tagged receptors. Approximately 4 × 106 cells in 1.5 ml of TEM buffer were then added to a glass cuvette; an equal volume of TEM containing 10 μm coelenterazine was then added and the contents of the cuvette mixed. The emission spectrum (400–600 nm) was immediately acquired using a Spex fluorolog spectrofluorimeter with the excitation lamp turned off. For comparisons between experiments, emission spectra were normalized with the peak emission fromRenilla luciferase in the region of 480 nm being defined as an intensity of 1.00. In some cases a BRET signal was calculated by measuring the area under the curve between 500 and 550 nm. Background was taken as the area of this region of the spectrum when examining emission from the isolated Renilla luciferase. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. A 2-h incubation was performed at room temperature with 500,000 cells in a total volume of 100 μl containing 15 nm Eu3+ -labeled anti-c-Myc antibody (Wallac) and 45 nm APC-labeled M5 anti-FLAG™ antibody (in house) and 50% newborn calf serum/PBS. After incubation the cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 30 μl of PBS before placing into wells of a 384-well microtiter plate for FRET analysis using a Victor2 (Wallac) configured for time-resolved fluorescence. The Eu3+-labeled anti-c-Myc antibody was excited at 320 nm and emissions monitored at 615 nm (Eu3+ emission) and 665 nm (energy transfer). A 200-μs reading was taken after a 50-μs delay to allow for decay of short-lived endogenous fluorescence signals. As the BRET experiments cannot distinguish between receptors present at the cell surface and in intracellular membranes, membrane preparations were used to obtain total cell expression levels. For binding to the δ-opioid receptor, a single concentration (4 nm) of [3H] diprenorphine in the absence and presence of 300 μm naloxone was used to define total and nonspecific binding. Assays were performed at 25 °C for 1 h in a buffer comprising 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. For binding to the β2-adrenoreceptor, a single concentration (2 nm) of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in the absence and presence of 10 μm propranolol was used to define total and nonspecific binding. Assays were performed at 30 °C for 1 h in a TEM buffer comprising 75 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. All binding experiments were terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters followed by three washes with ice-cold TEM. For each assay equivalent unlabeled cells were counted and membranes prepared to calculate receptor levels per cell (see Table I).Table IExpression levels of Renilla luciferase and eYFP-tagged forms of the human δ-opioid receptor and β2-adrenoceptor in BRET studiesStudy[3H]DHA binding[3H]Diprenorphinereceptors/cellreceptors/cellδ-Opioid receptor homo-oligomerND200,000 ± 10,000β2-δ receptor hetero-oligomer76,000 ± 14,000243,000 ± 23,000Following transient expression of HEK293 cells with combinations ofRenilla luciferase and eYFP-tagged forms of the δ-opioid receptor and β2-adrenoceptor, levels of expression of receptor binding sites were estimated from the specific binding of single concentrations of the antagonists [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) (β2-adrenoceptor) and [3H]diprenorphine (δ-opioid receptor), which are sufficient to occupy more than 90% of the receptors.

As the time-resolved FRET experiments monitor only receptors delivered to the cell surface, intact cells were used for these studies in conditions akin to those used for the FRET experiments (see above). [3H]DADLE (5 nm), in the absence or presence of naloxone (300 μm), was used to define total and nonspecific binding. Were performed essentially as described in Refs. 19Wong Y.G.

Cells were split into wells of a 24-well plate, and the cells were allowed to reattach. Cells were then incubated in medium containing [3H]adenine (0.5 μCi/well) for 16–24 h. The generation of [3H]cAMP in response to treatment of the cells with various ligands and other reagents was then assessed. The human δ-opioid receptor was modified at the N terminus to include either a c-Myc or a FLAG™ epitope tag. Following transient expression of either form of the receptor in HEK293 cells, these could be immunoprecipitated with appropriate anti-c-Myc or anti-FLAG™ antibodies (Fig.1 a). No immunoprecipitation was observed, however, when the antibody/epitope-tagged GPCR combinations were reversed, confirming the specificity of immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1 a and data not shown). Immunoblotting of SDS-PAGE resolved membrane fractions expressing the c-Myc-tagged δ-opioid receptor with the antic-Myc antibody resulted in detection of a 60-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1 b). Such a polypeptide was not detected by the anti-c-Myc antibody in membranes expressing the FLAG™-tagged form of the receptor (Fig.1 b). Co-expression of the c-Myc and the FLAG™ epitope-tagged forms of the δ-opioid receptor followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG™ antiserum and immunoblotting with the anti-c-Myc antibody also resulted in detection of the 60-kDa c-Myc-tagged δ-opioid receptor (Fig. 1 b). Equivalent results were obtained when the protocol was reversed and immunoprecipitation of cells co-expressing the two epitope-tagged forms of the δ-opioid receptor was performed with the anti-c-Myc antibody followed by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG™ antibody (data not shown). However, expression of either the c-Myc or FLAG™-tagged δ-opioid receptor alone failed to result in detection of the 60-kDa polypeptide using either of these two protocols (Fig. 1 b and data not shown). Separate expression of the c-Myc- and the FLAG™ epitope-tagged forms of the δ-opioid receptor followed by physical mixing of cell lysates prior to immunoprecipitation with either antibody also failed to result in co-immunoprecipitation of the two forms of the receptor (data not shown). Such results confirm previous data on the ability to detect homo-oligomers of co-expressed but differentially tagged forms of the δ-opioid receptor (8Cvejic S. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 26959-26964Google Scholar). When the c-Myc-tagged δ-opioid receptor was co-expressed along with the human β2-adrenoreceptor, co-immunoprecipitation experiments akin to those described above, but now using combinations of the anti-c-Myc antibody and an anti-β2-adrenoreceptor antibody, were able to provide evidence for the presence of hetero-interactions between these two GPCRs (Fig.2). Immunoprecipitation of the β2-adrenoreceptor resulted in the presence of the c-Myc-tagged δ-opioid receptor in the precipitated sample, which could be detected by immunoblotting following resolution of the sample by SDS-PAGE. A second polypeptide with mobility consistent with a dimer containing the c-Myc-tagged δ-opioid receptor was also detected (Fig.2). Neither of these bands was detected when the human β2-adrenoreceptor was expressed in the absence of the c-Myc-tagged δ-opioid receptor and then immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2). Equivalent results were obtained when the c-Myc-tagged δ-opioid receptor was co-expressed with a form of the β2-adrenoreceptor that had been C-terminally tagged with eYFP or with a form of the β2-adrenoreceptor tagged at the N terminus with the FLAG™ epitope and at the C terminus with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 2). Immunoprecipitation of either of these modified forms of the β2-adrenoreceptor resulted in co-precipitation of the c-Myc-tagged δ-opioid receptor and detection of both monomeric and potential dimeric species. These rather unexpected observations led us to consider whether such co-immunoprecipitation approaches following transient transfection of cells might produce artifactual results following solubilization of GPCRs from the membrane environment. Recently, β2-adrenoreceptor homo-oligomerization has been observed in intact cells by monitoring the interactions between forms of this GPCR C-terminally epitope-tagged with either Renillaluciferase or eYFP (4Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar). We thus constructed C-terminally taggedRenilla luciferase and eYFP forms of the δ-opioid receptor and the β2-adrenoreceptor as well as a Renillaluciferase and eYFP fusion protein akin to that described by Xuet al. (18Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 151-156Google Scholar) to act as a positive control for BRET. Transient expression of either isolated Renilla luciferase (data not shown) or β2-adrenoreceptor-Renilla luciferase in HEK293 cells, followed by the addition of the cell permeant luciferase substrate coelenterazine, resulted in emission of light with a single peak centred at 480 nm (Fig.3 a). Expression of theRenilla luciferase-eYFP fusion construct and addition of coelenterazine resulted in both a peak at 480 nm and the appearance of a second peak centred at 527 nm (Fig. 3 a). This second peak represents energy transfer from Renilla luciferase to eYFP and its subsequent emission with lower energy. Co-expression of β2-adrenoreceptor-Renilla luciferase and β2-adrenoreceptor-eYFP followed by addition of coelenterazine again produced the dual peak consistent with energy transfer between the BRET partners, which is reliant on their close physical proximity (Fig. 3 a). However, co-expression of the isolated Renilla luciferase along with β2-adrenoreceptor-eYFP did not result in energy transfer upon addition of coelenterazine (data not shown), indicating that there were not direct interactions between these two constructs. Furthermore, separate expression of β2-adrenoreceptor-Renilla luciferase and β2-adrenoreceptor-eYFP followed by mixing of the cells prior to addition of coelenterazine also failed to produce an energy transfer signal (Fig. 3 b), demonstrating a requirement for physical proximity for energy transfer. Equivalent studies with the co-expression of δ-opioid receptor-Renilla luciferase and δ-opioid receptor-eYFP again produced a pattern of light emission following addition of coelenterazine consistent with energy transfer and thus the proximity of the BRET partners and their associated GPCRs (Fig. 4 a). As before, no energy transfer signals were observed when the Renillaluciferase and eYFP-tagged forms of this GPCR were transiently expressed in different populations of HEK293 cells, which were then mixed prior to addition of coelenterazine (data not shown).Figure 4BRET-based detection of constitutive δ-opioid receptor homo-oligomerization but little evidence for a constitutive δ-opioid receptor-β2-adrenoreceptor hetero-oligomer. a, wavelength sweeps of light emission were conducted following addition of coelenterazine to HEK293 cells transiently expressing isolated Renilla luciferase (light blue) or δ-opioid receptor-Renilla luciferase and δ-opioid receptor-eYFP (purple, red, green).

Addition of either DADLE or isoprenaline to cells co-expressing β2-adrenoreceptor-Renilla luciferase and δ-opioid receptor-eYFP resulted in a significant (p< 0.05) increase in BRET signal. Ligands produced no significant effect when added to cells co-expressing δ-opioid receptor-Renilla luciferase and δ-opioid receptor-eYFP.c, wavelength sweeps of light emission were conducted following addition of coelenterazine to HEK293 cells transiently expressing the Renilla luciferase-eYFP fusion protein (purple), the δ-opioid receptor-Renillaluciferase and δ-opioid receptor-eYFP (red), β2-adrenoreceptor-Renilla luciferase and δ-opioid receptor-eYFP (green), or Renillaluciferase alone (black).

https://openalex.org/W2069056765,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a platelet-derived sphingolipid that elicits numerous biological responses in endothelial cells mediated by a family of G protein-coupled EDG receptors. Stimulation of EDG receptors by S1P has been shown to activate the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) in heterologous expression systems (Igarashi, J., and Michel, T. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 32363–32370). However, the signaling pathways that modulate eNOS regulation by S1P/EDG in vascular endothelial cells remain less well understood. We now report that S1P treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) acutely increases eNOS enzyme activity; the EC50 for S1P activation of eNOS is ∼10 nm. The magnitude of eNOS activation by S1P in BAEC is equivalent to that elicited by the agonist bradykinin. S1P treatment activates Akt, a protein kinase implicated in phosphorylation of eNOS. S1P treatment of BAEC leads to eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1179, a residue phosphorylated by Akt; an eNOS mutant in which this Akt phosphorylation site is inactivated shows attenuated S1P-induced eNOS activation. S1P-induced activation both of Akt and of eNOS is inhibited by pertussis toxin, by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, and by the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA (1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid). By contrast to S1P, activation of G protein-coupled bradykinin B2 receptors neither activates kinase Akt nor promotes Ser1179 eNOS phosphorylation despite robustly activating eNOS enzyme activity. Understanding the differential regulation of protein kinase pathways by S1P and bradykinin may lead to the identification of new points for eNOS regulation in vascular endothelial cells.

However, the specific intracellular signaling pathways that couple S1P/EDG receptor stimulation to eNOS activation remain less well understood. eNOS is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme: in vascular endothelial cells, eNOS is activated in response to the transient increases in intracellular calcium initiated by the activation of diverse G protein-coupled receptors, including the bradykinin B2 receptor.eNOS is also activated by phosphorylation by protein kinase Akt (20Fulton D.

Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1749-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Although G protein-coupled receptors may regulate the PI3-K/Akt pathway, the activation of Akt by S1P-induced EDG receptor stimulation has not been described previously.In the present study, we provide evidence that S1P potently and robustly activates eNOS in cultured vascular endothelial cells via EDG receptors in a pathway that involves G protein-dependent activation of kinase Akt. eNOS activation by the S1P/EDG pathway stands in contrast to the activation of eNOS by bradykinin B2 receptors, in which activation of eNOS appears to proceed independently of Akt-mediated phosphorylation.RESULTSWe first studied the responses of BAEC to S1P by analyzing the effects of S1P on activation of protein kinases Akt and ERK1/2 (Fig.1). We exploited two independent experimental approaches to assess Akt or ERK activation in BAEC: we analyzed immunoblots probed with antibodies that specifically detect the phosphorylated (activated) forms of these kinases, and we also performed in vitro kinase activity assays using protein substrates specific for kinases Akt and ERK. Note that the activation of these kinases is accompanied by the phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues in these proteins (25Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 36Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). After the addition of 100 nm S1P to BAEC, we detected increases in Akt phosphorylation as well as Akt enzyme activity within 1 min, reaching a maximum ∼4-fold increase in activity by 2–5 min, with a gradual return to basal levels seen at 120 min following drug addition (Fig.1). Immunoblot analyses probed with an anti-Akt antibody were used to verify that these cell lysates contain equivalent amounts of Akt protein. The MAP kinases ERK1/2 also undergo robust and rapid phosphorylation and kinase activation after the addition of S1P to BAEC; ERK1/2 activity and phosphorylation levels returned to the basal within 20 min following S1P addition (Fig. 1). In these same cell lysates from S1P-treated BAEC, we analyzed immunoblots probed with an antibody raised against a phosphopeptide comprising the eNOS amino acid sequence around Ser1179, the site at which eNOS undergoes phosphorylation by kinase Akt (20Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 21Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3012) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, S1P treatment of BAEC markedly increased eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1179, with a time course similar to that seen for Akt activation.We next analyzed the dose response to S1P for Akt and ERK1/2 activation as well as Ser1179-phospho-eNOS formation in BAEC treated for 5 min with increasing concentrations of S1P. Fig.2 A shows immunoblots of cell lysates probed with antibodies directed against phospho-Akt (top panel), phospho-ERK1/2 (middle panel) or Ser1179-phospho-eNOS (lower panel). S1P-induced activation of both Akt and ERK1/2, as well as Ser1179-phospho-eNOS formation, all showed similar EC50 values of ∼10 nm (Fig. 2 B). Treatment of BAEC with the S1P analog dihydro-S1P (which acts solely via EDG receptors (15Im D.S. Heise C.E. Ancellin N. O'Dowd B.F. Shei G.J. Heavens R.P. Rigby M.R. Hla T. Mandala S. McAllister G.

Together, these data indicate that S1P induces the reversible receptor-mediated activation of Akt and ERK1/2 and also promotes the synthesis of Ser1179-phospho-eNOS, with EC50 values in a physiologic range.Figure 2Dose response for S1P-mediated activation of Akt, ERK1/2, and Ser1179 eNOS phosphorylation. A shows the results of immunoblot analyses using the BAEC cell lysates prepared from cells that had been treated with S1P (5 min) at the indicated concentrations. Cell lysates (20 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies directed against phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, and phospho-eNOS (Ser1179), as indicated. Shown are the representative data of four independent experiments. B shows the results of densitometric analyses from pooled data, plotting the fold increase of the degree of phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and eNOS at the S1P concentration indicated, relative to the signals obtained in the absence of S1P.

As shown in Fig.3, pretreatment with pertussis toxin completely abolished S1P-induced Akt and ERK1/2 activation as well as Ser1179-phospho-eNOS synthesis, indicating that the effects of S1P are dependent upon the activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein pathways. Interestingly, the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA completely inhibited Akt activation and Ser1179-phospho-eNOS synthesis, suggesting that activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway by S1P is dependent upon the elevation of intracellular calcium concentration (Fig. 3). In contrast, BAPTA did not block S1P-induced ERK1/2 activation; rather, calcium chelation with BAPTA led to a marked increase in the phosphorylation of these MAP kinase pathway proteins. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-K (an upstream activator of Akt), blocked S1P-mediated Akt activation and Ser1179-phospho-eNOS formation but did not inhibit S1P-mediated activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3). In contrast to the effects of wortmannin, the kinase inhibitor PD98059 (which inhibits the MAP kinase kinase MEK, which in turn phosphorylates ERK1/2), abolished ERK1/2 activation by S1P, but blocked neither S1P-mediated activation of Akt nor Ser1179-phospho-eNOS synthesis (Fig. 3). These experiments demonstrate that the S1P-mediated activation of Akt and ERK1/2 and the formation of Ser1179-phospho-eNOS are mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and that Akt activation and Ser1179-phospho-eNOS formation are calcium-dependent, whereas ERK1/2 activation is not.Figure 3Pharmacological characterization of S1P-mediated phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and eNOS. Shown are the results of Western blot analyses for phosphorylated forms of Akt, ERK1/2, and eNOS, using the cell lysates of BAEC prepared from cells treated with S1P. Prior to S1P treatment (100 nm for 5 min), BAEC had been treated with various reagents (50 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTx) overnight, 20 μm BAPTA for 30 min, 500 nm wortmannin (WORT) for 30 min, 10 μm PD98059 for 30 min) or vehicle. Equal amounts of cell lysate (20 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies directed against phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, and phospho-eNOS (Ser1179) antibodies, as indicated. Equal loading of samples was also confirmed by reprobing the immunoblots with antibodies against eNOS and Akt (not shown). Shown are data representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined features of S1P-mediated eNOS activation in BAEC. Fig.4 A shows the results of a S1P dose-response experiment in which cellular eNOS activity was quantitated by measuring the formation ofl-[3H]citrulline in BAEC loaded withl-[3H]arginine, applying a well characterized assay for cellular NO synthesis (35Chen Z.

The NOS inhibitorl-ω N-nitroarginine completely abolishes S1P-induced NO synthesis in BAEC (Fig. 4 B). S1P-mediated eNOS activation is also blocked by the calcium chelator BAPTA and by pertussis toxin treatment, as shown in Fig. 4. The PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin, which completely abolishes eNOS phosphorylation (Fig. 3), attenuates but does not completely abrogate S1P-stimulated eNOS activation (Fig. 4 B); S1P-mediated eNOS activation is reduced by 70%, but residual S1P-augmented enzyme activity remains above basal (p < 0.05). PD98059 is without effect, suggesting that S1P-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3) does not modulate eNOS in these experimental settings (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4eNOS activation by S1P. Shown are the results of an eNOS activity assay performed in BAEC treated with S1P as indicated. A, dose response.

We studied wild-type eNOS cDNA as well as an eNOS mutant in which the putative kinase Akt phosphorylation site Ser1179 is changed to Ala (S1179A) (20Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J.

COS-7 cells transiently expressing FLAG/EDG-1 and/or eNOS cDNAs were treated with 100 nm S1P for 5 min; cell lysates were probed by Western blot analysis with various antibodies, as shown in Fig.5. The overall expression of endogenous kinase Akt protein was unaffected by cDNA transfections; expression levels of the variously transfected cDNAs were concordant with the specific cDNA constructs used in these experiments (Fig.5 A). S1P treatment induces the phosphorylation (activation) of Akt only in cells transfected with the EDG-1 cDNA. Similarly, Ser1179-phospho-eNOS formation is observed only when S1P is added to cells cotransfected with EDG-1 and wild-type eNOS cDNAs. Importantly, when cells are cotransfected with EDG-1 and the S1179A mutant eNOS, S1P-induced Ser1179-phospho-eNOS formation was not detected despite robust phosphorylation of Akt (Fig.5 A). We next examined the effects of S1P on eNOS activation in these cells. COS-7 cells transiently expressing FLAG/EDG-1 and eNOS cDNAs (wild-type or S1179A) were incubated withl-[3H]arginine and treated with S1P or vehicle; cells were harvested, and lysates were analyzed forl-[3H]citrulline formation as described above. As we have observed previously (18Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32363-32370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), S1P activates eNOS in cells cotransfected with FLAG/EDG-1 and wild-type eNOS, with an EC50 of ∼20 nm (Fig. 5 B). In cells cotransfected with the S1179A eNOS mutant plus EDG-1, there is a markedly attenuated response to S1P compared with wild-type eNOS (Fig.5 B), despite the fact that these cells express eNOS protein at equivalent levels (Fig. 5 A).Figure 5Effects of S1P on Akt and eNOS signaling in COS-7 cells cotransfected with EDG-1 plus wild-type or S1179A mutant eNOS.

Shown are the results of Western blot analyses in COS-7 cells cotransfected with cDNA encoding FLAG/EDG-1 and/or eNOS (wild-type eNOS (WT eNOS) or S1179A mutant), as indicated. The total DNA amount was normalized with empty vector plasmid DNA for each transfection. Cells were treated with 100 nm S1P for 5 min or with vehicle, as indicated. Cell lysates (20 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope, Akt, phospho-Akt, phospho-eNOS (Ser1179), or eNOS, as indicated.

Vanhoutte P.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, 1 μm bradykinin induces the activation (phosphorylation) of ERK1/2 in BAEC, as we have reported previously (Fig. 6 A(22Bernier S.G. Haldar S. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30707-30715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)). However, bradykinin does not induce the activation of Akt or formation of Ser1179-phospho-eNOS, although the same cell preparations respond to S1P (Fig. 6 A). We compared bradykinin and S1P-mediated eNOS activation in BAEC, as shown in Fig.6 B. Although bradykinin and S1P both activate eNOS to a similar extent, bradykinin-induced eNOS activation is not inhibited by pertussis toxin nor by wortmannin, in contrast to the inhibitory effects of these agents on S1P-mediated eNOS activation. PD98059 has no substantive effect on bradykinin-dependent eNOS activation in this experimental system. It is notable that bradykinin and S1P activate eNOS to a similar magnitude (Fig. 6 B). When cells are treated with both bradykinin and S1P in combination, there is no additive increase in eNOS activity compared with cells treated individually with bradykinin or S1P.Figure 6Differential regulation of Akt, ERK1/2, and eNOS by S1P and bradykinin in BAEC.

We performed yeast two-hybrid screening and identified filamin, a cytoskeletal actin-binding protein 280, as a Smad5-interacting protein. Filamin was found to be associated not only with Smad5 but also with other Smad proteins, including TGF-β/activin receptor-regulated Smad2. TGF-β signaling was defective in filamin-deficient human melanoma cells M2 compared with a filamin-transfected subline A7, as determined by TGF-β-responsive reporter gene activation and Smad2 nuclear accumulation. M2 cells restored TGF-β responsiveness following transient transfection of full-length filamin encoding vector.

AP-1 enhances but oncoprotein Evi-1 represses the TGF-β-induced transcription through binding to Smad3 (17Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R.

Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Moreover, Smad3 has been shown to associate with vitamin D receptor and to act as a co-activator for vitamin D receptor-mediated transcription, implicating a cross-talk between vitamin D and TGF-β signaling pathways (19Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar).It has recently been shown that Smad signaling is also negatively regulated by a ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The Hect family of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Smurf1 interacts with Smad1 and Smad5, and triggers their ubiquitinization and subsequent degradation independently of receptor activation (20Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). In contrast, ubiquitin conjugating enzymes bind to Smad2 in an activation dependent manner in the nucleus and cause its multi-ubiquitinization and subsequent degradation (21Lo R.S. Massague J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).Filamin 1 (also called ABP-280) is the major human non-muscle isoform of a protein family (22Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). It is a homodimer of 280 kDa containing N-terminal actin-binding domain and 24 tandem repeats of 96 amino acids. The last repeat, 24, represents self-association domain of the molecule. Filamins are multifunctional proteins (23Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P.

They efficiently cross-link actin filaments, connect cortical actin filament networks to cell membrane receptors, and act as a scaffold for intracellular proteins involved in signal transduction.Here we report the identification of filamin as a Smad-binding protein. Filamin-deficient melanoma cells showed impaired TGF-β signaling activity compared with filamin-supplemented cells, evidenced by a decreased signal-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation. The interaction of filamin with Smad family proteins may represent a potential regulatory mechanism in TGF-β superfamily signaling.DISCUSSIONSubcellular localization, phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, transcriptional activity, and turnover of Smad proteins are thought to be regulated by Smad-interacting molecules. In the present study we have identified filamin, a cytoskeletal protein, as a Smad-interacting protein, and demonstrated the involvement of filamin in Smad2-mediated TGF-β signaling in the cytoplasm.Interaction of Smad family proteins with filamin suggested the involvement of filamin in TGF-β superfamily signaling. Filamin-deficient M2 cells showed impaired TGF-β signaling compared with filamin-supplemented A7 cells (Fig. 4, A andC) and the defect in M2 cells was shown to be due to decreased Smad2 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 5, A and B). The reduced TGF-β signaling activity was restored following supplement of filamin by transfection (Figs. 4 B and 5 C). The N-terminal truncated filamin also rescued TGF-β responsiveness in M2 cells, indicating that the binding of filamin to actin with subsequent actin network reorganization and stabilization is dispensable for the function of filamin at least in TGF-β signaling. Since phosphorylation of Smad is recognized as a trigger for Smad-mediated signaling, interaction with filamin may be essential for effective Smad phosphorylation in TGF-β superfamily signaling pathway. However, it is also possible that nuclear translocation of Smads is impaired in M2 cells, through distinct mechanism from phosphorylation of Smad protein.How does filamin work in the phosphorylation of Smad? There are several possible explanations for the potential function of filamin in Smad pathway (Fig. 5 D). First, filamin may serve as an anchor protein, like SARA, to control localization of Smad proteins near the cell surface receptors. Supporting this idea is the observation that filamin is concentrated in cortical regions of the cytoplasm tethered by certain cell surface molecules (25Ott I. Fischer E.G. Miyagi Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 27Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 30Sharma C.P. Ezzell R.M. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3461-3470PubMed Google Scholar). Second, filamin-associated Smad proteins may keep their conformation suitable for receptor-mediated phosphorylation. MH1 domains of Smad2 and Smad4 can interact with their corresponding MH2 domains to form inactive conformation (31Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and association with filamin may interrupt this self-association to promote phosphorylation or subsequent hetero-oligomerization. There is a possibility that filamin protects Smad proteins from ubiquitin-dependent degradation by masking a ubiquitin ligase-binding site of Smads. However, the expression level of Smad2 in both M2 and A7 cells did not change following treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 (data not shown), which suggest that absence of filamin did not cause an increased turnover of Smad2 protein in M2 cells.It was recently reported that cytoskeletal microtubules bind to Smad proteins, and negatively regulate the signaling (5Dong C. Li Z. Alvarez Jr., R. Feng X.H. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Our study strongly suggests that filamin, which is localized in the juxtamembrane region where receptors and their signaling mediators interact, work positively on Smad phosphorylation. Although it remains a possibility that cytoplasmic filamin far from cell surface membrane may negatively regulate Smad signaling like microtubules, filamin is essential for maximal function of Smad-mediated signaling, evidenced by the results from the experiments using filamin-deficient cells. It is suggested that the mode of the regulation in Smad signaling is different between these cytoskeletal elements, filamins and tubulins, depending on their cytoplasmic organization and localization.A variety of proteins have been reported to interact with filamin, including cell surface protein integrin β chains (24Glogauer M.

Among these molecules, integrin β chains, presenilin-1, and SEK1 bind to a portion of filamin similar to the Smad-binding site identified in current study, namely from repeat 20 to repeat 23 or 24.Accumulating evidence suggests that MAPK cascade closely correlates with TGF-β superfamily signaling. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase subfamily of MAPK phosphorylates specific sites in the linker region of Smads, thereby inhibiting (38Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J.

Interestingly, SEK1, which binds to the C-terminal region of filamin, is activated by TAK1 (49Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J.

Therefore, it is possible that filamin mediate cross-talk between Smad and MAPK pathways.On the other hand, cross-talk between integrins and TGF-β signaling system has also been reported. Expression of TGF-β receptors is controlled by ligand-activated integrins in breast cancer (50Wang D. Sun L. Zborowska E. Willson J.K. Gong J. Verraraghavan J. Brattain M.G. J. Biol.

In bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, integrin αvβ6 binds to latency-associated peptide and induces TGF-β activation to induce pulmonary inflammation (53Munger J.S. Huang X. Kawakatsu H.

MAPK is activated by integrin stimulation in fibroblasts (54Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29309-29316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) through focal adhesion protein-tyrosine kinase activation. Since MAPK phosphorylates linker portion of Smads and regulates their nuclear translocation, it is possible that activated integrin modulates Smad-mediated signaling via MAPK pathway.It has been recently shown that periventricular heterotopia (PH), a human X-linked dominant disorder, is caused by a mutation of thefilamin1 gene (55Fox J.W. Lamperti E.D. Eksioglu Y.Z. Hong S.E. Feng Y. Graham D.A. Scheffer I.E. Dobyns W.B. Hirsch B.A. Radtke R.A. Berkovic S.F. Huttenlocher P.R. Walsh C.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1315-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Most patients of PH suffer from seizures because a subset of neuron cells fail to migrate into developing cerebral cortex and persist as nodules of neurons lining the ventricular surface. PH patients also show shortened digits, syndactyly, and clinodactyly. These anomalies have also been observed in impairment of TGF-β superfamily protein (56Thomas J.T. Lin K. Nandedkar M. Camargo M. Cervenka J. Luyten F.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 57Thomas J.T. Kilpatrick M.W. Lin K. Erlacher L. Lembessis P. Costa T. Tsipouras P. Luyten F.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and defective Smad-mediated signaling due to mutations in filamin may underline the pathogenesis of PH.In conclusion, we have identified a cytoskeletal protein, filamin, as a Smad-associating protein, and demonstrated this interaction plays an important role in receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smad. In view of its association with various mediators of intracellular signaling, filamin may provide a scaffold of cross-talk between TGF-β superfamily and other signal transduction pathways. The transforming growth factor (TGF)1-β superfamily cytokines act on a wide variety of cells and organs to regulate development and homeostasis. Members of the Smad proteins play pivotal roles in the intracellular signal transduction of TGF-β family proteins. Activated type I TGF-β family receptors phosphorylate conserved serine residues at the C terminus of so-called receptor-regulated Smads, Smad1, -5, and -8, for receptors of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), or Smad2 and -3 for receptors of TGF-β and activin, respectively. The phosphorylated Smads are then translocated into the nucleus with their common partner Smad4, where they activate target genes in collaboration with other transcriptional partners (1Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar, 2Whitman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 3Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Smad-mediated signaling is regulated or modified through a number of Smad-interacting proteins. It has recently been shown that in the cytoplasm, a FYVE domain protein, SARA, binds to both Smad2 and TGF-β receptor, and plays an important role in recruiting Smad2 to the receptor by controlling the subcellular localization of Smad (4Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Microtubules bind to Smad2, -3, and -4, and negatively regulate signaling, controlling the rate of Smad2 association to receptor and subsequent phosphorylation (5Dong C. Li Z. Alvarez Jr., R.

In the nucleus, Smad proteins form complexes with transcriptional partners depending on target genes. Whereas Smad4 itself has a DNA binding activity (6Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P.

The general co-activator p300 associates with Smad3 and induces transcriptional activity synergistically (11Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R.

Moreover, Smad3 has been shown to associate with vitamin D receptor and to act as a co-activator for vitamin D receptor-mediated transcription, implicating a cross-talk between vitamin D and TGF-β signaling pathways (19Yanagisawa J.

It has recently been shown that Smad signaling is also negatively regulated by a ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The Hect family of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Smurf1 interacts with Smad1 and Smad5, and triggers their ubiquitinization and subsequent degradation independently of receptor activation (20Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2078216015,"Betaglycan, also known as the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) type III receptor, is a membrane-anchored proteoglycan that binds TGF-β via its core protein. Deletion mutagenesis analysis has revealed two regions of betaglycan ectodomain capable of binding TGF-β: one at the amino-terminal half, the endoglin-related region (López-Casillas, F., Payne, H., Andres, J. L., and Massagué, J. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 124, 557–568), and the other at the carboxyl-terminal half, the uromodulin-related region (Pepin, M.-C., Beauchemin, M., Plamondon, J., and O'Connor-McCourt, M. D. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A 91, 6997–7001). In the present work we have functionally characterized these ligand binding regions. Similar to the wild type receptor, both regions bind TGF-β2 with higher affinity than TGF-β1. However, only the endoglin-related region increases the TGF-β2 labeling of the TGF-β type II receptor, the so-called “TGF-β -presentation” function of the wild type receptor. Despite this preference, both regions as well as the wild type receptor mediate the TGF-β2-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation, indicating that they can function indistinguishably as TGF-β-enhancing co-receptors. On the other hand, we found that the recently described ability of the wild type betaglycan to bind inhibin A is a property of the core protein that resides in the uromodulin-related region. Binding competition experiments indicate that this region binds inhibin and TGF-β with the following relative affinities: TGF-β2 > inhibin A > TGF-β1. All together, the present results suggest that betaglycan ectodomain is endowed with two bona fide independent ligand binding domains that can perform specialized functions as co-receptors of distinct members of the TGF-β superfamily.

GAG, glycosaminoglycan chains endoglin-related uromodulin-related polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 is the prototype of a superfamily of growth factors involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (1Roberts A.B.

TGF-β signals through a complex of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, the TGF-β type I and type II receptors. Ligand binding promotes the association between the type I and II receptors. In this complex, phosphorylation of the type I receptor kinase by the constitutively active type II receptor kinase results in its activation. Active type I receptor phosphorylates members of a novel family of transcriptional regulators, the Smads, which transduce the TGF-β signal into the cell nucleus (3Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Betaglycan is a membrane proteoglycan containing heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains whose core protein binds all three TGF-β isoforms (9Cheifetz S. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Biol.

Betaglycan is capable of fine tuning the availability of TGF-β to the signaling receptors, thereby determining the outcome of the TGF-β stimulation (12Chen C. Wang X.-F. Sun L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12862-12867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Sun L. Chen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25367-25372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This regulation is both positive and negative. Although the membrane-bound form of betaglycan increases the binding of TGF-β to the signaling complex, the soluble form of betaglycan prevents this binding and therefore blocks the actions of TGF-β (14López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). These effects are more dramatic for TGF-β2, the isoform for which betaglycan has higher affinity (15Segarini P.R. Roberts A.B. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14655-14662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Andres J.L. Rönnstrand L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. J. Biol.

Expression of membrane betaglycan in cells that normally do not express this co-receptor increases their binding to TGF-β2 and corrects for their low sensitivity to this TGF-β isoform (18López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 19Sankar S. Mahooti-Brooks N. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13567-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Presumably, this effect is mediated by a TGF-β-induced “presentation complex” formed between membrane-bound betaglycan and the TGF-β type II receptor (18López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 20Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22215-22218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the presentation function is insufficient to account for the betaglycan strict requirement for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition leading to the heart valve formation (21Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This latter work has raised the possibility of a more direct, albeit unknown, role of betaglycan in the TGF-β signaling.Betaglycan also interacts with type II receptors of another TGF-β superfamily member. Lewis et al. (22Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) shows that betaglycan also binds inhibin A and participates in a ternary complex composed of the activin type II receptor and inhibin. This complex mediates the inhibin antagonism of activin by a simple and elegant mechanism: the routing the activin type II receptor into an inactive complex with betaglycan instead of the signaling complex with activin and the activin type I receptor (22Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that betaglycan is a versatile co-receptor for at least two distinct members of the TGF-β superfamily and open the question of the nature of the structural determinants that make this versatility possible.The TGF-β binding function of betaglycan is a property of its ectodomain core protein. Although betaglycan GAG chains are capable of binding basic fibroblast growth factor, they are dispensable for TGF-β binding and TGF-β2 presentation function (8Ponce-Castañeda M.V. Esparza-López J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5927-5930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence comparisons have disclosed regions in betaglycan ectodomain with similarity to other receptors or extracellular proteins. The 260 residues at its amino-terminal end have 28% similarity to the corresponding amino-terminal portion of endoglin ectodomain (7Cheifetz S. Bellón T. Calés C., S., V. Bernabeu C. Massagué J. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19027-19030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the 330 residues at its carboxyl-terminal end have similarity to proteins related to uromodulin (24Bork P. Sander C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Several groups have utilized deletion mutants of the wild type receptor to map the ligand binding domain of betaglycan (14López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar,25Pepin M.-C. Beauchemin M. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These studies show the existence of two ligand binding regions in betaglycan that roughly match to each half of its ectodomain, the membrane-distal and the membrane-proximal regions (26Pepin M.-C. Beauchemin M. Collins C. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present work we have characterized the functional properties of these ligand binding regions. Our results indicate that betaglycan ligand binding regions are equivalent for its TGF-β isoform affinities and TGF-β-enhancing function but differ in their ability to bind inhibin A.DISCUSSIONBetaglycan belongs to a class of cell surface receptor molecules that regulate the access of ligands to the signaling receptors. The functional relevance of this growing class of co-receptors is exemplified by cell surface heparan sulfates, which are necessary for the high affinity binding and signaling of basic fibroblast growth factor (43Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar, 44Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 575: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Betaglycan is a particularly interesting and versatile co-receptor because it modulates the effects of at least three members of the TGF-β superfamily. In one hand, membrane-bound betaglycan positively regulates TGF-β, whereas in the other, it mediates the inhibin antagonism of the activin signal (18López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 22Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a soluble form of betaglycan capable of binding TGF-β with high affinity has been found in serum and extracellular matrix (45Andres J.L. Stanley K. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3137-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A recombinant version of soluble betaglycan binds, sequesters, and thereby antagonizes TGF-β, playing an opposite role to the membrane-bound counterpart (14López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Because of these dual actions, it has been proposed that betaglycan could be one of TGF-β major in vivo regulators (46Attisano L. Wrana J.L. López-Casillas F. Massagué J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To fully understand and take advantage of betaglycan properties, it is necessary to characterize its interactions with its different ligands and signaling receptors. Betaglycan binds inhibin A and all three mammalian TGF-β isoforms through its ectodomain core protein, which is disproportionally large when compared with the ectodomains of the corresponding signaling receptors. The regional similarities that betaglycan ectodomain exhibits with endoglin (7Cheifetz S. Bellón T. Calés C., S., V. Bernabeu C. Massagué J. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19027-19030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with a class of extracellular proteins related to uromodulin (24Bork P. Sander C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) suggest a modular design with separate domains. Interestingly, this modular design seems to adjust well to the identified regions of TGF-β binding activity. Several groups have used deletion mutants of rat betaglycan to map betaglycan TGF-β binding regions (14López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 25Pepin M.-C. Beauchemin M. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This experimental approach has revealed two ample portions of betaglycan with TGF-β binding activity that approximately correspond to each half of its ectodomain, the membrane-distal (E-related) and the membrane-proximal (U-related) regions (Fig. 1 A). In the present work we report the creation of additional betaglycan mutants that contain the U-related regions (Δ11 and Δ12) and, thus, complete our previously described set of mutants (14López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The availability of these new mutants has provided us with the materials to study the functional properties of these regions.The TGF-β affinity labeling of our new and a few selected old mutants (Figs. 1, B and C, and 3A) confirmed the presence of TGF-β binding activity in the E-related region, present in mutants Δ3, Δ10, and in the U-related region, present intact in mutant Δ11. In addition, we have found that these regions have TGF-β binding affinities that are very similar to the intact receptor. Ligand binding competitions (Fig. 2) indicate that Δ10 and Δ11 exhibit the same relative TGF-β affinities, approximately one order of magnitude higher for TGF-β2 than for TGF-β1. This TGF-β isoform selectivity has been shown before for the intact wild type receptor (15Segarini P.R. Roberts A.B. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14655-14662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Andres J.L. Rönnstrand L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23282-23287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mitchell E.J. Fitz-Gibbon L. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the E-related and the U-related regions are expressed as soluble receptors, they have the same relative TGF-β affinities of their membrane counterparts and the wild type receptor. These results further support the possibility that the residues in the E- and U-related regions may constitute bona fide independent structural domains of the betaglycan extracellular region.Nonetheless, the precise determination of the sites or residues involved in the ligand binding activity in these domains will be difficult to obtain by further analysis of betaglycan-truncated mutants, an approach that has met with puzzling results. As an example is the case of our previously published Δ1 (Δ45–199), Δ5 (Δ200–285), Δ8 (Δ45–282), and Δ9 (Δ287–409) mutants, which despite having complete the U-related region, do not bind TGF-β (14López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). A plausible explanation for this inability is that the portions of the E-related region that were not deleted in Δ1, Δ5, Δ8, and Δ9 indirectly affect the TGF-β binding activity of the U-related region by a “downstream folding effect.” Presumably, the leftover segments of the upstream E-related region in these mutants would cause an improper folding of the downstream U-related region and thereby loss of its TGF-β binding activity. The incomplete maturation of the mutant receptor, which would be another consequence of its putative improper folding, has been ruled out for all our mutants (old and new), since each one of them has been shown to reach the cell surface. Downstream folding effects may also explain the discrepancies in TGF-β binding activity shown by mutants that look alike. A case in point is our inactive Δ12 (Δ44–499) mutant (Figs. 1 and 3), which is very similar to the active Δ 44–564 and Δ 44–575 mutants published by the group of O'Connor-McCourt (25Pepin M.-C. Beauchemin M. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6997-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The removal of the first two cysteines that define the uromodulin similarity of the U-related region, as in mutant Δ12, renders this TGF-β binding region inactive. Surprisingly, O'Connor's group has found that the additional removal of the third or the third and fourth of these cysteines, as in their mutants Δ 44–564 and Δ 44–575, do not affect the binding activity of the U-related region (25Pepin M.-C. Beauchemin M. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6997-7001Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This would suggest that downstream folding effects impair the major determinants of the TGF-β binding activity of the U-related region in a very unpredictable manner. Also, these results would indicate that the last 213 residues of the U-related region are the most relevant for its TGF-β binding activity; unfortunately, further deletion of residues within this region has been uninformative. The inactivity of their Δ 44–596 mutant has been attributed to improper maturation of the mutant receptor, making it difficult to assess its intrinsic TGF-β binding activity (26Pepin M.-C. Beauchemin M. Collins C. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In view of the shortcomings of the analysis by deletion mutants, it is likely that the precise determination of the residues directly involved in the TGF-β-binding activity of betaglycan E- and U-related regions will require the use of biophysical techniques. These techniques, such as x-ray diffraction or nuclear magnetic resonance could be employed with our purified soluble Δ10 and Δ11 mutants.Another issue addressed in this work is the TGF-β2 presentation activity of the betaglycan TGF-β binding regions. We and others have demonstrated that the endogenous low affinity that the type II receptor has for TGF-β2 is compensated by the TGF-β presentation activity of the membrane-bound wild type betaglycan (18López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 20Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22215-22218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated the TGF-β2 presentation activity of the betaglycan TGF-β binding regions by determining the extent of TGF-β2 labeling that they confer to the type II receptor. For that we performed two kinds of experiments; in one we used epitope-tagged receptors in transiently transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B), and in another we used stably expressed untagged receptors in L6E9 cells (Fig.3 C). Both experiments led, essentially, to the same conclusion; the TGF-β binding regions of betaglycan have opposite ability to present this TGF-β isoform to the type II receptor. In both experiments the basal level of TGF-β2 binding of type II receptor, either the one endogenously present in the L6E9 cells or the one transiently transfected in COS-1 cells, is negligible in the absence of betaglycan (Fig. 3, B and C). In COS-1 cells, co-transfection with the wild type betaglycan or its gag− mutant greatly increased the TGF-β2 labeling of the type II receptor. Co-expression of Δ11, the betaglycan mutant encoding the complete U-related region, did not promote the same level of binding. At best, Δ11 improved the levels obtained with mutants devoid of TGF-β binding activity, which may be regarded as background. Similarly, when the Δ11 mutant was expressed in L6E9 cells, it did not increase the TGF-β2 binding of the type II receptor. On the other hand, in COS-1 cells, co-expression of Δ10 or Δ3 betaglycan mutants encoding the complete E-related region promoted the type II receptor TGF-β2 binding at levels even higher than those observed with the wild type betaglycan. In the L6E9 cells, the expression of the Δ10 mutant also increased the labeling of the type II receptor; however, in this case the wild type betaglycan was a better TGF-β2 presenter than the Δ10 mutant. The slightly better labeling of the L6E9 endogenous TGF-β type II receptor in the presence of the wild type betaglycan than in the presence of the Δ10 mutant contrasts with the opposite situation in the COS-1 cells experiment (compare the Δ10 and WT lanes in Figs. 3, B and C). However, very little can be said about the structure or nature of the interacting receptors based on this result. The experiments shown in Figs. 3, B and C correspond to different type of assays. In one we used a transiently expressed, tagged human type II receptor, whereas in the other, an untagged endogenous rat receptor was evaluated. These facts, added to unknown TGF-β cross-linking efficiencies for these receptors, would make any quantitative conclusion derived from these results unreliable. Nonetheless, the finding that the E-related region confers better TGF-β2 labeling of the type II receptor than the U-related region is evidenced by the two types of assays shown in Fig. 3. Based on these observations, it was reasonable to guess that the E-related region would be responsible of the TGF-β2 functional enhancement property of the wild type betaglycan. Contrary to this expectation, our experiments measuring the TGF-β2-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation indicated that both ligand binding regions were equally capable of performing that function (Fig. 4). This fact raises a paradox which indicates that the so-called TGF-β presentation function is, very likely, an artifact of the cross-linking step during the affinity labeling. These results also indicate that without sustaining functional experiments, affinity labeling data should be interpreted very cautiously.The last issue addressed in this work is related to the betaglycan inhibin A binding ability. Here we have shown that the intrinsic inhibin A binding capacity of betaglycan is confined to the U-related ligand binding region and that the GAG chains are dispensable for this capacity. Additionally, these findings suggest that the U-related region is the one that creates with the type II activin receptor the high affinity inhibin binding site, and that is the most likely candidate to mediate the inhibin antagonism of activin. This raises another question of why two polypeptide sequences so distinct from each other, as is the case for the E- and U-related regions, have such peculiar ligand binding properties. Their similar TGF-β binding and functional properties, their different inhibin A binding abilities, plus the fact that they are confined to discrete portions of the co-receptor would support the hypothesis that the E- and U-related regions reflect two independently folded domains of betaglycan. These facts also would favor the hypothesis that the TGF-β2-enhancing effect of betaglycan results from a simple ligand-concentrating mechanism; that is, that wild type receptor or its independently expressed ligand binding regions simply increase the local TGF-β2 concentration in the neighborhood of the TGF-β type II receptor. However, with the currently available evidence, the argument for a specific more-favorable TGF-β2 conformation, imposed by betaglycan or any of its ligand binding regions, cannot be ruled out. This last possibility is especially enticing due to the fact that only one of the regions is capable of binding inhibin A, which would suggest that very specific ligand-receptor interactions occur for each region. A more conclusive answer to these questions will have to wait for biophysical structural studies of betaglycan ligand binding regions. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 is the prototype of a superfamily of growth factors involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and development (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 2Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). TGF-β signals through a complex of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, the TGF-β type I and type II receptors. Ligand binding promotes the association between the type I and II receptors. In this complex, phosphorylation of the type I receptor kinase by the constitutively active type II receptor kinase results in its activation. Active type I receptor phosphorylates members of a novel family of transcriptional regulators, the Smads, which transduce the TGF-β signal into the cell nucleus (3Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar, 4Piek E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). TGF-β has two known co-receptors, betaglycan and endoglin, which are transmembrane glycoproteins with large extracellular regions that bind TGF-β and small cytoplasmatic regions without any clearly identifiable signaling motif (5López-Casillas F.

https://openalex.org/W1604166471,"To understand the role of the Yes-associated protein (YAP), binding partners of its WW1 domain were isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen. One of the interacting proteins was identified as p53-binding protein-2 (p53BP-2). YAP and p53BP-2 interacted in vitro and in vivo using their WW1 and SH3 domains, respectively. The YAP WW1 domain bound to the YPPPPY motif of p53BP-2, whereas the p53BP-2 SH3 domain interacted with the VPMRLR sequence of YAP, which is different from other known SH3 domain-binding motifs. By mutagenesis, we showed that this unusual SH3 domain interaction was due to the presence of three consecutive tryptophans located within the βC strand of the SH3 domain. A point mutation within this triplet, W976R, restored the binding selectivity to the general consensus sequence for SH3 domains, the PXXP motif. A constitutively active form of c-Yes was observed to decrease the binding affinity between YAP and p53BP-2 using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas the overexpression of c-Yes did not modify this interaction. Since overexpression of an activated form of c-Yes resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of p53BP-2, we propose that the p53BP-2 phosphorylation, possibly in the WW1 domain-binding motif, might negatively regulate the YAP·p53BP-2 complex.

WW domains are small modules that mediate protein/protein interactions (1Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 2Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The major features of the WW domain primary structure are (i) two conserved tryptophans spaced by 20–22 amino acids within the 40-amino acid long domain, (ii) a block of two or three aromatic amino acids located centrally between the two signature tryptophans, and (iii) a conserved proline located +3 to the second conserved tryptophan (3Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The three antiparallel β strands of WW domains form a hydrophobic patch that binds proline-rich or proline-containing motifs (4Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Based on the ligand-binding specificity, one can divide WW domains into five groups. Group I WW domains bind to the core sequence PPXY (2Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 5Rentschler S. Linn H. Deininger K. Bedford M.T. Espanel X. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Group II WW domains interact with a long stretch of prolines interrupted by a leucine (6Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 7Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Group III WW domains bind to PPR-containing motifs (8Bedford M.T. Sarbassova D. Xu J. Leder P. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10359-10369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Group IV WW domains interact with phosphoserine that is followed by a proline (9Lu P.-J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Group V WW domains interact with polyprolines interrupted by a glycine and flanked by arginine (10Komuro A. Saeki M. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36513-36519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A WW-like fold was identified in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor subfamily of tyrosine kinases (11Irusta P.M. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6912-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are composed of 50–70 amino acids forming a structure containing multiple β sheets (12Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). These modules also mediate protein/protein interactions through proline-rich motifs. Based on the binding specificity, the SH3 domains are divided into three major groups. Group I SH3 domains interact with basic-X-hydrophobic-proline-X-hydrophobic-proline (+XψPXψP), whereas Group II binds to hydrophobic-proline-X-hydrophobic-proline-X-basic (ψPXψPX+). Group III SH3 domains represented by the Eps8 family members select ligands with PXXDY consensus cores (13Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesarini G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Yes-associated protein (YAP),1 the first protein in which a WW domain was identified, is a phosphoprotein of 65 kDa that interacts with the SH3 domain of the c-yes proto-oncogene product, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src family. YAP expression is ubiquitous, with a high expression in ovaries (14Sudol M. Chen H.I. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). YAP has two isoforms: a short form (YAP) that possesses only one WW domain (WW1) and a long form (LYAP) that has two WW domains (WW1 and WW2) (Fig. 1 A). In addition, there is a PDZ domain-binding motif, TWL, at the carboxyl-terminal end of YAP that allows the interaction with a submembranous scaffolding protein, EBP50 (ERM-binding phosphoprotein) (15Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Since the modular structure of YAP is reminiscent of adaptor-type signaling proteins, we have decided to identify cognate partners of YAP to understand its molecular function. Using the human YAP WW1 domain to screen a mouse embryonic expression library, we have previously identified two putative ligand proteins: WW domain-binding protein (WBP)-1 and WBP-2 (2Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The analysis of these two ligands showed that the YAP WW1 domain binds to the PPXY core sequence (PY motif). Recently, it has been shown that YAP can also interact with polyomavirus enhancer binding protein-2α (PEBP-2α), a transcription factor (16Yagi R. Chen L.F. Shigesada K. Murakami Y. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2551-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In this report, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified another YAP WW1 domain partner, p53-binding protein-2 (p53BP-2) (17Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Originally, p53BP-2 was isolated as one of two proteins that interact with the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor protein, but not with a mutant form, in a yeast two-hybrid screen (17Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In fact, the most common point mutations of p53 found in cancers prevent p53/p53BP-2 interaction if they are located in the DNA-binding domain (18Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Human p53BP-2, composed of 1005 amino acids, possesses a PY motif, four ankyrin repeats, and one SH3 domain at the carboxyl-terminal end (Fig.1 A). Using the two-hybrid system and x-ray diffraction, it has been shown that the fourth ankyrin repeat and the SH3 domain of p53BP-2 interact with the DNA-binding domain of p53, thus preventing the interaction between DNA and p53 (17Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 18Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The p53BP-2 SH3 domain does not interact with p53 via a PXXP or PXXDY consensus motif. Like p53, p53BP-2 is part of a protein network since it has been shown that p53BP-2 can also interact with Bcl-2 (an anti-apoptotic protein), protein phosphatase-1γ, NF-κB subunit p65 (a transcription factor), and APCL (adenomatouspolyposis coli-like) protein (a tumor suppressor-like protein) (19Helps N.R. Barker H.M. Elledge S.J. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3884-3892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yang J.P. Hori M. Takahashi N. Kawabe T. Kato H. Okamoto T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5177-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Nakagawa H. Koyama K. Murata Y. Morito M. Akiyama T. Nakamura Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 101-105PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions are mutually exclusive and can be competed by p53. We show here that the interaction between p53BP-2 and YAP is dependent on the presence of the YAP WW1 and p53BP-2 SH3 domains. Using the SPOT technique, the binding motifs of these two domains were mapped. The p53BP-2 YPPPPY sequence was required for interaction with the YAP WW1 domain, and the YAP VPMRLRK peptide bound to the p53BP-2 SH3 domain. The unusual SH3 domain-binding motif seemed to be due to the presence of three consecutive tryptophans within the βC sheet of the SH3 domain. By CAT/ELISA, we confirmed that YAP was a putative transcription factor and that the interaction between YAP and p53BP-2 occurred in vivo. In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of c-Yes phosphorylated, directly or indirectly, p53BP-2. We also provided evidence that this phosphorylation might decrease or abolish the binding between YAP and p53BP-2. The screening was performed with a Matchmaker kit from CLONTECH. We used the human brain library from CLONTECH, in which cDNAs were cloned into the pGAD-10 vector (GenBankTM/EBI accession number U13188) at the EcoRI site using anEcoRI linker (CCGGAATTCCGG). Baits were cloned into the pGBT-BSE vector, which corresponds to a modified pGBT9 vector (GenBankTM/EBI accession number U07646): the sequence between EcoRI and BamHI was replaced byGAATTG GGATCCCCGGGTGAATTC AGATCC(the old EcoRI and BamHI sites are in italic and the new BamHI and EcoRI sites are underlined). Confirmation of interactions was performed in the pGAD-BSE vector, which corresponds to the pGAD-424 vector (GenBankTM/EBI accession number U07647) modified the same way as the pGBT9 vector. pDBGAL4-BSE was obtained by inserting theHindIII-EcoRI fragment corresponding to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 coming from the pGBT-BSE vector into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). GBT-YAPWW1 (where GBT is the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (yeast expression vector)), GAD-YAPWW1 (where GAD is the GAL4 activation domain), and GST-YAPWW1 correspond to the human cDNA region (nucleotides 758–926; GenBankTM/EBI accession number P46937) coding for the YAP WW1 domain (amino acids 162–217) (2Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The GST-YAPWW1-P202A construct is the GST-YAPWW1 plasmid with the substitution P202A (23Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17070-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). DB-HYAP6 (where DB is the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (mammalian expression vector)) possesses the BamHI-EcoRI fragment of human YAP, which corresponds to the full-length cDNA, except that for the first methionine, we added a BamHI linker (GGATCCCCGCATATGGATCC). DB-HYAP6ΔAD (amino acids 1–344) corresponds to XhoI (partial)-HindIII digestion of the DB-HYAP6 construct. After treatment with Klenow fragment, the vector was self-ligated. GST-WBP-1 corresponds to the PY motif (GTPPPPYTVG) of mouse WBP-1 (amino acids 170–179) (2Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). DB-BP-2 was obtained by ligating theAvrII-XbaI (blunted by Klenow) fragment of human p53BP-2 into the pDBGAL4-BSE vector at the BamHI andEcoRI (blunted by Klenow) sites. To maintain the reading frame, we cloned the BamHI/AvrII linker (GGATCCGTCTTGCCCGGCCCTAGG). GAD-PY5, GBT-PY5, GST-PY5, and DB-PY5 contain the PY motif (amino acids 729–768) of human p53BP-2 cDNA (GenBankTM/EBI accession number U58334) (24Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17284-17289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GST-A4 to GST-A11 correspond to PY5 with a point mutation. They were obtained by PCR using the XE-BamHI primer (5′-ACTTAGGGATCCAATCCAGAGGCTCCACATGTGC-3′) and the primer possessing the point mutation and the natural cloning site,ApaI. The PCR fragments were then inserted into GST-PY5 at the BamHI and ApaI sites. GST-Cterm and DB-Cterm were obtained by PCR using the XE-BamHI primer (see above) and the EX-Stop-SmaI primer (5′-ATCTATCCCGGGTTTCAGGCCAAGCTCCTTTG-3′) on p53BP-2 cDNA. The PCR fragment was cloned into pGEX-2TK at theBamHI and SmaI sites. This construct expresses the last quarter of p53BP-2 (amino acids 729–1005). DB-Cterm A9 corresponds to the insertion of the BamHI-SmaI fragment of mutant GST-Cterm (Y751A) into the pDBGAL4-BSE vector at theBamHI and EcoRI (blunted) sites. GST-CtermΔSH3 and DB-CtermΔSH3 were made from the GST-Cterm construct partially digested by BssHII and then blunted with Klenow fragment. After digestion by SmaI, the vector was religated. This construct produces the region between amino acids 729 and 978 of p53BP-2. GST-Cterm W976R corresponds to the GST-Cterm construct in which the TaqI-SmaI fragment was replaced by the PCR product obtained from the EX-p53BP-2-SmaI primer (GAATTCCCGGGTCAGGCCAAGCTTCTTTGTCTTGGTTT) and the XE-WR-TaqI primer (GAAATCGAATGGTGGAGGGCTCGCCTTAATGATAAGGAG). GST-Cterm L990Y was made by replacing theBsaAI-SmaI fragment of GST-Cterm by the PCR product issued from the EX-p53BP-2-SmaI primer (see above) and the XE-LY-BsaAI primer (ATGTTCCACGTAACTACCTGGGACTGTACC). GST-Cterm W976R-L990Y was made the same way as the GST-Cterm L990Y construct, but instead of inserting the PCR fragment into the GST-Cterm construct, we used the GST-Cterm W976R construct. HYAP6 corresponds to the BamHI-EcoRI fragment of human YAP cloned into the pcDNA3.1(−)/hygromycin vector (Invitrogen) at the XbaI and EcoRI sites. We used an XbaI/BamHI linker (TCTAGATACCGGTCGCCACCATGGATCC). HYAP6ΔAD was obtained from the HYAP6 construct digested by XhoI andHindIII and treated with Klenow fragment of polymerase I and then self-ligated. HYAP6 W199F corresponds to the HYAP6 construct in which the point mutation was introduced by the W199F primer (CCTGGGGTCCTGGAATGTTGTTGTC; italics show the mutation) using a double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BP-2 is the full coding sequence of human p53BP-2 (BamHI-XbaI) cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector at the BamHI and XbaI sites. The Yes and Yes Y535F constructs correspond to the full coding sequence of mouse c-Yes (wild type and mutant, respectively) cloned into theMluI sites of the pMIK-Neo vector (a kind gift from Dr. Maruyama, University of Tokyo). The pG5CAT vector (CLONTECH) encodes the CAT reporter gene downstream of the E1B minimal promoter containing five binding sites for GAL4. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transfected in duplicates using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (25Espanel X. Le Cam L. North S. Sardet C. Brun G. Gillet G. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of transfected samples was measured by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Per experiment, we used the same amount of protein, which was normalized to the sample with the lowest protein concentration. We then followed the Roche Molecular Biochemicals kit procedure for CAT quantification. For transfection efficiency, we transfected 1 μg of SV40-LacZ (26Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar) construct/60-mm dish. The β-galactosidase assays were carried out with 45 μl of the protein extract used for CAT/ELISA in the presence of 100 μl of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and 100 μg of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside. CAT/LacZ corresponds to the ratio of CAT absorbance to LacZ absorbance (27Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Bacteria were transfected with different DNA constructs cloned into the pGEX-2TK vector. The GST fusion proteins were induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C. GST fusion proteins were extracted and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (24Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17284-17289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Chicken brains were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmEDTA, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) in the presence of the protease inhibitor mixture CompleteTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After clarification by centrifugation, lysates were diluted 10 times in Tween buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1% bovine serum albumin) with protease inhibitors (CompleteTM) and incubated at 4 °C for 14 h under agitation with GST fusion protein (50 μg) bound to glutathione beads. The beads were washed three times with Tween buffer without bovine serum albumin. We expressed human p53BP-2 from amino acids 480 to 626 as a GST fusion protein (GST-Ab). This construct was obtained by PCR using the XE-Ab-BamHI primer (5′-ACATGGGGATCCACCGTGGCAGCAAGTTCAATA-3′) and the EX-Ab-SmaI primer (5′-ATCTATCCCGGGTGAATATTTGGCCCATTAGGACC-3′). Several milligrams of this construct were purified on glutathione beads, cleaved by thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from the GST part, and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12.5%). The protein band of the expected molecular mass was cut and directly sent to Covance for injections into rabbits and antibody production. Immune serums were combined and purified on column of GST-Ab coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (28Sudol M. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2839-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Protein samples in loading buffer (25% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% SDS) were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 with either 5% low-fat dried milk or 3% bovine serum albumin (for the 4G10 antibody). For Western immunoblotting, anti-YAP (29Sudol M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2145-2152PubMed Google Scholar), anti-MBP-2, and 4G10 (anti-phosphotyrosine from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies were diluted 1:2000. After 1 h, membranes were washed with the same buffer. The blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:8000 dilution; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For visualization of the signal, we used the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. HEK 293 cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. About 200 μg of protein were incubated with anti-MBP-2 antibody (diluted 1:20) for 1 h at 4 °C under agitation, and then protein A-agarose beads were added and incubated for 1 h. The beads were washed once with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and then twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The pGEX-2TK vector codes for GST fusion proteins harboring a protein kinase A site. GST fusion proteins (50 μg) were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by protein kinase A from bovine heart (Sigma) according to the protocol previously described (24Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol.

Peptides were synthesized on a derivatized cellulose membrane provided by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (30Frank R. Doring R.

The blots were blocked in Western wash solution (10 mmTris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl) plus 1× blocking buffer (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C under agitation. Radiolabeled GST fusion proteins (50 μg) were then added to the blocking solution for 14 h at 4 °C under constant shaking. Washes were performed with Western wash solution. Before autoradiography, filters were dried at room temperature. After electrotransfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in Western wash solution plus 5% low-fat dried milk for 1 h at 4 °C. Radiolabeled GST fusion proteins were added in the same solution. After 14 h at 4 °C under agitation, membranes were extensively washed with Western wash solution. To better understand the function of YAP, we searched for protein partners that could interact with its interaction module, the WW1 domain. We used the first amino-terminally located WW domain of YAP because this domain is present in the two isoforms of YAP. In previous studies, we had isolated two putative ligand proteins (WBP-1 and WBP-2) that interacted in vitro with the YAP WW1 domain (2Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether other proteins could interact with the WW1 domain of YAP, pull-down experiments on cell lysates using GST-YAPWW1 fusion protein were performed. As controls, GST alone and the GST-YAPWW1-P202A mutant, which is known to render the domain inactive for binding to PPXY-containing WBP-1 (23Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17070-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), were used. After separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the precipitated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with radioactively labeled GST-YAPWW1. As shown in Fig.2, there were four major specific proteins of 120, 100, 90, and 40 kDa that were pulled-down from chicken brain extracts by the human YAP WW1 domain. Proteins of the same molecular masses were pulled-down by GST-YAPWW1 from mouse brain and HeLa cell protein extracts (data not shown). To identify binding partners of the YAP WW1 domain that were visualized in the pull-down assays shown in Fig. 2, a yeast two-hybrid screen was used. A human brain cDNA library was probed with the YAP WW1 domain engineered as bait (GBT-YAPWW1). After screening ∼1.5 × 106 clones, 16 clones that were positive on selection medium and in a β-galactosidase colorimetric assay were obtained. The following clones were then isolated: the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (amino acids 41–174), kinesin-5 (amino acids 27–176), the KIAA0870 protein with a shifted reading frame (one time), an unknown sequence (three times), an empty pGAD vector (four times), and p53BP-2 (amino acids 517–1005; which was isolated seven times). With the exception of p53BP-2, none of the isolated clones contained the expected PPXY motif for binding to the WW1 domain of YAP. In addition, the alignment of inserts for all the remaining clones revealed no apparent consensus sequence that could be considered as a core for an alternative motif for binding to the WW1 domain of YAP. With the exception of p53BP-2, we considered all the remaining clones as false positives. In addition, isolation of p53BP-2 with its PPPPYP confirmed the following: (i) the results of Pirozziet al. (32Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), who showed, after a data bank screen, that the peptide of p53BP-2 containing the PY motif can interact in vitro with the YAP WW1 domain, and (ii) our previous in vitro results aimed at definition of the optimal core of the YAP WW1 binders through screening peptide repertoires displayed on phage (33Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have shown that the peptides containing PPPYP cores display the highest affinity for the WW1 domain of human and mouse YAP (33Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To further confirm the complex formation between YAP and p53BP-2, the interaction between GBT-YAPWW1 and the p53BP-2 proline-rich motif (PY5) fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain (GAD-PY5) was assayed. In parallel, we did the reverse experiment, in which PY5 was fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (GBT-PY5), whereas the YAP WW1 domain was fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain (GAD-YAPWW1). As shown in Fig.3, the PY motif of p53BP-2 by itself could interact with the YAP WW1 domain in both ways, whereas a mutant of the YAP WW 1 domain, YAFE-LH10 (L190W and H192G), did not interact with the PY5 construct (data not shown) (24Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17284-17289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As positive control, we repeated and confirmed the previous results reported by Field and co-workers (17Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) using p53 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (pVA3) and pGAD-Cterm, which corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal part of p53BP-2 from the PPXY motif to the end of the protein (amino acids 729–1005) (data not shown). To map the region of p53BP-2 that interacts with YAP, two different GST fusion proteins of p53BP-2 (GST-PY5 and GST-Cterm) were expressed. As depicted in Fig.4 A, GST-PY5 and GST-Cterm precipitated the two YAP isoforms (doublet) from chicken brain extracts, whereas the PY motif of WBP-1 or GST alone could not. The same result was obtained with human cellular extracts. Therefore, the PY motif by itself is also sufficient to precipitate YAP. It is interesting to note that Cterm has a higher affinity for YAP than for PY5 alone, suggesting that another region in GST-Cterm can interact with YAP to stabilize this complex. Since YAP interacts with the SH3 domain of c-Yes, we hypothesized that the SH3 domain of p53BP-2 might also interact with YAP. To address this, the SH3 domain was rendered inactive by deleting the last two β strands of the p53BP-2 SH3 domain from the GST-Cterm construct (GST-CtermΔSH3), and the GST pull-down experiments were repeated. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the p53BP-2 SH3 domain interacted, directly or indirectly, with YAP since the precipitation efficiency of the GST-CtermΔSH3 construct was lower compared with that of the GST-Cterm construct. To determine whether the SH3 domain of p53BP-2 interacts with YAP directly, 15-mer peptides that cover the entire sequence of human YAP with 10 amino acids overlapping between two consecutive peptides were synthesized. The peptides were covalently attached to a cellulose membrane through their C termini as described in the SPOT technique (31Blankenmeyer-Menge B. Nimitz B. Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1990; 31: 1701-1704Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The membrane was then probed with the radiolabeled GST-Cterm fusion protein containing the SH3 domain of p53BP-2. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the p53BP-2 SH3 domain bound to YAP through two peptides, spots 16 and 17, whereas the GST-CtermΔSH3 construct did not interact with any spot, as expected (data not shown). Spots 16 and 17 shared the PQTVPMRLRK sequence, which did not contain the general consensus sequence PXXP or PXXDY for binding to SH3 domains. As controls, we also synthesized the p53-derived peptide CN"

LCAT-KO mice had normochromic normocytic anemia with increased reticulocyte and target cell counts as well as decreased red blood cell osmotic fragility. A subset of LCAT-KO mice accumulated lipoprotein X and developed proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis characterized by mesangial cell proliferation, sclerosis, lipid accumulation, and deposition of electron dense material throughout the glomeruli. LCAT deficiency reduced the plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (−70 to −94%) and non-HDL cholesterol (−48 to −85%) levels in control, apoE-KO, LDLr-KO, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein-Tg mice. Transcriptome and Western blot analysis demonstrated up-regulation of hepatic LDLr and apoE expression in LCAT-KO mice. Despite decreased HDL, aortic atherosclerosis was significantly reduced (−35% to −99%) in all mouse models with LCAT deficiency. Our studies indicate (i) that the plasma levels of apoB containing lipoproteins rather than HDL may determine the atherogenic risk of patients with hypoalphalipoproteinemia due to LCAT deficiency and (ii) a potential etiological role for lipoproteins X in the development of glomerulosclerosis in LCAT deficiency.

Med. 1999; 341: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar) indicate that increased plasma HDL levels protect against the development of atherosclerosis. One of several proposed functions of HDL as an anti-atherogenic lipoprotein is to facilitate reverse cholesterol transport, a process by which cholesterol is transported from peripheral cells to the liver for removal from the body (7Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar). LCAT may play a major role in this process by maintaining a free cholesterol gradient between peripheral cells and the HDL particle surface, thus promoting free cholesterol efflux (1Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The newly generated cholesteryl esters (CE) accumulating in the HDL core may be transferred directly to the liver via whole particle and/or selective uptake (9Eisenberg S. Oschry Y. Zimmerman J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Alternatively HDL-CE may be transferred to apoB-containing lipoproteins as a result of the activity of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) (8Tall A.R. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19: A31-A35PubMed Google Scholar).The important role that LCAT plays in HDL metabolism has been established by the identification and characterization of patients with LCAT deficiency. Mutations in the human LCAT gene result either in familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) or in fish eye disease (FED). FED patients have a partial deficiency of LCAT function leading to hypoalphalipoproteinemia and the development of corneal opacities (11Carlson L.A. Philipson B. Lancet. 1979; 2: 921-923Abstract Scopus (113) Google Scholar,12Santamarina-Fojo S. Hoeg J.M. Assmann G. Brewer Jr., H.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1999Google Scholar). FLD patients have a total deficiency of LCAT function (12Santamarina-Fojo S. Hoeg J.M. Assmann G.

Lab. Invest. 1967; 20: 231-243Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In addition to hypoalphalipoproteinemia and corneal opacities, many FLD patients also develop a mild normochromic, normocytic anemia, proteinuria, and/or renal dysfunction (14Gjone E. Norum K.R. Acta Med. Scand. 1968; 183: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Torsvik H. Gjone E. Norum K.R. Acta Med.

The mild hemolytic anemia in FLD appears to be secondary to changes in red blood cell membrane lipids resulting from altered cholesterol metabolism (17Murayama N. Asano Y. Hosoda S. Maesawa M.

Glomerulosclerosis, the major cause of morbidity and mortality in FLD, may ultimately lead to renal failure in the fourth or fifth decade of life (19Myhre E. Gjone E. Flatmark A. Hovig T.

Med. 1982; 51: 411-426PubMed Google Scholar), but its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Likewise, the role of LCAT in modulating the development of atherosclerosis in these patients remains unclear. Despite reduced plasma HDL, many patients with FLD or FED do not appear to have an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease (21Kuivenhoven J.A. Pritchard H. Hill J. Frohlich J. Assmann G.

In the present study we characterize the lipid, ophthalmologic, hematological, renal, and cardiovascular organ systems of LCAT-KO mice on both regular and high fat/high cholesterol (HF/HC) diets. LCAT-KO mice develop a clinical phenotype similar to human patients with FLD. In addition to severe hypoalphalipoproteinemia, LCAT-KO mice present with normochromic normocytic anemia and glomerulosclerosis. Our findings indicate that the induction of LpX by the HF/HC diet is associated with the development of glomerulosclerosis in these mice. We also report that, in addition to decreased HDL, LCAT deficiency reduces the plasma levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins by up-regulating LDL receptor gene expression. Despite the low plasma HDL levels, these changes in the plasma lipid profile lead to markedly reduced aortic atherosclerosis in mice with LCAT deficiency. These combined findings provide important new insights into the role that LCAT plays in the development of glomerulosclerosis and atherosclerosis in LCAT-deficient states.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have investigated potential mechanisms leading to renal disease and altered atherogenic risk in LCAT-KO and LCAT-KO mice crossed with atherosclerosis-susceptible mouse models. LCAT-KO mice present with a clinical phenotype similar to patients with FLD, including normochromic normocytic anemia, glomerulosclerosis, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, LCAT deficiency alters the plasma levels of the pro-atherogenic apoB containing lipoproteins by modulating the hepatic expression of the LDLr and apoE, which, despite decreased HDL levels, leads to reduced atherogenic risk.LCAT deficiency in mice markedly reduces total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and apoA-I levels as well as increases pre-β HDL and triglyceride levels (31Sakai N.

FEBS Lett. 1972; 24: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), appear to be bilayer vesicles with diameters of 30–70 nm (47Lynn E.G. Choy P.C. Magil A. O K. Mol.

These particles also accumulate in FLD patients as a result of the high plasma concentrations of free cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine observed in LCAT deficiency (47Lynn E.G. Choy P.C. Magil A.

Corneal opacities are found in several syndromes associated with HDL deficiency including Tangier disease (58Chu F.C. Kuwabara T. Cogan D.G. Schaefer E.J. Brewer Jr., H.B. Arch. Ophthal. 1979; 97: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), apoA-I deficiency (59Funke H. von Eckardstein A. Pritchard P.H. Karas M. Albers J.J. Assmann G. Reckwerth A. Welp S. J. Clin.

However, analysis of the cornea of LCAT-KO mice with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, or oil red-O failed to reveal similar changes.LCAT-KO mice developed anemia characterized by normochromic normocytic indices, increased target cells, and reticulocyte count findings consulted with hemolysis. The mild hemolytic anemia appears to be secondary to altered red blood cell membrane lipids resulting from changes in plasma cholesterol metabolism. The red blood cell membrane fragility was decreased in LCAT-KO compared with controls, consistent with altered red blood cell membrane lipids as well as an increased proportion of target cells that are more resistant to hemolysis (62Gjone E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1974; 137: 73-82PubMed Google Scholar).We further examined the consequences of LCAT deficiency on the morphology and function of the kidneys from mice maintained either on regular or HF/HC diets. Glomerulosclerosis was not detected in LCAT-KO mice on a regular chow diet. In contrast, on the HF/HC diet, a subset of LCAT-KO mice developed renal lesions similar to those previously described in patients with FLD (19Myhre E. Gjone E. Flatmark A. Hovig T. Nephron. 1977; 18: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Borysiewicz L.K. Soutar A.K. Evans D.J. Thompson G.R. Rees A.J. Q. J.

Pathol. 1991; 4: 331-335PubMed Google Scholar). Histologically, these lesions were characterized by significant reductions in the vascular space, expanded mesangial region with increased number of mesangial cells and mesangial sclerosis, and increased extracellular matrix with accumulation of lipid droplets and macrophages. Filipin and oil red-O staining demonstrated the accumulation of free cholesterol and polar lipids in the glomeruli. Ultrastructurally, the endothelial cytoplasm and the vascular spaces were smaller in LCAT-KO than in controls, and the mesangial regions contained an increased amount of extracellular matrix. Although significant, the glomerular lesions in LCAT-KO mice fall within the milder spectrum of lesions described in FLD patients. However, most of the tissue analysis has been performed in patients with end stage renal disease. The absence of lesions on a regular chow diet, and the mildness of the lesions after the HF/HC diet, in the LCAT-KO mice, are both consistent with previous observations that the C57Bl/6 mouse strain is resistant to the induction of glomerulosclerosis (66Zheng F. Striker G.E. Esposito C. Lupia E. Striker L.J. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 1999-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The plasma albumin, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels were normal in all study animals, even in LCAT-KO mice found to have renal lesions. In patients with FLD these plasma indicators of renal function remain normal until the development of severe renal disease. Proteinuria, one of the earliest findings in patients with FLD (12Santamarina-Fojo S. Hoeg J.M. Assmann G. Brewer Jr., H.B. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw Hill, New York1999Google Scholar, 13Norum K.R. Gjone E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab.

Suppl. 1974; 137: 73-82PubMed Google Scholar) was also detected in 10 of 11 LCAT-KO mice on the HF/HC diet. Thus, the renal lesions in LCAT-KO mice lead to abnormal renal function.The pathogenesis of renal injury in FLD is poorly understood. Some investigators have suggested that the renal damages observed in FLD may be immune complex- and complement-mediated (20Borysiewicz L.K. Soutar A.K. Evans D.J. Thompson G.R. Rees A.J. Q. J. Med. 1982; 51: 411-426PubMed Google Scholar, 65Lager D.J. Rosenberg B.F. Shapiro H. Bernstein J. Mod. Pathol. 1991; 4: 331-335PubMed Google Scholar) and may be further exacerbated by the accumulation of oxidized phospholipids in the glomeruli (67Jimi S. Uesugi N. Saku K. Itabe H. Zhang B. Arakawa K. Takebayashi S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 794-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that large LDL particles as well as LpX trapped in capillary loops induce endothelial damage and vascular injury in the kidneys of FLD patients (51Norum K.R. Glomset J.A. Nichols A.V. Forte T. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 54Gjone E. Blomhoff J.P. Skarbovik A.J. Clin. Chim.

However, these abnormal lipoproteins are not always detected in FLD (20Borysiewicz L.K. Soutar A.K. Evans D.J. Thompson G.R. Rees A.J. Q. J. Med. 1982; 51: 411-426PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest that LCAT-KO mice developed glomerulosclerosis only while on the HF/HC diet, when the plasma levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins were increased. Both large LDL and LpX were present in the plasma of LCAT-KO mice only on the HF/HC diet. Furthermore, renal lesions were only detected in the group of mice that accumulated LpX. These findings provide strong support for the importance of large LDL and LpX in the development of renal disease in FLD (68O K. Ly M. Fang D.Z. Frohlich J. Choy P.C. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 173: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).In patients with LCAT deficiency the atherogenic risk is variable. The mechanisms leading to altered atherosclerosis are poorly understood. Despite low HDL, many FLD and FED patients do not appear to be at increased risk of developing premature coronary artery disease (21Kuivenhoven J.A. Pritchard H. Hill J. Frohlich J. Assmann G. Kastelein J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 191-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some patients presenting with severe coronary artery disease have been reported (22Solajic-Bozicevic N. Stavljenic-Rukavina A. Sesto M. Clin.

To investigate potential mechanisms leading to this variable atherogenic risk, we examined the consequences of LCAT deficiency on the development of atherosclerosis in LCAT-KO and LCAT-KO mice crossed with atherosclerosis-susceptible mouse models. Despite decreased HDL, LCAT-KO, LCAT-KO × apoE-KO, LCAT-KO × LDLr-KO, and LCAT-KO × CETP-Tg mice had a significant reduction in the mean aortic lesion area compared with their respective controls. Analysis of LCAT-induced changes in other plasma lipoproteins provided some insights into these unexpected findings. In addition to lowering HDL, LCAT deficiency reduced the plasma levels of the pro-atherogenic apoB containing lipoproteins by enhancing the hepatic expression of LDLr and apoE. The marked reduction in the plasma levels of the anti-atherogenic HDL may be offset by a reduction in the plasma levels of the proatherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins, thus resulting in reduced atherosclerosis despite decreased HDL.Decreased plasma LDL levels have been reported in most (12Santamarina-Fojo S.

Human Rad9 (hRad9) is the homologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad9 protein that plays a critical role in cell cycle checkpoint control. To examine the potential signaling pathway linking ATM and hRad9, we investigated the modification of hRad9 in response to DNA damage. Here we show that hRad9 protein is constitutively phosphorylated in undamaged cells and undergoes hyperphosphorylation upon treatment with ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet light (UV), and hydroxyurea (HU). Interestingly, hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 induced by IR is dependent on ATM. Ser272 of hRad9 is phosphorylated directly by ATM in vitro. Furthermore, hRad9 is phosphorylated on Ser272 in response to IR in vivo, and this modification is delayed in ATM-deficient cells. Expression of hRad9 S272A mutant protein in human lung fibroblast VA13 cells disturbs IR-induced G1/S checkpoint activation and increased cellular sensitivity to IR. Together, our results suggest that the ATM-mediated phosphorylation of hRad9 is required for IR-induced checkpoint activation.

These checkpoint controls prevent damaged DNA from being replicated or distributed into daughter cells prior to the completion of DNA repair, thus helping to maintain genomic integrity. Failure of this cell cycle surveillance mechanism can cause genomic instability that eventually leads to cancer formation in mammals (5Hartwell L. Weinert T. Kadyk L. Garvik B.

In S. pombe, the protein products of the six checkpoint rad genes (rad1 + , rad3 + , rad9 + , rad17 + , rad26 +, and hus1 +) play crucial roles in sensing changes in DNA structure. All of the six rad genes are required for checkpoint activation (for reviews, see Refs. 10Stewart E. Enoch T. Curr. Opin.

Genetic studies have placed the six checkpoint rad genes in the same signaling pathways that monitor DNA damage and stalled replication forks (13al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cells with mutations in any one of these genes are hypersensitive to both replication blocks- and DNA damage-causing agents in all cell cycle phases (14al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), suggesting that these genes are involved in all cell cycle checkpoints. Rad1 is a putative exonuclease (15Long K.E. Sunnerhagen P. Subramani S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 148: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that forms a stable protein complex with Rad9 and Hus1 (16Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K.

The finding that Rad3, but not other checkpoint Rad proteins, is required for DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Rad26 suggests that the Rad3·Rad26 complex may be the “first sensor” of DNA damage (18Edwards R.J. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Importantly, all six checkpoint Rad proteins are required for DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of two downstream checkpoint protein kinases, Cds1 and Chk1 (19Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J.

To date, two related mammalian kinases, ATM1 (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related) have been shown to share structural and functional similarities with Rad3 in S. pombe(21Bentley N.J.

ATM was identified as the gene mutated in the ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) patients (38Savitsky K. Sfez S. Tagle D.A. Ziv Y. Sartiel A. Collins F.S. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. Hum. Mol.

They are defective in multiple cell cycle checkpoints, including G1/S, S, and G2/M.

ATM, ATR, and Rad3 are members of a Ser/Thr kinase family that contains a serine/threonine kinase domain closely related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase at the carboxyl termini. ATM acts upstream of Chk2 (43Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), the human homologue of Cds1 in S. pombe. ATR operates upstream of Chk1 in response to UV (44Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J.

In mammalian cells, Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate Cdc25 phosphatase, resulting in the nuclear export of Cdc25 and inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity (1Dasika G.K. Lin S.C. Zhao S. Sung P. Tomkinson A.

Taken together, these studies highlight the evolutionary conservation of the checkpoint signaling pathways.In addition to the genes described, ATM-mediated signaling pathways involve tumor suppressor genes such as p53,BRCA1, and NBS1 (49Banin S.

Molecular details of how ATM regulates these tumor suppressors have been described, but whether ATM regulates human checkpoint Rad proteins is unknown. Here, we investigate the regulation of hRad9 by phosphorylation. We demonstrate that ATM-mediated phosphorylation of hRad9 is critical for ionizing radiation-induced checkpoint activation.DISCUSSIONHere we demonstrated that the anomalous molecular mass of endogenous hRad9 is due to basal phosphorylation. This basal phosphorylation is likely to occur at multiple sites, since the 60-kDa form of hRad9 could be converted to 45 or 55 kDa molecular mass, depending on the amounts of phosphatase used in CIAP treatment. While the functional significance of the extensive phosphorylation of hRad9 is unknown, it is plausible that the basal phosphorylation of hRad9 is either required for its interaction with hHus1 and/or hRad1 to form a stable complex. Alternatively, phosphorylation may be required for the stabilization of hRad9 within the cell (31Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).Several observations described here lead to our conclusion that ATM phosphorylates Ser272 of hRad9 in response to IR. First, ATM specifically phosphorylated Ser272 in vitro, but not other serines around it. Second, IR-induced hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 is diminished in A-T cells, and hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 is restored by the re-introduction of ATM cDNA into A-T cells. Third, IR-induced phosphorylation of hRad9 on Ser272 was detected in vivo, and ATM-deficient cells had delayed phosphorylation of Ser272. Fourth, transient expression of hRad9S272A resulted in the defective G1/S checkpoint activation upon DNA damage and increased cellular sensitivity to IR, suggesting that the hRad9S272A mutant may act in a dominant-negative manner. The finding that hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 in response to IR is ATM-dependent is consistent with the observation in yeast species that DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of DDC1 or Rad9 is dependent on MEC1 or Rad3, respectively (8O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 61Longhese M.P. Paciotti V. Fraschini R. Zaccarini R. Plevani P. Lucchini G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5216-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). While we demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser272 of hRad9 is required for activation of the DNA damage-induced G1/S phase checkpoint, the mechanism by which hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 activates downstream effectors remains to be investigated.Hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 was also observed upon UV and HU treatment. It is likely that ATR mediates the UV- and HU-induced hyperphosphorylation of hRad9. In this regard, we found that ATR did phosphorylate full-length hRad9 and NH2-terminal (amino acids 1–223) and COOH-terminal (amino acids 224–391) hRad9 in vitro (Fig. 5 E and data not shown). Interestingly, Ser272 was not a favorable substrate site for ATR in vitro, suggesting that there may be unique phosphorylation sites for ATM and ATR in the hRad9 protein. Studies using oriented peptide libraries in the kinase assay have shown that some sequences are preferentially phosphorylated by one kinase but not by the other (63Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Interestingly, delayed phosphorylation is also seen in p53 and NBS1 in A-T cells (55Zhao S. Weng Y.C. Yuan S.S. Lin Y.T. Hsu H.C. Lin S.C. Gerbino E. Song M.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. Gatti R.A. Shay J.W.

Using α-phosphopeptide antibodies, we showed that Ser272 of hRad9 was phosphorylated in vivoupon DNA damage (Fig. 6). IR-induced phosphorylation of Ser272 was delayed in ATM-deficient cells, suggesting that ATR or another kinase may phosphorylate Ser272 of hRad9 in the absence of ATM. Recent studies showed that Hus1-deficient mouse cells are sensitive to UV but not IR, while C. elegans mrt2mutants (S. pombe rad1 + homologue) are sensitive to IR but less sensitive to UV (36Weiss R.S. Enoch T. Leder P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1886-1898PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gartner A. Milstein S. Ahmed S. Hodgkin J. Hengartner M.O. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), suggesting that members of the checkpoint Rad complex may be selectively activated by a specific type of DNA damage. In addition, our results on hRad9, together with other's results on p53, also indicate that different sites of the same protein could be targeted by different upstream kinases in response to DNA damage or stalled DNA replication forks (68Caspari T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R315-R317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 69Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W.

Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, multiple levels of regulation may provide fine tuning of cellular responses to different DNA structure changes.Although hRad9 is a direct substrate of ATM in vitro andin vivo, we were unable to show interaction between ATM and hRad9 by co-immunoprecipitation. The absence of this evidence may reflect a transient interaction or inefficient co-immunoprecipitaiton due to the presence of large protein complexes. The requirement of all other checkpoint Rad proteins for DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of DDC1/Rad9 (72Paciotti V. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Longhese M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4199-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) 2A. Carr, personal communication. suggests that the Rad protein complexes, not the DDC1/Rad9 itself, are likely to be required for the interaction between MEC1/Rad3 and DDC1/Rad9 in yeast species. Interestingly, in our 32P labeling experiment (Fig. 2 A) and GST-hRad9 pull-down assay (data not shown), additional proteins were readily detectable, suggesting that hRad9 is likely to be present in multiple protein complexes.DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of hRad9 appears to be normal in NBS cells. There are two plausible explanations. Human Rad9 may operate upstream of NBS1, alternatively, hRad9 may function separately from NBS1 (Fig. 8). The checkpoint Rad proteins are hypothesized to play the roles of sensors in recognizing DNA structure changes (9Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1267-1274PubMed Google Scholar). Other events, including DNA repair, transcription, and apoptosis, are likely downstream cellular processes following the binding of these sensors to damaged DNA (73Aboussekhra A. Vialard J.E. Morrison D.E. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Cernakova L. Fabre F. Lowndes N.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3912-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 74Kiser G.L. Weinert T.A. Mol. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 4393-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). If this is true, it is most likely that hRad9 acts upstream of NBS1. Further studies will be required to clarify the relationship between Rad9 and NBS1.Our studies provide the first demonstration that the mere presence of the hRad9 protein may not be sufficient to activate checkpoint controls. Instead, phosphorylation of Ser272 of hRad9per se is required to activate the cellular response to IR. Given that the main functions of the six checkpoint Rad proteins are conserved among yeast and mammals, we anticipate that human checkpoint Rad proteins, including ATM, hRad1, hRad9, hHus1, hRad17, and ATR, may form a multiprotein sensor detecting and processing aberrant DNA structures or stalled replication forks (Fig. 8). The integrity and the tight coordination among these checkpoint Rad proteins underlie their roles in maintaining genomic stability and in preventing cancer development. In eukaryotic cells, DNA damage and stalled DNA replication forks activate evolutionarily conserved checkpoint pathways, resulting in a delay in cell cycle progression, initiation of DNA repair process, and transcriptional regulation of specific genes (for reviews, see Refs.1Dasika G.K. Lin S.C. Zhao S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Lee E.Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7883-7899Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 2Elledge S.J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These checkpoint controls prevent damaged DNA from being replicated or distributed into daughter cells prior to the completion of DNA repair, thus helping to maintain genomic integrity. Failure of this cell cycle surveillance mechanism can cause genomic instability that eventually leads to cancer formation in mammals (5Hartwell L. Weinert T. Kadyk L. Garvik B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 6Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar). The DNA damage checkpoint pathways are conserved amongSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals (7Venclovas C. Thelen M.P.

In S. pombe, the protein products of the six checkpoint rad genes (rad1 + , rad3 + , rad9 + , rad17 + , rad26 +, and hus1 +) play crucial roles in sensing changes in DNA structure. All of the six rad genes are required for checkpoint activation (for reviews, see Refs. 10Stewart E. Enoch T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Rhind N. Russell P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Caspari T. Carr A.M. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have placed the six checkpoint rad genes in the same signaling pathways that monitor DNA damage and stalled replication forks (13al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cells with mutations in any one of these genes are hypersensitive to both replication blocks- and DNA damage-causing agents in all cell cycle phases (14al-Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Lehmann A.R. Carr A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), suggesting that these genes are involved in all cell cycle checkpoints. Rad1 is a putative exonuclease (15Long K.E. Sunnerhagen P. Subramani S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 148: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that forms a stable protein complex with Rad9 and Hus1 (16Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Rad17 transiently interacts with the Rad1·Rad9·Hus1 complex (16Caspari T.

Microbiology. 1998; 144: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). There is a stable interaction between Rad3 and Rad26 (18Edwards R.J. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The finding that Rad3, but not other checkpoint Rad proteins, is required for DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Rad26 suggests that the Rad3·Rad26 complex may be the “first sensor” of DNA damage (18Edwards R.J. Bentley N.J. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Importantly, all six checkpoint Rad proteins are required for DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of two downstream checkpoint protein kinases, Cds1 and Chk1 (19Lindsay H.D. Griffiths D.J.

Overexpressed ACK1 perturbs clathrin distribution, an activity dependent on the presence of C-terminal “adaptor” sequences that are also present in the related nonkinase gene 33. ACK1 interacts with the adaptor Nck via SH3 interactions but does not form a trimeric complex with p21-activated serine/threonine kinase, which also binds Nck. Stable low level expression of green fluorescent protein-ACK1 in NIH 3T3 cells has been used to localize ACK1 to clathrin-containing vesicles.

Recently Cdc42 has been found to associate with the γ-subunit of the coatomer complex; it is hypothesized that Cdc42 may compete with cargo receptors for binding to the coatomer protein γ-COP subunit and facilitate the release of coatomer subunits from transport vesicles (7Wu W.J.

The structure of Cdc42 complexed to the p21 binding domain of ACK indicates that hydrophobic residues in the “effector loop” and also the C-terminal region of Cdc42 are important in determining the specificity of effector binding (14Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Manser E. Lim L. Laue E.D. Nature. 1999; 399: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The ACK-2 tyrosine kinase (a smaller spliced variant of ACK1) becomes tyrosine phosphorylated upon stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and bradykinin (15Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recently a Caenorhabditis eleganshomolog termed ARK-1, which also contains a CRIB domain, has been reported to act as a negative regulator of EGF signaling downstream of let23 (16Hopper N.A. Lee J. Sternberg P.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we report that a region of ACK1 specifically associates with the N-terminal globular region of clathrin heavy chain in vitro. This region has homology to sequences in β-arrestin, which provides a link between clathrin and various serpentine receptors (17Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Clathrin is the major structural component of clathrin-coated vesicles,and clathrin-mediated endocytosis plays a particularly important role in receptor internalization and export of components out of thetrans-Golgi network. ACK1 is found here to co-localize with a subset of brefeldin A-insensitive clathrin vesicles, and moderate overexpression of GFP-ACK1 results in stimulation of transferrin uptake, indicating that the kinase can participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis. The pXJ-HA or pXJ-FLAG and pXJ-GFP vectors containing the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter and encoding the Kozak initiation and N-terminal HA or FLAG epitopes were as described previously (9Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). GST-Nck and FLAG-Nck vectors contained the full-length human cDNA. HA-ACK was constructed by introducing a BamHI site adjacent to the initiation codon and an HindIII site flanking the termination codon of ACK1 by polymerase chain reaction (using Vent polymerase, New England Biolabs). The entire coding sequence was cloned into the pXJ-HA vector via these unique sites. The kinase-inactive ACK1K158Rmutant was generated using the QuickChange protocol (Stratagene). ACK1 deletion (see Fig. 1 A) and point mutants (see Fig.4 C) were constructed with BamHI- andEcoRI-containing primers by polymerase chain reaction and were cloned into pGEX vector for protein expression. The ACK1 C-terminal constructs were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using BamHI and HindIII site linkers and were cloned into pXJ-FLAG vectors for cell transfection. In Fig.4 B human ACK1, rat arrestin-3, and human selenium-binding protein (SBP) 56 sequences were cloned by annealing primers with aBamHI site and EcoRI site overhang and cloned into pGEX 2T. The sequences correspond to: ACK 19-mer (564), ACK 22-mer (561), SBP56 19-mer (437), SBP56 24-mer (432), arrestin-3 19-mer (367), arrestin-3 26-mer (360).Figure 4Residues required for efficient clathrin binding. Panel A, sequence comparison of the core clathrin binding sequences derived from ACK, rat arrestin-3, human selenium-binding protein (SBP56), amphiphysin-2, the AP-3 subunit β3A, yeast Ent1p, and rat epsin 1. The two putative clathrin binding sequences in Drosophila ACK and C. elegans ARK-1 are shown below. Panel B, various GST-ACK, GST-SBP56, or GST-arrestin-3-derived peptides were expressed, immobilized on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column, and tested for clathrin binding as for Fig. 1. Proteins were separated on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, Coomassie stained (upper frame), and probed with anti-clathrin monoclonal antibody (lower frame). Exposures shown were for 1 min. The constructs correspond to residues of human sequences (in parentheses): ACK1 19-mer (564), ACK1 22-mer (561), SBP56 19-mer (437), SBP56 24-mer (432), arrestin-3 19-mer (367), and arrestin-3 26-mer (360). Panel C, GST-ACK564–582 containing single point substitutions as indicated above each lane were analyzed for clathrin binding as for Fig. 1 using anti-clathrin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) COS-7, NIH 3T3, and A431 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection studies cells were plated at low density on glass chamber slides (Nunc) for 1–2 days. The cells were starved for 1 h and then transfected by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 0.5 μg of each plasmid and 3 μl of LipofectAMINE/ml of medium. After an overnight period in 1% fetal bovine serum cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C, washed, and fixed for indirect immunofluorescence. Cell staining was performed as described previously (8Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X-Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were incubated in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 37 °C at the following dilutions: anti-HA (Santa Cruz) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used at 2.5 μg/ml and anti-clathrin (ICN) or anti-adaptin (Transduction Laboratories) monoclonal antibody at a 1:20 dilution. The cells were then washed twice with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with secondary antibody in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibodies at 1:100 dilutions and rhodamine-conjugated second antibodies (Boehringer Manneheim) at 1:100 were used at room temperature. Photomicrographs were collected on an Zeiss Axioplan microscope using a × 63 oil immersion objective. Digitized data (8-bit) were subject to analysis performed using the Macintosh version of the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U. S. National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified as described (9Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Rat brain lysates were prepared in buffer A (40 mm HEPES pH 7.3, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 5% glycerol, 5 mm (dithiothrietol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). GST-ACK fusion proteins were loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (50 ml, final 2 mg/ml), and rat brain lysates (2 mg of protein in 0.5 ml) were cycled through these columns over 2 h at 4 °C. Columns were washed extensively and bound proteins released by 10 mm glutathione. Crude coated vesicles were partially purified from rat brain according to method by Kirchhausen and Harrison (19Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1725-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In vitro translated clathrin was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reticulolysates containing in vitro translated [35S]Met N-terminal clathrin was incubated with β-arrestin bound to glutathione-Sepharose in the presence of either ACK peptides (19-mer), pep-1 (normal), or pep-2 (reverse sequence). Bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione. 2.5 ml of GST-ACK lysate was loaded onto 100-μl glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns, washed with GST buffer, and incubated with 0.25 ml of cytosol for 2 h. The column was washed with GST buffer and then with 1 column volume of solution D (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmCaCl2). 1 volume of subtilisin (2 μg/ml) in solution D was added for 30 min at room temperature. 1 column volume of solution D was defined as flow-through. Bound proteins were then eluted with glutathione (referred to as bound fraction). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, blocked in 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Mouse anti-clathrin (Transduction Laboratories) was used at a 1:500 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% milk. After washing, incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO) was performed for 1 h. Signals were visualized in the presence of luminol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The ACK1 cDNA was isolated from a human hippocampal expression library by screening with [γ32P]GTP·Cdc42 (9Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A related human kinase is TNK1 (20Hoehn G.T. Stokland T. Amin S. Ramirez M. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Small D. Civin C.I. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 903-913PubMed Google Scholar), which exhibits homology in the tyrosine kinase domain, the flanking SH3 domain, and in a region at the extreme C terminus of the two proteins (Fig.1 A). A bovine brain cDNA encoding a related ACK isoform referred to as ACK2 which lacks C-terminal regions has been isolated (15Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly the “gene 33” protein binds Cdc42 through an ACK-related CRIB domain and contains extensive homology to C-terminal regions also (21Fiorentino L. Pertica C. Fiorini M. Talora C. Crescenzi M. Castellani L. Alema S. Benedetti F. Segatto O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7735-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To search for interacting partners of ACK, a stable GST-ACK443–646fusion protein (Fig. 1 A, construct 1) was expressed and used as an affinity matrix with rat brain lysate. An ∼160-kDa protein that bound to GST-ACK443–646, but not GST, was determined to be clathrin heavy chain by peptide microsequencing of the excised band. Deletion analysis allowed us to map a minimal region required for clathrin association (Fig. 1 A). The p21 binding domain (CRIB) was not required for clathrin association. A 32-residue construct (ACK561–593) was sufficient for clathrin binding, albeit with reduced efficiency. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves multiprotein components that comprise the clathrin coat; accessory components include dynamin, amphiphysin, adaptors, and AP-180. We did not detect other purified proteins by Coomassie staining, nor were the coated vesicle proteins AP-180 and α-adaptin enriched in the ACK-bound fraction (Fig.1 B). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged ACK and stained for endogenous clathrin. Clathrin typically shows punctate vesicular and perinuclear staining in all cell types, reflecting its involvement in a variety of membrane trafficking pathways (Fig.2 A, top left frame). Transient (higher level) ACK1 expression caused redistribution of clathrin that co-localized with ACK1 (Fig.2 A, top right panel). By contrast the distribution of actin was unaffected by ACK1 expression (data not shown). Various regions of ACK1 were then tested for their ability to induce this alteration in clathrin distribution (as summarized in Fig.2 C). The N-terminal kinase/SH3 domains (1) did not exhibit such an effect (not shown), whereas the C-terminal half of ACK1 (middle frames) induced clathrin redistribution to the same extent as the full-length protein. A minimal clathrin binding domain ACK1561–593 did not induce aggregation but did disrupt the normal perinuclear distribution of clathrin (not shown). Thus, clathrin redistribution (clustering) may require ACK1 C-terminal sequences to form multivalent interactions with other proteins. This redistribution of clathrin was reflected in the loss of receptor-mediated endocytotic function as assayed by transferrin uptake in A431 cells (Fig.2 B). Similarly, ACK1514–1037 containing sequences C-terminal to the p21 binding domain inhibited transferrin uptake into transfected cells. However, smaller ACK constructs (compare ACK514–927) apparently induced clathrin aggregation while having little effect on transferrin uptake as summarized in Fig.2 C. The tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK2 in response to integrin (15Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and of ACK1 in response to melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteogylcan has been noted (22Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Simpson M.A. Keely P.J. Guan J.-L. Tachibana K. Lim L. Manser E. Furcht L.T. Iida J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 507-513Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar), where the kinase is linked to these pathways via p130Cas (22Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Simpson M.A. Keely P.J. Guan J.-L. Tachibana K. Lim L. Manser E. Furcht L.T. Iida J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 507-513Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This important adaptor is known to provide docking sites for other key SH2-containing partners including Nck and Src (23Sclaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A striking feature of ACK is the presence of multiple proline-rich motifs in the C-terminal half with substantial similarity to the gene 33 protein, being potential binding sites for SH3 or WW domain-containing proteins. The adaptor Nck (containing three SH3 domains and one SH2 domain) was tested for an association with ACK1. This interaction has recently been documented betweenDrosophila DACK and Dock, the fly Nck homolog (24Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The striking segregation of ACK1 and clathrin in cultured cells (Fig. 2) allows in vivo association to be tested by co-localization. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the distribution of Nck was shifted dramatically by co-expression of ACK1, indicating an association of the proteins through SH3 rather than SH2 domains. This was confirmed by blot overlay (18Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) using the Nck SH3 domains as a probe (data not shown). Consistent with this, α-PAKK298A (the catalytic inactive form that binds most tightly to the second SH3 domain of Nck) did not segregate with ACK1 complexes present in the cell (Fig. 3 A). Most likely a trimeric ACK·Nck·PAK complex is not seen because the second SH3 domain of Nck is involved in binding both partners. An interaction of Src SH3 with arrestin is implicated in the coupling of signals between G protein-coupled receptors and downstream pathways (25Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar), indicating that Src kinases may play a general role in down-regulation of receptors. We also detected a co-localization of ACK1 and Src (data not shown) as for Nck. From analysis of various ACK constructs, at least two proline-rich Src-SH3 interacting regions (490–646 and 705–787) were identified by overlay (Fig.3 B). Because a significant fraction of cellular Src in fibroblasts is associated with endosomes and can enhance EGF receptor internalization (26Ware M.F. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30185-30190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a cooperative role of Src with ACK1 is clearly a possible mechanism of action. β-Arrestin and arrestin-3 have been found to contain a common region that acts as a clathrin adaptor and which is not present in the visual arrestins (17Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). This region of β-arrestin has sequence similarity to part of ACK561–593 and the “clathrin box” of other proteins (Fig.4 A), including the β1, β2, and β3 adaptins, epsin, AP-180, and amphiphysins (27Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7278-7285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6479-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although only leucine is completely conserved among these binders, other candidate clathrin binders including SBP56 (29Lanfear J. Fleming J. Walker M. Harrison P. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), SH3 andankyrin repeat containing SHANK isoforms (30Lim S. Naisbitt S. Yoon J. Hwang J.I. Suh P.G. Sheng M. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29510-29518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) were identified. Interestingly, SBP56 has recently been purified as a factor that can stimulate intra-Golgi transport (31Porat A. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14457-14465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins displaying peptides corresponding to sequences from ACK1, β-arrestin, and SBP56 were generated and assessed for their clathrin binding potential (Fig. 4 B). An ACK 19-mer bound efficiently to clathrin, but the β-arrestin 19-mer or an SBP56 19-mer interacted only weakly. Although a larger β-arrestin 26-mer bound clathrin, the SBP56 24-mer contained core sequences essentially identical to those of ACK1, it interacted only weakly under these conditions. The clathrin binding of SBP56 may require flanking sequences to adopt a higher affinity binding state. The suggestion that SBP56 stimulates intra-Golgi transport (31Porat A. Sagiv Y. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14457-14465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) via a clathrin-binding protein is intriguing. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce amino acid substitutions within GST-ACK1561–593 in the core clathrin box (Fig. 4 A). Substitutions of four of the core residues prevented clathrin binding (Fig. 4 C), whereas the fifth position was unaffected by the glycine → alanine change. The hydrophobic residues within the core motif (i.e. ACK1 Leu-570, Ile-571, and Phe-573) play similarly important roles in other clathrin binders (32Wendland B. Steece K.E. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4383-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We conclude that a central motif (LIDF) corresponding to residues 575–580 is indeed essential for clathrin binding, as has been found with other adaptors (28Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6479-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Further, we were able to identify similar motifs (Fig. 4 A) inDrosophila ACK and the recently described C. elegans homolog ARK-1 (16Hopper N.A. Lee J. Sternberg P.W. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), although the C-terminal halves of these proteins are otherwise dissimilar. Clathrin forms a trimeric complex of three heavy and light chains in solution. These assemble into cage-like structures under appropriate condition with the globular head domain facing inward (19Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1725-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To confirm that ACK interacted with this head domain, clathrin immobilized on GST-ACK443–646was subjected to proteolytic digestion with subtilisin in situ, then flow-through and bound fractions were analyzed (Fig.5 A). After the ∼160-kDa clathrin heavy chain (Fig. 5 A, second lane) was fragmented by subtilisin, and the ∼50-kDa N-terminal globular “head” domain (19Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1725-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) remaining in the bound fraction (fourth lane) was detected by an anti-clathrin (N terminal) antibody. Residues within the globular clathrin N-terminal domain are involved in associating with β-arrestin (17Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Because ACK and β-arrestin probably bind to the same surface we next tested whether ACK and β-arrestin compete for clathrin binding. Synthetic peptides (19-mers) corresponding to the ACK clathrin binding sequence pep-1 and a control reverse peptide (pep-2) were synthesized. In vitrotranslated clathrin1–579 was passed through columns containing immobilized GST/β-arrestin360–385, in the presence of these peptides (Fig. 5 B). ACK pep-1 but not pep-2 (reverse sequence) could compete with β-arrestin for binding to both clathrin1–579 (head) and full-length clathrin (from the reticulolysate). The latter binds more efficiently as a consequence of its multivalent character. The high peptide concentration required for competition probably reflects the dimeric nature of the immobilized GST-arrestin360–385 and the smaller length of competitor (i.e. GST-26-merversus 19-mer competitor). Thus both ACK and β-arrestin bind to the same site on the clathrin head domain. Because transient overexpression of ACK leads to deleterious effects on the general distribution and function of clathrin, we sought to localize directly a GFP-tagged version of ACK1 protein expressed at low level in cultured cells. Antibodies raised against the conserved N-terminal region of ACK1 recognized an endogenous ACK species in COS-7 and NIH 3T3 cells that co-migrated with transfected HA-ACK1 (Fig.6 A), suggesting that this is the endogenous species not the smaller ACK2 protein. However, our antibody did not detect ACK by immunofluorescence efficiently. Therefore, a pool of NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing GFP-ACK was selected and passaged six times (∼12 divisions) to confirm viability; among this population ∼20% of the cells stained positive for anti-GFP, although the GFP fluorescence itself was barely detectable. The distribution of GFP-ACK1 in these cells (using anti-GFP antibodies) was punctate with no overall disruption to the perinuclear and vesicular clathrin localization, compared with the nonexpressing cells (Fig. 6 B). At high magnification ACK1 indeed co-localized to a subpopulation of clathrin vesicles (Fig. 6 C), although we noted that most of the vesicles showed only weak clathrin staining (marked by arrows). Thus in the merged image (right) it appears that many (green) ACK vesicles lack clathrin. Two major populations of clathrin-containing vesicles termed AP-1 and and AP-2 complexes are well characterized. AP-1-containing vesicles, which are marked by γ-adaptin, are thought to be primarilytrans-Golgi originating vesicles that are sensitive to brefeldin A. As seen in Fig.7 A, brefeldin A causes loss of punctate γ-adaptin distribution but had no effect on ACK. At higher magnification it was clear that the predominantly perinuclear γ-adaptin never co-localized with GFP-ACK. By contrast there was significant co-l"

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90β promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters.

Thrombin also stimulates the expression of nuclear proteins that constitute the transcription factor AP-1, which participates in transactivation of several early growth response genes implicated in VSMC1 proliferation (9Rao G.N.

These observations suggest that G protein-coupled receptors may utilize cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases such as Janus kinases (JAKs) and Src kinases to initiate mitogenesis. In fact, both JAK and Src kinases play important roles in VSMC proliferation induced by Ang II (10Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol.

JAKs are 1 of 11 mammalian nonreceptor tyrosine kinase families that were initially identified as essential mediators of cellular signaling induced by the interaction of cytokines with their cognate receptors (16Aringer M.

There are four members of the JAK family, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Targeted gene disruption studies in mice demonstrate that JAKs are essential for cytokine-induced signaling (17Parganas E.

In interactions of cytokines with their cognate receptors, receptor dimerization induced by ligand binding to cell surface receptors leads to the activation of one or more of the JAK family of kinases associated with the transmembrane receptor. This, in turn, leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the receptor cytoplasmic domains, which provide docking sites for signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and other proteins that contain phosphotyrosine-binding motifs (19Hilton D.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). STATs, upon phosphorylation by JAKs on tyrosine residues, undergo homo- or heterodimerization with other STAT family members and migrate to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, STAT dimers bind to target genes to enhance transcription (20Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT proteins undergo serine phosphorylation in a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase)-dependent manner. In fact, both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins is necessary for maximal activation of transcription (22Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Heat shock proteins (Hsps), initially identified by their enhanced synthesis in cells exposed to elevated temperatures, have been subsequently shown to accumulate in response to various stresses including cardiac hypertrophy, ischemic preconditioning, oxidative stress, and aging (27Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Expressed constitutively, Hsps function as molecular chaperones under physiologic conditions. During stress, Hsps prevent protein aggregation, either through refolding of denatured proteins or by promoting their degradation through a proteolytic pathway (28Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3591) Google Scholar). Induction of Hsps on exposure to a stressor confers protection against exposure to a subsequent stressor in various cell types (29Lowenstein D.H. Chan P.H. Miles M.F.

Because thrombin-activated PAR-1 requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the effect of thrombin on the activation of members of the JAK family and their substrates, STATs. We show that thrombin causes activation of JAK2 and tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1, -2, and -3. We also demonstrate that inhibition of JAK2 activity attenuates thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation. Furthermore, our results show that thrombin induces Hsp70 and Hsp90 expression in VSMC via activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Thus, the JAK-STAT pathway may be an important physiologic mediator of thrombin-induced events in VSMC. Thrombin and AG-490 were purchased from Calbiochem. H9C2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.

All experiments were conducted using VSMC between passage numbers 7 and 20 that were growth-arrested by incubation in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 72 h. VSMC, grown to ∼70% confluence in 60-mm dishes, were quiesced by incubating in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 72 h. Quiesced VSMC were exposed to 1.0 unit/ml thrombin for 24 h after pretreatment with a JAK2-specific inhibitor, AG-490, for 16 h. Cells were labeled with [methyl-3H]thymidine for 4 h, and its incorporation into DNA was measured as described previously (9Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R. Wu Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol.

VSMC were plated in 60-mm dishes at an initial concentration of 3,500 cells/cm2 and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Cells were growth-arrested by incubating in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 48 h and then either left untreated or exposed to AG-490 for 16 h before treatment with 1.0 unit/ml thrombin for 48 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and diluted with isotonic solution, and the increase in cell number was directly measured with a Coulter counter (model ZM, Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with 1.0 unit/ml thrombin in the presence and absence of AG-490 for the specified times at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (9Rao G.N.

For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins were incubated with appropriate antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The antibody-protein complexes were incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B/protein A/G plus agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and antibody-protein complexes bound to the beads were pelleted at 2,000 × g for 2 min. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. ERK2 activity assay and Western blotting were performed as described previously (9Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R. Wu Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from growth-arrested VSMC that were either treated or untreated with thrombin (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). DNA binding was performed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein in a total volume of 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 4% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 100,000 cpm of32P-labeled double-stranded Hsp70 (−122GATCCGGCGAAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCCGACCT−90) or Hsp90 (−643GCCTGGAAACTGCTGGAAAT−623) oligonucleotide for 20 min at room temperature.

For identifying bands containing specific STAT proteins, the samples were incubated with STAT1 or STAT3 antibody for 30 min before the DNA-binding reaction was performed. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel, and the dried gel was exposed to X-Omat AR x-ray film with intensifying screen at −70 °C·.

The 5′ Hsp90β CAT reporter constructs A (−1044 to +36) and C (−299 to +36) were kindly provided by David Latchman (University College London, London, UK). For transfection, VSMC were grown to 70–80% confluence in 100-mm dishes containing DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of VSMC with Hsp90β CAT reporter and ΔJAK2 plasmid DNA was performed by the calcium precipitate method (9Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R. Wu Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol.

Cells were cotransfected with β-galactosidase expression vector to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cells were quiesced with DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum 16 h after transfection. After being quiescent for 36 h, cells were either untreated or treated with thrombin for 6 h. In experiments with AG-490, cells were treated with the inhibitor for 16 h before thrombin treatment. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (9Rao G.N. Katki K.A. Madamanchi N.R. Wu Y. Birrer M.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μg of protein was incubated with 4 μl of 40 mm acetyl-CoA and 4 μl of 50 μCi/ml [C14]chloramphenicol in a total volume of 150 μl at 37 °C for 2–4 h. Acetylated and nonacetylated chloramphenicol were extracted with ethyl acetate and separated by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 1B plates using chloroform/methanol mixture (19:1) as solvent. Air-dried silica plates were subjected to autoradiography, and the acetylated [C14]chloramphenicol was quantified using an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). β-Galactosidase assay was performed following manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Differences were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance, and post-hoc analysis was performed using Student-Newman-Keuls method. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To understand the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in thrombin-induced VSMC mitogenesis, we have investigated the effect of thrombin on the JAK-STAT pathway. Initially, growth-arrested rat VSMC were treated with 1.0 unit/ml thrombin in the presence and absence of AG-490, a specific inhibitor of JAK2. As shown in Fig.1 A, thrombin induced a 4.6-fold increase in DNA synthesis as measured by thymidine uptake after 24 h, an effect that was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by AG-490 (p < 0.05). AG-490 per se had no significant effect on DNA synthesis even at a concentration of 50 μm. Measuring its effect on cell counts corroborated the inhibitory effect of AG-490 on thrombin-induced DNA synthesis. AG-490 significantly inhibited the thrombin-induced increase in VSMC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B,p < 0.05). AG-490 alone had no significant effect on VSMC proliferation, indicating that it is not cytotoxic at the concentrations used in this experiment. AG-490 also significantly inhibited PAR-1-derived agonist peptide (SFLLRNP)-induced VSMC DNA synthesis (not shown) suggesting that the effects of thrombin-induced JAK2 activation are mediated via PAR-1 activation. The effect of AG-490 on thrombin-induced VSMC proliferation is similar to its effect on VSMC growth induced by Ang II, another G protein-coupled receptor agonist (10Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24684-24690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These results suggest that JAK2 plays a role in VSMC proliferation induced by the activation of G protein-coupled receptors and led us to test the activation of specific members of the JAK-STAT pathway in response to thrombin stimulation. To assess the contributions of the different JAK kinases to thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, we immunoprecipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins after thrombin stimulation and probed for the presence of phosphorylated JAK proteins (Fig.2). By using an anti-JAK1 antibody, we found that JAK1 was transiently phosphorylated at 15 min after stimulation with thrombin (Fig. 2). In contrast, we observed a biphasic increase in JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment with thrombin (Fig. 2). This was confirmed by Western blot analysis of thrombin-stimulated cell lysates with a phospho-specific JAK2 antibody (Fig. 3 A), which demonstrated maximal stimulation of JAK2 at 1 min (8.7 ± 4.0-fold increase) (Fig. 3 B). Finally, we also measured thrombin-induced TYK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2). In contrast to the rapid activation of JAK2, peak activation of TYK2 was observed after 15 min of exposure to thrombin. These results were corroborated by additional experiments in which thrombin-stimulated VSMC lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-TYK2 antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 3 C). TYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation was maximum (5.0 ± 1.0-fold increase) at 15 min after thrombin stimulation (Fig. 3 D). JAK3 protein was not observed in VSMC lysates, which is consistent with reports that the expression of this protein is confined to lymphoid and myeloid cells (39Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A.

The differences in the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of various JAKs suggest that they may participate in different stress-mediated events in VSMC.Figure 3Rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and delayed activation of TYK2 in VSMC treated with thrombin.Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with 1.0 unit/ml thrombin for the indicated times and harvested in lysis buffer.

D, densitometric analysis of TYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (mean ± S.D., n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and TYK2 in response to thrombin treatment was not due to an increase in the levels of these protein as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 3, A andC), indicating that thrombin altered tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs without affecting steady-state protein levels. Similar to the observation of Abe and Berk (41Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21003-21010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), pretreatment of VSMC with 50 μm AG-490 for 16 h completely inhibited thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2, whereas it had no effect on c-Src, a non-JAK cytosolic tyrosine kinase (not shown). Because JAK2 phosphorylation was most pronounced following treatment with thrombin and inhibition of the JAK2 phosphorylation with AG-490 blocked thrombin-induced proliferation of VSMC, we chose to investigate further the role of JAK2 in thrombin-induced mitogenesis. To determine whether thrombin-induced JAK2 activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins, the JAK substrates, we measured tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of these proteins. First, thrombin-treated VSMC lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the Western blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies against STAT1α/β, STAT2, or STAT3. All three STAT proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to thrombin treatment. STAT1α was rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated within 1 min, an effect that was sustained for 60 min (Fig.4 A). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1β in response to treatment with thrombin was much less pronounced than that of STAT1α. To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins in response to treatment with thrombin was accompanied by translocation into the nucleus, Western blot analyses of nuclear and cytosolic fractions of thrombin-treated VSMC were performed (Fig. 4 B). Thrombin induced nuclear translocation of STAT1 in 5 min (3.03 ± 0.25-fold increase), an increase that was sustained for 60 min (Fig. 4 C), whereas no discernible change was observed in the protein levels in cytosolic fractions (Fig. 4 D). Immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting experiments revealed an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 within 1 min in response to treatment with thrombin that was sustained throughout the 60-min treatment period (Fig. 4, D and E). As with STAT1, STAT3 also rapidly translocated to the nucleus following treatment with thrombin, whereas the levels of this protein in cytosolic fractions were similar to control values (Fig. 4 F). Peak nuclear translocation of STAT3 protein was observed at 10 min after treatment with thrombin (6.63 ± 1.52-fold increase) (Fig. 4 G). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT2 was also observed in VSMC treated with 1.0 unit/ml thrombin (not shown). These experiments demonstrate that thrombin causes tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT proteins in VSMC. Inhibition of JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation by pretreatment of VSMC with 50 μm AG-490 for 16 h blocked tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 (not shown), indicating that JAK2 kinase activity is required for phosphorylation of these proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2043761487,"Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle requires phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) by the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, whose activity can specifically be blocked by the CDK inhibitor p16INK4A. Misregulation of the pRb/cyclin D/p16INK4A pathway is one of the most common events in human cancer and has lead to the suggestion that inhibition of cyclin D-dependent kinase activity may have therapeutic value as an anticancer treatment. Through screening of a chemical library, we initially identified the [2,3-d]pyridopyrimidines as inhibitors of CDK4. Chemical modification resulted in the identification of PD 0183812 as a potent and highly selective inhibitor of both CDK4 and CDK6 kinase activity, which is competitive with ATP. Flow cytometry experiments showed that of the cell lines tested, only those expressing pRb demonstrated a G1 arrest when treated with PD 0183812. This arrest correlated in terms of incubation time and potency with a loss of pRb phosphorylation and a block in proliferation, which was reversible. These results suggest a potential use of this chemical class of compounds as therapeutic agents in the treatment of tumors with functional pRb, possessing cell cycle aberrations in other members of the pRb/cyclin D/p16INK4A pathway. Progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle requires phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) by the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, whose activity can specifically be blocked by the CDK inhibitor p16INK4A. Misregulation of the pRb/cyclin D/p16INK4A pathway is one of the most common events in human cancer and has lead to the suggestion that inhibition of cyclin D-dependent kinase activity may have therapeutic value as an anticancer treatment. Through screening of a chemical library, we initially identified the [2,3-d]pyridopyrimidines as inhibitors of CDK4. Chemical modification resulted in the identification of PD 0183812 as a potent and highly selective inhibitor of both CDK4 and CDK6 kinase activity, which is competitive with ATP. Flow cytometry experiments showed that of the cell lines tested, only those expressing pRb demonstrated a G1 arrest when treated with PD 0183812. This arrest correlated in terms of incubation time and potency with a loss of pRb phosphorylation and a block in proliferation, which was reversible.

Full CDK activity requires association with a cyclin regulatory subunit, and it is the distinct combinations of CDK-cyclin complexes that control progression through the different phases of the cell cycle (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). During early to mid G1, when the cell is responsive to mitogenic stimuli, it is CDK4 and CDK6 in association with the D-type cyclins that control advancement through the cell cycle, by their phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein, pRb (2Kato J. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 787-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclin D-dependent kinases also act as integrators of extracellular stimuli. For example, induction of cyclin D1 transcription can be activated by the ras signaling pathway (3Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 4Gille H. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22033-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), whereas degradation of cyclin D1 protein is stimulated by the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3β, which is itself regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Wnt signaling pathways (5Diehl J.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14736-14742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The importance of the cyclin D-dependent kinases and pRb in controlling transit through G1 is further reflected by the fact this pathway is a major target of genetic alteration in cancer. This is exemplified by the RB gene itself, which is found mutated in a number of tumor types, and cyclin D1, which is overexpressed in a variety of tumors (7Sellers W.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 3301-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8Donnellan R. Chetty R. Mol. Pathol. 1998; 51: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Another major player in this pathway is the tumor suppressor gene INK4A/CDKN2Aencoding the p16INK4A protein, which specifically inhibits the kinase activity of the two cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and is found genetically altered in multiple tumor types (9Sharpless N.E. DePinho R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In a number of cases, the pattern of RB mutation appears to inversely correlate with mutations ofINK4A/CDKN2A, suggesting that a single defect of the pRb/cyclin D/p16INK4A pathway is enough for tumor development (10Hall M. Peters G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 67-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity with which this pathway appears to be misregulated in cancer has lead to the suggestion that in situations where cyclin D-dependent kinase activity may be up-regulated such as by mutation of INK4A/CDKN2A or overexpression of cyclin D1, inhibiting the kinase activity of both CDK4 and CDK6 may be an effective anticancer treatment. Evidence for the validity of such an approach has been provided in a number of ways. Reintroduction of INK4A/CDKN2A into tumor cells where this gene is defective will inhibit cell growth in culture and tumor growth in xenograft studies, whereas a peptide mimic of p16INK4A has demonstrated antiproliferative properties in a number of cell lines (11Jin X.

Interestingly, reintroduction of p16INK4A activity into tumor lines only blocks proliferation in cells where pRb is active (15Lukas J. Parry D. Aagaard L. Mann D.J. Bartkova J. Strauss M. Peters G. Bartek J. Nature. 1995; 375: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 16Medema R.H. Herrera R.E. Lam F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 kinase activity may only be a useful anticancer treatment in tumors where pRb is functional, but other members of the pathway such as p16INK4A or possibly cyclin D1 have aberrant functions. Further support for this model has come from studies using antisense cDNA technology and an antibody to block cyclin D1 function, which showed that loss of cyclin D1 action only blocks proliferation in cells with active pRb (17Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Shay J.W. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2663-2674PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lukas J. Bartkova J. Rohde M. Strauss M. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2600-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Expression of antisense cDNA has also been used to show that loss of cyclin D1 function will also block pRb phosphorylation and inhibit the growth and tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells (19Arber N. Doki Y. Han E.K. Sgambato A. Zhou P. Kim N.H. Delohery T. Klein M.G. Holt P.R. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1569-1574PubMed Google Scholar). These data provide a strong rationale for inhibition of cyclin D-dependent kinase activity as an approach to cancer chemotherapy in tumor cells where pRb is functional, but the activity of other members of the pRb/cyclin D/p16INK4A pathway has been altered. Screening efforts have recognized the [2,3-d]pyridopyrimidines as inhibitors of CDK4 (20Barvian M. Boschelli D.H. Cossrow J. Dobrusin E. Fattaey A. Fritsch A. Fry D. Harvey P. Keller P. Garrett M.

Here we describe the identification of one such compound PD 0183812 as a potent and specific inhibitor in vitro of the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 (Fig. 1). This study characterizes the biochemical properties of PD 0183812 and provides evidence that the biological effects of this compound are consistent with cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibition. CDK assays for IC50determinations and kinetic evaluation were performed in 96-well filter plates (Millipore, MADVN6550). All CDK-cyclin kinase complexes were expressed in insect cells through baculovirus infection and purified as described previously (21Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22300-22306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The substrate for the assays was a fragment (amino acids 792–928) of pRb fused to GST (GST·RB-Cterm, Ref. 22Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The total volume for each well was 0.1 ml containing a final concentration of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 25 μm ATP (for CDK4-cyclin D1, CDK6-cyclin D2, and CDK6-cyclin D3) or 12 μm ATP (for CDK2-cyclin E, CDK2-cyclin A, and CDC2-cyclin B) containing 0.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 ng of enzyme, 1 μg of GST·RB-Cterm, and appropriate dilutions of inhibitor. All components except the [γ-32P]ATP were added to the wells, and the plate was placed on a plate mixer for 2 min. The reaction was then started by adding the [γ-32P]ATP, and the plate was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the plate was kept at 4 °C for at least 1 h to allow the substrate to precipitate. The wells were then washed five times with 0.2 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and radioactive incorporation was determined with a β plate counter (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Kinase assays for PDGFr, FGFr, EGFr, SRC, and PKC kinases were performed as described previously (23Fry D.W. Nelson J.M. Slintak V. Keller P.R. Rewcastle G.W. Denny W.A. Zhou H. Bridges A.J. Biochem.

All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc). For cell counts, cells were trypsinized and counted using a Coulter Z2 particle count and size analyzer. Cells were seeded at 2 × 104 per well in a 96-well Cytostar T plate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated overnight. Varying concentrations of PD 0183812 were added to the wells and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. 0.1 μCi of [14C]thymidine was added to each well, and incorporation of the radiolabel was allowed to proceed for 48 h. Incorporated radioactivity was determined with a β plate counter. Cells were washed and harvested using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mm EDTA. Cells were then washed in PBS containing 1% FBS (1% FBS/PBS), fixed in 85% ethanol and stored at 4 °C for at least 16 h and up to 5 days before staining with propidium iodide (PI). For PI staining, cells were washed in 1% FBS/PBS prior to incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in the same solution containing 40 μg/ml PI (Molecular Probes) and 250 μg/ml RNase A (Roche Diagnostics Ltd.). Data were collected using a Coulter EPICS Elite ESP equipped with a Spectraphysics argon-ion laser and analyzed using the WinMDI program, version 2.8. Results represent a minimum of 15,000 cells assayed for each sample. Cells were trypsinized and 200 μl of each sample was counted in 19.8 ml of PBS using a Coulter Z2 particle count and size analyzer. The rest of each sample was washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 30 min, in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet per 10 ml of lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics Corp). The volume of lysis buffer used was 100 μl per 1 × 106 cells. Following lysis, samples were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 6% polyacrylamide gels (10 μl of cell lysate per gel lane) and electroblotted onto ImmobilonTM-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 containing 3% casein and then incubated in the same buffer with primary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature followed by a 1-h incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution, Bio-Rad). Immunodetection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western analysis, pRb was detected using the Rb C-terminal control antibody from Cell Signaling Technology at a dilution of 1:2000. The phosphorylation status of pRb at serine 780 was detected with the phospho-Rb (Ser-780) antibody (at a dilution of 1:4000) also from Cell Signaling Technology. We have recently identified the [2,3-d]pyridopyrimidines as inhibitors of CDK4 (20Barvian M. Boschelli D.H. Cossrow J. Dobrusin E. Fattaey A. Fritsch A. Fry D. Harvey P. Keller P. Garrett M. La F. Leopold W. McNamara D. Quin M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Toogood P. Wu Z. Zhang E. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). From this series we identified PD 0183812 as an extremely potent inhibitor of CDK4-cyclin D1 with an IC50 value of 0.008 μm (Table I). Similar IC50 values of 0.0071 and 0.013 μm were also measured for inhibition of CDK6-cyclin D2 and CDK6-cyclin D3 respectively (Table I). In contrast, the non-cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK2 and CDC2 exhibited considerably higher IC50 values for inhibition by PD 0183812 (Table I). Specifically, selectivity ratios of >500-, 26-, and 20-fold were obtained for CDC2-cyclin B, CDK2-cyclin A, and CDK2-cyclin E, respectively versus CDK4-cyclin D1. PD 0183812 had very little inhibitory activity against other protein kinases including PDGFr, FGFr, EGFr, SRC, and PKC (Table I). Kinetic analysis shows that PD 0183812 exhibited pure competitive inhibition with respect to ATP as indicated by the double reciprocal plot of ATP concentrationversus catalytic activity of CDK4-cyclin D1 (Fig.2). Thus, PD 0183812 is a potent and selective ATP competitive inhibitor of the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6.Table IPD 0183812 is a selective inhibitor of cyclin D-dependent kinasesKinasePD 0183812 (IC50)μmCDK4/D10.008CDK6/D20.0071CDK6/D30.013CDK2/E0.165CDK2/A0.2095CDC2/B>40PDGFr14FGFr8.6EGFr>50SRC22PKC>50Assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As outlined in the Introduction, the major known cellular target of the cyclin D-dependent kinases is pRb and phosphorylation of this protein is required for progression through G1. Therefore a compound that can inhibit the cellular activity of both CDK4 and CDK6 in tumor cells expressing functional pRb, but where another member of the pRb/cyclin D/p16INK4A pathway is altered would be predicted to invoke a G1arrest. In tumor cells in which pRb is not present or not functional and where the pRb/cyclin D/p16INK4A pathway is not required for G1 progression, treatment with such an inhibitor would not be expected to cause an arrest in G1. To test the ability of PD 0183812 to behave in this manner, we treated three human carcinoma cell lines that express pRb but not p16INK4A, (MDA-MB-453, breast carcinoma; H1299, lung carcinoma; U251, glioblastoma; data not shown; Refs. 26Tam S.W. Shay J.W. Pagano M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5816-5820PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kataoka M. Wiehle S. Spitz F. Schumacher G. Roth J.A. Cristiano R.J.

Shay J.W. Pagano M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5816-5820PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kubo A. Nakagawa K. Varma R.K. Conrad N.K. Cheng J.Q. Lee W.C. Testa J.R. Johnson B.E. Kaye F.J. Kelley M.J. Clin.

In all three cell lines that express pRb, a significant increase in the G1 fraction and a concomitant decrease in the S and G2/M fractions was observed when cells were treated with between 0.2 and 0.8 μm PD 0183812 (Fig.3). At higher concentrations, a significant increase in G2/M was seen in the H1299 and U251 tumor lines. No increase in G1 was noted between 0.2 and 0.8 μm for the cell lines not expressing pRb (Fig. 3). However a strong increase in G2/M starting at 0.8 μm for all three of these cell lines was noted. From these results, we conclude that in the tumor lines tested, PD 0183812 induces a pRb-specific G1 arrest indicative of cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibition. However, high concentrations of the drug cause a pRb-independent increase in G2/M. We next went on to address whether the pRb-specific G1arrest caused by PD 0183812 correlated with a block in DNA synthesis as measured by thymidine incorporation. To do this we selected the two breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468. Each cell line was exposed to varying concentrations of PD 0183812 for 24 h, at which point the amount of thymidine incorporated by all the samples over the next 48 h in the presence of PD 0183812 was measured (Fig.4). From this graph, the IC50of PD 0183812 for inhibition of DNA synthesis was calculated and found to be 0.32 μm for the MDA-MB-453 cell line, which expresses pRb, and >3.0 μm for the MDA-MB-468 cell line, which does not. For the MDA-MB-453 cell line, this is similar to the concentration range of the compound (0.2–0.8 μm), which causes a G1 arrest (Fig. 4). For the MDA-MB-468 cell line, treatment of the cells with <1.0 μm of PD 0183812 had no significant effect on DNA synthesis. Thus treatment of tumor cell lines with PD 0183812 causes a pRb-specific G1 arrest, which correlates with a block in DNA synthesis. Because we had shown that PD 0183812 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase selective inhibitor in vitroand causes a pRb-specific G1 arrest in human tumor cells, we went on to investigate whether this compound could also block thein vivo phosphorylation of pRb, the cellular substrate of the cyclin D-dependent kinases. For this experiment we again used the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-453. Cells were treated with 0.1–0.9 μm PD 0183812. Untreated cells or cells treated with the drug vehicle, Me2SO, were included as controls. Mimosine, a plant amino acid often used to synchronize cells in G1, was incorporated into the experiment as a drug that is known to cause a G1 arrest (30Lalande M. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Expression and phosphorylation of pRb was monitored by Western blot analysis using two antibodies, one for detection of pRb expression and a second for detection of phosphorylation at serine 780 of pRb (P-Ser-780Rb). Phosphorylation at serine 780 on pRb was investigated as it has been reported that CDK4 can specifically phosphorylate this sitein vitro and that serine 780 is phosphorylated in mid G1 when both CDK4 and CDK6 but not CDK2 are active (22Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 31Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar,32Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that immunoprecipitates of the transcription factor E2F1, which associates with pRb, contain no serine 780-phosphorylated pRb, indicating that phosphorylation of this site may be involved in disruption of the E2F1·pRb complex (31Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). FACS analysis was also carried out on a portion of each sample so that the level of pRb phosphorylation could be compared side by side with the fraction of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. From these studies, we found that whereas the untreated or Me2SO-treated cells possessed mainly hyperphosphorylated pRb, with strong phosphorylation at serine 780, samples treated with 0.3–0.9 μm PD 0183812 showed an increase in the G1 fraction of the cells (peaking at 0.5 μm), which correlated with loss of serine 780 phosphorylation on pRb (Fig.5). We also noted that there was no significant increase in the sub-G1 population of cells, which is often used as an indicator of apoptosis (33Ormerod M, G. Collins M, K. Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Robertson D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 153: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cells treated with mimosine showed an increase in their G1 population equivalent to treatment with 0.3 μm PD 0183812, but there was no significant loss of pRb phosphorylation. Together, these data suggest that treatment of pRb-expressing tumor cells with PD 0183812 causes a G1arrest, which coincides with loss of pRb phosphorylation at serine 780, indicating inhibition of cyclin D-dependent kinase activity. To investigate the long term effects of PD 0183812 on cell proliferation, we treated the MDA-MB-453 cell line with either Me2SO (vehicle control) or 0.5 μm PD 0183812, a concentration of the drug, which we have shown will cause a G1 block and a loss of pRb phosphorylation (Fig. 5). We then took samples for cell counts, and examination of pRb phosphorylation by Western blot at 0–5 days after drug addition. It should be noted that medium with either drug or Me2SO was only added once to the cells (on day 0) and was not replaced during the experiment. Looking at the cell counts between 1 and 5 days after treatment, it was clear that there was a significant block in cell proliferation (Fig.6 A), which correlated with loss of pRb phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). It should be noted that the control cells ceased to grow after day 4, which may have been because of their confluency and exhaustion of nutrients in the cell medium. Thus, treatment of pRb expressing tumor cells with PD 0183812 causes a cytostatic block in proliferation which is maintained for at least 5 days and correlates with a loss of pRb phosphorylation at serine 780 indicative of cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibition. The final question addressed in this study is whether the block in tumor cell proliferation induced by PD 0183812 is reversible. For this experiment the MDA-MB-453 cells were exposed to either Me2SO (vehicle control) or 0.5 μm PD 0183812 for 24 h. After 24 h (day 1) the medium was removed, and the cells were washed. Fresh medium containing Me2SO was added to the Me2SO-treated cells. Fresh medium containing 0.5 μm PD 0183812 was added to half the PD 0183812-treated cells, whereas the other half were treated with medium containing Me2SO. All medium was changed at day 3 to try and counteract nutrient exhaustion, especially where cells were proliferating for the length of the experiment. Samples were then taken for cell counts and detection by Western blot of pRb expression and phosphorylation at serine 780. It is clear from the cell counts (Fig.7 A), that PD 0183812 causes a sustained block in proliferation. This result is reflected in the Western blot data, which show that phosphorylation at serine 780 of pRb is low in the cells treated with PD 0183812 for the first 5 days of the experiment, compared with the Me2SO-treated cells (Fig.7 B). By day 6, the Me2SO-treated cells have stopped growing, and pRb phosphorylation at serine 780 is low. As in the previous experiment, this may be because of the confluency of the cells and nutrient exhaustion of the medium. If however, the compound is removed on day 1, 24 h after addition, it appears that the cells recover and resume proliferation (Fig. 7 A). It must be noted that there does appear to be a lag in resuming proliferation because cell counts on days 2–4 were still low. In comparison, the Western blot data from this experiment (Fig. 7 B) show that if the compound is removed on day 1 the amount of pRb phosphorylation on serine 780 on days 2–5 returns to the level seen for the vehicle control-treated cells. Therefore PD 0183812 causes a block in proliferation, which is reversible when the compound is removed 24 h after addition and is accompanied by a return of phosphorylation on serine 780 of pRb. Within the last 5 years, enormous progress has been made in deciphering the mechanism by which mammalian cells regulate and progress through the cell cycle. Clearly CDKs have emerged as key regulators of cell cycle progression, and in fact movement either proceeds or stops based on the catalytic activity of these enzymes. CDKs have also been some of the more intensely studied enzymes in terms of potential targets in cancer chemotherapy. The cyclin D-dependent kinases have been of special interest because of the exceptionally high percentage of tumors that exhibit abnormalities in the pRb/cyclin D/p16INK4A pathway. In particular the fact that tumors that have functional pRb often harbor an alteration in another member of this pathway, such as a defect in the cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4A, has led to the suggestion that inhibition of cyclin D-dependent kinase activity in these tumors may have therapeutic value. We therefore set out to identify inhibitors of cyclin D-dependent kinase activity by initially screening for inhibitors of CDK4. Through this effort we recognized the [2,3-d]pyridopyrimidines as inhibitors of this enzyme (20Barvian M. Boschelli D.H. Cossrow J. Dobrusin E. Fattaey A. Fritsch A. Fry D. Harvey P. Keller P. Garrett M. La F. Leopold W. McNamara D. Quin M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Toogood P. Wu Z. Zhang E. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Subsequent chemical modification lead to the identification of PD 0183812 as a compound with unprecedented potency in vitroagainst both the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. Investigation into the cellular behavior of PD 0183812 revealed that this compound gave a pRb dependent G1 cell cycle arrest. This result is indicative of cyclin D-dependent kinase inhibition, as this activity has previously been shown to be required for pRb-dependent G1 progression (15Lukas J. Parry D. Aagaard L. Mann D.J. Bartkova J. Strauss M. Peters G. Bartek J. Nature. 1995; 375: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 16Medema R.H. Herrera R.E. Lam F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The concentration of PD 0183812 required to give this pRb-specific G1 arrest (0.5 μm in MDA-MB-453 cells) also caused a loss of phosphorylation on pRb at serine 780, a site previously reported to be targeted by CDK4 for phosphorylation and correlated with its IC50 for inhibition of DNA synthesis (31Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that the cellular target of PD 0183812, which gives a pRb-specific G1 arrest in human tumor cells, is the cyclin D-dependent kinases. At higher concentrations however, PD 0183812 caused a significant increase in the G2/M population of cells in a non-pRb-dependent manner. There are a number of reasons why this may have occurred. One option is that at high concentrations, PD 0183812 may be inhibiting other kinases (including other CDKs) in the cell that are rate-limiting at G2/M but not G1. A second possibility is that a cyclin D-dependent kinase (but pRb-independent) step may be rate-limiting in G2/M at these concentrations of the drug. There is some evidence that CDK4 may play a role in the G2/M transition and so for the moment, this possibility cannot be ruled out (34Gabrielli B, G. Sarcevic B. Sinnamon J. Walker G. Castellano M. Wang X.Q. Ellem K.A.,. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13961-13969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Finally we come to the effect of PD 0183812 on cellular proliferation. From the studies presented here it is clear that one treatment of 0.5 μm PD 0183812 is sufficient to produce a G1arrest, loss of phosphorylation on pRb at serine 780, and significantly inhibit growth for at least 5 days. This is an extremely interesting result as there has been some discussion as to whether a catalytic inhibitor of CDK4 would be sufficient to arrest cycling cells (35Shapiro G.I. Harper J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1645-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). One reason for this, was the discovery that expression of p16INK4A, but not a dominant-negative form of CDK4 will cause a cell cycle arrest (36Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may be because of the fact that p16INK4A expression results in redistribution of the CDK inhibitor p27KIP1 within the cell and inhibition of CDK2 as well as CDK4 (36Jiang H. Chou H.S. Zhu L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5284-5290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With PD 0183812 we also found that removal from the cells after 24 h allowed rephosphorylation of pRb and an eventual resumption of proliferation. Thus at this stage the effects of PD 0183812 are reversible. It is interesting to note that expression of p16INK4A is associated with replicative senescence, and it will be of interest to investigate the long term effects of PD 0183812 on tumor cells (37Huschtscha L, I. Reddel R.R. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In recent years a number of CDK inhibitors have been disclosed, which have a wide variety of potencies and specificities (38Fry D.W. Garrett M.D. Curr. Opn. Oncol. Endocr. Met. Invest. Drugs. 2000; 2: 40-59Google Scholar). Many of these existing compounds such as the purines, olomoucine and roscovitine, and the non-purines, butyrolactone and kenpaullone, show considerable activity against CDK2 and CDC2, but little activity against CDK4 (39Meijer L. Kim S.H.,. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 40Zaharevitz D.W. Gussio R. Leost M. Senderowicz A.M. Lahusen T. Kunick C. Meijer L. Sausville E.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2566-2569PubMed Google Scholar). The flavone flavopiridol also known as L86-8275 will inhibit CDK4 but with a similar potency to CDK2 and CDC2, and there is building evidence that it may have other cellular targets including aldehyde dehydrogenase, glycogen phosphorylase, and duplex DNA (39Meijer L. Kim S.H.,. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 41Schnier J.B. Kaur G. Kaiser A. Stinson S.F. Sausville E.A. Gardner J. Nishi K Bradbury E.M.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2419-2428PubMed Google Scholar). Thus potent and selective inhibitors of the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 have been elusive. Recently however, there have been several reports of compounds that do inhibit CDK4-cyclin D1 in vitro and show selective growth inhibition of tumor cells with functional pRb or defective p16INK4A (28Kubo A. Nakagawa K. Varma R.K. Conrad N.K. Cheng J.Q. Lee W.C. Testa J.R. Johnson B.E. Kaye F.J. Kelley M.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 4279-4286PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kent L.L. Hull-Campbell N.E. Lau T.

Fretz H. Chandhuri B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) These reports therefore reinforce the gathering evidence that the identification of pharmacological inhibitors of cyclin D-dependent kinases could allow the development of a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients with tumors where the retinoblastoma gene is still functional but other members of the pRb/cyclin D/p16INK4A pathway are defective. With PD 0183812, we have identified the most potent CDK4-cyclin D1 inhibitor to date. We have also shown that PD 0183812 can inhibit CDK6-cyclin D2 and CDK6-cyclin D3 with a similar potency to CDK4-cyclin D1. Therapeutically this is an important point because tumors that, for example, have functional pRb but defective p16INK4A and express CDK6 as well as CDK4 along with one or more of the D-type cyclins, may require inhibition of both these CDKs for therapeutic value. PD 0183812 would be capable of this whereas in contrast the recently discovered CDK4-cyclin D1 inhibitor fascaplysin would not, because it specifically targets this form of the cyclin D-dependent kinases (45Soni R. Muller L. Furet P. Schoepfer J. Stephan C. Zumstein-Mecker S. Fretz H. Chandhuri B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus the identification of PD 0183812 as a small molecule inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 provides us with an important tool to investigate the cellular processes in which the cyclin D-dependent kinases participate and a chemical lead in the development of a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of genetically characterized tumors. We would like to thank everyone who has worked on the CDK inhibitor project at both Onyx Pharmaceuticals and at Pfizer Global Research and Development, Ann Arbor Laboratories. We would also like to thank J. Titley and M. Quinn for their assistance with the FACS analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1994750040,"Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein, NS5A, is a phosphoprotein produced from the processing of the viral polyprotein precursor. NS5A associates with several cellular proteins in mammalian cells, and the biological consequences of this interaction are currently unknown. To this end, five stable NS5A-expressing murine and human cell lines were established. Tetracycline-regulated NIH3T3 cells and rat liver epithelial cells as well as the constitutive, NS5A-expressing, human Chang liver, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells all exhibited cell growth retardation compared with the control cells. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry indicated that the NS5A-expressing human epitheloid tumor cells had a reduced S phase and an increase in the G(2)/M phase, which could be explained by a p53-dependent induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) protein and mRNA levels. NS5A interacts with Cdk1 in vivo and in vitro, and a significant portion of the p21(Waf1/Cip1) was found to be in a complex with Cdk2 in the NS5A-expressing human hepatic cell line. Cdk1 and cyclin B1 proteins were also reduced in human Chang liver cells consistent with the increase in G(2)/M phase. Our results suggest that the NS5A protein causes growth inhibition and cell cycle perturbations by targeting the Cdk1/2-cyclin complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1975297292,"In this study, we report the molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding three distinct isoforms of rat (r) TRP6 Ca2+ channels. The longest isoform, rTRP6A, contains 930 amino acid residues; rTRP6B lacks 54 amino acids (3–56) at the N terminus, and rTRP6C is missing an additional 68 amino acids near the C terminus. Transient transfection of COS cells with expression vectors encoding rTRP6A or rTRP6B increased Ca2+ influx and gave rise to a novel Ba2+ influx after activation of M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. By contrast, passive depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin did not induce Ba2+ influx in cells expressing rTRP6 isoforms. Ba2+ influx was also stimulated in rTRP6A-expressing cells after exposure to the diacylglycerol analog, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), but rTRP6B-expressing cells failed to show OAG-induced Ba2+ influx. Expression of a rTRP6 N-terminal fragment of rTRP6B or rTRP6A antisense RNA blocked M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent Ba2+ influx in COS cells that were transfected with rTRP6 cDNAs. Together these results suggest that rTRP6 participates in the formation of Ca2+ channels that are regulated by a G-protein-coupled receptor, but not by intracellular Ca2+stores. In contrast to the results we obtained with rTRP6A and rTRP6B, cells expressing rTRP6C showed no increased Ca2+ or Ba2+ influxes after stimulation with carbachol and also did not show OAG-induced Ba2+ influx. Glycosylation analysis indicated that rTRP6A and rTRP6B are glycosylated in COS cells, but that rTRP6C is mostly not glycosylated. Together these results suggest that the N terminus (3–56 amino acids) is crucial for the activation of rTRP6A by diacylglycerol and that the 735–802 amino acid segment located just downstream from the 6th transmembrane segment may be required for processing of the rTRP6 protein. In this study, we report the molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding three distinct isoforms of rat (r) TRP6 Ca2+ channels.

Cytosolic Ca2+ signals play important roles in the development, function, and death of cells (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature.. 1998; 395: 645-648Google Scholar, 2Usachev Y.M. Thayer S.A. Bioessays.. 1999; 21: 743-750Google Scholar). Increases in intracellular Ca2+ typically result from the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and/or from an increased influx of extracellular Ca2+ (3Putney J.W.J. Mckay R.R. Bioessays.. 1999; 21: 38-46Google Scholar). In many types of cells, stimulation of seven-transmembrane receptors that couple to the production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate is followed by a biphasic increase in intracellular Ca2+. An initial transient increase is due to the opening of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-activated Ca2+ channels that release the Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. This is followed by a sustained increase in Ca2+ due to the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane (4Putney J.W.J. Cell Calcium.. 1990; 11: 611-624Google Scholar, 5Putney J.W.J. Bird G.S.J. Cell.. 1993; 75: 199-201Google Scholar, 6Putney J.W.J. Science.. 1993; 262: 676-678Google Scholar). Calcium influx that is triggered by the emptying of intracellular stores was first termed capacitative calcium entry by Putney (7Putney J.W.J. Cell Calcium.. 1986; 7: 1-12Google Scholar). The molecular identification of Ca2+channels mediating capacitative calcium entry is currently a topic of wide interest. The molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding Ca2+ channels that function in the visual system of Drosophila (d), the transient receptor potential (dTRP)1 (8Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron.. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Google Scholar) and dTRP-like (dTRPL) (9Phillips A.M. Bull A. Kelly L.E. Neuron.. 1992; 8: 631-642Google Scholar) channels, provided the first two candidates for capacitative calcium entry channels. dTRP was shown to form Ca2+-permeable channels that are activated by store depletion, whereas dTRPL forms nonselective cation channels that are constitutively active and insensitive to store depletion when expressed in Sf9 cells (10Vaca L. Sinkins W.G. Hu Y. Kunze D.L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol... 1994; 267: C1501-C1505Google Scholar, 11Dong Y. Kunze D.L. Vaca L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol... 1995; 269: C1332-C1339Google Scholar). Coexpression of dTRP and dTRPL was also shown to give rise to a store-operated current that is distinct from that produced by either dTRP or dTRPL alone (12Xu X.S. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell.. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Google Scholar). Furthermore, dTRP and dTRPL interact directly, suggesting that they are likely to form heteromeric channels (12Xu X.S. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell.. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Google Scholar, 13Reuss H. Mojet M.H. Chyb S. Hardie R.C. Neuron.. 1997; 19: 1249-1259Google Scholar). A search for mammalian homologues of the dTRP and dTRPL genes has yielded seven TRP homologues, TRP1–7, which are differentially expressed in various tissues. The functional characteristics of channels encoded by these genes have been studied primarily in heterologous cell systems (14–32). Based on these studies, the seven mammalian TRP homologues can be divided into two groups: TRP1/2/4/5, which are thought to form channels activated by Ca2+ store depletion, and TRP3/6/7, which are thought to be activated by Gq-coupled receptors independently of Ca2+stores (14Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Science.. 2000; 287: 1604-1605Google Scholar, 20Vannier B. Peyton M. Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brain Res... 1999; 64: 41-51Google Scholar). Recently, human (h) TRP6, hTRP3 (26Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature.. 1999; 397: 259-263Google Scholar), and mouse (m) TRP7 (28Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 27359-27370Google Scholar) have been reported to be activated by diacylglycerol (DAG), but the activation pathway and domain within the TRP proteins required for activation are still unclear. To study the mechanisms of regulation of TRP6, we used a RT-PCR strategy to clone the rat (r) TRP6 cDNA. This approach yielded cDNA encoding three distinct isoforms of TRP6. When expressed in COS cells, rTRP6A and rTRP6B form Ca2+ channels that couple to M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) and are regulated independently of intracellular Ca2+ stores. The longest isoform, rTRP6A, is activated by the DAG analog, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), but rTRP6B is not, suggesting that amino acids present in the N terminus of rTRP6A are crucial for activation by DAG but are not required for activation by carbachol. Finally, the apparent inability of the shortest TRP6 isoform, rTRP6C, to undergo glycosylation and form functional channels suggests that a domain located on the cytoplasmic side of the sixth transmembrane segment may be required for processing of the rTRP6 protein. rTRP6A cDNA was cloned from rat lung total RNA, and rTRP6B and C cDNAs were cloned from PC12D cell (36Katoh-Semba R. Kitajima S. Yamazaki Y. Sano M. J. Neurosci. Res... 1987; 17: 36-44Google Scholar) total RNA using a RT-PCR approach. The forward primer for rTRP6A was 5′-CCAGGCACTTGCCATGAGCCAGAG-3′; the forward primer for rTRP6B and C was 5′-ATGAGCCGGGGTAATGAAAACAGAC-3′, and the common reverse primer was 5′-CCAATCGATCTATCTGCGGCTTTCC-3′. The RT-PCR products were isolated from 1% agarose gels and cloned in pGEM-T Easy (Promega). TRP6 cDNAs were excised from this vector by digesting with NotI andSpeI and subcloned between the NotI andSpeI sites of pEF-BOS-SK, a derivative of the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (37Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res... 1990; 18: 5322Google Scholar) that contains the multiple cloning site of pBluescript-SK (Stratagene). The resulting plasmids were designated pBOS-TRP6A, -B, and -C. An antisense expression vector, pBOS-TRP6A-antisense, was constructed by subcloning aNotI/SpeI DNA fragment encoding rTRP6A in pEF-BOS-KS. An expression vector encoding the TRP6B N-terminal fragment fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), pEGFP-TRP6B-N, was constructed by cloning a DNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 1–301 of rTRP6B between the EcoRI and XmaI sites of pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH). pBOS-TRP6AΔ was constructed by digesting pBOS-TRP6A and pBOS-TRP6C with XhoI and SpeI and ligating the smallXhoI/SpeI fragment from pBOS-TRP6C to the large fragment of pBOS-TRP6A. In the same way, pBOS-TRP6C+ (which has the same primary structure as pBOS-TRP6B) was constructed by ligating the small XhoI/SpeI fragment from pBOS-TRP6A to the large fragment of pBOS-TRP6C. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Confluent cultures were replated in 12-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, the medium was changed, and 100 μl of transfection mixture was added to each well. Transfection mixtures contained 500 ng of the M5muscarinic receptor expression plasmid pBOS-M5 (38Bonner T.I. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Buckley N.J. Neuron.. 1988; 1: 403-410Google Scholar), 1 μg of rTrp6 cDNA, 50 ng of the GFP expression plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), and 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINETM 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 100 μl of Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h at 37 °C, the transfection mixtures were removed, and normal medium was added to the cells. Two days after transfection, cells were loaded with fura 2-AM (Wako, 2 μm in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer: 6 mm Hepes-NaOH, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 2 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 6 mm glucose, pH 7.4) for 90 min at room temperature in the dark. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ and Ba2+-dependent fluorescence were measured in individual cells or small groups of cells by fluorescence videomicroscopy using the Argus-50/Ca system (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K). Fura-2 loaded cells were stimulated with 340 nm and 380 nm of light at 1.4-s intervals, and fluorescence was recorded at 510 nm. Data were calculated using Microsoft Excel 98. Artifacts associated with the addition of drugs were graphically removed from fluorescence traces. A 17-amino acid peptide (914KLGERLSLESKQEESRR930) and a 12-amino acid peptide (788QGHKKGFQEDAE799) were used as the antigen peptides for the production of antiserum in rabbits (Biologica Co., Nagoya, Japan) and were designated as anti-TRP6-C terminus and anti-TRP6 (788), respectively. These TRP6 antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography (SulfoLink kit, Pierce) using the antigen peptide as described in Harlow and Lane (39Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1988; : 313-315PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured and transfected as described above. Two days after transfection, cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by the addition of radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40 (nonylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol), 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The mixture was sonicated in the cold and cleared by centrifuging at 5,000 rpm for 5 min. The samples were mixed with the same volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 200 mmdithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and resolved by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% acrylamide resolving gel). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.2 μm, FluorotransTM, Pall Corp.). After the transfer, membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% powdered skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate). The membranes were then exposed to anti-TRP6 antibody (650 μg/ml, 1:500 dilution) in phosphate-buffered saline (containing 0.5% powdered skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with the above buffer and incubated in buffer containing anti-rabbit IgG antibodies cross-linked with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc.; 1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times, and TRP6 bands were visualized by staining with a freshly prepared solution containing 0.25 mg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Wako), 0.01% H2O2, 0.04% NiCl2, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Cell lysates were treated with endoglycosidase H (0.05 units, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or peptide N-glycosidase F (5 units, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The samples were then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blots as described above. Using a RT-PCR strategy, we cloned cDNAs encoding three rat TRP6 isoforms: rTRP6A from rat lung and rTRP6B and C from PC12D cells. rTRP6A is composed of 930 amino acids, and rTRP6B and C contain 876 and 808 amino acids, respectively. Compared with rTRP6A, rTRP6B is missing 54 amino acids at the N terminus, and rTRP6C is missing an additional 68 amino acids near C terminus (Fig. 1 A andB). Hydropathy analysis suggests that rTRP6 has six hydrophobic transmembrane domains and one pore-forming region, located between the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments. Both N- and C-terminal regions contain a large percentage of hydrophilic amino acid residues, and the N terminus of rTRP6A-C is predicted to contain three ankyrin-like repeats (Fig. 1 C). When expressed in COS cells, rTRP6A, -B, and -C proteins of apparent molecular masses 107, 98, and 87 kDa, respectively, were detected using an antibody that recognizes the rTRP6 C terminus. By contrast, COS cells transfected with the empty expression vector, pBOS-SK, produced no detectable TRP6 protein (Fig. 2 A,left). The specificity of the rTRP6-C terminus antibody is demonstrated by the fact that preincubation with the TRP6-C-terminal oligopeptide completely blocked the appearance of TRP6 bands in the Western blots (Fig. 2 A, right). Endogenous rTRP6 proteins were found to be widely expressed in rat brain (Fig.2 B, left). The rTRP6 protein expressed in brain roughly comigrated with rTRP6A expressed in COS cells (Fig.2 B, right). To study the roles of the three rTRP6 isoforms in calcium signaling, rTRP6A, -B, or -C cDNAs or pBOS-SK were transiently expressed in COS cells along with expression vectors for M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and GFP. An expression vector encoding M5 mAChR, which couples to Gq (38Bonner T.I. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Buckley N.J. Neuron.. 1988; 1: 403-410Google Scholar), was used to study the role of rTRP6 in carbachol-stimulated Ca2+ entry. Cells were loaded with fura-2 in KRH (containing 2 mmCaCl2), and extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by adding 4 mm EGTA just before making the measurements. The addition of 500 μm carbachol to these cells induced a rapid rise in cytosolic Ca2+, which decreased to basal levels within 2–3 min (Fig. 3,A–D). This transient increase in Ca2+corresponds to the rapid release of Ca2+ from internal stores and subsequent expulsion of Ca2+ from the cell. The addition of 4 mm CaCl2 to the extracellular solution induced a second increase in cytosolic Ca2+ due to the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A–D). Compared with the control cells, the Ca2+ increases due to influx were much larger in cells expressing rTRP6A or -B, but cells expressing rTRP6C showed no significant differences in Ca2+influx compared with the control (Fig. 3 E). To further characterize the rTRP6 channels, we examined the ability of carbachol to stimulate Ba2+ influx in COS cells expressing individual rTRP6 isoforms. Ba2+ is frequently used as a substitute for Ca2+ since its entry into the cell can also be monitored by measuring increases in fura-2 fluorescence. Previously, we found that endogenously expressed store-operated Ca2+channels in neuronal PC12D cells are relatively impermeable to Ba2+ ions. 2L. Zhang, F-F. Guo, and D. Saffen, unpublished observations. pBOS-SK-transfected COS cells in nominally Ca2+-free KRH buffer did not show any Ba2+ influx after stimulation with carbachol and subsequent addition of 200 μmBaCl2 (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, significant carbachol-stimulated Ba2+ influx was observed in TRP6A- or -B-transfected cells (Fig. 4, Band C). COS cells expressing rTRP6C, the shortest isoform, showed no Ba2+ influx (Fig. 4 D). To determine whether the regulation of rTRP6 is dependent on the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, the effects of thapsigargin were examined. Thapsigargin indirectly causes the release of Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic reticulum by irreversibly inhibiting the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, which functions to fill these stores (40Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drøbak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar). In nominally Ca2+-free medium, the addition of 1 μm thapsigargin depleted the intracellular Ca2+ stores, resulting in a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+. Ba2+ influx was not observed in control cells or in rTRP6A-, -B-, or -C-transfected cells after the addition of 200 μm BaCl2 to the medium (Fig. 5, A–D). Similar results were obtained using 100 nm thapsigargin to deplete intracellular Ca2+stores. 3L. Zhang and D. Saffen, unpublished observations. Coexpression of rTRP6B-N (encoding the N-terminal 1–301 amino acid residues of rTRP6B) with rTRP6A totally blocked carbachol-stimulated Ba2+influx (Fig. 6, A andB). A similar inhibitory effect was observed when pBOS-TRP6A antisense expression vector was cotransfected with the rTRP6B expression vector (Fig. 6, C and D). In Fig.6 E, Western blots show that rTRP6B protein levels are significantly reduced in cells cotransfected with the rTRP6A antisense expression vector. These data suggest that expression of rTRP6A or -B causes an increase in Ca2+ influx compared with the control cells. To obtain additional evidence for this model, we examined the effects of rTRP6A antisense RNA expression on Ca2+ influx. Fig.7 shows that in nominally Ca2+-free medium, carbachol-stimulated Ca2+influx was reduced to control levels when rTRP6A antisense RNA was coexpressed with rTRP6A. Recent studies show that hTRP3 and hTRP6 (26Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature.. 1999; 397: 259-263Google Scholar) and also mTRP7 (28Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 27359-27370Google Scholar) can be directly activated by the analogs of diacylglycerol. We therefore tested the effects of a membrane-permeable diacylglycerol analog, OAG, on Ba2+ influx in COS cells expressing rTRP6. Cells in nominally Ca2+-free medium were exposed to 100 μm OAG and then 200 μmBaCl2. No Ba2+ influx was observed in pBOS-SK-transfected control cells (Fig.8 A), but significant stimulation of the influx of Ba2+ by OAG was observed in rTRP6A-expressing cells (Fig. 8 B). By contrast, there was no OAG-induced Ba2+ influx in rTRP6B- or -C-transfected cells (Fig. 8, C and D). Pretreatment of cells with 500 nm PMA, a PKC activator, abolished OAG-activated, rTRP6A-mediated Ba2+ influx (Fig. 8 F), whereas pretreatment with PMA alone had no effect on Ba2+ influx (Fig. 8 E). PMA also failed to stimulate Ba2+influx when added just before the addition of BaCl2.3 Similar results were obtained using 100 nm PMA.3 To further investigate the involvement of PKC in M5 receptor-mediated Ba2+ influx, we examined the effects of the phorbol ester PMA and the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X (41Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 15771-15781Google Scholar, 42Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 9194-9197Google Scholar). Pretreatment of COS cells expressing rTRP6A and M5 receptor with PMA blocked carbachol-activated, rTRP6A-mediated Ba2+ influx (Fig.9, A and B). GF 109203X alone did not significantly affect carbachol-induced Ba2+ influx (Fig. 9 C), but pretreatment of the cells with GF 109203X before PMA abolished the inhibitory effect of phorbol ester (Fig. 9 D). These results indicate that PMA inhibits carbachol-activated Ba2+ influx by activating PKC. The predicted amino acid sequence of rTRP6A contains nine consensus NX(S/T) motifs for N-glycosylation (Fig.10 A). Because only sites that are exposed to the extracellular side of the membrane are expected to be glycosylated, the topological model for rTRP6 depicted in Fig. 1suggests that only Asn at position 711 is a candidate for glycosylation. To analyze whether rTRP6 is glycosylated in COS cells and to provide evidence that rTRP6 proteins are expressed on the surface of plasma membrane, we treated the cell lysates with two glycosidases, endoglycosidase H and peptide N-glycosidase F before performing the Western blot analysis. Treatment with endoglycosidase H, an enzyme that cleaves the N-glycosidic bond between the first and second GlcNAc residue of high mannose-containing, immature glycoproteins did not change the pattern of rTRP6A significantly, but eliminated two sharp bands located just above the rTRP6B band with the highest mobility. Treatment with peptideN-glycosidase F, an enzyme that cleaves theN-glycosidic bond between the sugar chain and asparagine of the mature and immature forms of glycoproteins, almost totally eliminated the hazy material between 83 and 175 kDa and increased the intensities of rTRP6A and -B high mobility bands, but did not change the appearance of the rTRP6C band (Fig. 10 B). The results in Fig. 10 show that cells expressing rTRP6C have very low levels of the mature glycosylated protein. This suggested that the 735–802 segment missing in rTRP6C is crucial for processing of the rTRP6 protein. To test this hypothesis, we prepared the constructs TRP6AΔ and TRP6C+. As shown in Fig. 11 A, TRP6AΔ is equivalent to rTRP6A but is missing the 735–802 segment, and TRP6C+ is equivalent to rTRP6C with the addition of the 735–802 segment (TRP6C+ is structurally the same as rTRP6B). Fig. 11 B shows the results of Western blot analysis using the anti-TRP6-C terminus Ab. As shown in the figure, cells expressing rTRP6AΔ lost most of the hazy material in the region between 83 and 175 kDa compared with rTRP6A. By contrast, cells expressing TRP6C+ contained more of this hazy material compared with rTRP6C-expressing cells and showed the same pattern with rTRP6B. Fig. 11 C shows the Western blot result obtained by probing with an antibody that recognizes a 12-amino acid peptide located within the 735–802 segment region. As expected, TRP6AΔ was not recognized by anti-TRP6 (788) Ab. By contrast, TRP6C+ was recognized by anti-TRP6 (788) Ab and showed the same pattern as rTRP6B (Fig. 11 C). To test the functional importance of the 735–802 segment, we measured carbachol- and OAG-stimulated Ba2+ influx in pBOS-TRP6AΔ- or pBOS-TRP6C+-transfected COS cells. As shown in Fig.12 A, cells expressing TRP6AΔ failed to show Ba2+ influx response to carbachol stimulation. By contrast, cells expressing TRP6C+ showed significant Ba2+ influx, whereas the original rTRP6C-expressing cells did not (Fig. 12 B and Fig.4 D). There was also no Ba2+ influx observed after stimulation with OAG in either TRP6AΔ or TRP6C+-expressing cells (Fig. 12, C andD). In the present study, we cloned three isoforms of rat TRP6, designated rTRP6A, -B, and -C. These isoforms may result from alternative RNA splicing as suggested for other TRP subtypes (15Wes P.D.

Mizuno et al. (27Mizuno N. Kitayama S. Saishin Y. Shimada S. Morita K. Mitsuhata C. Kurihara H. Dohi T. Mol. Brain Res... 1999; 64: 41-51Google Scholar) also report the cloning of TRP6 from rat brain. Their sequence is similar to our rTRP6A cDNA, except that it contains an insertion of a G residue at position of 1210 and a deletion of a C residue at position 1326, resulting in a shift in the reading frame in this region compared with our sequences and also with respect to the mouse and human TRP6 sequences. Previous studies found that mouse TRP6 mRNA is expressed at low levels in brain (25Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 29672-29680Google Scholar). Using Western blot analysis, we found that rTRP6 protein is expressed throughout the brain, including the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, brain stem, and midbrain regions (Fig. 2 B). In COS cells, transient expression of rTRP6A and -B resulted in a 2.5- and a 1.5-fold increase in Ca2+ influx compared with control cells when Ca2+ was added back to cultures stimulated with carbachol in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. By contrast, rTRP6C-transfected cells showed no significant Ca2+ increase compared with the control cells in the same assay (Fig. 3). To date, seven mammalian homologues (Trp1–7) of theDrosophila Trp and Trpl genes have been isolated (15–28). There can be divided into two groups based upon whether or not they can be activated by store depletion (14Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Science.. 2000; 287: 1604-1605Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the TRP6 channels are regulated, however, is still unresolved. Boulay et al. (25Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 29672-29680Google Scholar) found that mouse TRP6 functions as a G-protein-coupled receptor-regulated Ca2+ store-independent channel when expressed in COS cells (25Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 29672-29680Google Scholar). By contrast, Mizuno et al. (27Mizuno N. Kitayama S. Saishin Y. Shimada S. Morita K. Mitsuhata C. Kurihara H. Dohi T. Mol. Brain Res... 1999; 64: 41-51Google Scholar) reported that rat TRP6 is a thapsigargin-sensitive and Ca2+store-regulated channel in COS cells. In our study, COS cells expressing rTRP6A or -B showed significant Ba2+ influx in response to carbachol stimulation, whereas rTRP6C or control vector pBOS-SK-transfected cells did not show any Ba2+ influx (Fig. 4). By contrast, thapsigargin failed to induce any Ba2+ influx in rTRP6A-, -B-, or -C-transfected cells (Fig.5). Together these data indicate that rTRP6 functions as a receptor-activated, Ca2+ store-independent Ca2+channel in COS cells. Hofmann et al. (26Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature.. 1999; 397: 259-263Google Scholar) first showed that human TRP6 and TRP3 are activated by DAG analogs, and Okada et al. (28Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 27359-27370Google Scholar) observed a similar activation for mouse TRP7. In our experiments, OAG induced significant Ba2+ influx in rTRP6A-transfected cells (Fig.8 B), but not in control cells (Fig. 8 A). Interestingly, cells expressing rTRP6B failed to show OAG-induced Ba2+ influx (Fig. 8 C). rTRP6B is missing a 54-amino acid (3–56) segment that is present at the N terminus of rTRP6A, suggesting that these amino acids are crucial for activation by DAG but are not required for rTRP6 activation by mAChR (Fig.4 B). Together these results imply that activation of rTRP6 after stimulation of mAChR is mediated by DAG-dependent and DAG-independent pathways. Further study will be needed to elucidate the role of the N-terminal 54-amino acid segment in the activation of rTRP6A by DAG. In addition to its ability to activate Ba2+ influx through rTRP6A, OAG is also known to activate PKC (46Mori T. Takai Y., Yu, B. Takahashi J. Nishizuka Y. Fujikura T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ).. 1982; 91: 427-431Google Scholar). To determine whether PKC activation is correlated with Ba2+ influx, we examined the effects of another PKC activator, PMA, on Ba2+ influx. Pretreatment with PMA did not induce Ba2+ influx (Fig.8 E), but instead blocked OAG-induced Ba2+ influx in rTRP6A-expressing cells (Fig. 8 F). These data indicate that DAG-induced Ba2+ influx does not involve the activation of protein kinase C but, rather, that activation of PKC blocks the activation of the rTRP6A channel. Pretreatment of cells with PMA also blocked carbachol-activated, rTRP6A-mediated Ba2+influx (Fig. 9, A and B). This inhibition is mediated by PKC since pretreatment of the cells with GF 109203X before PMA abolished the inhibitory effects of this phorbol ester (Fig.9 D). If DAG can both activate and inhibit TRP6 channels, one might expect that pretreatment of the cells with GF 109203X alone would potentiate carbachol-induced Ba2+ influx. Pretreatment with GF 109203X, however, did not significantly change the rate or extent of carbachol-stimulated Ba2+ influx (Fig. 9 C). This result suggests that DAG produced after activation of mAChR might stimulate Ba2+ influx more efficiently (or perhaps more rapidly) than it activates PKC. Activation by OAG and inhibition by PMA has also been reported for mTRP7 (28Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 27359-27370Google Scholar). Clearly, further study is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the regulation of TRP Ca2+ channels by DAG. Previous studies from Birnbaumer and co-workers showed that human TRP3 proteins expressed in HEK293 (30Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 133-142Google Scholar) and COS cells (31Vannier B. Zhu X. Brown D. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 8675-8679Google Scholar, 32Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 15195-15202Google Scholar) and mouse TRP6 proteins in COS cells (25Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 29672-29680Google Scholar) are glycosylated. In our study, we also found that rat TRP6 proteins are glycosylated when expressed in COS cells. rTRP6A is present mostly in the mature glycosylated form, whereas rTRP6B contains both mature glycosylated and immature and unglycosylated forms. By contrast, most of the rTRP6C is not glycosylated (Fig. 10 B), suggesting that rTRP6C may not be processed normally. This may explain why rTRP6C did not respond to stimulation with carbachol and OAG. The glycosylation results led us to examine the importance of the 68 amino acids (735–802 segment) missing from the rTRP6C, which is located on the cytosolic side immediately adjacent to the sixth transmembrane domain. To determine the function of this segment, we constructed TRP6AΔ, which is rTRP6A deleted for this segment, and TRP6C+, which is rTRP6C with this fragment added on. As expected, TRP6AΔ did not show glycosylation characteristic of the mature forms and also failed to show Ba2+ influx response to the carbachol stimulation (Fig. 11 B and Fig.12 A). By contrast, TRP6C+ did express mature glycosylated forms compared with rTRP6C, showing a pattern similar to rTRP6B (to which it is structurally identical). As for rTRP6B, significant Ba2+ influx was observed in TRP6C+-expressing cells after stimulation with carbachol (Fig. 11 B and Fig. 12 B). The first 35 amino acids in the 735–802 segment (735DDADVEWKFARAKLWFSYFEEGRTLPVPFNLVPSP769) together with the sixth transmembrane segment are highly conserved in TRPs from Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals, suggesting the potential functional importance of this domain. By contrast, the last 33 amino acids of this fragment (770KSLLYLLLKFKKWMSELIQGHKKGFQEDAEMNK802) are only conserved among TRP6s from different species. Expression of mRNA encoding rTRP6C can be detected at low levels in brain and PC12D cells by RT-PCR,3 but the function of this isoform remains unknown. In summary, we have cloned three distinct rTRP6 isoforms and demonstrated that rTRP6 contributes to the formation of G-protein-coupled receptor-regulated store-depletion-independent Ca2+ channels when expressed in COS cells. We have also identified two domains that are important for the function of rTRP6 channels: the N terminus (3–56 amino acids), which is crucial for the activation of rTRP6A by DAG, and the 735–802 segment located just downstream from the sixth transmembrane segment, which may be required for processing of the rTRP6 protein.

https://openalex.org/W2075962843,"The ErbB receptor family is implicated in the malignant transformation of several tumor types and is overexpressed frequently in breast, ovarian, and other tumors. The mechanism by which CI-1033 and gemcitabine, either singly or in combination, kill tumor cells was examined in two breast lines, MDA-MB-453 and BT474; both overexpress the ErbB-2 receptor. CI-1033, a potent inhibitor of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, reduced levels of activated Akt in MDA-MB-453 cells. This effect alone, however, did not induce apoptosis in these cells. Gemcitabine treatment resulted in a moderate increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells that was accompanied by activation of p38 and MAPK (ERK1/2). CI-1033 given 24 h after gemcitabine produced a significant increase in the apoptotic fraction over treatment with either drug alone. During the combined treatment p38 remained activated, whereas Akt and activated MAPK were suppressed. Substitution of CI-1033 with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD 098059 in combination with gemcitabine produced the same results as the combination of CI-1033 and gemcitabine. p38 suppression by SB203580 prevented the enhanced cell kill by CI-1033. In contrast to MDA-MB-453, BT474 cells exhibited activated p38 under unstressed conditions as well as activated Akt and MAPK. Treatment of BT474 cells with CI-1033 inhibited both the phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK and resulted in a 47% apoptotic fraction. Gemcitabine did not cause apoptosis in the BT474 cells. These data indicate that suppression of Akt and MAPK in the presence of activated p38 results in cell death and a possible mechanism for the enhanced apoptosis produced by the combination of CI-1033 and gemcitabine in MDA-MB-453 cells. Furthermore, tumors that depend on ErbB receptor signaling for survival and exhibit activated p38 in the basal state may be susceptible to apoptosis by CI-1033 as a single agent."
https://openalex.org/W2144527553,"We identified a novel MaxiK α subunit splice variant (SV1) from rat myometrium that is also present in brain. SV1 has a 33-amino acid insert in the S1 transmembrane domain that does not alter S1 overall hydrophobicity, but makes the S0–S1 linker longer. SV1 was transfected in HEK293T cells and studied using immunocytochemistry and electrophysiology. In non-permeabilized cells, N-terminal c-Myc- or C-terminal green fluorescent protein-tagged SV1 displayed no surface labeling or currents. The lack of SV1 functional expression was due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention as determined by colabeling experiments with a specific ER marker. To explore the functional role of SV1, we coexpressed SV1 with the α (human SLO) and β1 (KCNMB1) subunits of the MaxiK channel. Coexpression of SV1 inhibited surface expression of α and β1 subunits ∼80% by trapping them in the ER. This inhibition seems to be specific for MaxiK channel subunits since SV1 was unable to prevent surface expression of the Kv4.3 channel or to interact with green fluorescent protein. These results indicate a dominant-negative role of SV1 in MaxiK channel expression. Moreover, they reveal down-regulation by splice variants as a new mechanism that may contribute to the diverse levels of MaxiK channel expression in non-excitable and excitable cells. We identified a novel MaxiK α subunit splice variant (SV1) from rat myometrium that is also present in brain. SV1 has a 33-amino acid insert in the S1 transmembrane domain that does not alter S1 overall hydrophobicity, but makes the S0–S1 linker longer. SV1 was transfected in HEK293T cells and studied using immunocytochemistry and electrophysiology. In non-permeabilized cells, N-terminal c-Myc- or C-terminal green fluorescent protein-tagged SV1 displayed no surface labeling or currents. The lack of SV1 functional expression was due to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention as determined by colabeling experiments with a specific ER marker. To explore the functional role of SV1, we coexpressed SV1 with the α (human SLO) and β1 (KCNMB1) subunits of the MaxiK channel. Coexpression of SV1 inhibited surface expression of α and β1 subunits ∼80% by trapping them in the ER. This inhibition seems to be specific for MaxiK channel subunits since SV1 was unable to prevent surface expression of the Kv4.3 channel or to interact with green fluorescent protein. These results indicate a dominant-negative role of SV1 in MaxiK channel expression.

Biomembr. 1991; 23: 537-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Their functional properties and relative abundance vary from tissue to tissue and within the same tissue (1Latorre R.

Physiol. 1999; 277: G22-G30PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological role of MaxiK channels in different tissues is influenced not only by their single channel properties, but also by their expression level. In line with this view, they are strikingly abundant in smooth muscle, where they play a critical role in the control of vascular tone (6Brayden J.E. Nelson M.T. Science. 1992; 256: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar), and their expression level is exquisitely modulated during pregnancy (7Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brain, differential surface expression has been detected, suggesting a critical role of MaxiK channels in shaping the electrical activity in mammalian brain (8Knaus H.G. Schwarzer C. Koch R.O. Eberhart A. Kaczorowski G.J. Glossmann H. Wunder F. Pongs O. Garcia M.L. Sperk G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 955-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying MaxiK channel diversity has received much attention in recent years; however, those that determine channel expression levels in vertebrates are less understood. Vertebrate MaxiK channels are composed of the pore-forming α and modulatory transmembrane β subunits (9Adelman J.P. Shen K.Z. Kavanaugh M.P. Warren R.A. Wu Y.N. Lagrutta A. Bond C.T. North R.A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 209-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 10Knaus H.G. Garcia-Calvo M. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. J. Biol.

Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2001: 49-70Crossref Google Scholar). The α subunit has seven transmembrane domains (S0–S6) (12Meera P. Wallner M. Song M. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14066-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and seems to be the product of a single gene (13Toro L. Meera P. Wallner M. Tanaka Y. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 112-117PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, modulatory β subunits are products of several genes and contribute largely to the functional diversity of MaxiK channels. For instance, the β1 subunit can profoundly modulate the apparent voltage/Ca2+ sensitivity and activation/deactivation kinetics of the α subunit (14McManus O.B. Helms L.M. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Swanson R. Leonard R.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 645-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 15Meera P. Wallner M. Jiang Z. Toro L.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional diversity of MaxiK channels is further enhanced by alternative splicing of its α (11Meera P. Wallner M. Toro L. Archer S.L. Rusch N.J. Potassium Channels in Cardiovascular Biology. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2001: 49-70Crossref Google Scholar) and β (17Uebele V.N. Lagrutta A. Wade T. Figueroa D.J. Liu Y. McKenna E. Austin C.P. Bennett P.B. Swanson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23211-23218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) subunits. Ten splice sites have been reported for the α subunit; eight of them are located in the intracellular carboxyl terminus. However, only one splice insert has been reported to have profound functional effects on activation and deactivation kinetics and voltage/Ca2+ sensitivities of the vertebrate MaxiK channel (11Meera P. Wallner M. Toro L. Archer S.L. Rusch N.J. Potassium Channels in Cardiovascular Biology. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2001: 49-70Crossref Google Scholar, 18Saito M. Nelson C. Salkoff L. Lingle C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, at least two mechanisms can contribute to the functional diversity of MaxiK channels: association with various β subunits and splice variation. Recently, aDrosophila protein (DSLIP1) that reduces the number of functional channels in the plasma membrane has been isolated. This protein interacts with both human and Drosophila MaxiK channels (19Xia X. Hirschberg B. Smolik S. Forte M. Adelman J.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2360-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a mammalian DSLIP1 counterpart has not been described. We now report a novel mammalian MaxiK channel α subunit splice variant (SV1)1 that can regulate surface expression of both α (hSLO) and β1 subunits of the human MaxiK channel when expressed in HEK293T cells. SV1 retains either α or β1 subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These findings suggest that SV1 may act as a dominant-negative expression regulator by inhibiting MaxiK α and β1 subunit surface expression and show splice variation as a possible mechanism for regulation of MaxiK channel expression in mammalian tissues. Total RNA was extracted using 0.5∼1.0 g of pregnant rat myometrium (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, 17 days pregnant) and the Totally RNA isolation kit (Ambion Inc.). Poly(A) RNA was purified using an Oligotex mRNA minikit (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 100 ng of poly(A) RNA was converted to single-stranded cDNA by priming with an oligo(dT) primer, followed by a 20-μl reverse transcription reaction with 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Single-stranded cDNA was mixed with MaxiK gene-specific primers spanning a region between the linker of transmembrane segments S0 and S1 and transmembrane segment S2 (see Fig. 1 A,arrows) and amplified with 3.5 units of Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a 100-μl reaction. The upstream primer anneals to nucleotides 419–437 (5′-AGGAGGTGGTGGCAGCCGA-3′), and the downstream primer anneals to nucleotides 652–672 (5′-AAACCGCAAGCCAAAGTAGAG-3′) according to GenBankTM/EBI accession number U55995. PCR was performed by denaturing at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Amplification products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Sequences were determined using automated fluorescent sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Two amplification products were obtained: one with the expected size corresponding to the reported mammalian SLO sequences (253 base pairs) and another of larger size (352 base pairs). Sequence analysis showed that this product had an amino acid sequence identical to mammalian (human, rat, mice, bovine, and canine) SLO sequences, but contained an in-frame 33-amino acid segment. As expected for a splice site, the flanking nucleotides were Gs, which occur 60–80% of the time at splice sites (20Lodish H. Baltimore D. Berk A. Zipursky S.L. Matsudaira P. Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1995: 485-542Google Scholar). For functional analysis, the 33-amino acid segment was inserted into the human MaxiK α subunit (hSLO); this construct was named splice variant 1 (SV1). Note that human and rat MaxiK channel α subunits have an overall 99% amino acid identity. RT-PCR was performed as described above using poly(A) RNA from rat brain and/or uterus (non-pregnant). The primers used to check the presence of the SV1 insert in rSLO were as follows (see Fig. 1 C): Reaction 1 (Box B1), 5′-AAGATGGATGCGCTCATCATC-3′ (forward primer, nucleotides 166–186, GenBankTM/EBI accession numberU55995), which includes the start codon Met3 (21Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Recept. Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar), and 5′-CATGAGGAGTCTAGGCATG-3′ (reverse primer, SV1-specific; see Fig.1 B); and Reaction 2 (Box B2), 5′-GCATTTGAAAGATCCTCATTG-3′ (forward primer, SV1-specific; see Fig. 1 B) and 5′-CTCTATGATTTCAGGGACGTA-3′ (reverse primer, nucleotides 1120–1140, GenBankTM/EBI accession number U55995). Detection of SV1 in brain and uterus was performed using the same SV1-specific primers. All products were confirmed by sequencing. Probe DNAs were obtained by RT-PCR amplification using gene-specific primers for rSLO and SV1. To detect rSLO (generic sequence), we amplified a highly conserved region that includes the domain DQDDDD, known as the “Ca-bowl” (22Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1355-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), where no splicing sites have been reported. The upstream primer anneals to nucleotides 2842–2861 (5′-GGACCAAGACGATGATGATG-3′), and the downstream primer anneals to nucleotides 3060–3077 (5′-GCTAGTGTCTGCGGAGTG-3′). For SV1, the same specific primers used for RT-PCR analysis were used. Both amplification products were subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and analyzed by nucleotide sequencing. Clones with the correct inserts were digested withEcoRV and KpnI and cloned into similarly digested pBluescript II KS vector (Stratagene). Plasmids were linearized withAcc65I, and digoxigenin-labeled antisense riboprobes were synthesized using the digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The RPA was performed using RNA isolated from non-pregnant rat myometrium and brain with the RNase protection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each sample (100 μg of total RNA) was individually hybridized with 1 ng of rSLO probe or SV1 probe overnight at 45 °C. The unprotected single-stranded RNAs were digested with RNase A/T1. For each sample, total SV1-protected fragments and 1% of the rSLO-protected fragments were mixed, separated on an 8 murea and 5% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using contact blotting. Signals were detected by immunological and chemiluminescent detection with the chemiluminescent substrate CSPD® using the digoxigenin luminescent detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). hSLO (12Meera P. Wallner M. Song M. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14066-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and SV1 were tagged with the c-Myc epitope AEEQKLISEEDL at the N terminus. Tagged and untagged SV1 and hSLO behaved similarly. For simplicity, we refer to the c-Myc-tagged constructs as hSLO and SV1 throughout this work. hSLO-GFP and SV1-GFP were constructed by fusing GFP (pEGFP-N2, CLONTECH) to the C terminus of the human MaxiK α subunit. N-terminal GFP tagging was avoided since it is known that the tag diminishes the voltage and Ca2+ sensitivities of the hSLO fusion protein (23Meyer E. Fromherz P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1105-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All constructs were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers areU11058 for the human MaxiK pore-forming α subunit and U25138 for the human MaxiK modulatory β1 subunit (KCNMB1). The calcium phosphate transfection protocol was used to transiently transfect HEK293T cells (24Graham F.L. Van Der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to ∼10% confluency and incubated for ∼22 h with the transfection mixture. The transfection mixture was made by mixing (in a 1:1 ratio) a solution containing 250 mm CaCl2 and 20 ng/μl endotoxin-free plasmid with a buffer containing 42 mmHEPES, 274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, and 11 mmdextrose, pH 7.05. This mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to cell treatment. After transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmNa2HPO4, 2.3 mmNaH2PO4, 138 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) and fed with complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; Life Technologies, Inc.). The day before immunocytochemistry experiments, cells were mechanically dissociated and transferred to chamber slides (Lab-Tek) that were precoated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine and 0.1 mg/ml collagen. In experiments involving cotransfection of cDNAs, we used a 1:1 cDNA molar ratio. Three days after transfection, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a 1:50 dilution of anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody. Cells were washed and fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, nonspecific binding was blocked by preincubating the cells with 5% donkey serum at room temperature. The excess serum was removed, and the secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution; Alexa 594, Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dried for 5 min, and mounted (Molecular Probe Prolong) for imaging. Three days after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. To permeabilize cells, subsequent solutions contained 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Nonspecific binding was blocked for 30 min at room temperature using 5% donkey serum. Primary antibodies were then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature. The secondary antibodies were rhodamine red-X succinimidyl ester-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:200 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Cells were washed again, and mounting was performed as described for non-permeabilized cells. Images were acquired by optically sectioning tissues every 0.5–1 μm with a confocal microscope (Leica) and analyzed using the Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics) and Adobe Photoshop programs. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were used against hSLO, Kv4.3 (Alomone Labs), and ERp72 (endoplasmic reticulum marker, Calbiochem) at 1:500, 1:500, and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. These antibodies were raised against purified peptides corresponding to residues 883–896 (VNDTNVQFLDQDDD) of hSLO (7Song M. Zhu N. Olcese R. Barila B. Toro L. Stefani E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Knaus H.G. Eberhart A. Koch R.O.A. Munujos P. Schmalhofer W.A. Warmke J.W. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Koch R.O. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and residues 623–638 ((C)FIDEHATKRSRTKEEL) of ERp72 protein (27Kuznetsov G. Bush K.T. Zhang P.L. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8584-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To label the human β1 subunit, we used a polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) raised against residues 85–102 (GRWAMLYHTEDTRDQNQQ) of KCNMB1 (29Wanner S.G. Koch R.O. Koschak A. Trieb M. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Knaus H.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5392-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Anti-c-Myc was a monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution) raised against sequence AEEQKLISEEDLLRKRREQLKHKLEQLRNSCA (clone 9E10, Oncogene Science Inc.). The lowest concentration of antibody that gives the highest signal was used in these studies. In all experiments, a negative control was performed by transfecting cells with no DNA and by preadsorbing each antibody with the corresponding antigenic peptide. hSLO, hSLO-GFP, SV1, and SV1-GFP cDNAs were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. One day after transfection, cells were plated on coverslips precoated with Cell-Tak (Collaborative Biomedical Products). Transfected cells were identified using a fluorescence microscope (for GFP constructs; CK40-RFL, Olympus) or by the CD8 method (30Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, CD8 cDNA is cotransfected with the cDNA of interest. Transfected cells are identified by light microscopy with the aid of anti-CD8 antibody-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads®, Dynal, Inc.). In our experience, this method is highly successful when Shaker or hSLO K+ channels are cotransfected. Currents were measured 1–5 days after transfection using the cell-attached, inside-out, and whole-cell patch-clamp modes. Recording pipettes had resistances of ∼2–5 megaohms and were filled with 105 mm potassium methanesulfonate, 5 mmKCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm HEDTA, and 58 nm free Ca2+, pH 7.0. The bath solution was 105 mm potassium methanesulfonate, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 μm free Ca2+, pH 7.0. A Ca2+ electrode was used to measure pCa (World Precision Instruments, Inc.) as previously described (31Alioua A. Tanaka Y. Wallner M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Meera P. Toro L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32950-32956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Data was filtered at one-fourth the sampling frequency and acquired and analyzed with pCLAMP (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Normalized voltage activation curves of macroscopic currents were calculated as described previously (15Meera P. Wallner M. Jiang Z. Toro L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Values are expressed as means ± S.D. (n = number of experiments). A new splice variant of the MaxiK α subunit (SV1) (Fig.1 A, gray portion) was isolated from rat myometrium by RT-PCR using MaxiK gene-specific primers spanning the S0–S1 linker and the middle of transmembrane segment S2 (arrows). Two PCR products were obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”): one with identical amino acid sequence to mammalian (human, rat, mice, bovine, and canine) SLO sequences and another containing an in-frame insert of 33 amino acids in the S1 transmembrane domain. Fig. 1 B shows the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the new insert and its position in transmembrane segment S1 (arrowhead). This insert contains a homologous sequence for the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site (RXS*) (32Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To discard the possibility of a cloning artifact, we amplified 447 bases of the 5′-end (including 3 bases upstream to the Met3 start codon) (21Wallner M. Meera P. Ottolia M. Kaczorowski G. Latorre R. Garcia M.L. Stefani E. Toro L. Recept. Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar) and 708 bases of the 3′-end using pairs of SV1- and rSLO-specific primers. Using this strategy, only cDNAs containing SV1 sequences should be amplified. The diagram in Fig. 1 C depicts the sizes of the expected products (1Latorre R. Oberhauser A. Labarca P. Alvarez O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 2McManus O.B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 537-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and the positions of the primers (arrows) and SV1 (gray boxes). The RT-PCRs yielded single bands (Fig.1 C) of the expected sizes (447 (lane 1) and 708 (lane 2) nucleotides) and sequences, indicating that indeed the SV1 insert is present in rat myometrium SLO cDNAs. As expected, when water (lane W) was added instead of cDNA, no bands were detected. RT-PCR using human myometrium cDNAs and the same primers also generated products with the expected sizes and sequences (data not shown). The mRNA of the novel splice variant was detected in the uterus (Fig. 1 D, lane U) and brain (lane B) using both RT-PCR (upper panel) and RPA (lower panel). RT-PCR was performed using SV1-specific primers that detected the expected 99-base pair product. SV1 transcripts were also detected by RPA. This method was used because of its much higher specificity and sensitivity compared with RT-PCR and Northern blotting. RPA analysis clearly demonstrated SV1 transcripts in uterus and also in brain (Fig. 1 D). SV1-specific and rSLO-(2842–3078) generic probes distinguished two bands of the expected sizes. Signals for SV1 accounted for 1.2 ± 0.1% (n = 5) of the total rSLO message (note that only 1% of the total rSLO reaction was loaded; see “Experimental Procedures”). This low expression, together with the small size of the SV1-specific probe, likely contributed to the difficulty in detecting transcripts using Northern blotting (data not shown). Nevertheless, both the RT-PCR experiments (Fig. 1, Cand D) and the RPA results confirm the authenticity of the SV1 splice variant and the existence of its mRNA in rat uterus and brain. Because the SV1 insert is located within the hydrophobic S1 domain of SLO, we investigated if its insertion could impact the hydrophobic properties of S1. Fig. 1 E illustrates the hydrophobicity plots of SLO (upper panel) and SV1 (lower panel) from the amino terminus to the end of S2; the location of the insert is marked with a solid bar. Note that rSLO and hSLO sequences are 100% conserved in this region and have 99% overall sequence identity. Striking is the similar hydrophobic pattern of S1 in both SLO and SV1 constructs. This similarity is further illustrated in Fig.1 F by overlapping S1 hydrophobicity values from SLO (solid line) and SV1 (dotted line). The high degree of overlap demonstrates that the overall hydrophobicity pattern of SLO is not disrupted by the splice insert in SV1, but rather it elongates the linker between S0 and S1. To investigate the functional impact of the SV1 splice insert, HEK293T cells were transfected with SV1 and hSLO constructs (Fig. 2; see “Experimental Procedures”). Currents were measured in cell-attached or inside-out configurations (Fig. 2, A–D, middle andright panels). Fig. 2 A shows that cells transfected with SV1 (as assessed by coexpression of CD8; see “Experimental Procedures”) had no detectable currents when measured in the cell-attached (n = 4) or inside-out (n = 4; 10 μm Ca2+) configurations. Changes in internal Ca2+ concentrations from 1.5 μm to 1.4 mm did not produce detectable currents. To ensure that patched cells were transfected with SV1, GFP was fused at the C terminus of SV1 (Fig. 2 B,left panel). Similarly, SV1-GFP-transfected cells (as assessed by GFP fluorescence) showed no detectable currents in cell-attached (n = 12) or inside-out (n= 6) recordings in the presence of 10 μm intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, in whole-cell recordings, SV1- and SV1-GFP-transfected cells failed to generate any current (data not shown). The lack of measurable currents from SV1 constructs was not caused by the addition of the c-Myc tag at the SV1 N terminus or fusion of GFP at its C terminus. SV1 constructs with (n = 8) or without (n = 12) c-Myc yielded no measurable currents. In addition, previous studies demonstrated that N-terminal c-Myc addition does not change the overall properties of the wild-type hSLO channels (12Meera P. Wallner M. Song M. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14066-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal GFP fusion does not change the overall voltage/Ca2+ sensitivities of hSLO compared with c-Myc-tagged hSLO. Fig. 2 (C andD) shows examples of currents in cell-attached or inside-out configurations. Voltage activation curves demonstrate that the voltage dependence of c-Myc-tagged hSLO (Fig. 2 E, ▪) and that of GFP-tagged hSLO (●) were practically identical. Furthermore, current measurements at different Ca2+ concentrations indicated that the Ca2+ sensitivity of the hSLO-GFP channel was also similar (Fig. 2 F). Because the fusion of GFP to the C terminus of hSLO does not interfere with its functional expression, it is likely that the addition of GFP to SV1 also keeps its intrinsic characteristics. Thus, our electrophysiological results using SV1-GFP demonstrate the inability of SV1 to produce detectable currents in the plasma membrane of HEK293T cells. To determine whether SV1 reaches the plasma membrane, we directly measured the cellular localization of SV1 and compared it with the hSLO expression pattern using fluorescent confocal microscopy. Since the N terminus of the MaxiK channel is positioned extracellularly (12Meera P. Wallner M. Song M. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14066-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we used N-terminal c-Myc-tagged hSLO (Fig. 2 C) or SV1 (Fig. 2 A) and anti-c-Myc antibody to detect their surface expression in non-permeabilized cells (live cells). Fig.3 A clearly shows that hSLO was expressed in the plasma membrane (arrowheads) of HEK293T cells. The overlap of the fluorescent confocal image taken near the middle of the cells and the differential interference contrast (DIC) image show that the labeling coincided with the borders of the cells. Because cells were not permeabilized, no signal was detected inside the cells. In contrast to hSLO and under identical conditions, SV1-transfected cells showed no labeling even when the whole depth of the cells was scanned (Fig. 3 B). This lack of labeling was observed in all studied cells in four different experiments. However, when cells were permeabilized, the anti-c-Myc antibody was able to reach its target inside the cell, and labeling of SV1 could be observed. The overlap of DIC and fluorescence images indicates that SV1 expression was concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cells (Fig.3 C). Fig. 3 D is the quantification of the number of labeled cells/field (0.02 mm2) in experiments as in Fig. 3(A–C). In contrast to hSLO, SV1 showed no surface labeling; note that 40 different fields were examined. On the other hand, under permeabilized conditions, SV1 showed perinuclear labeling in every field examined, consistent with accumulation of protein in the ER. The distribution of SV1 or SV1-GFP, seen at high magnification, showed a strong network expression pattern that spread wit"
https://openalex.org/W2042731832,"α1-Adrenergic receptors (α1A, α1B, and α1D) are regulators of systemic arterial blood pressure and blood flow. Whereas vasoconstrictory action of the α1A and α1D subtypes is thought to be mainly responsible for this activity, the role of the α1B-adrenergic receptor (α1BAR) in this process is controversial. We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress either wild type or constitutively active α1BARs. Transgenic expression was under the control of the isogenic promoter, thus assuring appropriate developmental and tissue-specific expression. Cardiovascular phenotypes displayed by transgenic mice included myocardial hypertrophy and hypotension. Indicative of cardiac hypertrophy, transgenic mice displayed an increased heart to body weight ratio, which was confirmed by the echocardiographic finding of an increased thickness of the interventricular septum and posterior wall. Functional deficits included an increased isovolumetric relaxation time, a decreased heart rate, and cardiac output. Transgenic mice were hypotensive and exhibited a decreased pressor response. Vasoconstrictory regulation by α1BAR was absent as shown by the lack of phenylephrine-induced contractile differences between ex vivo mesenteric artery preparations. Plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol levels were also reduced in transgenic mice, suggesting a loss of sympathetic nerve activity. Reduced catecholamine levels together with basal hypotension, bradycardia, reproductive problems, and weight loss suggest autonomic failure, a phenotype that is consistent with the multiple system atrophy-like neurodegeneration that has been reported previously in these mice. These results also suggest that this receptor subtype is not involved in the classic vasoconstrictory action of α1ARs that is important in systemic regulation of blood pressure. α1-Adrenergic receptors (α1A, α1B, and α1D) are regulators of systemic arterial blood pressure and blood flow.

In other α1AR-expressing tissues such as liver and kidney, the function of these receptors is to regulate metabolic processes (13Kunos G. Ishac E.J.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and sodium and water reabsorption (14Kopp U.G. Dibona G.F. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 789-814Google Scholar), respectively. These responses are transduced primarily via receptor coupling to the Gq/phospholipase C pathway (5Guarino R.D. Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which leads to the subsequent activation of downstream signaling molecules including protein kinase C and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. α1-adrenergic receptor α1B-adrenergic receptor wild type α1BAR C128F single mutant α1BAR C128F/A204V/A293E triple mutant α1BAR non-transgenic non-knockout knockout atrial natriuretic factor mean arterial pressure gram body weight The progress toward elucidating the distinct regulatory role of each α1 subtype in the various physiologic responses mentioned above has been constrained by a limited number of subtype-selective agonists and antagonists. This is especially true in the α1B system where there are no selective agonists or antagonists available. We have alleviated this constraint by examining the unique attributes of the α1BAR in a transgenic mouse model that exhibits constitutive α1BAR activity targeted only to tissues that normally express the receptor. The appropriate distribution of receptor overactivity was achieved by using the mouse isogenic α1BAR promoter (15Zuscik M.J. Piascik M.T. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to drive the overexpression of a transgene containing cDNAs of either the wild type (W) hamster α1BAR (3Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randall R.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7159-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) or the constitutively active mutant forms of the receptor. Two such mutants were employed, a C128F single mutant (S) and a C128F/A204V/A293E triple mutant (T), both of which spontaneously couple to Gq (16Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R.J. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 112-122PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hwa J. Gaivin R.J. Porter J.E. Perez D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The systemic expression of constitutively active α1BARs in these transgenic mice has already led to the identification of a pathology similar to multiple system atrophy suggesting that overstimulation of these receptors leads to neurodegeneration (18Zuscik M.J. Sands S. Ross S.A. Waugh D.J.J. Gaivin R.J. Morilak D.A. Perez D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extend this examination of phenotype to the cardiovascular system. Discrete overexpression of constitutive α1BAR activity in the cardiovascular system makes these mice well suited to address questions regarding α1BAR regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis. Our findings not only confirm the involvement of the α1BAR in cardiac hypertrophy but suggest that this subtype is not involved with blood pressure-related vasoconstriction. Rather, the hypotension seems to be a manifestation of autonomic failure and not the result of a direct action of the α1B subtype in the peripheral vasculature. Understanding the α1BAR control over these processes and the manifestation of disease will further define the therapeutic potential that would come from the development of α1BAR-selective antagonists and will have an impact on the future development of novel gene therapies. The generation and genotyping of transgenic mice possessing systemic α1BAR overactivity has been described elsewhere (18Zuscik M.J. Sands S. Ross S.A. Waugh D.J.J. Gaivin R.J. Morilak D.A. Perez D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific distribution of systemic α1BAR overactivity was achieved by using the mouse α1BAR gene promoter (15Zuscik M.J. Piascik M.T. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to drive the overexpression of a transgene containing a cDNA coding for the wild type (W) α1BAR (3Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Cleveland Clinic Foundation Transgenic Core Facility injected ∼200 copies of each transgene into the pronuclei of one cell B6/CBA mouse embryos, which were surgically implanted into pseudo-pregnant female mice. 3 W, 5 single mutant, and 3 triple mutant founder mice were identified, and subsequent generations were genotyped by Southern analysis of genomic DNA extracted from tail biopsies. All phenotypic studies detailed below are carried out using equal proportions of male and female mice. Echocardiographic measurements were performed on mice according to a previously published transthoracic echocardiographic method (19Tanaka N. Dalton N. Mao L. Rockman H.A. Peterson K.L. Gottshall K.R. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Ross Jr., J. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of 0.05 mg/g ketamine HCl and 0.1 mg/g thiobutabarbital. The chest area was shaved and ultrasonic gel was applied. Measurements were made as previously described using the Acuson Sequoia 512 system (Mountain View, CA) that employed a dynamically focused symmetrical annular array transducer (13 MHz) for two-dimensional and M-mode imaging. The parasternal long and short axes and apical four chamber views were visualized. Five consecutive cycles of each parameter were measured. Cardiac output was calculated from echocardiographic data using the following equation, [π × (PA)2 × VTI × HR]/4, where PA was the diameter of the pulmonary artery, VTI was the doppler velocity time integral in the pulmonary artery, and HR was the echocardiographically determined heart rate. The measurement of the mean carotid artery blood pressure in conscious mice was performed as described previously (20Link R.E. Desai K. Hein L. Stevens M.E. Chruscinski A. Bernstein D. Barsh G.S. Kobilka B.K. Science. 1996; 273: 803-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg/g ketamine and 2 μg/g acepromazine maleate. A carotid catheter was inserted and connected to a low compliance COBE CDXIII pressure transducer (Cobe Cardiovascular, Arvada, CO). Blood pressure readings were collected on a Model 7D Polygraph (Grass Instrument Division, West Warwick, RI). The recording began immediately after surgery and continued for a 7-h period. The mean femoral artery pressure was determined in mice using a modified version of a previously described method (21Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar). The mice were anesthetized with an initial intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (0.05 mg/g) followed 5 min later by an injection of thiobutabarbital (0.1 mg/g). Supplemental doses of thiobutabarbital were delivered only when necessary to maintain stable anesthesia. A femoral catheter was inserted and connected to a low compliance COBE CDXIII pressure transducer (Cobe Cardiovascular) interfaced with an AH 60-9315 universal oscillograph (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The right femoral vein was cannulated similarly for intravenous administration of increasing amounts of phenylephrine at a delivery rate of 0.1 μl/g/min using a microinfusion pump. Four strains of mice were used for this experiment. The α1B knockout mouse (KO, C57-black) and its non-knockout control (NK mice) were bred in Glasgow from breeding pairs supplied by Professor S. Cotecchia (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) (for review see Ref. 8Cavalli A. Lattion A.-L. Hummler E. Nenniger M. Pedrazzini T. Aubert J.-F. Michel M.C. Yang M. Lembo G. Vecchione C. Mostardini M. Schmidt A. Beermann F. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11589-11594Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Tissues were also taken from the W2 α1BAR overexpressor in this study and its appropriate non-transgenic control (NT mice). Mice weighing 25–35 g (KO and their age-matched controls) or 35–55 g (overexpressed and their age-matched controls) were killed by an overdose of CO2. The mesentery was removed, and the branches of first order mesenteric artery were dissected and cleared of connective tissue before mounting on a wire myograph for isometric force recording. The arteries were bathed in Krebs solution, and the temperature was maintained at 37 °C at a pH of 7.4 with a gas mixture of 95% O2, 5% CO2 throughout the experiment. Preliminary studies employed the normalization technique of Mulvany and Halpern (22Mulvany M.J. Halpern W. Circ. Res. 1977; 41: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar) in 1977 to obtain vessel internal diameter and normalized resting tension. Thereafter, the vessel segments were set at 0.17 mg of resting tension before construction of concentration response curves. After a “priming” protocol involving challenges of norepinephrine (10 μm) and/or KCl (50 mm), tissues were washed and allowed 30 min before beginning construction of a cumulative concentration response curve to phenylephrine (1–10 μm). The potency of the agonist was determined by comparing EC50 values (concentration required to produce 50% of maximum response) obtained in each tissue. Mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of thiobutabarbital (0.125 mg/g). An abdominal incision was made, and blood samples were obtained via venipuncture of the vena cava either 5 min after application of the anesthetic or after 1 h of stable anesthesia. Total plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels were determined in 100 μl of plasma samples using the commercially available plasma catecholamines by high pressure liquid chromatography kit (Bio-Rad). Plasma cortisol levels were determined in parallel in 100 μl of plasma samples using the commercially available fluorescence polarization immunoassay kit (Abbott). All reported errors and error bars represent S.E., and significance was determined using either an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test (p < 0.05) or a one-way analysis of variance (see Figure and Table Legends). We have previously described the genotypic and initial phenotypic analysis of systemic α1BAR mice (18Zuscik M.J. Sands S. Ross S.A. Waugh D.J.J. Gaivin R.J. Morilak D.A. Perez D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), confirming transgene integration. The tissue-specific overexpression of wild type and mutant α1BARs was confirmed via saturation binding analysis of various tissues from F1 and F2 generation of heterozygous mice. Of the seven transmitting founder lines, five exhibited significant transgene overexpression including two W lines (W1 and W2), one single mutant line (S1), and two triple mutant lines (T1 and T2). The distribution and magnitude of receptor overexpression were not significantly different among the various lines as expected for the housekeeping nature of the promoter. The level of α1BAR overexpression was ∼2-fold in the heart with greater overexpression seen in the liver, lung, brain, and spleen (18Zuscik M.J. Sands S. Ross S.A. Waugh D.J.J. Gaivin R.J. Morilak D.A. Perez D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Confirming constitutive signaling of these overexpressed receptors in the transgenic lines, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels were significantly higher in kidneys from W2+/−, S1+/−, and T2+/− mice than in age-matched NT mice (Fig. 1). Similar constitutive stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate metabolism has been previously shown in the liver (18Zuscik M.J. Sands S. Ross S.A. Waugh D.J.J. Gaivin R.J. Morilak D.A. Perez D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The rank order increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pool size seen among the various lines (T2 > S1 > W2) corresponds with the strength of constitutive signaling that was found for these receptors in vitro (16Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R.J. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 112-122PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hwa J. Gaivin R.J. Porter J.E. Perez D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It should be noted that when bred to homozygosity, mice overexpressing constitutively active mutant forms of the α1BAR (S1 and T2) displayed reproductive problems. This was not seen in the W2 line, suggesting that reproductive failure was unlikely the result of breeding artifacts. Therefore, all phenotypic analyses were performed on heterozygotes. All transgenic lines also displayed a 20–30% reduction in body weight, but this was only apparent in older mice that were more than 12 months of age (18Zuscik M.J. Sands S. Ross S.A. Waugh D.J.J. Gaivin R.J. Morilak D.A. Perez D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). α1ARs have been shown to evoke a hypertrophic response in cultured cardiac myocytes (23Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Chien K.R. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the regulation of this process predominated by the α1Asubtype (25Knowlton K.U. Michel M.C. Itani M. Shubeita H.E.

Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1515-1523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because myocardial-targeted overexpression of constitutively active α1BARs has also been shown to cause cardiac hypertrophy in mice (11Milano C.A. Dolber P.C. Rockman H.A. Bond R.A. Venable M.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we performed morphologic and echocardiographic analyses in the context of our systemic transgenic model. Indicative of a hypertrophic phenotype, W2, S1, T1, and T2 mice showed an increased heart to body weight (heart/Bw) ratio compared with age-matched (4–6 months) NT control mice (Fig.2). Body weight was not significantly different among the lines at 4–6 months of age. It should be noted that other organs including the liver, kidneys, lungs, and brain did not exhibit a change in mass relative to body weight (data not shown). Increases in heart mass ranged between 12 and 41% with S1 mice showing the largest increase. These findings were confirmed echocardiographically in W2, S1, and T2 mice, which showed an increased thickness of the posterior wall and interventricular septum compared with age-matched NT control mice (Table I).Table IEchocardiographic analysesWall thicknessLeft ventricle dimensionsHeart functionIVSPWLVIDdLVIDs%FSIVRTHR (echo)HR (cuff)COmm/gBwmm/gBwmm/gBwmm/gBwmsbeats/minbeats/minml/minNT0.031 ± 0.0020.027 ± 0.0010.074 ± 0.0020.028 ± 0.00262.2 ± 1.215.70 ± 1.2573 ± 53681 ± 6724.0 ± 3.3W2+/−0.036 ± 0.0020.034 ± 0.001*0.113 ± 0.011*0.057 ± 0.010*49.6 ± 6.225.50 ± 1.7*344 ± 42*607 ± 46*10.4 ± 1.2*S1+/−0.040 ± 0.002*0.034 ± 0.001*0.102 ± 0.003*0.044 ± 0.006*57.9 ± 5.029.17 ± 3.1*337 ± 16*590 ± 63*18.3 ± 1.1T2+/−0.041 ± 0.002*0.039 ± 0.003*0.100 ± 0.008*0.049 ± 0.008*51.2 ± 4.627.06 ± 3.2*382 ± 41*588 ± 55*15.2 ± 1.8*12-month-old mice were anesthetized with 0.05 mg/gBw ketaset and 0.1 mg/gBw inactin, and the chest area was shaved and swabbed with ultrasound gel. Several cardiac parameters were echocardiographically determined including interventricular septal thickness (IVS), posterior wall thickness (PW), left ventricular internal dimension in diastole (LVIDd) and in systole (LVIDs), isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), and heart rate (HR (echo)). For comparison, HR was also determined in conscious mice via a tail cuff.

Molecular confirmation of cardiac hypertrophy was attempted by measuring ANF message levels via Northern blot analysis of poly(A) mRNA purified from 8-month-old NT and T2 mouse hearts. ANF, a gene often associated with cardiac hypertrophy (27Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB. J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), was not up-regulated in T2 mice relative to the NT controls (data not shown), suggesting that the morphologic and echocardiographic findings are indicative of an early stage hypertrophy. Besides our model, the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mouse (28Vikstrom K.L. Factor S.M. Leinwand L.A. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 556-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also shows hypertrophy in the absence of ANFup-regulation, suggesting that the progression of cardiac hypertrophy is not always strictly associated with the up-regulation ofANF (29Vikstrom K.L.

Another more likely reason for the lack of ANF up-regulation is the low level of α1BAR overexpression present in our model. For example, the Gαq overexpression mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy (30D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) displayed no change in ANF expression with a 2-fold increase in the Gαq protein, a circumstance similar to the 2-fold overexpression of cardiac α1BARs in our mice. However, a 4-fold increase in Gαq was sufficient to invoke ANFtranscription. These findings collectively indicate that a threshold of expression may be necessary to evoke changes in fetal gene transcription. Despite an increased ventricular diameter in both diastole and systole, the cardiac output in the transgenic lines was lower than that seen in NT mice (Table I). This probably is attributed to the decreased heart rate and increased isovolumetric relaxation time displayed by transgenic animals (Table I). The decreased heart rate, which was confirmed via a tail cuff measurement in conscious mice (Table I), may be the result of a direct effect on Purkinje fiber automaticity, which is thought to be controlled by the α1BAR (31Balzo U.D. Rosen M.R. Malfatto G. Kaplan L.M. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 1535-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the overexpression of the receptor. A similar decrease in heart rate was also found in the heart-targeted Gαq-overexpressing mouse (30D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn G.W., II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Overall, because α1BARs are coupled to Gαq, the decrease in heart rate may be directly related to signaling events downstream of α1BAR activation, or it may be part of the autonomic dysfunction, which we describe later. Interestingly, a robust myocardial overexpression (>40-fold) of the wild type α1BAR has been shown to cause increased diacylglycerol content and ANF mRNA without inducing the morphological hallmarks of hypertrophy (12Akhter S.A. Milano C.A. Shotwell K.F. Cho M.-C. Rockman H.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21253-21259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). One conclusion that can be drawn from this earlier study is that only constitutively active α1BARs can induce hypertrophy. This raises the possibility that constitutively active receptors may signal through different pathways than wild type receptors. However, in arguing against this possibility, modest developmental and tissue-specific overexpression (2-fold in the heart) of wild type α1BARs in our mice caused a cardiac hypertrophy that was less robust but similar to that seen in the heart-targeted constitutively active α1BAR mouse. Unlike the heart-targeted model, our model may be exhibiting a phenotype that more genuinely represents the end point impact of α1BAR action in the heart because our use of the isogenic α1BAR promoter facilitates transgene overexpression in all α1BAR-expressing cardiac cell types, not just cardiac myocytes. Overall, because several experimentally distinct approaches to genetically induce α1BAR overactivity have independently led to the manifestation of a somewhat similar cardiac phenotype, the emergence of that phenotype must be α1BAR-dependent and not simply the spurious outcome of transgenic manipulation. Based on this assumption, we assert that in addition to the α1AAR, the α1BAR plays an important regulatory role in the progression of the hypertrophic program in cardiac tissue. The α1ARs are widely expressed in the peripheral arteries (4Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Malik N. Gaivin R.J. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 823-831PubMed Google Scholar, 5Guarino R.D. Perez D.M.

Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This modification entails the addition of a butylamine residue derived from spermidine to a highly conserved lysine of inactive eIF-5A, resulting in the formation of the unusual amino acid, hypusine, and activated eIF-5A (2Park M.H. Wolff E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15264-15269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first reaction leading to the formation of hypusine is catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS; EC 1.1.1.249), an enzyme that adds butylamine to the conserved lysine of eIF-5A to form deoxyhypusine. A subsequent reaction in which deoxyhypusine is converted to hypusine is catalyzed by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.99.29) (2Park M.H. Wolff E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15264-15269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hypusine modification apparently ensues immediately following translation of eIF-5A inasmuch as there is no accumulation of either eIF-5A precursor (lysine form) or eIF-5A intermediate (deoxyhypusine form) unless cells are treated with inhibitors of either deoxyhypusine synthase or deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Hypusine-containing eIF-5A is not required for global protein synthesis. Indeed, in eIF-5A-deficient yeast, protein synthesis is only inhibited by ∼30%, and this is accompanied by only a slight change in the polysome profile (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 4Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. BioFactors. 1993; 4: 95-104PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3934-3940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, activated eIF-5A appears to facilitate the translation of specific subsets of mRNA. For example, yeast cells in which DHS has been inactivated are incapable of dividing and simply enlarge (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Park M.H. Joe Y.A. Kay W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1677-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These observations have prompted the proposal that hypusine-containing eIF-5A facilitates translation of the subset of mRNAs required for cell division and hence is necessary for cell proliferation (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 7Tome M.E. Gerner E.W. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarly, inhibitors of the synthesis of spermidine, which is required for DHS activity, have been shown to decrease cell division (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 7Tome M.E. Gerner E.W. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Jakus J. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13151-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it seems clear that hypusine-containing eIF-5A facilitates protein synthesis, the way in which it does so is not fully understood. The protein was initially identified as a putative translation initiation factor based on its ability to stimulate methionyl-puromycin synthesis under in vitro conditions (9Kemper W.M. Berry K.W. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5551-5557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this has since been questioned in light of the fact that a similar effect on translation is not observed in situ (10Bevec D. Hauber J. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Zuk D. Jacobson A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). More recent evidence suggests that eIF-5A facilitates protein synthesis by promoting nuclear export of specific mRNAs (10Bevec D. Hauber J. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that eIF-5A may be involved in mRNA turnover, acting downstream of decapping (11Zuk D. Jacobson A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2914-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Isoforms of the gene encoding eIF-5A have also been isolated from plant tissue. For example, two isoforms of eIF-5A exhibiting tissue-specific expression have been isolated from tobacco (GenBankTMaccession numbers X635411 and X635412) (12Chamot D. Kuhlemeier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and recently DHS was also cloned from tobacco (GenBankTM accession number AJ242017) (13Ober D. Hartmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32040-32047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The eIF-5A gene has also been cloned from humans (GenBankTM accession number I53801), fungi (GenBankTM accession numbers P19211 and P23301), yeast (GenBankTM accession number D83166), Zea mays(GenBankTM accession number Y07920), Solanum tuberosum (GenBankTM accession numbers AB004823 toAB004827), and alfalfa (GenBankTM accession number X59441). However, apart from an expected involvement in translation, no specific function has yet been ascribed to plant DHS and hypusine-containing eIF-5A. The finding that there are isoforms of the plant eIF-5A gene has prompted the proposal that the different isoforms facilitate the translation of subsets of mRNA required for specific physiological functions, including photosynthesis (12Chamot D. Kuhlemeier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present study, we describe the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones from tomato that encode DHS and eIF-5A. Of particular interest is the finding that these genes are both up-regulated at the onset of natural senescence and in the event of cell death attributable to environmental stress, for this indicates that hypusine-modified eIF-5A may facilitate translation of the suite of mRNAs required for programmed cell death. Tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum, cv. Match) were grown in 8-inch pots for 8 weeks under greenhouse conditions. By this stage, the seedlings had developed three pairs of leaves. Cotyledons for Western blot analysis were harvested at 5, 7, 11, 15, and 20 days after planting. Flowers for Northern blot analysis were harvested at tight bud and open plus senescing stages of development. Fruit for Northern analysis was harvested at breaker (one-tenth of the surface area beginning to turn color), pink, red firm, and red soft stages of development. For preparation of a cDNA library, total RNA was isolated from drought-stressed leaves of 8-week-old tomato seedlings according to Davis et al. (14Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York, NY1986: 130-135Crossref Google Scholar). Drought stress was induced by removing the roots from the seedlings and placing the cut stems in 2m sorbitol for 6 h. Poly(A)+-RNA was purified using a Poly(A)tract mRNA Isolation System (Promega). Double-stranded cDNA was prepared using the ZAP express cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). Approximately 5 × 105clones were screened with a DHS probe obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp DNA Thermal Cycler, model 2400). Template RNA for RT-PCR was isolated from leaves of 8-week-old tomato plants that had been chill-injured for 2 days at 5 °C in a growth chamber (16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod) and subsequently rewarmed for 6 h in the greenhouse. Reverse transcription was performed by adding 500 ng of total RNA, 50 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm of each dNTP, 1 unit of RNase inhibitor, and 2.5 μm oligo(dT) primer (5′-GACTGCAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) containing ClaI,PstI, and SalI restriction enzyme sites to 20 μl of 1× RT-PCR buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min, at 42 °C for 50 min, and then heated to 99 °C for 5 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase. The cDNA product was amplified with 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 μl of reverse transcription product, 1× PCR buffer plus MgCl2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm of each dNTP, 1 μmupstream primer (5′-AGTCTAGAAGGTGCTCGTCCTGAT-3′), and 1 μm oligo(dT) primer. The PCR parameters were 1 min of template denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of primer annealing at 58 °C, and 2 min of primer extension at 72 °C for 35 cycles. The PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels, excised withSalI and XbaI, and ligated into SalI- and XbaI-excised pBluescript KS(+) plasmid (Stratagene). Positive clones obtained by screening the cDNA library with this DHS probe were recovered using the ExAssist Helper Phage/SOLR strain system and recircularized in pBluescript SK(−) phagemid (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was isolated by alkaline lysis (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.38-1.39Google Scholar) and sequenced at MOBIX (McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). The open reading frame of tomato DHS cDNA was compiled and analyzed using the BLAST Search (GenBankTM, Bethesda, MD), and sequence alignments were achieved using the BCM Search Launcher (available on the World Wide Web). One full-lengthArabidopsis and four full-length tomato cDNA clones encoding eIF-5A were obtained by PCR using an Arabidopsissenescing leaf cDNA library and the environmental stressed tomato leaf cDNA library as templates, respectively. ForArabidopsis eIF-5A, partial-length cDNA clones were obtained using the internal upstream primer (5′-AAARRYCGMCCYTGCAAGGT-3′) with T7 (5′-AATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) as a downstream primer and the internal downstream primer (5′-TCYTTNCCYTCMKCTAAHCC-3′) with T3 (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′) as an upstream primer. For tomato eIF-5As, partial-length cDNA clones were obtained using the internal upstream primer (5′-AAARRYCGMCCYTGCAAGGT-3′) with T7 as a downstream primer and the internal downstream primer (5′-ACYTCMACHACCTTGCARGG-3′) with T3 as an upstream primer. Internal primers were designed from the tobacco eIF-5A sequences (12Chamot D. Kuhlemeier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cDNA products were amplified with 2.5 units of Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 1–5 μl of template cDNA, 1× PCR buffer plus MgCl2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm of each dNTP, 1 μm upstream primer, and 1 μm downstream primer. The PCR parameters were 1 min of template denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of primer annealing at 48 or 52 °C, and 2 min of primer extension at 72 °C for 35 cycles. The PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript KS(+) plasmid and sequenced. Full-length cDNAs were obtained by PCR using specific primers designed from the sequences of the partial-length cDNA PCR products and Arabidopsis and tomato leaf cDNA libraries as templates. Tomato DHS and Arabidopsis eIF-5A were subcloned into the GST fusion vector, pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using BamHI and SalI restriction sites and overexpressed in E. coli DH5α. Overnight cultures were transferred to 10 times volume of fresh 2× YT. After 2 h of initial growth in 2× YT at 37 °C, 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the cultures, and growth was continued for an additional 4 h at 30 °C before the cells were harvested. The GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography according to the vector manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and treated for 16 h with the protease, factor Xa (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (1 μg of protease per 100 μg of GST fusion protein) to release recombinant DHS and eIF-5A protein. The purity of the recombinant proteins was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gels). Polyclonal antibodies against DHS were raised in rabbits using tomato recombinant protein eluted from SDS-polyacrylamide gels as antigen. The enzyme activity of recombinant tomato DHS was assayed according to Park and Wolff (2Park M.H. Wolff E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15264-15269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bevec et al. (16Bevec D. Kappel B. Jaksche H. Csonga R. Hauber J. Klier H. Steinkasserer A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with slight modification. GST-DHS and GST-eIF-5A fusion proteins were digested with factor Xa in order to release GST, and the products of this digestion, GST plus DHS and GST plus eIF-5A, were used for the assay. The standard reaction mixture contained 5 μg of GST plus DHS, 20 μg of GST plus eIF-5A, 0.5 μCi of [3H]spermidine-HCl ([terminal methylene-3H]spermidine; 15 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 mm NAD+, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 0.3 m glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) buffer in a total volume of 200 μl. In control reaction mixtures, GST plus DHS and GST plus eIF-5A were replaced by corresponding amounts of GST. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, and 30 μl was then withdrawn and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15%). Radiolabeled bands were visualized by soaking the gel in a fix solution (isopropyl alcohol/water/acetic acid, 25:65:10) for 30 min and for a further 30 min in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gel was then dried and exposed for 6 days using a preflashed film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (10 μg) was fractionated on 1.0% denatured formaldehyde-agarose gels and immobilized on Hybon-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization conditions were as described by Wang and Arteca (17Wang T-W. Arteca R.N. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For Western analysis, homogenate protein (20 μg) was fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was carried out according to Wanget al. (18Wang T-W. Balsamo R.A. Ratnayake C. Platt K.A. Ting J.T.L. Huang A.H.C. Plant J. 1997; 11: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using antiserum from rabbit as the primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Genomic DNA was isolated from tomato leaves and digested with the restriction endonucleases,EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, andXbaI. The digested products (10 μg of DNA) were fractionated on a 1.0% agarose gel, immobilized on a nylon membrane, and hybridized with DHS cDNA as for Northern analysis. Chlorophyll was assayed as described by Porraet al. (19Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Protein was measured according to Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Leakage of electrolytes from chill-injured leaves was measured as a change in conductivity of leaf diffusates (21Wright M. Simon E.W. J. Exp. Bot. 1973; 24: 400-411Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using a Conductivity Bridge model 31 (Yellow Springs Instruments, Inc.). A full-length cDNA clone encoding tomato DHS (GenBankTM accession number AF296077) was isolated by screening a cDNA library prepared from sorbitol-treated leaves with a probe obtained by RT-PCR. The cDNA contains 1610 base pairs, including a 53-base pair 5′-noncoding sequence and a 414-base pair 3′-noncoding sequence, and encodes a 381-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 42.1 kDa (Fig.1). The derived amino acid sequence of tomato DHS cDNA has high homology with the amino acid sequences of human DHS (GenBankTM accession number 1352267), yeast DHS (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GenBankTM accession number 731670), fungal DHS (Neurospora crassa, GenBankTM accession number 1352268), Archaeobacteria DHS (Methanococcus janaschii, GenBankTMaccession number 2498303), and tobacco DHS (GenBankTMaccession number AJ242017) (Fig. 2). The tomato DHS sequence also has high homology with anArabidopsis genomic clone (GenBankTM accession number AB017060) that has not been functionally annotated. Using primers designed from this sequence and the tomato DHS sequence, PCR products encoding Arabidopsis DHS, carnation DHS, and banana DHS were cloned using senescing Arabidopsis leaf, carnation flower, and ripening banana fruit cDNA libraries as templates. Full-length cDNA clones encoding Arabidopsis DHS (GenBankTM accession number AF296078), carnation DHS (GenBankTM accession number AF296079), and banana DHS (GenBankTM accession number AF296080) were subsequently obtained by screening these libraries with the PCR products, and the derived amino acid sequences proved to have high homology with the tomato DHS amino acid sequence (Fig. 2).Figure 2Alignment of the amino acid sequences of DHS from tomato, tobacco, carnation, banana, Arabidopsis, human, fungi (N. crassa), yeast (S. cerevisiae), and Archaeobacteria (M. janaschii).

In these experiments, 8-week-old plants bearing 3–4 pairs of leaves were derooted by cutting the stem at the soil surface, and the aerial part of the plant was placed in 2 msorbitol, a treatment known to induce osmotic stress (17Wang T-W. Arteca R.N. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The abundance of DHS transcript in preparations of total RNA increased substantially within 6 h of treatment with sorbitol but showed no increase over the same period in leaf RNA preparations from control derooted plants placed in water (Fig.3 A). Indeed, no increase in DHS transcript level was apparent even after 18 h for the water control plants, indicating that the up-regulation of DHS expression observed for leaves of sorbitol-treated plants reflected osmotic stress rather than a wound effect arising from the derooting procedure. This was further confirmed by simply withholding water from derooted plants. Within 6 h, the water-deprived plants were wilted, and there was an increase in DHS transcript level comparable with that induced by treatment with sorbitol (data not shown). In addition, treatment of the plants for up to 20 h with 1 ppm ethylene had no effect on DHS transcript level, indicating that the up-regulation of DHS in response to sorbitol treatment or withholding water is not induced by the increase in ethylene production that normally accompanies drought stress (17Wang T-W. Arteca R.N. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Expression of the tomato leaf DHS gene is also up-regulated in response to chilling injury. In these experiments, total RNA for Northern blots was isolated from the second leaf pairs of 8-week-old potted plants that had been exposed to 5 °C in a growth chamber for varying periods of time and subsequently allowed to rewarm at ambient temperature in the greenhouse. The degree of chilling injury was assessed by determining the conductivity of leaf diffusates, which is a measure of membrane leakiness (21Wright M. Simon E.W. J. Exp. Bot. 1973; 24: 400-411Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For plants chilled for 2 days at 5 °C with no subsequent rewarming (C2W0 plants), there was no up-regulation of DHS expression and no change in leaf diffusate conductivity (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). However, in keeping with the fact that chilling injury is more strongly manifested during subsequent rewarming (22Sharom M. Willemot C. Thompson J.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), there was a substantial increase in DHS transcript abundance coincident with a slight increase in membrane leakage within 6 h of rewarming (C2W6 plants) (Fig. 4, lane 3). The C2W6 plants also exhibited slight wilting symptoms. Within 24 h of rewarming (C2W24 plants), wilting symptoms had completely disappeared, diffusate conductivity had returned to normal, and DHS transcript abundance was at background levels, indicating that expression of the gene had been down-regulated (Fig. 4, lane 4). Thus, DHS expression was up-regulated coincident with the onset of symptoms of chilling injury and down-regulated during recovery from the low temperature episode. In order to confirm that changes in expression of DHS are correlated with the onset of chilling injury rather than recovery, tomato plants were subjected to more severe chilling injury by exposing them to 5 °C for 2 days followed by rewarming at ambient temperature for 1 day and a further 3-day 5 °C chilling episode with no subsequent rewarming (C3W0 plants). This resulted in stronger up-regulation of DHS expression and extensive membrane leakage reflecting chilling injury (Fig. 4, lane 5). The C3W0 plants also exhibited strong wilting symptoms. After a 6-h rewarming period (C3W6 plants), there was still high expression of DHS and extensive membrane damage (Fig. 4, lane 6), and the plants were still visibly wilted. However, after a 24-h period of rewarming (C3W24), the plants were beginning to regain turgor; diffusate conductivity, although still high by comparison with background levels, was lower, reflecting repair of membrane damage; and DHS expression was only barely detectable (Fig. 4, lane 7). Indeed, within 48 h of returning the C3W0 plants to ambient temperature, the plants regained full turgor. These observations collectively indicate that DHS expression is up-regulated coincident with the onset of chilling injury but is not required for the recovery phase. In a final set of experiments, tomato plants were exposed to 5 °C continuously for 6 days with no subsequent rewarming (C6W0 plants). These plants were severely wilted and showed high levels of DHS expression as well as extensive membrane damage as reflected by high leaf diffusate conductivity (Fig. 4, lane 8). During a subsequent 6-h rewarming period (C6W6 plants), DHS expression was further up-regulated, and there was a slight further increase in leakage (Fig. 4, lane 9). After 24 h of rewarming (C6W24 plants), DHS expression had begun to abate, membrane damage was still extensive, and the leaves showed visual symptoms of dying (Fig. 4, lane 10), and after 48 h at ambient temperature, the leaves were crinkly and dead. Thus, 6 days of continuous exposure to 5 °C with no intermittent opportunity for recovery proved to be a lethal episode of chilling during which there was strong expression of DHS. DHS expression is also up-regulated during natural senescence. This was demonstrated by probing Northern blots of total RNA from tomato flowers and fruit at different stages of development with radiolabeled DHS cDNA. Levels of DHS transcript were barely detectable in flower buds and greatly enhanced in preparations of total RNA isolated from a mixture of open and senescing flowers (Fig.5 A). The abundance of DHS transcript also proved to be very low in breaker tomato fruit, pink fruit, and fully ripe red firm fruit but increased substantially as fully ripe fruit began to soften coincident with the onset of senescence (Fig. 5 B). These observations indicate that DHS expression is not required for fruit ripening and is only up-regulated when the fully ripened fruit begins to senesce. In order to confirm that up-regulated expression of the DHS gene reflected increased expression of its cognate protein, Western blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant DHS protein. This is illustrated for developing tomato cotyledons in Fig.6. Food reserves are stored in the cotyledonary tissue of seeds, and during germination the cotyledons senesce and their food reserves are mobilized to support growth. DHS protein was not detectable in cotyledon tissue after 5 days of germination but was minimally present by day 7, reached a peak by day 15 coincident with maximal levels of chlorophyll in the tissue, and stayed high between days 15 and 20 as chlorophyll levels began to decline and the cotyledons became visibly senescent (Fig. 6,A and B). DHS mRNA levels increased between days 7 and 11 after germination and remained high through to day 20 coincident with the onset of cotyledon senescence (Figs. 6,A and B). Thus, mRNA and protein levels for DHS began to increase well before the onset of a decline in chlorophyll levels, one of the first manifestations of senescence execution, indicating that the enzyme may be involved in the upstream regulatory control of senescence. Full-length cDNA clones for four isoforms of tomato eIF-5A (eIF-5A1, GenBankTM accession number AF296083; eIF-5A2, GenBankTM accession number AF296084; eIF-5A3, GenBankTM accession number AF296085; eIF-5A4, GenBankTM accession number AF296086) were isolated by PCR using the cDNA library prepared from sorbitol-treated leaves as a template and primers designed from tobacco eIF-5A (GenBankTM accession numbers X635411 and X635412). The tomato eIF-5A sequences are 89–92% identical at the amino acid level and 70–80% identical at the nucleotide level, and they are also closely similar (80–97% identity at the amino acid level to other plant eIF-5A sequences (Table I). The extent of sequence identity is lower (50–60% at the amino acid level) when the tomato eIF-5A sequences are compared with those of human, fungi, and yeast (Table I).Table IAmino acid (upper value) and nucleotide (lower value) eIF-5A sequence identitiesTomato-1 (AF296083)Tomato-2 (AF296084)Tomato-3 (AF296085)Tomato-4 (AF296086)%%%%Tomato-110089.491.292.5(AF296083)(100)(76.5)(79.7)(70.4)Tomato-289.410091.992.5(AF296084)(76.5)(100)(79.9)(77.7)Tomato-391.291.910090.0(AF296085)(79.7)(79.9)(100)(80.3)Tomato-492.592.590.0100(AF296086)(70.4)(77.7)(80.3)(100)Arabidopsis88.185.689.987.5(AF296082)(78.0)(76.8)(80.8)(76.2)Carnation82.581.280.681.9(AF296081)(79.4)(77.7)(77.0)(77.4)Corn86.986.386.986.3(Y07920)(75.8)(76.3)(77.0)(75.3)Potato-192.592.590.097.5(AB004827)(79.1)(86.7)(80.7)(98.1)Potato-292.592.590.097.5(AB004823)(78.7)(87.0)(80.5)(97.7)Tobacco-196.689.093.189.7(X63541"
https://openalex.org/W1551447396,"We found in the present study that stimulation of A2A adenosine receptors (A2A-R) prevents apoptosis in PC12 cells. This A2A-protective effect was blocked by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors and was not observed in a PKA-deficient PC12 variant. Stimulation of PKA also prevented apoptosis, suggesting that PKA is required for the protective effect of A2A-R. A general PKC inhibitor, but not down-regulation of conventional and novel PKCs, readily blocked the protective effect of A2A-R stimulation and PKA activation, suggesting that atypical PKCs (aPKCs) serve a critical role downstream of PKA. Consistent with this hypothesis, stimulation of A2A-R or PKA enhanced nuclear aPKC activity. In addition, the A2A-protective effect was blocked by a specific inhibitor of one aPKC, PKCζ, whereas overexpression of a dominant-positive PKCζ enhanced survival. In contrast, inhibitors of MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not modulate the A2A-protective effect. Dominant-negative Akt also did not alter the A2A-protective effect, whereas it significantly reduced the protective action of nerve growth factor. Collectively, these data suggest that aPKCs can function downstream of PKA to mediate the A2A-R-promoted survival of PC12 cells. Furthermore, the results indicate that different extracellular stimuli can employ distinct signaling pathways to protect against apoptosis induced by the same insult.

Adenosine, which is released from metabolically active cells by facilitated diffusion or is generated extracellularly by degradation of released ATP, is a potent biological mediator (1Daval J.-L. Nehlig A. Nicolas F. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1435-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is well known that adenosine modulates the activity of numerous cell types including various neuronal populations, platelets, neutrophils, and smooth muscle cells (1Daval J.-L. Nehlig A. Nicolas F. Life Sci. 1991; 49: 1435-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To date, four adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) have been identified. These receptors all contain seven transmembrane domains and belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorA2A-RA2A adenosine receptorCGSCGS 21680CSC8-(3-chlorostyryl)-caffeinePKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseaPKCsatypical PKCsPP2Aprotein phosphates 2A, PDD, phorbol-12,13-didecanoatePBSphosphate-buffered salineMTT3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideFKforskolinPPaseprotein phosphataseOKAokadaic acidCaly Acalyculin ABiMBisindolylmaleimide I-HClNGFnerve growth factorNF-κBnuclear factor-κBPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePKC+dominant-positive PKCdnAkta dominant-negative AktGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumERKextracellular signal-regulated kinase family (2Olah M.E.

DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, the rat A2A-R gene is heavily expressed by striatal neurons and colocalizes with the D2dopamine receptor in GABAergic striopallidal neurons (5Ferre S. O'Connor W.T. Fuxe K. Ungerstedt U. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 5402-5406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Low level A2A-R expression is also observed in the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and other areas of the brain (6Rosin D.L. Robeva A. Woodard R.L. Guyenet P.G. Linden J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 401: 163-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Importantly, A2A-R has been regarded as a potential therapeutic target in protecting against neurodegeneration (e.g. Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease; see Refs. 7Richardson P.J. Kase H.

Raingeaud J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that stimulation of A2A-R increases intracellular cAMP formation and activates novel protein kinase C isozymes in PC12 cells (13Chern Y. Chiou J.-Y. Lai H.-L. Tsai M.-H.

In the present study, we found that activation of A2A-R prevents apoptosis in serum-deprived PC12 cells. This protective mechanism involves transient enhancement of PKA activity and subsequent activation of atypical PKCs (aPKCs) and requires the activity of a serine-threonine protein phosphatase (PPase).

Cells were plated at the density of 3 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate. After 24 h, cells were treated with the indicated reagent(s) for another 24 h and harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Sarkosyl, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K), and incubated at 50 °C for 3 h. RNase (2 mg/ml) was added to the lysate for another 15 h. The lysate was extracted with 200 μl of phenol/chloroform and then centrifuged again for 5 min. DNA fragments present in the supernatant were separated using a 2% agarose gel. Cells grown on 150-mm plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in DMEM. The resuspended cells were plated on 96-well plates (1.5 × 104 cells/well) and treated with the indicated reagent(s) for 24 h. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] was then added to the medium (1 mg/ml), and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Me2SO (100 μl) was then applied to the medium to dissolve the formazan crystal derived from mitochondrial cleavage of the tetrazolium ring of MTT. The absorbency at 570 nm in each well was measured on a micro-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. None of the reagents used in this study interfered with the MTT values. PKC activity was measured as described previously (14Lai H.L. Yang T.H. Messing R.O. Chin Y.H. Lin S.C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. To measure atypical PKC activity, PC12 cells were first treated with PDD (1 μm) for 20 h to down-regulate conventional and novel PKCs. Cells were then washed with twice DMEM and incubated with the indicated reagents for the desired period of time. Different fractions of cells were then collected as described below. PKC activity was measured in a 40-μl reaction containing 136 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Na2HPO4, 0.3 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmMg2SO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm glucose, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.2. Reactions were started by adding 150 μm of substrate (ε peptide, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and 100 μm of [γ-32P]ATP (2 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The samples were centrifuged at 7,500 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were then spotted on 2 × 2-cm phosphocellulose squares (Whatman P-81), washed three times using 75 mm phosphoric acid, and once using 75 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Radioactivity retained on the P-81 papers were measured by scintillation counting. PKCζ activity was assayed as described above except that a PKCζ-specific pseudosubstrate peptide (sequence 113–129; SIYRRGARRWRK-LYRAN) was added during the assay to block the PKCζ activity. PKCζ activity in PC12 cells was determined as the difference between the PKC activity assayed in the absence and in the presence of 300 μm PKCζ-specific pseudosubstrate peptide (17Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Boone R.H. Matthews L.H. Zhou G. Coleman E.S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PKC activity increased linearly for up to 30 min using up to 30 μg of protein. Membrane, cytosol, and nuclear fractions were isolated as described by Zhou et al. (18Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3110-31137Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 2 min), resuspended, and incubated in 1 ml of PKC sonication buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 100 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm NaF) at room temperature for 2 min, and chilled on ice for 5 min. Nonidet P-40 was added to 1% (v/v) final concentration. Samples were forced once through a 20-gauge needle and then MgCl2 was added to 5 mm. The samples were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to collect the nuclear fractions in the pellets. The supernatants were collected as the non-nuclear fraction or were further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 45 min to separate the cytosol and membrane fractions. The pellets (i.e. the membrane fractions) were resuspended in 300 μl of PKC sonication buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The nuclear fractions were resuspended in 150 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 425 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 80 μg/ml PMSF, 1 mm NaVO4, 20 mm NaF, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 25% glycerol) and incubated for 30 min on ice. The nuclear samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to collect nuclear extracts in the supernatants. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent. PC12 cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 2 μm aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, and 0.5 μm OKA). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 7,500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was utilized for the Western blot analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent. Equal amounts of sample were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide gels. The resolved proteins were then electroblotted onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the desired primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the corresponding secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then washed and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and recorded using Kodak XAR-5 film. All plasmids used in transient transfection experiments were prepared by CsCl purification. Cells were transfected using TfxTM (Promega), following the manufacturer's protocol, and then harvested between 48 and 72 h post-transfection. Transfection efficiency was typically between 10 and 15%. For survival analyses, cells were transiently transfected with a control vector or with vectors encoding the gene of interest along with one-seventh of the molar amount of an expression construct (pEGFP, CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA) encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), as indicated. Two days post-transfection, cells were subjected to serum deprivation for 24 h. Transfected cells were identified by GFP expression. Survival was determined as percentage of GFP-expressing cells by counting GFP-expressing cells in photomicrographs taken using a fluorescent microscope and normalized to the total number of cells counted from the corresponding photomicrographs of cells examined by phase contrast. An average of 1500 to 4000 total cells was counted for each experimental condition. Alternatively, GFP-expressing cells were quantified by flow cytometry as indicated below. These two methods produced similar results for the percentage of GFP-expressing cells. The survival index of 100% is designated as the percentage of GFP-expressing cells transfected with a control vector under the indicated treatment conditions. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmid construct plus one-seventh the amount of GFP vector. Forty eight hours post-transfection, serum was withdrawn for 24 h, and cells were analyzed for the expression of GFP by gently removing the cells from plates with PBS containing trypsin (0.15%) and EDTA (0.53 mm) and then analyzing cell samples by flow cytometry with a Becton Dickinson FACScan. The transfected cells were identified by the expression of GFP that was detected using the FL-1 channel (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 530/30 nm). For each transfected plasmid, 30,000 cells were analyzed. Unless indicated otherwise, results were analyzed by one-way analyses of variance. Differences between means were assessed by the Student-Newman-Keuls method and were considered significant where p < 0.05. Serum deprivation for 24 h resulted in significant DNA fragmentation in PC12 cells (Fig.1 A). Serum deprivation also decreased cell survival, as measured by the MTT assay (Fig.1 C). Addition of an A2A-R-selective agonist, CGS21680 (CGS, 0.1 μm), reversed the DNA fragmentation and cell death induced by serum deprivation. Addition of CGS (0.1 μm) also significantly reduced phosphorylation of the stress-activated kinases JNK1 and JNK2 (Fig. 1 B), which are implicated in apoptosis (12Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar). Such protection by A2A-R required new protein synthesis, because a protein synthesis inhibitor blocked the prevention of apoptosis by activation of A2A-Rs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). Since activation of A2A-R led to a transient increase in cAMP in PC12 cells (13Chern Y. Chiou J.-Y. Lai H.-L. Tsai M.-H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar), we first examined whether PKA plays an important role in preventing apoptosis due to serum deprivation. As shown in Fig.2 A, two PKA inhibitors (H-89 and KT-5720) reduced the protective effect of CGS and forskolin (FK) in serum-deprived apoptosis. In addition, CGS and FK exerted no effect on serum-deprived apoptosis in a PKA-deficient PC12 variant (A123, Fig.2 B), further supporting our hypothesis that PKA is critical for the protective effect of A2A-R against apoptosis. Furthermore, the effect of CGS was markedly reduced by an A2A-R-selective antagonist, 8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC) (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the effect of CGS is mediated by A2A-Rs. Because stimulation of A2A-R activates a serine/threonine PPase in neutrophils (19Revan S. Montesinos M.C. Naime D. Landau S. Cronstein B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17114-17118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we examined whether a PPase was involved in prevention of apoptosis by A2A-R activation. As shown in Fig. 3, two serine/threonine PPase inhibitors, okadaic acid (OKA) and calyculin A (Caly A), blocked the protective effect of A2A-R activation in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal inhibition of the A2A-protective effect by Caly A and OKA occurred at 1 and 10 nm, respectively. Caly A and OKA at these concentrations also markedly reduced the protective effect of FK (Fig. 3). Caly A (1 nm) or OKA (10 nm) alone did not markedly affect the survival of PC12 cells in the absence or presence of serum. Thus, a serine-threonine PPase appears to act downstream of PKA to facilitate survival of serum-starved cells upon A2A-R stimulation. Activation of A2A-R has been shown to stimulate the ERK/MAPK pathway in several cell types, including PC12 cells (20Seidel M.G. Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Holler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25833-25841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined whether this pathway is involved in the protection against apoptosis by A2A-R activation. As shown in Fig. 4 A, treatment with CGS or FK increased phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 without altering protein levels. A MAPK kinase inhibitor (PD98059) blocked the FK- and CGS-mediated activation of ERK. However, PD98059 did not prevent the protective effect of CGS in serum-deprived cells (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, activation of ERK is not required for A2A-R-mediated protection against apoptosis. This finding is consistent with the observation that ERK is not important for cAMP- or NGF-mediated survival of primary sympathetic neurons (21Creedon D.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20713-20718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We previously showed that stimulation of A2A-Rs activates novel PKCs (14Lai H.L. Yang T.H. Messing R.O. Chin Y.H. Lin S.C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I-HCl (BiM) to examine whether PKC is involved in the protective effect of A2A-R. As shown in TableI, BiM markedly reduced the protective effect of CGS and FK. PKC therefore might be involved in A2A-R-mediated protection and exert its effect downstream of PKA.Table IA PKC inhibitor attenuates A2A-R-mediated protection against apoptosis in serum-deprived PC12 cellsReagentSerumBiMMTT (% control)None+−100.0 ± 2.1None−−31.1 ± 1.5CGS−−69.8 ± 3.2 1-ap < 0.05 compared with serum-deprived cells cultured without CGS, BiM, or FK.FK−−68.0 ± 2.9 1-ap < 0.05 compared with serum-deprived cells cultured without CGS, BiM, or FK.None−+34.8 ± 3.9CGS−+39.3 ± 3.6FK−+31.5 ± 1.3Viability of PC12 cells was determined by MTT assay after 24 h of serum deprivation in the presence or absence of CGS (0.1 μm) or FK (5 μm).

PKC is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that is composed of three subfamilies as follows: conventional, novel, and atypical. We previously demonstrated that two novel PKC isozymes (δ and ε) play significant roles in the desensitization of A2A-R-induced cAMP formation in PC12 cells (14Lai H.L. Yang T.H. Messing R.O. Chin Y.H. Lin S.C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, two atypical PKC isozymes (aPKCs; λ/ι and ζ) and two conventional PKC isozymes (α and γ) were also observed in our line of PC12 cells (Fig. 5,B and C). To identify the PKC isozymes involved in the protective effect of A2A-R, we treated PC12 cells with a PKC-stimulating phorbol ester, PDD (100 nm), for 20 h to induce proteolysis and down-regulation of conventional and novel PKCs. This treatment caused down-regulation of the conventional PKCs (α and γ; Fig. 5 C) and novel PKCs (δ and ε; see Ref. 14Lai H.L. Yang T.H. Messing R.O. Chin Y.H. Lin S.C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because aPKCs (λ and ι and ζ) are insensitive to diacylglycerols and phorbol esters, long term PDD treatment did not decrease levels of aPKCs in PC12 cells (Fig. 5 B). Most interestingly, long term PDD treatment did not alter the response to A2A-R stimulation (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, as shown in Table II, stimulation of A2A-R using CGS exerted a similar protective effect in PC12 variants expressing dominant-negative fragments of PKCε or PKCδ. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that conventional and novel PKCs are not involved in A2A-R-mediated protection against apoptosis in PC12 cells.Table IIStimulation of A2A-Rs promotes survival in PC12 cell lines that express dominant negative fragments of novel PKCsCellCGSSerumMTT (% control)PC12−+100.0 ± 2.1−−31.6 ± 1.5+−69.6 ± 2.6 2-ap < 0.05 compared with serum-deprived cells cultured without CGS.PC12-V10C−+100.0 ± 2.2−−25.3 ± 0.8+−69.4 ± 2.6 2-ap < 0.05 compared with serum-deprived cells cultured without CGS.PC12-V1ɛ1−+100.0 ± 3.2−−33.0 ± 1.5+−74.1 ± 1.7 2-ap < 0.05 compared with serum-deprived cells cultured without CGS.PC12-V1ɛ2−+100.0 ± 2.4−−32.0 ± 1.6+−75.7 ± 4.9 2-ap < 0.05 compared with serum-deprived cells cultured without CGS.PC12-V1δ1−+100.0 ± 2.3−−27.2 ± 1.2+−70.5 ± 4.7 2-ap < 0.05 compared with serum-deprived cells cultured without CGS.PC12-V1δ2−+100.0 ± 2.3−−39.8 ± 1.8+−82.5 ± 5.8 2-ap < 0.05 compared with serum-deprived cells cultured without CGS.Viability of the indicated PC12 cell line was determined by MTT assay after serum deprivation for 24 h in the presence or absence of CGS (0.1 μm).

We next considered whether aPKCs are important for the A2-R-mediated protection by measuring aPKC activity after A2A-R stimulation in PC12 cells treated with PDD for 20 h. In these cells, CGS enhanced aPKC activity in both nuclear and non-nuclear fractions (Fig. 6,A and B). The increase in aPKC activity was much greater in the nuclear fraction as compared with the non-nuclear fraction. Western blot analysis showed that PKCζ and PKCλ/ι immunoreactivities were markedly increased in the nuclear fraction following treatment with CGS (Fig. 6 C). FK also enhanced aPKC activity in the nuclear fraction with a time course comparable to that observed with CGS (Fig. 7). These results suggest that PKA mediates increases in nuclear aPKCs during A2A-R stimulation.Figure 7Forskolin increases nuclear aPKC activity in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were treated with or without FK (5 μm) for the indicated time and then were collected to harvest nuclear fractions for determination of PKC activities.

Therefore, we used a cell-permeable PKCζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor to assess the role of PKC in the A2A-mediated protection. As shown in Fig.8 A, the PKCζ-specific inhibitor blocked A2A-R-mediated protection against apoptosis. In addition, transient overexpression of a dominant-positive PKCζ (PKCζ+, see Ref. 23Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell.

Based on their protein structure and biochemical properties, mammalian PLA2 enzymes can be divided into several classes: low molecular weight secretory; 85-kDa cytosolic; selective acetyl hydrolases of platelet-activating factor; and calcium-independent PLA2. Thus far, eight low molecular weight mammalian PLA2 enzymes have been described including group (G) IB, five GII enzymes, GV, and GX (2Murakami M. Kudo I. Umeda M. Matsuzawa A. Takeda M. Komada M.

Each low molecular weight PLA2 is abbreviated, with a lowercase letter indicating the low molecular weight PLA2species (m and h for mouse and human, respectively), followed by uppercase letters identifying the low molecular weight PLA2group. Each low molecular weight PLA2 is 13–15 kDa in size and contains a signal peptide and 12–14 cysteine residues, the positions and spacing of which are conserved among the low molecular weight PLA2members (6Tischfield J.A.

In addition, an ∼55-kDa mammalian protein containing a region homologous to the 10-kDa bee venom PLA2 has been described (7Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7492-7496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Low molecular weight PLA2 enzymes require millimolar Ca2+ for activity and display no specificity for the fatty acid in the sn-2 position of phospholipids (8Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cytosolic PLA2, or GIV PLA2, is a large cytosolic enzyme (∼85 kDa), requires only micromolar Ca2+for activity, and is the only cloned PLA2 that displays high selectivity toward arachidonate-containing phospholipids (9Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 10Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.L. J. Lipid Mediat.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition to the absence of a calcium requirement, the hematopoietic calcium-independent PLA2 contains eight ankyrin motifs that are not found in any other PLA2 (12Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Groups IV and VI and the platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolases (GVII and GVIII) exhibit a catalytic serine, whereas the cysteine-rich, low molecular weight groups utilize a catalytic histidine (13Six D.A.

GIV PLA2 has been established, by comparison of various hematopoietic cell types derived from mice with a disruption of this gene with those of their normal littermates, as essential for providing arachidonic acid to the downstream enzymes, such as cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxygenase, for generation of prostanoids and leukotrienes (14Bonventre J.V.

GIIA PLA2, a secretory granule-stored species, has been shown to augment arachidonic acid release by an extracellular membrane action that can be active site-dependent or mediated by cell activation through lectin-like receptors (19Copic A.

In addition to these downstream eicosanoid mediators, there are metabolites with gene-inducing functions via interaction with the intracellular receptors of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family (21Forman B.M.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the PLA2/COX/prostaglandin cascade might play a critical role in regulating the differentiation and function of helper T cells. CD4+ helper T cells can be divided into two functional subsets based on their secreted cytokines (28Mosmann T.R. Sad S. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 138-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3311) Google Scholar, 29Abbas A.K. Murphy K.M. Sher A. Nature. 1996; 383: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (3833) Google Scholar). Type 1 helper T (Th1) cells secrete interferon-γ and IL-2 and are responsible for delayed type hypersensitivity and eradication of intracellular microorganisms. Type 2 helper T (Th2) cells produce cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, which enhance the production of IgE antibodies involved in allergic responses, and IL-5, which promotes the maturation of eosinophils. Furthermore, IL-4 regulates FcεRI expression of human mast cells, whereas IL-5 is comitogenic with stem cell factor for their mucosal expansion (30Bischoff S.C. Sellge G. Lorentz A. Sebald W. Raab R. Manns M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8080-8085Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). There is evidence that prostaglandin E2(PGE2), a metabolite of the cyclooxygenase pathway, selectively promotes the differentiation of Th2 cells (31Hilkens C.M. Snijders A. Snijdewint F.G. Wierenga E.A. Kapsenberg M.L. Eur. Respir. J. 1996; 22 (suppl.): 90-94Google Scholar). Production of IL-2 and interferon-γ by short term peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures and by long term Th clones is inhibited by PGE2 in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas IL-4 and IL-5 production is enhanced (32Snijdewint F.G. Kalinski P. Wierenga E.A. Bos J.D. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5321-5329PubMed Google Scholar, 33Demeure C.E. Yang L.P. Desjardins C. Raynauld P. Delespesse G. Eur. J.

Naı̈ve human CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 in the presence of PGE2 display a Th2 phenotype, which is maintained upon restimulation in the absence of PGE2 (34Katamura K. Shintaku N. Yamauchi Y. Fukui T. Ohshima Y. Mayumi M. Furusho K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4604-4612PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PGE2 can directly inhibit transcription of the IL-2 gene but not the IL-4 gene in human Jurkat T cells (35Paliogianni F. Kincaid R.L. Boumpas D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1813-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 36Paliogianni F. Boumpas D.T. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 171: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to its direct effect on the transcription of cytokine genes in T cells, PGE2 inhibits the release of IL-12, the potent Th1-promoting cytokine, from antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (37Kuroda E. Sugiura T. Zeki K. Yoshida Y. Yamashita U. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2386-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38Kalinski P. Schuitemaker J.H. Hilkens C.M. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2804-2809PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibits the expression of the IL-12 receptor in differentiating Th cells (39Wu C.Y. Wang K. McDyer J.F. Seder R.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2723-2730PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PGD2, the dominant mast cell-derived prostanoid species, has been added to the growing list of Th2 effectors. Hematopoietic prostaglandin D2synthase is expressed in human Th2 but not Th1 cells. The up-regulated expression of hematopoietic prostaglandin D2synthase and de novo expression of COX-2, induced with anti-CD3, result in the production of PGD2 by Th2 cells (40Tanaka K. Ogawa K. Sugamura K. Nakamura M. Takano S. Nagata K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2277-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Of note, mice rendered deficient in the PGD2receptor, DP, have impaired Th2 responses and allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in a model of allergic asthma (41Matsuoka T. Hirata M. Tanaka H.

Here, we report the molecular cloning of a novel PLA2, designated group XII PLA2 (GXII PLA2), which contains at least two alternatively spliced forms, GXII-1 and GXII-2. Both murine GXII-1 (mGXII-1) PLA2 and GXII-2 (mGXII-2) PLA2 contain a histidine-based PLA2 catalytic domain and are cysteine-rich, although the position and spacing of the cysteine residues are different from those in other PLA2s. The enzymatic activity of mGXII-1 PLA2 is optimal at pH 8.0 and in low millimolar calcium. Importantly, mGXII PLA2, in particular mGXII-2 PLA2, is preferentially expressed in Th2 cells, where it is induced upon stimulation through the T cell receptor. Thus, GXII PLA2 is novel in its 20-kDa size, distribution of cysteine residues, and preferential expression in Th2 cells. Murine Th2 clones, D10 and CDC35, and murine Th1 clones, AE7, OF6, and AR5, were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% conditioned medium from Con A-stimulated rat splenocytes. The murine Th1 clone D1.1 was maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% T-STIM (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA), and human IL-2 at 50 units/ml. When indicated, Th clones were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 for 6 h before harvesting. The BHK cell is a baby hamster kidney cell line maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CD4+Th cells and B cells were purified from spleens and lymph nodes harvested from 6–8-week-old BALB/C mice by using CD4 (L3T4) and CD45R (B220) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified CD4+Th cells were stimulated in vitro with plate-bound anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (2C11) at 1 μg/ml in the presence of anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibody (5C3) at 20 μg/ml (Th2-skewing conditions) or anti-IL-4 monoclonal antibody (11B11) at 5 μg/ml (Th1-skewing conditions). 24 h poststimulation, IL-2 at 50 units/ml was added to all cultures. In addition, IL-4 at 500 units/ml or IL-12 at 50 units/ml was added into Th2 or Th1 cultures, respectively. 7 days poststimulation, cells were harvested, washed thoroughly, and restimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3. 24 h after restimulation, cells were harvested for RNA preparation. All antibodies were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The purified B cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 6 h before harvesting. AnSmaI/HindIII restriction fragment encompassing amino acid residues 11–192 of mGXII-1 PLA2 was cloned into the EcoRV and HindIII site of pET-29c (Novagene, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid and the empty pET-29c, respectively, were used to transform the BL-21 Escherichia coli (Novagene). 100 μl of the overnight culture of the transformed BL-21 cells was diluted with 10 ml of fresh LB medium containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml), cultured at 37 °C for 3 h, and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C to express recombinant mGXII-1 PLA2 protein. The induced BL-21 cells were lysed with 0.6 ml of BugBuster™ protein extraction reagent (Novagene). The insoluble fractions were resuspended with 0.6 ml of BugBuster™ reagent containing 200 μg/ml lysozyme and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The lysozyme-treated insoluble fractions were washed three times with 1 ml of 1:10 diluted BugBuster™ reagent. The washed insoluble fractions were subsequently solubilized in 0.6 ml of 1:10 diluted BugBuster™ buffer containing 6 mguanidine HCl. The denatured proteins were refolded by sequential dialysis at room temperature against 1 liter of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm cysteine, and 4, 2, or 1 m guanidine HCl (8 h for each dialysis buffer). Guanidine HCl was then removed by dialysis against 2 liters of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 24 h at room temperature. The resulting recombinant mGXII-1 PLA2 (at ∼50 μg/ml) contains an NH2-terminal S tag and is more than 90% pure as examined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. PLA2 activity was assessed by the hydrolysis of 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine to liberate [14C]arachidonic acid using a lipsome-based assay. 10–25 ng of recombinant mGXII-I PLA2 or an equal volume of a concomitantly prepared insoluble fraction of empty pET29c-transformed BL-21 cells was adjusted to a final volume of 125 μl containing 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 3.6 μm1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine for 0–30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 625 μl of Dole's reagent. Free [14C]arachidonic acid was extracted in n-heptane and counted in a liquid β-scintillation counter. Stimulated or unstimulated cells were harvested, and total RNA was prepared by using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA derived from various organs was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). For Northern analysis, 10 μg of each RNA sample was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with indicated cDNA probes in the QuickHyb buffer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA probes used were the full-length mGXII-1 PLA2, the full-length mGV PLA2, and the full-length γ-actin. RT-PCR was performed by using the RT-PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. 0.5 μg of each RNA sample was used per RT-PCR reaction. The sequences of primers used in RT-PCR were as follows: mGXII-1 sense, 5′-GGGCAGGAACAGGACCAGACCACCG-3′; mGXII-2 sense, 5′-CCACAGTGGTCCTGGGAAGTACTGGG-3′; mGXII-1 and mGXII-2 antisense, 5′-GGTTTATATCCATAGCGTGGAACAGGCTTCG-3′; mGV sense, 5′-GTCCATGATTGAGAAGGTGACC-3′; mGV antisense, 5′-TCATAGGACTGGGTCCGAATGG-3; mGX sense, 5′-GGTCACATGTATACAAGCGTGG-3′; mGX antisense, 5′-ATGTGATGGTCCATGCACTTCC-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCA-3′; β-actin antisense, 5′-CGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′. A partially digestedSalI/BglII fragment and a partially digestedXhoI/BglII cDNA fragment encoding nearly full-length cDNAs of mGXII-1 PLA2 and mGXII-2 PLA2, respectively, were cloned into theXhoI/BamHI site, in frame with the GFP cDNA, of pEGFP-N (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting expression vectors and empty pEGFP-N vector were used to transfect BHK cells by using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were replated on glass slides 24 h later, rested overnight, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.005% in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 min at room temperature, and observed under fluorescence microscopy. The full-length mGXII-1 PLA2 cDNA was cloned into the SalI site of the pCI (Promega) vector. An SphI/NotI restriction fragment, encoding the last 12 amino acid residues of mGXII-1 PLA2, was replaced with a double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding an HA tag. The resulting vector and an expression vector for HA-tagged NIP45 were used to transfect BHK cells (42Hodge M.R. Chun H.J. Rengarajan J. Alt A. Lieberson R. Glimcher L.H. Science. 1996; 274: 1903-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The transfected BHK cells were replated and fixed as described above. The fixed BHK cells were then permeabilized with acetone (2 min at −20 °C), stained with anti-HA antibody (1:500 dilution of 12CA5,Roche Molecular Biochemicals), washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and restained with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (1:300 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). In the process of screening a D10 Th2 cell cDNA library, we isolated a hybrid cDNA clone that contained the 3′ untranslated region of the c-mafprotooncogene fused to an ∼1.5-kilobase novel cDNA. Sequence analysis revealed that the novel 1.5-kilobase cDNA encoded an open reading frame (ORF) of 191 amino acid residues, containing a signal peptide at its NH2 terminus and a conserved sequence for the catalytic domain of low molecular weight PLA2 enzymes. In addition, the ORF contained 14 cysteine residues, similar to the GIIA PLA2 protein. However, the position and spacing of the cysteine residues in this novel ORF were distinct from those of other low molecular weight PLA2s. For instance, although this ORF contains cysteine residues that are capable of forming disulfide bonds 27–131 and 51–102, it lacks the appropriately spaced cysteine residues required to form disulfide bonds 29–45, 44–109, 61–95, and 85–100, which are found in all the mammalian low molecular weight PLA2s. The position and spacing of cysteine residues in this novel ORF are also different from those of other histidine-based PLA2s, such as GIII, GIX, and GXI (13Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). This novel ORF also lacks a canonical calcium binding domain for low molecular weight PLA2s (Fig.1). Furthermore, its predicted molecular mass is ∼21 kDa, which is significantly larger than that of the low molecular weight PLA2s, which are typically ∼14 kDa. These results implied that the ORF represented a novel member of the PLA2 family, henceforth called group XII-1 PLA2 (GXII-1 PLA2). We subsequently searched the GenBankTM Data Bank with the mGXII-1 PLA2sequence and identified several human expressed sequence tag clones encoding the human GXII-1 PLA2 (hGXII-1), which is more than 90% homologous to the mGXII-1 PLA2 (Fig. 1). A further search of the GenBankTM Data Bank with the hGXII-1 PLA2 sequence revealed that the hGXII-1 PLA2sequence matched a genomic sequence derived from human chromosome 4q25 (accession number AC004067). Furthermore, a Drosophilaortholog (accession number AAF49567), which contains a consensus histidine catalytic PLA2 domain and 14 cysteine residues with spacing almost identical to that of mGXII-1 PLA2, was present in GenBankTM. This result suggests that GXII PLA2 is evolutionarily conserved. In addition to hGXII-1 PLA2, we also identified two murine expressed sequence tag clones (accession numbers AA008695 and AA204520) encoding an mGXII-1 PLA2-related open reading frame, in which the first 73 amino acid residues of mGXII-1 PLA2, including the signal peptide, were replaced with a novel amino acid sequence of 34 residues following a distinct initial methionine (Fig. 1). This related open reading frame, independently derived from embryo and lymph node cDNA libraries, does not encode any obvious signal peptide and might represent an alternatively spliced form of mGXII-1 PLA2; this open reading frame was designated murine group XII-2 PLA2 (mGXII-2 PLA2). To determine whether mGXII-1 PLA2 has functional phospholipase A2 catalytic activity, we expressed an NH2-terminal S-tagged protein inE. coli and enriched the protein to >90% purity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.2 A). The capacity of the recombinant protein to hydrolyze arachidonic acid in thesn-2 position of phosphatidylethanolamine was determined. Maximal PLA2 activity was observed at pH 8.0 in 1.2 mm calcium (data not shown). The kinetics of release of arachidonic acid using 10 ng of enzyme was linear from 5 to 30 min (Fig. 2 B) and yielded a specific activity of 0.24 μmol/min per mg of enzyme. Similar to other low molecular weight PLA2s, the mGXII-1 PLA2 contains a signal peptide at its NH2 terminus, suggesting that mGXII-1 PLA2 might be a secreted protein or a membrane-associated protein. To determine the subcellular localization of both mGXII-1 PLA2 and mGXII-2 PLA2, we fused them with GFP and then overexpressed the fusions in BHK cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, mGXII-1 PLA2 displayed a pattern consistent with localization to the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum in BHK cells. The Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum pattern of mGXII-1 PLA2 was more obvious when an HA-tagged mGXII-1 PLA2 was used (Fig. 3 B). For controls, overexpression of the GFP expression plasmid alone displayed a diffuse pattern, and an HA-tagged nuclear protein, NIP45 (42Hodge M.R. Chun H.J. Rengarajan J. Alt A. Lieberson R. Glimcher L.H. Science. 1996; 274: 1903-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), was localized to the nuclei of BHK cells. In contrast to mGXII-1 PLA2, overexpression of GFP-mGXII-2 PLA2gave a pattern indistinguishable from that of GFP alone. This is in agreement with the absence of a signal peptide in mGXII-2 PLA2. These results demonstrated that mGXII-1 PLA2 and mGXII-2 PLA2 have distinct subcellular localizations. Because there is some evidence to suggest that the PLA2/COX/eicosanoid cascade regulates the differentiation and function of helper T cells, we examined the expression of mGXII PLA2s among various Th clones by Northern analysis using a cDNA probe common to both mGXII-1 PLA2 and mGXII-2 PLA2. As shown in Fig.4 A, the expression of mGXII PLA2s was easily detected in Th2 clones, such as D10 and CDC35, and was further induced upon stimulation with anti-CD3. In contrast, the Th1 clones expressed very low levels of mGXII PLA2s, which were also less abundant after anti-CD3 stimulation than transcript levels in Th2 clones. Furthermore, mGXII PLA2 was expressed at very low levels in a naı̈ve CD4+Th cell population and was dramatically induced in cells that had been polarized along the Th2 pathway but not the Th1 pathway (Fig.4 B). Of note, two transcripts were detected by the common cDNA probe, further suggesting the presence of alternative splice forms or homologues of mGXII PLA2. Because we were unable to distinguish mGXII-1 PLA2 from mGXII-2 PLA2 by Northern analysis, we used sequence-specific primers in RT-PCR to examine the expression and cell type specificity of both forms of mGXII PLA2. As shown in Fig. 5, the expression kinetics and cell type specificity of both mGXII-1 PLA2 and mGXII-2 PLA2, in particular mGXII-2 PLA2, as examined by RT-PCR, are similar to those revealed by Northern analysis. Importantly, mGXII-2 PLA2 is almost exclusively expressed in stimulated normal Th2, but not Th1 or B, cells (Fig.5 A). In contrast to its subset-specific expression among the Th cell lineages, transcripts encoding mGXII-1 PLA2 could be detected in a variety of organs and tissues (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, transcripts encoding mGXII-2 PLA2 were only detected in spleen and, to a much lesser degree, in embryo (Fig.5 B). This is in agreement with the origin of the two mGXII-2 PLA2 expressed sequence tag clones described previously. The knowledge that an arachidonic acid-selective PLA2, GIV PLA2, could function in concert with GV PLA2for PGE2 generation in a mouse macrophage line (18Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and for PGD2 production by mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (43Reddy S.T. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) prompted an assessment of the expression of GV PLA2 in Th cells. We repeated the RT-PCR analysis above using primers specific to mGV PLA2 or mGX PLA2. As shown in Fig.5 A, the expression of mGV PLA2 was detected in stimulated Th2 cells but not in Th1 cells, whereas the expression of mGX PLA2 was comparable between Th1 and Th2 cells. The Th2 cell-specific expression of mGV PLA2 was further confirmed by Northern analysis using Th clones. As shown in Fig. 5 C, mGV PLA2 was expressed at a very low level in resting D10 cells (Th2 cells); however, its expression was dramatically induced within 6 h after anti-CD3 stimulation. In contrast, no expression of mGV PLA2 was detected in AE7 cells (Th1 cells). Here we have described the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel PLA2 group, designated group XII. Despite the generic characteristics of being cysteine-rich and functioning optimally at a basic pH, GXII PLA2 merits this separate designation because of the following features. It shares no significant amino acid sequence homology, other than the catalytic histidine motif, with other PLA2 enzymes. Although GXII PLA2 is cysteine-rich, the spacing of cysteine residues is distinct from that of other low molecular weight PLA2 enzymes. GXII PLA2 also lacks the canonical calcium binding domain of the low molecular weight PLA2 enzymes. The molecular mass of mGXII-1 PLA2 is ∼20 kDa, which is somewhat larger than the 14 kDa of the low molecular weight cysteine-rich PLA2 enzymes. These observations and the calculated specific activity of the recombinant mGXII-1 PLA2 are in agreement with those of Gelb et al. (44Gelb M.H. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39823-39826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), who also described mammalian GXII PLA2 while this manuscript was under review. In addition, GXII PLA2 is present in more than one species, and alternative spliced forms, mGXII-1 and mGXII-2, have been identified. Murine GXII PLA2, in particular mGXII-2 PLA2, and mGV PLA2 are preferentially expressed in Th2 cells within the T cell lineage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the differential expression of certain PLA2 members in Th cells. These observations suggest an as yet unknown effector function of Th2 cells. In light of the report that COX2 and hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase are also preferentially expressed in Th2 cells (40Tanaka K. Ogawa K. Sugamura K. Nakamura M. Takano S. Nagata K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2277-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), it is intriguing to postulate that the Th2 cell-specific PLA2s, such as mGXII and mGV, might be functionally linked to COX2 and hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase in Th2 cells. Thus, in Th2 cells, mGXII PLA2 and mGV PLA2 might provide arachidonic acid to COX2 for generation of intermediates that hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase converts to PGD2. This scenario is further supported by three observations. First, mGXII PLA2 was induced in Th2 cells after T cell receptor stimulation (Fig. 4 B) in a time course parallel to that observed for COX2 induction (40Tanaka K. Ogawa K. Sugamura K. Nakamura M. Takano S. Nagata K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2277-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Second, exogenous GV PLA2 was able to induce the expression of COX2 in macrophages (17Balsinde J. Shinohara H. Lefkowitz L.J. Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25967-25970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Third, mGXII-1 PLA2 is present in a perinuclear location in transfected BHK cells. It is known that the generation of eicosanoids is dependent on the location within the cell of the enzymes of their biosynthesis, which seems to occur in a perinuclear location. Group V PLA2 has been described in association with the nuclear envelope in mouse mast cells and acts in a cooperative manner with GIV cytosolic PLA2 to provide arachidonic acid for eicosanoid biosynthesis (45Bingham III, C.O. Fijneman R.J. Friend D.S. Goddeau R.P. Rogers R.A. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31476-31484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, the mGXII PLA2 and mGV PLA2, two Th2 cell-specific enzymes, are well placed for a functional interaction with COX2 induced at the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum to generate PGG2/PGH2, which are processed by hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase to provide PGD2 and its metabolites. Interestingly, a metabolite of PGD2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, is one of the natural ligands of the nuclear coreceptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (21Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar), which was recently shown to be induced by the Th2 cytokine IL-4 and which can regulate gene expression in both T and non-T cells (46Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 47Clark R.B. Bishop-Bailey D. Estrada-Hernandez T. Hla T. Puddington L. Padula S.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recent report that a second G-protein-coupled PGD2 receptor, chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed in Th2 cells (CRTH2), resides on Th2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils and is pharmcacologically distinct from DP PGD2 receptor (48Hirai H. Tanaka K. Yoshie O. Ogawa K. Kenmotsu K. Takamori Y. Ichimasa M. Sugamura K. Nakamura M. Takano S. Nagata K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) introduces the possibility of an autocrine pathway. Alternatively, mGXII PLA2 and mGV PLA2 might affect the differentiation and function of Th2 cells independently of their enzymatic activities. In agreement with this hypothesis, GI and GIIA PLA2s can initiate signaling events by binding to lectin-like cell surface receptors (4Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 19Copic A. Vucemilo N. Gubensek F. Krizaj I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26315-26320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An alternatively spliced form, mGXII-2 PLA2, which does not contain any signal peptide, was also identified. Most low molecular weight PLA2 members are either secreted proteins or are associated with cell membranes and act in situ. Murine GXII-2 PLA2, without a signal peptide, may be the only exception within the low molecular weight PLA2 family. Although the GFP-mGXII-2 PLA2 fusion protein is homogeneously distributed within BHK cells, it should be noted that this result was obtained by overexpression of a GFP fusion protein and might not reflect the distribution of the endogenous protein. The actual subcellular localization of GXII PLA2s can only be definitively determined by immunocytochemistry using antibodies that distinguish the two alternative spliced products of GXII PLA2; such antibodies are not yet available. Assuming, however, that the subcellular localization of the GFP-mGXII-2 PLA2 fusion protein faithfully reflects that of endogenous mGXII-2 PLA2, this result further supports the notion that mGXII-2 PLA2 might mediate a biological function, in addition to releasing arachidonic acid from cell membranes. Thein vivo function of GXII PLA2 will be revealed by the analysis of GXII PLA2-deficient mice, currently being generated.

https://openalex.org/W2109888135,"Rab proteins are small GTPases that are essential elements of the protein transport machinery of eukaryotic cells. Each round of membrane transport requires a cycle of Rab protein nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. We have recently characterized a protein, Yip1p, which appears to play a role in Rab-mediated membrane transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we report the identification of a Yip1p-associated protein, Yop1p. Yop1p is a membrane protein with a hydrophilic region at its N terminus through which it interacts specifically with the cytosolic domain of Yip1p. Yop1p could also be coprecipitated with Rab proteins from total cellular lysates. The TB2 gene is the human homolog of Yop1p (Kinzler, K. W., Nilbert, M. C., Su, L.-K., Vogelstein, B., Bryan, T. M., Levey, D. B., Smith, K. J., Preisinger, A. C., Hedge, P., McKechnie, D., Finniear, R., Markham, A., Groffen, J., Boguski, M. S., Altschul, S. F., Horii, A., Ando, H. M., Y., Miki, Y., Nishisho, I., and Nakamura, Y. (1991) Science 253, 661–665). Our data demonstrate that Yop1p negatively regulates cell growth. Disruption ofYOP1 has no apparent effect on cell viability, while overexpression results in cell death, accumulation of internal cell membranes, and a block in membrane traffic. These results suggest that Yop1p acts in conjunction with Yip1p to mediate a common step in membrane traffic.

These results suggest that Yop1p acts in conjunction with Yip1p to mediate a common step in membrane traffic. The Rab family encompasses a conserved group of key molecules involved in membrane traffic and represents a distinct subgroup of the Ras superfamily (2Collins R.N. Brennwald P. Front. Mol. Biol. 1999; 24: 137-175Google Scholar). Each stage of membrane traffic through both the constitutive and regulated secretory pathways of all eukaryotic cells is associated with a distinct Rab protein that regulates the cascade of events that lead to SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (3Pfeffer S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E17-E22Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). A hallmark of Rabs is their localization to specific compartments of the transport pathway. This distribution is consistent with the function of Rab proteins in distinct intracellular transport processes. In every case examined, the localization pattern of a Rab protein reflects the membrane transport step that it regulates. In keeping with this view, more than 30 members of the Rab family have been identified (2Collins R.N. Brennwald P. Front. Mol. Biol. 1999; 24: 137-175Google Scholar). Rabs are stably prenylated at their C terminus, which mediates their association with membranes (4Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). However, while the majority of Rabs are membrane-associated, prenylated Rabs are also found in the cytosol bound to the Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). 1The abbreviations used are:GDIGDP dissociation inhibitorGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAinfluenza virus hemagglutinin epitopePCRpolymerase chain reactionORFopen reading framePBSphosphate-buffered salinePNSpostnuclear supernatantPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisERendoplasmic reticulumCPYcarboxypeptidase Y GDI shares sequence homology with the Rab escort protein involved in presenting and removing Rab proteins from the prenylation machinery (5Seabra M.C.

Sci. 1996; 21: 472-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). GDI has several properties that underscore its role in mediating Rab protein function: (i) GDI binds preferentially to the GDP-bound conformation of Rab proteins and slows the intrinsic rate of GDP nucleotide dissociation (7Araki S. Kikuchi A. Hata Y. Isomura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) GDI requires the fully prenylated Rab protein for interaction and binds in such a way so that the geranylgeranyl groups are shielded in a hydrophobic pocket (8Musha T. Kawata M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9821-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (iii) GDI is a pleiotropic factor interacting with many different Rab proteinsin vitro and in vivo; in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single gene encodes GDI function for all 11 Rab proteins (9Garrett M.D. Zahner J.E. Cheney C.M. Novick P.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1718-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These properties enable the Rab protein to exist in the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm as a soluble heterodimer with GDI and facilitate recycling of the GDP-bound Rab back to the donor compartment (10Soldati T. Riederer M.A. Pfeffer S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model, Rab proteins are complexed to GDI in the cytosol, and depletion of GDI in yeast causes loss of the soluble pool of Rabs and a concomitant inhibition of transport in the secretory pathway.

However, identification of such a machinery has proven elusive. To date, no factor mediating this process has been identified; however, several features of Rab membrane recruitment have been established: (i) Rabs are recruited to membranes in their inactive GDP-bound conformation bound to GDI (11Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); (ii) membrane recruitment is accompanied by the displacement of GDI (12Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Sumizawa T. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar); (iii) membrane recruitment is specific, and the C-terminal hypervariable region of the Rab protein mediates this specificity (13Chavrier P. Gorvel J.P. Stelzer E. Simons K. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Nature. 1991; 353: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); (iv) prenylation of Rab proteins is crucial for membrane recruitment in addition to the C-terminal ∼35 amino acid residues; (v) membrane recruitment is followed by nucleotide exchange, and the two processes can be distinguished kinetically (14Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar,15Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M. Nature. 1994; 368: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar); and (vi) for Rab4, the existence of a membrane protein that acts as a specific Rab receptor has been demonstrated, although the precise identity of this receptor is unknown (16Ayad N. Hull M. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4497-4507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have characterized a membrane protein in yeast, Yip1p, which appears to mediate the dissociation of the Rab heterodimer from GDI.YIP1 is an essential gene (17Yang X. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that is highly conserved in evolution. 2R. Collins, unpublished data. However, Yip1p is a pleiotropic factor and lacks specificity for interaction with any particular Rab GTPase (17Yang X. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have therefore searched for a protein accessory factor that may act in conjunction with Yip1p, and we report the identification of a novel membrane protein, Yop1p, which physically interacts with Yip1p. Disruption of YOP1 has no apparent effect on cell viability, while overexpression results in cell death and accumulation of internal cell membranes. These results suggest that Yop1p acts in conjunction with Yip1p to mediate a common step in membrane traffic. Because of the essential nature of Rab recruitment for the activation and recycling of Rabs, characterization of Yop1p may provide crucial insight into the action of Rab proteins in mediating membrane transport. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in these studies are listed in TableI. All yeast strains were manipulated as described by Guthrie and Fink (18Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). YOP1 gene deletion was carried out using the KAN R module (19Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar) as a selectable marker and the primers CAAAGACATAACCGCACTCCAATCATGTCCGAATATGCATCTAGTATTCACTCTCCGTACGCTGCAGGTCGAC and GAGGATATAGGTGAGTTGCCTCTTAATGAACAGAAGCACCTGTAGCCTTAGAAGCCTATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG to precisely eliminate the YOP1 ORF. Genomic PCR using an internal deletion primer and the flanking primer CTTGAAGCTTGTTATTCCGA was performed to verify gene disruption. Yeast expressing GST-Yop1p under the control of the GAL1/10promoter (RCY423) and GST alone (RCY427) were created by digesting pRC494 and pRC337, respectively, with ClaI to direct integration at the LEU2 locus of NY605. Strains RCY425, RCY428, and RCY462 were created by transforming pRC695 into RCY423, RCY427, and NY605, respectively. In the same manner, RCY429 was created by transforming pNB632 into RCY423. RCY460 was created by transforming the hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Yop1p protein expression vector pRC778 into RCY407. For immunofluorescence, RCY469 was created by digesting pRC833 with EcoRV to direct integration of the plasmid at the URA3 locus of RCY407.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceNY605MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112Novick laboratoryRCY376MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→HA-YOP1This studyRCY377MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→HA-YOP1C terminusThis studyRCY404MAT a leu2–3,112 ura3–52 YOP1∷URA3 GFP-YOP1This studyRCY407MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112 YOP1ΔKANRThis studyRCY423MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→GST-YOPThis studyRCY425MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→GST-YOP1[URA3 2μ myc9-YIP1]This studyRCY427MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→ GSTThis studyRCY428MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→ GST [URA32μ myc9-YIP1]This studyRCY429MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→GST-YOP1[URA32μDSS4-myc3]This studyRCY460MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112 YOP1ΔKANR[URA3 CEN HA-YOP1]This studyRCY462MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3,112[URA32μ myc9-YIP1]This studyRCY469MAT a leu2–3,112 ura3–52∷URA3 HA-YOP1 YOP1ΔKANRThis studyRCY496MAT a leu2–3,112 ura3–52∷URA3 HA-YOP1[LEU2CENGFP-YIP1] YOP1ΔKANRThis studyRCY509MAT a leu2–3,112 ura3–52[URA32μ GAL1–10→GST-YOP1] [LEU2CENGFP-YIP1]This studyRCY508MAT a leu2–3,112 ura3–52[URA32μGAL1–10→GST-YOP1] [LEU2CENGFP-YPT7]This studyRCY455MAT a /α ura3–52 his3Δ200 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→GST-YPT52[pRS426GAL1–10→HA-YOP1 (pRC782)]This studyRCY456MAT a /α ura3–52 his3Δ200 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→GST-SEC4[pRS426GAL1–10→HA-YOP1 (pRC782)]This studyRCY457MAT a /α ura3–52 his3Δ200 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→GST-YPT1ΔC[pRS426GAL1–10→HA-YOP1 (pRC782)]This studyRCY465MAT a /α ura3–52 his3Δ200 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→GST-YPT6[pRS316GAL1–10→HA-YOP1 (pRC783)]This studyRCY467MAT a /α ura3–52 his3Δ200 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→GST-YPT7[pRS316GAL1–10→HA-YOP1 (pRC783)]This studyRCY464MAT a /α ura3–52 his3Δ200 leu2–3,112∷LEU2 GAL1–10→ GST [pRS316GAL1–10→HA-YOP1 (pRC783)]This studyY190MAT a gal4Δgal80Δ trp1–901 ade2–101 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 URA3∷GAL10→LacZ, LYS2∷GAL10→HIS3 cyhRElledge laboratory Open table in a new tab Yeast strains were streaked out on a selective plate and incubated at 30 °C. Liquid media cultures were grown at room temperature. A single colony from each strain was inoculated into 5 ml of selective medium and grown to stationary phase. The day prior to the experiment, medium was inoculated with aliquots of stationary culture at room temperature to obtain cells in logarithmic phase growth. Turbidity measurements were made using a Beckman model DU-40 spectrophotometer at 600 nm. The genomic YOP1 ORF contains a single intron. For convenience, this intron was removed for the majority of YOP1 constructs by overlap PCR with the primers RNC66 (GGAGCTCCACCGCGGTGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAACTAGGAAGAGTTGCATAGATAGGATGGGTGA) and RNC78 (CGATACCAAGTACTCTGGTAATAGAATTTTACAGC) together with RNC67 (CTCGAGGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGCTTGATATCGAATGCTCAAAAGCTAACACTAGGCCAG) and RNC79 (TATCCATGGGTAAGTACTCTGGTAATAGAATTTTACAGC). Full-lengthYOP1 fusion constructs were constructed by PCR with oligonucleotides RNC44 (TGGTACCTCATGAGCGAATATGCATCTAGTATTCACTCTC) and RNC80 (AATAGGATCCTTAATGAACAGAAGCACCTGTAG). TheNcoI/BamHI-digested PCR product was subcloned into pAS2-1 and pACT2 to create two-hybrid vectors expressing full-length YOP1, p121 to create HA-tagged YOP1under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter (pRC393) and pRC337 to create GST-tagged YOP1 under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter (pRC494). C-terminal YOP1constructs containing amino acids 18–180 were created in a similar manner with the oligonucleotides RNC79 (TATCCATGGGTAAGTACTCTGGTAATAGAATTTTACAGC) and RNC80. The PCR product was subcloned into p121 to create pRC439 expressing HA-taggedYOP1 C terminus under the control of the GAL1/10promoter. pRC581 containing yEGFP-tagged YOP1 under the control of its own gene regulatory elements in pRS406 was created by overlap PCR with the oligonucleotides RNC66, RNC67, RNC179 (CAAAGACATAACCGCACTCCAATCATGTCTAAAGGTGAAGAATTATTC), RNC180 (AGAGTGAATACTAGATGCATATTCGGATTTGTACAATTCATCCATACC), RNC181 (CATGATTGGAGTGCGGTTATG), and RNC182 (TCCGAATATGCATCTAGTATTCACTCTCAAATGAAAC). pRC695 expressing Myc9-YIP1 in pRS426 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was created by overlap PCR placing a cassette containing Myc9 (gift of Y. Barral, ETH, Zurich) in frame behind the start codon of YIP1with the primers 9× oligo 1 YIP1 (GCAAGACAACTATTAGTCCCTCTCGAGATGCTCCACCGCGGTGGC) and 9× oligo 2 YIP1 (TGTTACTAGTATTGTAGAAAGACATAATTCCTGCAGCCCGGGGGAT). pNB632, aURA3 multicopy plasmid containingDSS4-Myc3, has been described previously (21Collins R.N. Brennwald P. Garrett M. Lauring A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18281-18289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). pRC337 was created by subcloning GST in front of the GAL1/10 promoter of vector pNB527 digested withBamHI/XhoI using primers RNC177 (CTAGACTAGATCTTCATGAGTTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGGAAAATTAAG) and RNC178 (GACTGACCTCGAGTAGGATCCAGTCACCATGGTCAGATCCGATTTTGGAGGATG) and digesting the PCR product with BglII/XhoI. pRC778 containing a single HA epitope at the N terminus of Yop1p expressed at wild-type levels in the vector pRS315 was created by PCR overlap with the oligonucleotides RNC157 (TACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTTCCGAATATGCATCTAGTATTCAC) and HA 1 (AGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACATCTCGAGAGGGACTAATAGTTGTC). The insert of pRC778 was removed with SalI/HindIII and ligated into the vector pRS306 digested withXhoI/HindIII to create pRC833, aURA3-integrating vector expressing wild-type levels of HA-tagged Yop1p. pRC693 containing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Yip1p under the control of its own promoter and terminator in pRS315 was constructed by placing a cassette containing yeast-enhanced GFP mut3 (22Cormack B.P. Bertram G. Egerton M. Gow N.A.R. Falkow S. Brown A.J.P. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) in frame behind the start codon ofYIP1 with the primers GFP oligo 1 (GACAACTATTAGTCCCTCTCGAGATGTCTAAAGGTGAAGAATTATTCAC) and GFP oligo 2 (GTTACTAGTATTGTAGAAAGACATTTTGTACAATTCATCCATACCAT). pRC650 and pRC556 containing GFP-tagged Ypt6p and Sec4p, respectively, in pRS315 were created in a similar fashion. pRC903 was created by subcloning a cassette containing GST-tagged YOP1 under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter from pRC494 into the 2μURA3 vector pRS426. pRC940 containing YIP1 was constructed by genomic PCR with the oligonucleotides YF YIP1 (GTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGGTCGACGTAGTGCTTGTTACGTTAG) and YR YIP1 (CCACCGCGGTGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAACTCTATGCTTTCCTTATTTACCTCTGGA) and inserted into pRS426 to create a multicopy URA3 vector. For electrophoresis, samples were boiled for 5 min in gel loading buffer (60 mmTris, pH 6.8, 10% sucrose, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue), microcentrifuged for 5 min, and loaded onto 12 or 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). Prestained protein molecular weight markers were from Life Technologies, Inc. For Western blotting, gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 2 h at 200 mA. The membranes were stained with Ponceau S to observe the quality of the transfer. Antigens on the membrane were detected by incubating the filter with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in TBST; 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.2% Tween 20). Primary antibodies were incubated in TBST, followed by three washes. Secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies were added in blocking buffer, followed by three washes and chromogenic blot development with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (both from Bio-Rad) substrates in AP buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). Yeast strains were grown in minimal medium containing 2% galactose. 10 OD units from each culture were harvested and washed in 1 ml of ice-cold TAZ buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaN3). Cell pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm KPi, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20) containing protease inhibitors (10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A), and an equal volume of glass beads was added. The cells were then lysed by vortexing for 2 min in a Turbo-Beater (Fisher) at 4 °C. A total detergent-solubilized lysate was generated by incubating lysates end-over-end with an additional 1 ml of lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. Detergent-solubilized lysates were cleared by two sequential centrifugation steps in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. 20 μl of glutathione S-transferase 4B beads (GST-beads; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the lysates and incubated with constant mixing for 30 min at 4 °C. After four washes with 0.6 ml of lysis buffer, the GST beads were boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Pull-down experiments from yeast strains RCY509 and RCY508 used the lysis buffer 25 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 160 mm KCl, 2 mmEDTA, 2% glycerol, and 0.4% Triton X-100. Pull-down experiments fom yeast strains RCY455, RCY456, RCY457, RCY465, RCY467, and RCY464 used the lysis buffer, 25 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 160 mmKCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2% glycerol, and 0.5% Tween 20. Primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal α-GST (gift of T. Fox, Cornell University), mouse monoclonal α-Myc antibody (9E10; Ref. 23Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar), affinity-purified Rabbit α-GFP antibody (24Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (gift of P. Silver, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), and mouse monoclonal α-HA 12CA5. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were used (Bio-Rad) to detect the presence of Myc9-Yip1p and either GST alone or GST-Yop1p. Yeast strain RCY460 containing wild-type levels of HA-tagged Yop1p as the only source ofYOP1 was used for this experiment. 25 OD units were harvested and washed in 1 ml of TAZ buffer. Cells were broken by glass bead lysis in a Turbo-Beater at 4 °C in fractionation buffer with protease inhibitors (PBS containing 0.2 m sorbitol and 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin). A postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was generated by two sequential centrifugation steps for 5 min at 500 ×g. 2.7 mg of PNS was then spun sequentially at 10,000 × g for 15 min and at 100,000 × g for 12 min to generate P10 and P100 fractions. For Triton X-100 solubilization, the P100 membrane pellet was resuspended in fractionation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated for 10 min on ice and recentrifuged at 100,000 ×g. For high salt treatment, the P100 membrane pellet was resuspended in fractionation buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Samples were incubated for 10 min on ice and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g. Pellets and supernatants were resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The HA-Yop1p was detected with mouse monoclonal 12CA5 antibody followed by anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Triton X-114 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was purified by precondensation as described (25Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 25 OD units of yeast strain RCY460 were harvested and washed in 1 ml of TAZ buffer. Postnuclear supernatants were generated as described above. 1.8 mg of PNS was added to the same volume of PBS containing 2% Triton X-114 with protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). The samples were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C to solubilize membrane proteins. The lysates were incubated for 3 min at 30 °C followed by low speed centrifugation (700 × g) to separate the detergent-enriched and the soluble phases. This cycle was repeated a further two times with the detergent-enriched and soluble phases individually. The detergent phase was washed twice with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-114 and the soluble phase with 10% Triton X-114. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Snc1/2p, an integral membrane protein, was used as a positive control and was detected with anti-Snc1/2p antisera (gift of P. Brennwald, Cornell University). Yeast strains RCY376 and RCY377 containing HA-YOP1 full-length and C-terminal constructs (respectively) behind the galactose promoter, were grown in sucrose minimal medium to early log phase, before washing and resuspending in galactose minimal medium. At the indicated intervals, aliquots of 5 OD units were harvested for production of lysates. For the sec18 experiments, cells were grown at room temperature until log phase before shifting an aliquot to the restrictive temperature (37 °C) for 1 h. Lysates were then boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The membrane was probed with polyclonal anti-carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (gift from P. Brennwald). Yeast strains RCY469 containing HA-Yop1p and RCY407 (isogenic untagged control) were grown to early log phase in YPD medium. 2× fixative (2× PBS, 4% glucose, 40 mm EGTA, 7.4% formaldehyde) was added to an equal volume of medium containing 3 OD units of cells and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml of 1× fixative, and incubated for a further 1 h. The cells were washed twice in 2 ml of spheroplasting buffer (100 mm KPi, pH 7.5, 1.2m sorbitol) and then incubated in spheroplasting buffer containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.08 mg/ml of zymolyase for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle mixing. 20 μl of the cell suspension was placed on individual wells of a polylysine-coated printed microscope slides (Carlson Scientific, Inc.) for 10 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS/BSA (1 mg/ml BSA) and permeabilized for 5 min with either 0.1% SDS or 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS/BSA. After washing five times in PBS/BSA, cells were blocked for 30 min in PBS/BSA. Polyclonal α-HA antibody (Y11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to each well at a dilution of 1:5000 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed 5 times in PBS/BSA and then incubated with Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:200 for 30 min at room temperature. Monoclonal 1.2.3 antibody was used to detect Sec4p (26Brennwald P. Novick P. Nature. 1993; 362: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (3E6; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used to detect GFP. These were followed by Oregon Green 514-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:250. To stain nuclei, 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) in PBS/BSA was added to each well, and after 10 min at room temperature, cells were washed five times. Cells were mounted in a small drop of mounting medium (Moviol), and the slides were left to air dry in the dark for at least 30 min. Confocal microscopy was performed using an Olympus FluoView confocal station (Olympus). Oregon Green was excited with the 488-nm line of an argon laser, and Texas Red was excited with the 568-nm line of a krypton laser. The cells were incubated for 14 h in medium containing galactose as sole carbon source at a final cell density (A 600) of between 0.4 and 0.7. Cells were washed with 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.8, and then fixed with 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.8, containing 3% glutaraldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C. The cell walls were removed by treatment with 0.1m KPi buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 mg/ml zymolyase 100T. The cell pellet was incubated with 1.5 ml of cold 2% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 1 h on ice followed by incubation with 1.5 ml of filtered 2% uranyl acetate (aqueous) at room temperature for 1 h. The cell pellets were dehydrated with the following ethanol washes: 50, 70, 90, and 100% followed by four washes from a fresh bottle of 200 proof ethanol and a final rinse in 100% acetone. The pellet was then incubated with 50% acetone, 50% SPURR resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences); this was changed to 100% SPURR resin, and the sample was transferred to beem capsules (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and baked at 80 °C for at least 24 h. Thin sections were cut onto Specimen Grids (Veco) (3-mm diameter, 75 × 300 mesh copper), contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and then examined in an FEI Philips TECHNAI 12 BioTwin electron microscope at 100 or 80 kV. The ORF sequences were subcloned into pAS1-CYH2 or pAS2–1 for “bait” and pACTII for “fish” constructs, respectively. The yeast strain Y190 was used for to screen the library for N-terminal Yip1p-interacting clones (27Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The yeast reporter strain Y190, which contains the reporter geneslacZ and HIS3 downstream of the binding sequences for Gal4, was sequentially transformed with the pACT2 and pAS2–1 (CLONTECH) plasmids containing the genes of interest. Double transformants were plated on selective medium (lacking tryptophan and leucine) and incubated for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Trp+ Leu+ colonies processed for the β-galactosidase filter assay as described (21Collins R.N. Brennwald P. Garrett M. Lauring A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18281-18289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To explore the role of Yip1p in membrane traffic, we considered the possibility that it may exist in physical association with other proteins. Such a protein may perhaps act to provide a specificity component to the Rab membrane recruitment reaction. To identify such potential proteins, we performed a two-hybrid screen using the cytosolic domain of Yip1p as bait. For this interaction screen, we used two-hybrid libraries constructed from short fragments (0.5–1 kilobase pair) of yeast genomic DNA (28James P. Halladay J. Craig E. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the yeast genome is relatively compact with few intron-containing genes, such a library represents a collection of random protein fragments. The rationale for such a strategy was that a Yip1p-interacting protein may be a membrane protein interacting with Yip1p through exposed soluble loops. Interactions may not be revealed by expressing full-length cDNAs, but protein fragments of the isolated loops alone may demonstrate interaction in the two-hybrid system. Analogous strategies have been used successfully to explore interactions of multispanning membrane proteins using the two-hybrid system (29Young K.H. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Using this scre"
https://openalex.org/W2026825834,"Fatty acid synthase (FAS), a nutritionally regulated lipogenic enzyme, is transcriptionally controlled by ADD1/SREBP1c (adipocyte determination and differentiation 1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), through insulin-mediated stimulation of ADD1/SREBP1c expression. Progesterone exerts lipogenic effects on adipocytes, and FAS is highly induced in breast tumor cell lines upon progesterone treatment. We show here that progesterone up-regulates ADD1/SREBP1c expression in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and the primary cultured preadipocyte from rat parametrial adipose tissue. In MCF7, progesterone induced ADD1/SREBP1c and Metallothionein II (a well known progesterone-regulated gene) mRNAs, with comparable potency. In preadipocytes, progesterone increased ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA dose-dependently, but not SREBP1a or SREBP2. Run-on experiments demonstrated that progesterone action on ADD1/SREBP1c was primarily at the transcriptional level. The membrane-bound and mature nuclear forms of ADD1/SREBP1 protein accumulated in preadipocytes cultured with progesterone, and FAS induction could be abolished by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of ADD1/SREBP1 in these cells. Finally, in the presence of insulin, progesterone was unable to up-regulate ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA in preadipocytes, whereas its effect was restored after 24 h of insulin deprivation. Together these results demonstrate that ADD1/SREBP1c is controlled by progesterone, which, like insulin, acts by increasing ADD1/SREBP1c gene transcription. This provides a potential mechanism for the lipogenic actions of progesterone on adipose tissue. Fatty acid synthase (FAS), a nutritionally regulated lipogenic enzyme, is transcriptionally controlled by ADD1/SREBP1c (adipocyte determination and differentiation 1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), through insulin-mediated stimulation of ADD1/SREBP1c expression. Progesterone exerts lipogenic effects on adipocytes, and FAS is highly induced in breast tumor cell lines upon progesterone treatment. We show here that progesterone up-regulates ADD1/SREBP1c expression in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and the primary cultured preadipocyte from rat parametrial adipose tissue. In MCF7, progesterone induced ADD1/SREBP1c and Metallothionein II (a well known progesterone-regulated gene) mRNAs, with comparable potency. In preadipocytes, progesterone increased ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA dose-dependently, but not SREBP1a or SREBP2. Run-on experiments demonstrated that progesterone action on ADD1/SREBP1c was primarily at the transcriptional level. The membrane-bound and mature nuclear forms of ADD1/SREBP1 protein accumulated in preadipocytes cultured with progesterone, and FAS induction could be abolished by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of ADD1/SREBP1 in these cells. Finally, in the presence of insulin, progesterone was unable to up-regulate ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA in preadipocytes, whereas its effect was restored after 24 h of insulin deprivation. Together these results demonstrate that ADD1/SREBP1c is controlled by progesterone, which, like insulin, acts by increasing ADD1/SREBP1c gene transcription. This provides a potential mechanism for the lipogenic actions of progesterone on adipose tissue.

As a key lipogenic enzyme, FAS is expressed mainly in liver and adipose tissue, where it turns dietary carbohydrates to fat. In these tissues, the transcription of the FAS gene is under nutritional control, leading to commensurately regulated activity of the enzyme. Briefly, feeding a high carbohydrate diet induces, whereas fasting or consuming a high fat diet decreases, FAS gene expression. Insulin (1Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

Westley B. May F. Alibert C. Rochefort H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 965-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and further studies have established that FAS expression was induced by progestins in the normal mammary gland also (12Chalbos D. Joyeux C. Galtier F. Escot C. Chambon M. Maudelonde T. Rochefort H. Rev. Esp. Fisiol. 1990; 46: 43-46PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of FAS induction by progestins relies primarily on transcriptional activation, as shown by run-on studies (13Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. Macphee K.G. Estrem S.T. Xu G. Goodridge A.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the direct implication of the progesterone receptor in the FAS gene-stimulated transcription has not been clearly established. Recently, significant progress has been made in the elucidation of the mechanisms of FAS gene regulation. Particularly, the role of a key transcription factor, ADD1/SREBP1c (adipocyte determination and differentiation 1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), has been uncovered. ADD1/SREBP1c, a member of the basic helix loop helix family of transcription factors (14Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X.X. Goldstein J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 15Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and in transgenic mice (17Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The ability of ADD1/SREBP1c to transactivate the FAS gene seems to be physiologically relevant, because ADD1/SREBP1c is induced by insulin in primary hepatocytes (18Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and adipose cell lines (19Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), down-regulated by cAMP and glucagon in hepatocytes (18Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and nutritionally regulated in the liver of mice (20Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it has been proposed that ADD1/SREBP1c is the mediator of insulin action on FAS gene expression (21Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In the light of these new insights, the present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of FAS gene regulation by progesterone. We found that progesterone is able to stimulate ADD1/SREBP1c expression, making it likely that progesterone-induced stimulation of FAS expression is exerted through activation of the same transcription factor as insulin, ADD1/SREBP1c. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Phenol red-free DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and DMEM, Ham's F12 (50:50 mix) were obtained from Sigma. Procedures with experimental animals were authorized and followed the guidelines of the Ministry of Agriculture (France) (authorization 006614). Female Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (125–150 g) were killed by decapitation, and parametrial fat pads were removed aseptically. Cell preparation and culture were performed as described in Ref. 22Deslex S. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar. Briefly, preadipocytes obtained from the stroma-vascular fraction of adipose tissue by collagenase digestion were plated at a density of 1–2 × 104 cells/cm2 in 8% fetal bovine serum/DMEM. After 12 h, cultures were washed and fed with 8% fetal bovine serum/DMEM. Medium was changed every other day. At confluence (3 days post-plating), cells were allowed to differentiate in DMEM/Ham's F12 containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, and 200 pm T3 (ITT medium) in the absence of serum, as described in Ref. 22Deslex S. Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar. Early differentiating preadipocytes (day 2 post-confluence) were treated with progesterone in serum-free medium for 24 h unless otherwise stated. Progesterone treatment was provided to cell dishes as an ethanol solution. An equivalent volume of ethanol alone (never exceeding 0.1% v/v) was added in untreated controls. In some experiments, cells in serum-free medium were infected (100 plaque-forming units/cell) with an adenovirus encoding a dominant negative form of ADD1 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (ad-DN) or with a control empty virus (ad-null) as described (23Boizard M. Le Liepvre X. Lemarchand P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). 16 h post-infection, the medium was changed, and progesterone was added or not for the next 24 h. MCF7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, Va) and cultured as recommended by the supplier. Progesterone treatment was performed in serum-free medium 1 day after confluence. Total RNA was isolated from 3–5 culture dishes (90 mm) by the guanidium thiocyanate method, as described in Ref. 24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar. RNAs were then separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was as described previously (23Boizard M. Le Liepvre X. Lemarchand P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and blots were washed in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Hybridization probes were as follows. ADD1/SREBP1c probe was a rat ADD1 cDNA fragment encompassing the first 403 amino acids of the ADD1 protein cloned in pSVSPORT1 (provided by B. Spiegelman, Boston, MA). The SREBP1a probe was a polymerase chain reaction fragment described previously (18Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding full-length MTII is described in Ref. 25Karin M. Richards R.I. Nature. 1982; 299: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar and was a kind gift of Dr. P. Hainaut (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France). An RNA probe for 18 S was used for normalization of the results. The effect of progesterone on gene transcription was assessed by run-on experiments as described in Ref. 26Dugail I. Quignard-Boulange A. Le Liepvre X. Ardouin B. Lavau M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. Nuclear extracts and crude membranes were prepared from cultured preadipocytes as described previously (27Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), separated on 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, and electrotransferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SREBP1 was probed using a 5 μg/ml dilution of the polyclonal antibody IgG-2A4 (ATCC). A C/EBPβ antibody (SC130, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was also used as a control for the specificity of progesterone effect. The blots were revealed using the ECL system (Pierce), as described by the manufacturer. The effect of progesterone was evaluated by Dunnet's Post test. The stimulatory effect of progesterone on FAS gene expression was originally described in MCF7, a breast carcinoma cell line. As a first step, the ability of progesterone to induce FAS mRNA in cultured preadipocytes was compared with the MCF7 cell system. A model of cultured preadipocytes isolated from female parametrial adipose tissue was chosen because of the presence of well characterized progesterone receptors on these cells (28Gray J.M. Wade G. Endocrinology. 1979; 104: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the induction of FAS activity upon differentiation. MCF7 cells or early differentiating preadipocytes (day 2 post-confluence) were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium in the presence of increasing concentrations of progesterone, and FAS mRNA levels were assessed by Northern blot analysis. Fig. 1 shows that progesterone dose-dependently increases FAS mRNA in both MCF7 cells and preadipocytes. We have also observed that induction of FAS mRNA by progesterone in preadipocytes was accompanied by a significant increase in lipogenic activity, as assessed by the conversion of [U-14C]glucose into lipids (data not shown). This establishes that the system of primary cultured preadipocytes behaves as the MCF7 cell line and is suitable to study progesterone regulation of FAS activity. In the light of the importance of ADD1/SREBP1c in insulin-mediated regulation of FAS gene expression, the effect of progesterone on SREBPs was next investigated. Fig. 2 shows that using an ADD1/SREBP1 cDNA probe, a dose-dependent induction of progesterone on ADD1/SREBP1 mRNA levels could be detected in preadipocytes. The EC50 for the progesterone effect was 90 nm, in good relation to that observed for the induction of FAS gene expression (220 nm) by the hormone (see Fig. 1). The ADD1/SREBP1 gene can be transcribed from two alternate promoters, generating two different (ADD1/SREBP1c and SREBP1a) transcripts of approximately the same size. Because the ADD1/SREBP1 probe used did not distinguish between the 1c and the 1a transcript, we also used a probe specific for SREBP1a to examine the effect of progesterone. We show in Fig. 2 that this 1a probe generated very weak hybridization signals that required a long time exposure and did not reveal any effect of progesterone. This suggests that in preadipocytes, the expression of the 1a isoform is low and unaffected by hormone treatment. Thus we concluded that the progesterone-induced ADD1/SREBP1 mRNA represented mainly the ADD1/SREBP1c transcript. For these reasons, the signals generated by the ADD1/SREBP1 probe were identified as ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA in quantitative analysis in Fig.2B. Because it has been demonstrated that progesterone was able to modify cholesterol trafficking at the plasma membrane, by virtue of its amphiphile properties, we also probed the blots for the mRNA encoding SREBP2, the cholesterol-sensitive isoform of SREBP that is derived from an independent gene. No hybridization signal for SREBP2 could be detected by Northern blot analysis, and no induction of SREBP2 mRNA could be seen upon progesterone treatment (data not shown). These data indicate that progesterone selectively stimulates the expression of the ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA, but not SREBP1a or SREBP2. The time course of the induction of ADD1/SREBP1c by progesterone was also examined (Fig. 2C). ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA levels increased between 0 and 24 h in control cells treated with ethanol only, reflecting the differentiation-dependent expression of ADD1/SREBP1c during adipose conversion. In progesterone-treated cells, ADD1/SREBP1c induction was more marked than in controls, indicating an effect of progesterone beginning after 6 h of treatment, sustained for at least a 24-h period. Among well characterized progesterone target genes is the Metallothionein IIA (MT-IIA) (29Slater E.P. Cato A.C. Karin M. Baxter J.D. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, we next compared the effects of progesterone on MT-IIA and ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA levels in the MCF7 cell line. Only background levels of hybridization could be detected in MCF7 cells with the SREBP1a-specific probe (data not shown), suggesting that, as in preadipocytes, the signals obtained with the ADD1/SREBP1 probe were generated by ADD1/SREBP1c. Fig.3 shows that ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA is expressed, albeit at low levels, in MCF7 cells in the absence of progesterone. This basal level of ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA can be dose-dependently induced by progesterone, in a very similar manner to the induction observed for the mRNA of MT-IIA, a well known progesterone-responsive gene. EC5O values were 110 and 70 nm for ADD1/SREBP1c and MT-IIA mRNAs, respectively. The time course of progesterone induction of ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA was also very similar to that reported in preadipocytes, with a stimulatory effect detectable after 6 h (data not shown). Thus these results demonstrate that ADD1/SREBP1c, like MT-IIA, is a progesterone-inducible gene. To further investigate the mechanism by which ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA concentrations are increased by progesterone, we measured gene transcription rates in run-on experiments. Fig. 4 shows that the ADD1/SREBP1 transcription rate is increased by progesterone treatment in both MCF7 cells and preadipocytes. Moreover, the amplitude of the progesterone effect on transcription (6.5-fold in MCF7 cells and 3.2-fold in preadipocytes) closely parallels that observed for steady state mRNA levels (9.7-fold in MCF7 cells and 3.1-fold in preadipocytes). Thus progesterone acts primarily at the transcriptional level in the regulation of ADD1/SREBP1c.Figure 4Effect of progesterone on ADD1/SREBP1c transcription rate. MCF7 cells (upper panel) and preadipocytes (lower panel) were treated for 24 h with 10 μm progesterone (Pg) as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and nuclei were prepared. Labeled RNAs were hybridized to 10 μg of dot-blotted plasmids. The control plasmid was the pSVsport1 vector in which ADD1/SREBP1 is cloned. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plasmid (full-length rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA in pUC9) was used as a negative control. Autoradiograms show representative results obtained with two independent preparations of nuclei. Quantification of the blots is shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To establish the link between the induction of ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA expression by progesterone and the induction of the FAS gene, an ADD1/SREBP1c target, we first investigated whether progesterone was able to increase the amount of the ADD1/SREBP1 protein in the cells. Crude membranes and nuclear extracts of preadipocytes were prepared and probed with a monoclonal anti-SREBP1 antibody in Western blots. As shown in Fig. 5A, cells treated with progesterone for 24 h showed increased levels of the precursor form in membrane fractions and higher contents of the active nuclear (cleaved) form of the ADD1/SREBP1 protein. As a control for the specificity of the progesterone effect, nuclear extracts were also probed with a C/EBPβ antibody, which did not reveal any change in C/EBPβ protein content. Collectively, these data demonstrate that progesterone, by increasing transcription rates of the gene, raises the levels of ADD1/SREBP1 mRNA in cells, which in turn leads to the accumulation of the membrane-bound precursor and mature nuclear forms of the ADD1/SREBP1 protein. To definitely establish the link between the induction of the nuclear mature form of ADD1/SREBP1 and FAS gene expression, we examined whether overexpression of a dominant negative form of ADD1/SREBP1c in progesterone-treated cells was able to block FAS gene induction. Preadipocytes were thus infected with an adenovirus overexpressing a dominant negative mutant for ADD1, described in Ref. 23Boizard M. Le Liepvre X. Lemarchand P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, or a control null vector and then stimulated by progesterone. The dominant negative form of ADD1 has been demonstrated to sequester endogenous ADD1/SREBP1c in cells, by dimerizing with the wild type protein and preventing DNA binding (30Kim J.B. Spotts G. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 15: 2582-2588Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 5B show that the 4-fold induction of FAS expression by progesterone that occurred in cells infected by the null vector was abolished when cells were infected by the adenovirus encoding the dominant negative form of ADD1. This demonstrates that ADD1/SREBP1 is required for progesterone-induced FAS gene expression. Finally, we investigated the relationship between insulin and progesterone in the control of ADD1/SREBP1c expression. Preadipocytes, which are known to acquire insulin sensitivity upon differentiation, were induced to fully differentiate in the presence of insulin (day 7 post-confluence), and the ability of progesterone to induce ADD1/SREBP1c expression was tested. Fig.6 shows that when cells differentiated in the presence of insulin, the ability of progesterone to induce ADD1/SREBP1c expression was abolished. The lack of progesterone effect was not due to a general desensitizing effect of insulin to progesterone, because MT-IIA gene expression still responded normally in insulin-differentiated cells. In agreement, Fig. 6 also shows that progesterone response was restored when cells were allowed to fully differentiate in the presence of insulin and then deprived of the hormone 24 h before progesterone treatment. Thus this experiment shows that insulin and progesterone exert nonadditive effects on ADD1/SREBP1c gene expression. In the present study, we provide evidence that the expression of ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA is stimulated by progesterone. We show that high levels of ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA can be induced upon progesterone stimulation in both the MCF7 cell line and primary cultured preadipocytes. We show that the effect of progesterone selectively involves the ADD1/SREBP1c isoform, which can be functionally distinguished from other cholesterol-regulated SREBP isoforms (for review, see Ref. 31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2980) Google Scholar) and which preferentially targets the expression of lipogenic genes in transgenic mice (17Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We also demonstrate that the progesterone effect on ADD1/SREBP1c is exerted through increased gene transcription and leads to increased levels of the protein product, especially the membrane-bound precursor and the mature nuclear active form of ADD1/SREBP1c. Changes in the levels of active SREBPs in the nucleus implicate complex post-translational control, such as regulated proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound precursor (31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2980) Google Scholar), and also activation through phosphorylation (32Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schurmann S. Knebel B. Krone W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showing the accumulation of both the high molecular weight precursor in membranes and the mature cleaved forms of ADD1/SREBP1 in nuclei upon progesterone treatment might suggest that proteolytic cleavage is not rate-limiting in the control of ADD1/SREBP1c. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that progesterone might also activate (directly or indirectly) ADD1/SREBP1c transcriptional activity. Our present data agree with a previous report (33Swinnen J.V. Ulrix W. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12975-12980Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) showing that the induction of several lipogenic genes was paralleled by increased levels of the mRNAs encoding SREBP1 and 2 and showing the accumulation of SREBP1 in the nucleus of human prostate cancer cells upon androgen treatment. These observations suggest that the SREBP factors might be a common control point through which sex hormones might signal for metabolic effects. Here we provide direct evidence that nuclear ADD1/SREBP1c protein is the factor through which the stimulatory effect of progesterone on FAS is exerted. This is supported mainly by the fact that the progesterone effect on FAS mRNA can be abolished by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative form of ADD1 within the cells, demonstrating that transcriptionally active ADD1/SREBP1c is required for the progesterone action on the FAS gene. This suggests that the effect of the hormone is not mediated through progesterone receptor target DNA sequences, which have not been found in the 5′ regulatory region of the FAS gene. Moreover, in the context of the regulation of ADD1/SREBP1c expression by insulin, the present study points out that the expression of ADD1/SREBP1c might be a key control point to which several hormone signaling pathways might converge for the regulation of lipogenesis. This is supported by our data showing that progesterone can act as insulin, to stimulate ADD1/SREBP1c expression. The effect of these two hormones appear to be mutually exclusive, at least in the cultured preadipocyte system, which exhibits both insulin and progesterone sensitivity. This is in agreement with the fact that both hormones act with similar kinetics on ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA, through the same mechanism, i.e.stimulation of ADD1/SREBP1 gene transcription (present data and 19). The finding of the present study that progesterone might be able in some situations to replace insulin for the control of ADD1/SREBP1c expression might have some physiological significance. During late pregnancy, an insulin-resistant state (34Homko C.J. Sivan E. Reece E.A. Boden G. Semin. Reprod. Endocrinol. 1999; 17: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35Ryan E.A. Enns L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) develops, and maternal glucose utilization is reduced, hence sparing carbohydrates for the rapidly growing fetus. However, lipogenesis in the parametrial adipose tissue remains active (36Lorenzo M. Caldes T. Benito M. Medina J.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this context, the induction of ADD1/SREBP1c by progesterone might serve to maintain lipogenesis in maternal adipose tissue, to preserve energy fat stores required for lactation, a highly energy-consuming process. On the other hand, it has been observed that progesterone treatment of diabetic rats was able to induce lipogenesis in fat (37Mendes A.M. Madon R.J. Flint D.J. J. Endocrinol. 1985; 106: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), further suggesting that in the absence of insulin, progesterone can serve as an alternative stimulating factor of adipose tissue lipogenesis. Thus, our present observation that ADD1/SREBP1c is a progesterone-regulated transcription factor might provide a mechanism for the understanding of the physiological regulation of lipogenesis by progesterone."

We prepared a monoclonal antibody against human peflin. The antibody immunoprecipitated a 22-kDa protein as well as the 30-kDa protein from the lysate of Jurkat cells. Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates revealed that the 22-kDa protein corresponds to ALG-2. This was confirmed by Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates of epitope-tagged peflin or ALG-2 whose cDNA expression constructs were transfected to human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Gel filtration of the cytosolic fraction of Jurkat cells revealed co-elution of peflin and ALG-2 in fractions eluting earlier than recombinant ALG-2, further supporting the notion of heterodimerization of the two PEF proteins. Surprisingly, peflin dissociated from ALG-2 in the presence of Ca2+. Peflin and ALG-2 co-localized in the cytoplasm, but ALG-2 was also detected in the nuclei as revealed by immunofluorescent staining and subcellular fractionation. Peflin was recovered in the cytosolic fraction in the absence of Ca2+ but in the membrane/cytoskeletal fraction in the presence of Ca2+. These results suggest that peflin has features common to those of other PEF proteins (dimerization and translocation to membranes) and may modulate the function of ALG-2 in Ca2+ signaling.

These results suggest that peflin has features common to those of other PEF proteins (dimerization and translocation to membranes) and may modulate the function of ALG-2 in Ca2+ signaling. It is now accepted that Ca2+ is one of the most versatile second messengers relaying information within cells to regulate their activities such as muscle contraction, secretory events, cell cycle, differentiation, gene expression, and apoptosis. Ca2+ plays its pivotal role through specific classes of Ca2+-binding proteins, most of which possess Ca2+-binding motifs such as endonexin folds, C2 regions, or EF-hands. Many EF-hand type Ca2+-binding proteins have been identified, and they have been classified into dozens of families based on amino acid sequence similarities and number of EF-hand motifs in their molecules (1Persechini A. Moncrief N.D. Kretsinger R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1989; 12: 462-467Google Scholar). Recently, we classified a new family of proteins possessing domains with five EF-hand-like motifs, and we proposed the name “penta-EF-hand (PEF)”1 as a collective name for these domains (2Maki M. Narayana S.V.L. Hitomi K. Biochem. J... 1997; 328: 718-720Google Scholar). The PEF domain was originally found in the Ca2+-binding domain of the small subunit of calpain, an intracellular Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, by x-ray crystallography (3Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1997; 4: 532-538Google Scholar, 4Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V.L. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1997; 4: 539-547Google Scholar). Later studies revealed that the PEF domains are present in several other Ca2+-binding proteins such as the calpain large subunit, sorcin (5Van der Bliek A.M. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Hes E. Borst P. EMBO J... 1986; 5: 3201-3208Google Scholar), grancalcin (6Boyhan A. Casimir C.M. French J.K. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 2928-2933Google Scholar), and apoptosis-linkedgene 2 (ALG-2) (7Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science.. 1996; 271: 521-525Google Scholar). Whereas sorcin and grancalcin exist as homodimers (8Teahan C.G. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J... 1992; 286: 549-554Google Scholar, 9Hamada H. Okochi E. Oh-hara T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res... 1988; 48: 3173-3178Google Scholar), calpains exist as heterodimers of the large catalytic and small regulatory subunits (10Goll D.E. Kleese W.C. Okitani A. Kumamoto T. Cong J. Kapprell H. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis.CRC Press, Inc. 1990; : 3-24Google Scholar). The bacterially expressed recombinant PEF domain of the calpain small subunit forms a homodimer without the large subunit (11Blanchard H. Li Y. Cygler M. Kay C.M. Simon J. Arthur C. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Protein Sci... 1996; 5: 535-537Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies have also revealed that the dimers are formed through a pair of fifth EF-hands (EF-5s) that have lost their Ca2+-binding capacities due to two-residue insertions (3Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1997; 4: 532-538Google Scholar, 4Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V.L. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1997; 4: 539-547Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that PEF proteins may form dimers with each other through EF-5, which provides a new interface for the interaction with possible targets. The calpain small subunit, sorcin, grancalcin, and ALG-2 have hydrophobic domains with variable lengths in the N-terminal regions. In the case of calpains, the hydrophobic N-terminal domains bind to the membranes and play an important role in the change of subcellular localization induced by Ca2+ (12Crawford C. Brown N.R. Willis A.C. Biochem. J... 1990; 265: 575-579Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of sorcin is required to interact with the membrane-localized annexin VII in a Ca2+-dependent manner (13Verzili D. Zamparelli C. Mattei B. Noegel A.A. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett... 2000; 471: 197-200Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal regions of PEF proteins are thought to interact with phospholipids and/or target proteins on membranes. Previously, we reported a novel PEF protein, peflin (PEFprotein with a long N-terminal hydrophobic domain), which was cloned after a homology search for other PEF proteins (14Kitaura Y. Watanabe M. Satoh H. Kawai T. Hitomi K. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 263: 68-75Google Scholar). Peflin is most similar to ALG-2 in the PEF domain and has the longest N-terminal hydrophobic region of proteins in the PEF family. Peflin is expressed in several human cell lines, but its target protein and function have not been determined yet. In this study, using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific to human peflin, we demonstrated that peflin was co-immunoprecipitated with ALG-2. The peflin/ALG-2 heterodimer dissociated in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The N-terminal hydrophobic domain of peflin was not essential for the heterodimerization. Peflin co-localized with ALG-2 in the cytoplasm and changed the subcellular localization in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,l-glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C under humidified air containing 5% CO2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as above. BALB/c female mice were immunized three times with His-tagged N-terminal truncated peflin (His-peflinΔN) prepared as described previously (14Kitaura Y. Watanabe M. Satoh H. Kawai T. Hitomi K. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 263: 68-75Google Scholar). Hybridomas were generated by polyethylene glycol-mediated fusion of donor splenocytes to the P3 myeloma cell line. Positive hybridomas were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cloned by limited dilution. Cloned hybridomas were transplanted intraperitoneally to BALB/c mice. The IgG fraction was prepared from ascites and purified by the ammonium sulfate precipitation method. Western blotting was performed as described previously (14Kitaura Y. Watanabe M. Satoh H. Kawai T. Hitomi K. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 263: 68-75Google Scholar). Jurkat cells (1 × 107) were incubated in a 60-mm dish containing 1.5 ml of a methionine/cysteine-free medium for metabolic labeling (Sigma) supplemented with PBS-dialyzed fetal bovine serum to 10% and 35S-labeled amino acid mixture (100 μCi/ml, 70% methionine and 30% cysteine) at 37 °C for 4 h under humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm pefabloc, 25 μm leupeptin, 10 μm E-64, and 1 μm pepstatin) containing 5 mm EGTA or 0.01 mm CaCl2. Aliquots were incubated with indicated antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C and further incubated with protein G-Sepharose 4FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with buffer A and subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography using a BAS 2000 system (Fuji Film, Kanagawa, Japan). Anti-human RECK MoAb 32C10A (15Takahashi C. Sheng Z. Horan T.P. Kitayama H. Maki M. Hitomi K. Kitaura Y. Takai S. Sasahara R.M. Horimoto A. Ikawa Y. Ratzkin B.J. Arakawa T. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 13221-13226Google Scholar) was used as a negative control antibody for immunoprecipitation. Anti-FLAG MoAb M2 was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Anti-mouse ALG-2 polyclonal antibody (PoAb) raised in rabbits was affinity-purified using recombinant human ALG-2 as described previously (16Maki M. Yamaguchi K. Kitaura Y. Satoh H. Hitomi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 1998; 124: 1170-1177Google Scholar). An EcoRI fragment of the full-length peflin cDNA was inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector, pCXN2 (a derivative of pCAGGS, a kind gift from Dr. J. Miyazaki; Ref. 17Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene.. 1991; 108: 193-199Google Scholar), and a BamHI fragment of either a full-length or an N-terminal truncated peflin (peflinΔN: amino acids 116–284) was inserted in-frame into a pCMV-tag2 vector (Stratagene) for expression as FLAG-tagged protein. A human ALG-2 cDNA was cloned from Jurkat cells by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method, and aBglII/BamHI fragment was inserted into pCXN2 and pCMV-tag2. One day after HEK293 cells (1 × 106cells/60-mm dish) had been seeded, the cells were transfected with the expression plasmid DNAs by the conventional calcium phosphate precipitation method. After 48 h, cells were collected and analyzed by the immunoprecipitation and/or Western blotting methods, where aliquots of immunoprecipitated proteins and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE using comparable amounts of the relevant samples. The DNA transfection efficiency monitored by the expression of a green fluorescent protein construct, pCMV-EGFP (obtained fromCLONTECH), was about 20% under a similar condition in separate experiments. Cytospin preparations of Jurkat cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/0.2 ml) were prepared by centrifugation using an SC-2 adapter (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS, cover glasses were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-peflin MoAb and anti-ALG-2 PoAb) at 4 °C overnight and with secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for peflin and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for ALG-2) at room temperature for 30 min. Immunofluorescences were analyzed by an MRC-1024 Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Subcellular fractionation was performed by lysing cells with a Dounce homogenizer in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitors as described above), followed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g (4000 rpm by a Sakuma M-150 rotor) for 10 min at 4 °C producing a pellet (see Fig. 7 A,P1). The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g (13,000 rpm by a Sakuma M-150 rotor) for 10 min at 4 °C producing a second pellet (see Fig. 7 A,P2) and then at 100, 000 × g (60,000 rpm by a Beckman TLA 100 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C producing a third pellet and a supernatant (see Fig. 7 A, P3 andS, respectively). Nuclei were purified essentially as described by Dignam and colleagues (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res... 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Briefly, the crude nuclear fraction (P1) was homogenized in buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2 m sucrose, layered onto a cushion of buffer A containing 2 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g (18,000 rpm by a Beckman TLS-55 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C. Jurkat cells (2 × 108) were washed twice with PBS and lysed in buffer B containing 5 mm EGTA, and the cytosolic fractions (100,000 ×g, supernatant) were prepared as above. The cytosolic proteins were fractionated by gel filtration using a Superdex-75 column (1.0 cm × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions (0.2 ml each) were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. Recombinant human ALG-2 was prepared essentially as described previously (16Maki M. Yamaguchi K. Kitaura Y. Satoh H. Hitomi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 1998; 124: 1170-1177Google Scholar) and subjected to gel filtration using the same column. Previously, we prepared anti-peflin antiserum and detected a 30-kDa protein as a major band in the lysates of various cell lines (14Kitaura Y. Watanabe M. Satoh H. Kawai T. Hitomi K. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1999; 263: 68-75Google Scholar). The antiserum, however, also cross-reacted with a protein of about 40 kDa, and it remained unknown whether the 30-kDa protein was processed from the 40-kDa protein. In the present study, we prepared a MoAb, named P1G, which was more specific to the peflin protein. As shown in Fig.1 A, the prepared MoAb P1G recognized a 30-kDa protein as a single band in Jurkat cell lysates by Western blotting, whereas the antiserum reacted additionally with other proteins. The MoAb could detect FLAG-tagged peflin (FLAG-peflin) and FLAG-tagged N-terminal truncated peflin (FLAG-peflinΔN) exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells as differently migrating bands at expected positions. Thus, it was concluded that the 30-kDa protein detected with the antiserum corresponds to an unprocessed peflin molecule. To determine whether MoAb P1G could immunoprecipitate peflin, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. The peflin protein was immunoprecipitated with MoAb P1G (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) but not with an irrelevant MoAb 32C10A against human RECK (Fig.1 B, lane 2), which is not expressed in Jurkat cells. To search for a peflin-interacting protein, we metabolically labeled Jurkat cells with35S-labeled amino acids, and immunoprecipitated peflin with MoAb P1G. An autoradiogram revealed a protein band of about 22 kDa, which was co-immunoprecipitated with peflin in the presence of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA but not in the presence of CaCl2 (Fig. 2). PEF proteins have the common feature of dimerization with each other (2Maki M. Narayana S.V.L. Hitomi K. Biochem. J... 1997; 328: 718-720Google Scholar). For example, sorcin and grancalcin form homodimers (8Teahan C.G. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J... 1992; 286: 549-554Google Scholar, 9Hamada H. Okochi E. Oh-hara T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res... 1988; 48: 3173-3178Google Scholar), and calpains form heterodimers of the large and small subunits (10Goll D.E. Kleese W.C. Okitani A. Kumamoto T. Cong J. Kapprell H. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis.CRC Press, Inc. 1990; : 3-24Google Scholar). Interestingly, heterodimers of the calpain subunits have been reported to dissociate in a Ca2+-dependent manner (19Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Tomioka S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1995; 208: 376-383Google Scholar). We thought that peflin might also dimerize with itself or with other PEF proteins. We suspected the co-immunoprecipitated 22-kDa protein to be ALG-2 because it is the 22-kDa protein most similar to peflin in the PEF protein family. To investigate the interaction of peflin with ALG-2 in Jurkat cells, we performed a combined immunoprecipitation-Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, ALG-2 was detected in the immunoprecipitates using anti-peflin MoAb P1G in the presence of EGTA but not in the presence of CaCl2. Anti-ALG-2 PoAb also immunoprecipitated peflin in the presence of EGTA in a complementary experiment. The immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated at least three times under different conditions by varying the concentrations of antibodies and protein G. The figures show representative results. Efficiency of the immunoprecipitation of ALG-2 with anti-ALG-2 PoAb was poor, particularly in the presence of Ca2+ (see “Discussion” below). Next, we examined the interaction between the two PEF proteins using HEK293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged peflin and ALG-2 expression vectors. ALG-2 was detected in the immunoprecipitates of FLAG-peflin using anti-FLAG MoAb M2 (Fig.4 A). ALG-2 was also co-immunoprecipitated with N-terminal truncated peflin (FLAG-peflinΔN), indicating that the PEF domain of peflin is the site of this interaction. This was confirmed by complementary co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-ALG-2 with untagged peflin (Fig.4 B). On the other hand, untagged peflin was not co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-peflin (Fig. 4 C), suggesting no possibility of peflin/peflin interaction. In contrast, untagged ALG-2 was precipitated with FLAG-tagged ALG-2 regardless of the presence of either EGTA or CaCl2 as reported previously (Fig. 4 D and Ref. 20Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ... 1999; 6: 124-129Google Scholar). To further examine whether peflin forms a complex with ALG-2, we performed gel chromatography of the soluble fraction of Jurkat cells in the presence of EGTA. Peflin and ALG-2 were co-eluted in the fractions corresponding to 40–50 kDa (Fig.5 B, top andmiddle, fractions 9–14) greater than the calculated molecular masses (peflin, 30 kDa; ALG-2, 22 kDa). On the other hand, recombinant human ALG-2 was detected in the fractions eluting later than in those by Jurkat ALG-2 (Fig. 5 B,bottom, fractions 13-16). Recombinant human peflin was insoluble and could not be applied to the column. We investigated the localization of peflin and ALG-2 using Jurkat cells. Double-immunofluorescent staining was performed using both anti-peflin MoAb P1G and anti-ALG-2 PoAb and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Immunofluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm for peflin and in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus for ALG-2 (Fig.6). As shown in Fig. 7 A, peflin was recovered in the cytosolic fraction (S) using a lysis buffer containing 3 mm MgCl2 but containing neither EGTA nor CaCl2 by subcellular fractionation based on the differential centrifugation method. In contrast, ALG-2 was recovered in the crude nuclear fraction (P1), as well as in the cytosolic fraction. The crude nuclear fraction was subjected to centrifugation on a 2 m sucrose cushion. ALG-2 was detected in the purified nuclei (N), agreeing with the result of immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 6). In the presence of 0.01 mm CaCl2, however, almost all peflin and ALG-2 were recovered in the crude nuclear fraction (Fig. 7, B andC, P1), but the purified nuclei contained a smaller amount of peflin and most of the peflin protein was recovered in the membrane/cytoskeletal fraction above a 2 m sucrose cushion (data not shown). In contrast, under the same conditions, roughly equal amounts of ALG-2 were recovered in the membrane/cytoskeletal fraction and in the purified nuclei (data not shown). Inclusion of 0.1% Triton X-100 in a buffer containing 5 mm EGTA or 0.01 mm CaCl2 partially solubilized peflin and ALG-2 (Fig. 7, B and C), but some of the PEF proteins were resistant to the detergent. A higher concentration of Triton X-100 (1%) gave similar results (data not shown). These results suggested that peflin and ALG-2 also changed their subcellular distribution with Ca2+ as reported for other PEF proteins, probably from the cytosol to the membrane and detergent-insoluble (cytoskeletal) fractions. We showed that peflin exists as a complex with ALG-2 in the absence of Ca2+ but that the complex dissociates in the presence of the divalent cation. Peflin and ALG-2 seem to interact directly because the two proteins were eluted from the gel filtration column at the position of a heterodimer (Fig. 5). Previously, Missotten and colleagues (20Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ... 1999; 6: 124-129Google Scholar) showed that ALG-2 forms a homodimer by co-immunoprecipitation of transiently co-overexpressed FLAG- and Myc-tagged proteins in HEK293 cells. In agreement with their result, we also detected a complex of exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged ALG-2 and untagged ALG-2, but the efficiency of the dimer formation was lower than that of the heterodimer formation with peflin (Fig. 4,B and D). Without co-transfection with untagged ALG-2, no ALG-2 immunoreactive band was detected in the immunoprecipitates of anti-FLAG MoAb M2 (data not shown). In similar experiments, no FLAG-peflin/peflin complex was observed (Fig.4 C). On the other hand, a peflin/ALG-2 complex was clearly observed in the co-transfection assays (Fig. 4, Aand B) and even in the endogenously expressing proteins in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3). Thus, the formation of a peflin/ALG-2 heterodimer seems dominant over an ALG-2/ALG-2 homodimer. Since the 22-kDa protein that was co-immunoprecipitated with peflin in35S-labeled Jurkat cells was identified as ALG-2 (Fig. 2), it became possible to estimate an approximate molar ratio between peflin and ALG-2 in the complex. Assuming that peflin and ALG-2 incorporate 35S-labeled amino acids with similar efficiencies during de novo synthesis, relative specific radioactivities can be calculated from the numbers of methionine (excluding translation initiation Met) and cysteine residues in the proteins (peflin: 9 Met, 5 Cys; ALG-2: 3 Met, 1 Cys). Thus, the ratio of relative specific radioactivities of [35S]peflin and [35S]ALG-2 is 14:4. This ratio agrees well with that of the observed relative radioactivities of the 30-kDa band (peflin) and the 22-kDa band (ALG-2) in the autoradiogram analyzed by a bioimaging analyzer BAS 2000 system (3.5:1 versus 4.2:1 calculated from photostimulated luminescence units: peflin, 556; ALG-2, 132). This fact indicates the presence of an approximately equal molar ratio (1:0.83) of peflin and ALG-2 in the immunoprecipitates and suggests that the majority of peflin exists as a heterodimer with ALG-2 in the cytosol in the absence of Ca2+. On the other hand, not all of ALG-2 forms a heterodimer with peflin. Approximately 50% of ALG-2 is present in the 100,000 ×g supernatant fraction, and the rest is found in nuclei and membrane/cytoskeletal fractions (Figs. 6 and 7). Because the amounts of peflin in the latter fractions are quite low, non-cytosolic ALG-2 may exist either as a homodimer or complexed with unknown macromolecules. Co-elution of cytosolic ALG-2 with peflin in the gel filtration chromatography suggests that the majority of cytosolic ALG-2 forms a heterodimer with peflin (Fig. 5). The results of the immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-ALG-2 PoAb, however, do not support this notion (Fig. 3). Whereas only a fraction (<10%) of ALG-2 was immunoprecipitable from the lysate, more than half of peflin was co-immunoprecipitable with the antibody. The major cause of this inconsistency may be due to the nature of the anti-ALG-2 PoAb used in this study. The antibody was first raised in rabbits using denatured recombinant mouse ALG-2 and was later affinity-purified using recombinant human ALG-2 as a ligand. The obtained antibody may recognize only a fraction of ALG-2 that retains a specific conformation favoring interaction with peflin and may poorly recognize ALG-2 monomers and homodimers under undenatured conditions. Alternatively, the antibody may disrupt the protein-protein interaction under investigation. It is unlikely that the co-immunoprecipitation of peflin with anti-ALG-2 PoAb was due to a cross-reactivity of the antibody with peflin, because the antibody did not react with peflin overexpressed in HEK293 cells by Western blotting (data not shown). Indeed, anti-FLAG MoAb co-immunoprecipitated untagged peflin together with FLAG-tagged ALG-2 from the lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with the tagged ALG-2-expressing construct (Fig. 4 B). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the PEF domains of the recombinant rat and pig calpain small subunits revealed homodimerization through EF-5 of each molecule (3Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur J.S. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1997; 4: 532-538Google Scholar, 4Lin G.D. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yuen P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V.L. Nat. Struct. Biol... 1997; 4: 539-547Google Scholar). Recently, the heterodimers of recombinant m-calpains of the large and small subunits and the homodimer of grancalcin have been crystallized, and PEF domains have been shown to form similar dimer structures through EF-5s (21Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 6880-6889Google Scholar, 22Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H.

We assume that peflin forms a heterodimer with ALG-2 by a similar protein-protein interaction mechanism. The N-terminal hydrophobic region of peflin is not essential for heterodimer formation as revealed by FLAG-peflinΔN (Fig. 4 A). In the present study, however, we could not investigate the potential role of the EF-5 domains of peflin and ALG-2 in their interaction. A deletion mutant lacking EF-5 (peflinΔEF5) could not be expressed in transient transfection experiments using HEK293 cells suggesting the importance of heterodimerization with ALG-2 for stability and/or correct folding of peflin. The results of cellular fractionation experiments suggested that peflin and ALG-2 translocate from the cytosolic fraction to the membrane and Triton X-100-insoluble (cytoskeletal) fractions in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 7). In this study, however, we could not detect a change in the immunofluorescence after stimulation of Jurkat cells with Ca2+-ionophore, and we could not obtain direct evidence of the Ca2+-induced translocation of these proteins by immunofluorescent staining. Surprisingly, ALG-2 was also found to localize in nuclei, raising the possibility of a specific function in nuclear Ca2+signaling. Recently, Krebs and Klemenz (24Krebs J. Klemenz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2000; 1498: 153-161Google Scholar) showed the nuclear localization of ALG-2 by immunofluorescent staining of breast cancer cells and observed disappearance of the nuclear localization of ALG-2 at the onset of mitosis. Apoptotic pathways of ALG-2 have been partially clarified. ALG-2 was originally identified by the method called “death trap” in T-cell hybridoma using anti-CD3 antibody (7Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science.. 1996; 271: 521-525Google Scholar). An antisense ALG-2 cDNA expression prompted survival after a variety of apoptotic stimuli, but caspase activities were not affected (25Lacana E. Ganjei J.K. Vito P. D'Adamio L. J. Immunol... 1997; 158: 5129-5135Google Scholar). An ALG-2-interacting protein named either AIP1 (ALG-2-interactingprotein 1) or Alix (ALG-2-interacting protein X) was cloned concurrently by two independent groups (20Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ... 1999; 6: 124-129Google Scholar, 26Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 1533-1540Google Scholar). AIP1 is a 105-kDa protein with a proline-rich C-terminal region containing 10 PXXP sequence motifs that potentially bind to SH3 domains. The N-terminal-truncated AIP1 construct exerted dominant-negative effects on the apoptosis of transfected cells induced by starvation of trophic factors or staurosporine (26Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 1533-1540Google Scholar). The interaction between AIP1 and ALG-2 requires Ca2+. In addition, AIP1 has been reported to interact with SETA (SH3 domain-containing protein expressed intumorigenic astrocytes) through its C-terminal proline-rich region, which binds to SH3-N (one of the two SH3 domains) of SETA in a Ca2+-independent manner (27Chen B. Borinstein S.C. Gillis J. Sykes V.W. Bogler O. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 19275-19281Google Scholar). Overexpressed SETA proteins capable of binding to AIP1 sensitized astrocytes to UV light-induced cell death. Thus, in resting cells, SETA/AIP1 and peflin/ALG-2 complexes may exist separately in the cytoplasm. After Ca2+-mobilization, ALG-2 may dissociate from peflin and interact with SETA/AIP1 complex. In our preliminary experiments, however, peflin-overexpressed HEK293 cells did not show morphological changes and differences in apoptotic sensitivity upon stimulation with Ca2+-ionophore or staurosporine compared with control transfectants. Studies are in progress to investigate the potential role of peflin in Ca2+-dependent apoptosis under various conditions. We thank H. Shibata for his valuable suggestions, T. Kawai for his technical assistance, and Dr. K.

In this study, ET-1 (100 nm) induced a rapid activation of p21ras in human glomerular mesangial cells (HMC). Inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinase activation with [4-Amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine] or chelation of intracellular free calcium with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester significantly decreased ET-1dependent p21ras activation and suggested the involvement of the cytoplasmic proline-rich tyrosine kinase Pyk2. We have observed that Pyk2 was expressed in HMC and was tyrosine-phosphorylated within 5 min of ET-1 treatment. ET-1-induced activation of Pyk2 was further confirmed using phospho-specific anti-Pyk2 antibodies. Surprisingly, Src kinase activity was required upstream of ET-1-induced autophosphorylation of Pyk2. To determine whether Pyk2 autophosphorylation mediated ET-1-dependent p21ras activation, adenovirus-mediated transfer was employed to express a dominant-negative form of Pyk2 (CRNK). CRNK expression inhibited ET-1-induced endogenous Pyk2 autophosphorylation, but did not abolish ET-1-mediated increases in GTP-bound p21ras levels. ET-1-induced activation of the p38 MAPK (but not ERK) pathway was inhibited in HMC and in rat glomerular mesangial cells expressing the dominant-negative form of Pyk2. These findings suggest that the engagement of Pyk2 is important for ET-1-mediated p38 MAPK activation and hence the biological effect of this peptide in mesangial cells.

Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1997; 29: 2-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Endothelin-1 (ET-1)1 is a member of a family of 21 amino acid peptides possessing potent vasoconstrictor properties whose ability to stimulate mesangial cell proliferation is well established (2Simonson M.S. Wann S. Mene P. Dubyak G. Kester M. Nakazato Y. Sedor J.R. Dunn M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Moreover, ET-1, acting in concert with other vasoactive mediators, cytokines, and growth factors, plays an integral role in the pathogenesis of proliferative glomerulonephritis. Stimulation of mesangial cells with ET-1 evokes a wide variety of signaling events (for review, see Ref. 3Schramek H. Dunn M.J. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.T. Endothelins in Biology and Medicine. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1997: 81-100Google Scholar); however, ET-1-induced cell proliferation occurs primarily via its activation of the intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The p38 group of MAPKs has been found to be involved in inflammation, cell contraction, and cell death (4Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 5Muller E. Burger-Kentischer A. Neuhofer W. Fraek M.-L. Marz J. Thurau K. Beck F.-X. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Contractive responsiveness of mesangial cells was shown to depend on activation of the p38 MAPKs (5Muller E. Burger-Kentischer A. Neuhofer W. Fraek M.-L. Marz J. Thurau K. Beck F.-X. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Dunlop M.E. Muggli E.E. Kid. Int. 2000; 57: 464-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and could perhaps partially account for ET-1 contractive properties. On the basis of the genetic and biochemical evidence, it seems likely that p21ras , a member of the small GTPase superfamily, has a crucial role in growth factor-induced stimulation of ERK and resultant renal cell proliferation (for review, see Ref. 7Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 5: 1288-1299PubMed Google Scholar). The active form of p21ras is bound to GTP, whereas the inactive form is bound to GDP. The exchange of GTP for GDP is promoted by guanosine nucleotide exchange factors, which are recruited to the signaling complex by adaptor proteins (for review, see Ref. 8Clark G.J. O'Bryan J.P. Der C.J. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control: The Molecular Basis of Cancer and Other Diseases. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 213-230Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that ET-1-dependent p21ras activation in mesangial cells requires tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc and the subsequent formation of the Shc·Grb2·Sos signaling complex (9Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which ET-1 induces Shc phosphorylation has not been defined. In analogy to p21ras regulation of ERK, members of the Rho family of small GTPases are positive regulators of p38 MAPK pathways (10Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms of ET-1 stimulation of p38 MAPKs have not yet been clarified. The actions of ET-1 are mediated by ligand-dependent activation of specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (for review, see Ref. 11Hiley C.R. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.T. Endothelins in Biology and Medicine. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1997: 3-26Google Scholar). GPCRs are devoid of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity; therefore, the protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by ligands of GPCRs depends ultimately upon subsequent activation of cellular tyrosine kinases. Evidence suggests that ET-1 activates members of the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (12Schieffer B. Drexler H. Ling B.N. Marrero M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C2019-C2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cazaubon S. Chaverot N. Romero I.A. Girault J.-A. Adamson P. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.-O. J.

Tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be essential for the mitogenic effects of many GPCRs ligands, including ET-1 (3Schramek H. Dunn M.J. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.T. Endothelins in Biology and Medicine. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1997: 81-100Google Scholar), so it is not surprising that the signaling pathways linking GPCR activation with mobilization of cellular tyrosine kinases have become the subject of intensive investigation. One of the typical cellular responses to ligand-dependent GPCR activation shared by ET-1 is mobilization of intracellular calcium (for review, see Ref. 15Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). The cloning of the calcium-regulated cytoplasmic proline-rich tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (also known as related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), focal adhesion kinase-2 (FAK2), and cell adhesion kinase β (CAKβ), calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK)) suggested the link between GPCRs and the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation via mobilization of intracellular calcium (16Lev S.

Genomics. 1996; 32: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, a number of studies have supported the role of Pyk2 in coupling GPCRs with MAPK activation (21Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 22Blaukat A. Ivankivic-Dikic I. Groos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol.

ERK activation by ET-1 was found to coincide with Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation in primary astrocytes (13Cazaubon S. Chaverot N. Romero I.A. Girault J.-A. Adamson P. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.-O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6203-6212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pyk2 and FAK belong to a distinct family of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases that are regulated by extracellular stimuli (23Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Although FAK and Pyk2 may have partially redundant roles, they also exhibit distinct differences, notably with regard to their substrate specificity (24Schaller M.D. Sasaki T. J. Biol.

The proline-rich region of Pyk2 interacts with a number of SH3 (Src homology) domain-containing proteins, including the docking protein Crk-associated substrate (p130cas ) (27Astier A. Avraham H.

Activation of Pyk2, but not FAK, leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of PAP (26Andreev J. Simon J.-P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we show that glomerular mesangial cells express significant amounts of Pyk2 and elucidate the role of calcium-regulated Pyk2 in mediating ET-1-induced signaling events in these cells. We demonstrate that (i) ET-1-mediated activation of p21ras depends upon mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of Src family of kinases and that (ii) Pyk2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to ET-1 and that adenovirus-mediated transfer of a dominant interfering Pyk2 construct abolishes autophosphorylation of endogenous Pyk2, preventing ET-1-stimulated p38 MAPK activation. ET-1-mediated activation of p21ras and ERK activation were not abolished by adenovirus-mediated transfer of a dominant interfering Pyk2 construct. Taken together, these findings suggest that engagement of the calcium-regulated protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2 is important for cellular responses to ET-1 and hence the biological effects of this peptide.

The cDNA fragment encoding human CRNK (starting at 692 amino acid of human Pyk2) containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was originally amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into theHindIII/XbaI sites of the pAdlox vector. The starting codon (encoding methionine residue) was added at the N terminus of this recombinant protein. Serum-restricted mesangial cells were infected with varying titers of Ad LacZ in 0.9 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% bovine serum albumin; and 1 h later, this was replaced with serum-free culture medium. Following 24–48 h of infection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% glutaraldehyde and 1 mm MgCl2for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% X-gal in phosphate-buffered saline for 1–2 h at 37 °C. Infection of serum-restricted HMC with Ad Pyk2 WT or Ad Pyk2 CRNK was performed at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 70 or 90 plaque-forming units/cell. After 1 h, serum-free medium was added to the plates, and the cells were maintained for 24–48 h prior to stimulation. Ligation of a cDNA fragment encoding the Raf1 p21ras -binding domain (RBD) into theSmaI site of the pGEX-2T vector generated a GST-RBD fusion protein (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (37Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The activated p21ras affinity precipitation assay was performed exactly as described previously (9Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation of samples standardized for protein content, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (9Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have described previously the kinetics of ET-1-stimulated p21ras activation in glomerular mesangial cells (9Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In RMC, ET-1 evokes a biphasic GTP loading of p21ras , with the first peak of activation occurring at 2–5 min and resulting in a monophasic activation of ERK1 and ERK2. It is generally accepted that GTP-bound p21ras is able to interact with Raf1, leading to activation of the ERK signaling cascade. We have previously demonstrated that p21ras activation is mediated by an immediate association of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc with the guanosine exchange factor Sos1 via the adaptor protein Grb2. However, thus far, the identity of the tyrosine kinase responsible for phosphorylating Shc, leading to the resultant activation of p21ras , is undetermined. In this study, p21ras activation was assessed by means of an affinity binding assay that evaluates the quantity of GTP-bound p21ras protein able to associate with a GST-RBD fusion protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1, ET-1 induced a rapid activation of p21ras in HMC, with the active form of p21ras being detected as early as 1.5 min. Preincubation of HMC with PP1, a selective inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases, significantly decreased p21ras activation. In addition, chelation of intracellular free calcium with BAPTA/AM also inhibited ET-1-dependent GTP loading of Ras (Fig. 1). These data suggest that p21ras is activated by ET-1 via Src family kinases in a calcium-dependent manner. We next examined whether PP1 had any effect upon ET-1-induced activation of ERK1 and ERK2. ET-1 induced transient activation of ERK1 and ERK2 as detected by phosphorylation state-specific anti-ERK antibodies; as shown in Fig. 2, data obtained by this method are consistent with an ET-1-induced peak of ERK activation occurring at 4 min. In agreement with its effect on ET-1-induced p21ras activation, preincubation with PP1 significantly inhibited ET-1-dependent activation of ERK (Fig. 2). ET-1-dependent ERK1 and ERK2 activation in HMC was also sensitive to BAPTA/AM treatment (data not shown). These results provide evidence that inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinases decreases ET-1-regulated ERK activation. Although this, in all probability, occurs via inhibition of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, it must be noted that activation of ERK can occur through both Ras-dependent and -independent pathways (for reviews, see Refs. 10Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 38Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control: The Molecular Basis of Cancer and Other Diseases. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 83-98Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of p21ras is not necessarily accompanied by increases in ERK activity since the negative regulation of MAPK activity by dual-specificity phosphatases has been established (for review, see Ref. 39Kelly K. Chu Y. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control: The Molecular Basis of Cancer and Other Diseases. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 165-182Google Scholar). Thus, although activation of the ERK signaling cascade is a direct consequence of p21ras activation, intracellular p21ras and ERK activation levels may not necessarily correlate. The requirement of intracellular calcium mobilization and Src family kinase activation for ET-1-induced p21ras activation suggested the involvement of the proline-rich tyrosine kinase Pyk2 in this signaling pathway. Pyk2 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase known to be tightly regulated by intracellular free calcium levels and to interact with Src tyrosine kinases. Pyk2 expression has been reported to be restricted predominately to hematopoietic cells and cells of the nervous system (40Avraham H. Park S.-Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). A number of studies have demonstrated Pyk2 expression in additional cell types (29Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14341-14348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 41Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Inagami T. Numaguchi K. Yamakawa T. Motley E. Owada K.M. Marumo F. Hirata Y.

Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); therefore, to determine whether Pyk2 is expressed in HMC and whether it is activated in response to ET-1, HMC lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Pyk2 antibodies, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and anti-Pyk2 antibodies (Fig.3). Our results indicate that Pyk2 is expressed in HMC and that this protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated within 5 min of ET-1 treatment. ET-1-mediated Pyk2 activation was also detected by direct measurement of kinase-autophosphorylating activity in Pyk2 immunoprecipitates from HMC treated with ET-1 (data not shown). To study ET-1-mediated Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation in greater details, we used phospho-specific anti-Pyk2 antibodies, which recognize phosphorylation of specific tyrosines residues, viz.Tyr-402, Tyr-579, Tyr-580, and Tyr-881. Phosphorylation of Tyr-579 and Tyr-580 is required for maximal kinase activity of Pyk2. Tyr-402 is an autophosphorylation site that can serve as a target for the Src SH2 domain, and phosphorylated tyrosine 881 was shown to interact with the Grb2 SH2 domain (22Blaukat A. Ivankivic-Dikic I. Groos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Tyr-402, Tyr-580, and Tyr-881 all were phosphorylated 4 min following ET-1 stimulation. Phosphorylation of Tyr-579 and Tyr-580 was found to be regulated similarly under all experimental conditions; therefore, data for only one of latter is shown. We next investigated which tyrosine residues on Pyk2 required intracellular calcium mobilization for effective phosphorylation. As expected, ET-1-induced phosphorylation of all Pyk2 tyrosines was significantly attenuated in the presence of the calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (Fig. 4). The dramatic decrease in the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation observed in the presence of BAPTA/AM provides additional evidence for the selectivity of the phospho-specific antibodies used in this study since Pyk2 is unique among tyrosine kinases thus far described in its calcium-dependent activation. The identity of the band recognized by phospho-specific anti-Pyk2 antibodies was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation of Pyk2 with monoclonal anti-Pyk2 antibodies and immunoblotting either with phospho-specific anti-Pyk2 antibodies or with the same monoclonal anti-Pyk2 antibodies (data not shown). Our finding that Pyk2 Tyr-402 was autophosphorylated in ET-1-treated HMC raised the possibility that Pyk2 was associated with the tyrosine kinase c-Src. It has been shown that, following phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue in Src family protein kinases, the intramolecular interaction between this residue and the SH2 domain maintains these proteins in an inactive “closed” conformation (for review, see Ref. 40Avraham H. Park S.-Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar and 44Schwartzberg P.L. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control: The Molecular Basis of Cancer and Other Diseases. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 325-345Google Scholar). Pyk2 and Src are associated via a reciprocal interaction between the phosphorylated Tyr-402 of the former and the SH2 domain of the latter. The formation of this complex disrupts the inhibitory intramolecular interaction, thereby converting Src into its active form. We have coprecipitated Src with Pyk2 in ET-1-treated HMC and have also observed colocalization of Src with Pyk2 in ET-1-treated HMC by means of confocal microscopy (data not shown). Surprisingly, preincubation of these cells with PP1 or PP2 (selective inhibitors of Src family kinases) inhibited ET-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. As shown in Fig. 5, phosphorylation of Tyr-402 and Tyr-580 on Pyk2 in response to ET-1 was attenuated by PP2. This observed requirement for Src activity upstream of Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation was unexpected and indicated that an additional mechanism of Src activation was involved in ET-1-stimulated HMC. It is known that activation of protein kinase C by the lipophilic second messenger sn-1,2-diacylglycerol contributes to mitogenic signaling by ET-1 in mesangial cells (45Simonson M.S. Herman W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9347-9357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C can directly activate c-Src by phosphorylation of Ser-12 and Ser-44 (46Moyers J.S. Bouton A.H. Parsons S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated the possibility that Pyk2 phosphorylation could occur via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway in ET-1-treated HMC. It was previously shown that depletion of protein kinase C activity partially inhibited both the angiotensin II- and platelet-derived growth factor-induced Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation (47Brinson A. Harding T. Dilberto P.A. He Y. Li X. Hunter D. Herman B. Earp H.S. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) was found to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in HMC. Significant tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 Tyr-402 and Tyr-580 was detected (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-dependent effect was completely abolished by preincubation of HMC with PP2, but not with PP3, its inactive analog. In addition, preincubation of HMC with GF 109203X (bisindolylmaleimide; an inhibitor of protein kinase C) for 1.5 h decreased ET-1-induced autophosphorylation of Pyk2 as detected by Western blotting with phosphorylation state-specific anti-Pyk2 antibodies (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that both calcium mobilization and stimulation of Src family kinases (possibly in a protein kinase C-dependent manner) are required for ET-1-"

Here we report activation of NFκB transcription factors by HPK1 that was independent of SAPK/JNK activation. Overexpression of a dominant-negative SEK1 significantly inhibited SAPK/JNK activation, whereas NFκB stimulation by HPK1 remained unaffected. Furthermore, activation of NFκB required the presence of full-length, kinase-active HPK1, whereas the isolated kinase domain of HPK1 was sufficient for activation of SAPK/JNK. We also demonstrate that overexpression of a dominant-negative IKKβ blocks HPK1-mediated NFκB activation suggesting that HPK1 acts upstream of the IκB kinase complex. In apoptotic myeloid progenitor cells HPK1 was cleaved at a DDVD motif resulting in the release of the kinase domain and a C-terminal part. Although expression of the isolated HPK1 kinase domain led to SAPK/JNK activation, the C-terminal part inhibited NFκB activation. This dominant-negative effect was not only restricted to HPK1-mediated but also to NIK- and tumor necrosis factor α-mediated NFκB activation, suggesting an impairment of the IκB kinase complex. Thus HPK1 activates both the SAPK/JNK and NFκB pathway in hematopoietic cells but is converted into an inhibitor of NFκB activation in apoptotic cells.

In mammals, two families of serine/threonine kinases have been identified that contain a catalytic domain with extensive homology to Sterile 20 (Ste20) kinase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Kinases prototypically represented by p21-activated kinase (PAK) are characterized by a C-terminal kinase domain and an N-terminal p21-binding domain, flanked by proline-rich sequences that serve as SH3 domain-binding sites (6Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). PAKs are activated by the GTP-bound forms of the small GTPases Rac/Cdc42 and have been implicated in regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, cell cycle, and oxidant generation in neutrophils (7Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The second family comprises kinases related to germinal center kinase (GCK), which are defined by a N-terminally located kinase domain. Based on homologies within their C-terminal domains GCKs can be grouped into six subfamilies. Four kinases, GCK, GCKR/KHS, GLK, and HPK1, which will be referred to as subfamily I, share a C-terminally located regulatory domain, called citron homology domain (CNH) (8Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol.

Upon overexpression subfamily I kinases are rendered active and activate potently and selectively the SAPK/JNK pathway via MAP3Ks. Kinase activity of endogenous GCK, GCKR/KHS, and GLK is stimulated in response to TNFα (11Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

HPK1, which already displays significant kinase activity when immunoprecipitated from nonstimulated tissues or cell lines, has been reported to be activated in response to erythropoietin receptor engagement (19Nagata Y. Kiefer F. Watanabe T. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as T and B cell immunoreceptor cross-linking (20Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), providing a possible link to activated transmembrane receptors. SH3 domain-mediated coupling to possible downstream MAP3Ks like mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) has also been described (14Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Despite their structural similarity, the SH3 domain ligand motifs are poorly conserved between subfamily I kinases. Therefore, subfamily I kinases appear to be subject to different regulatory mechanisms and most likely serve distinct physiological functions. NFκB/Rel proteins are dimeric, sequence-specific transcription factors that control many important biological processes, including development, immune responses, cell growth, and apoptosis. NFκB family transcription factors are rendered inactive within the cytoplasm by interaction with IκB inhibitory proteins. In response to extracellular signals, a high molecular weight IκB kinase (IKK) complex is activated resulting in IκB phosphorylation followed by ubiquitinylation and degradation. De-repressed NFκB proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they bind and transactivate κB sites within the promoter region of NFκB-regulated genes (25Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific signaling molecules such as HPK1 are likely to provide specific inputs in ubiquitous transduction pathways and may function as signaling integrators or branch points. The increasing number of kinases that activate both SAPKs and NFκB family transcription factors prompted us to investigate a possible function of HPK1 in NFκB signaling. Here we report a robust stimulation of NFκB activity by HPK1 in hematopoietic cells. In apoptotic cells HPK1 was cleaved by a caspase 3-like activity, resulting in the generation of a dominant-negative C-terminal fragment that inhibited NFκB stimulation. The pGL8xNFκB-fos reporter plasmid contains 8 repeats of the mouse major histocompatibility complex class I h2dk gene κB site fused to the mouse c-fos minimal promoter driving a luciferase reporter gene. For normalization we generated pfos-LacZ that contains the identical mouse c-fos minimal promoter lacking the κB-binding sites. pSP64T-HPK1(D383E):HA and pSP64T-HPK1(D383N):HA were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the U.S.E. Mutagenesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. pMT2-based HPK1 expression plasmids were described previously (14Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For detection by immunoblotting T7-tagged versions of the GC family kinases GCK, GCKR, and GLK were generated in pCAT7. For pCAT7:FL:GLK an NcoI/Bsp120I fragment from pCR3.1-FL:GLK was inserted into the SmaI site of pCAT7-neo. For pCAT7:GCKR an EcoRI/SmaI fragment from pFLAG-GCKR was inserted into pCAT7-neo, and pCAT7:GCK was created by blunt insertion of an EcoRV/XbaI fragment from pRC/CMV-GCK into the EcoRI site of pCAT7-neo. A KpnI fragment comprising 1233 base pairs of mHPK1 cDNA containing the proline-rich motifs P1 to P4 was subcloned into pBluescript giving rise to the plasmid pB-mHPK1:KpnI. The following primer combinations were used to introduce deletions into the proline-rich motifs P1, P2, and P4 by polymerase chain reaction technology. For motif P1, deletion of the amino acids PPP: 5′-CTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGG-3′ and 5′-GGTAGATCTGATCCGCCGAGGGATGGCCTCAGGCTCCTCATC-3′; for motif P2, deletion of the amino acids PPPLPPKPKF: 5′-CTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTCAATTGCCCATCGTCCCTAATTCCTCCAGAACCATCATCTGATGGAGACCGAGGTATGTTCTCTGAAGGGGC-3′; and for motif P4, deletion of the amino acids PPLVP, 5′-CTAGAACTAGTGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CTCCATCTTTCCCCTCATCTTTTCCTTCCTTGGCTGGCCTGGCTCCGGAGCAGC-3′. Polymerase chain reaction products containing the desired mutations were cut with XhoI/BglII (ΔP1),XhoI/MfeI (ΔP2), andXhoI/StyI (ΔP4) and reinserted into pB-mHPK1:KpnI. Insertion of a ΔP1 containingXhoI/BglII fragment into pB-mHPK1:KpnI ΔP2 and pB-mHPK1:KpnI ΔP4 gave rise to the double mutants pB-mHPK1:KpnI ΔP1/P2 and pB-mHPK1:KpnI ΔP1/P4. Insertion of a ΔP4 containingMfeI/StyI fragment into pB-mHPK1:KpnI ΔP1/P2 resulted in pB-mHPK1:KpnI ΔP1/P2/P4. The respective mutations were then reintroduced into pcDNA3-mHPK1 by swapping of the corresponding KpnI fragments.

All experiments were at least repeated three times. Bars depict the average of duplicate transfections. Values presented within a diagram are derived from a single transfection experiment. Jurkat cells were transiently transfected by electroporation of 20 μg of NFκB luciferase reporter plasmid, 2 μg of β-galactosidase reporter construct, and 0–10 μg of wild-type or kinase-inactive HPK1 as indicated in 400 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. FDC-P1 cells were infected using transient supernatants of the ecotropic packaging cell line GP+E 86 transfected with 10 μg of retroviral vector.

The HA tag was detected using the mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5. A phosphospecific antibody against serine 32 of IκBα was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, the IκBα (antibody 2/PC142) antibody from Oncogene Research Products. The T7 tag was detected by the monoclonal antibody T7·Tag (Novagen). Cytoplasmic extracts from apoptotic HL60 cells were prepared as described (29Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G.

Lysates were centrifuged for 50 min at 100,000 × g, and the resulting clear supernatant was stored in aliquots at −80 °C until further usage. The presence of a caspase 3-like activity in the cytoplasmic extract was verified by cleavage of Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin substrate peptide. In vitro translated HPK1:HA, HPK1(D383E):HA, and HPK1(D383N):HA were generated as described (14Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N.

Caspase inhibitors (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) were added in Me2SO at a final concentration of 0.1 μm (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and 1.0 μm(Ac-YVAD-CHO). Soluble nuclear proteins were prepared and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described (31Schlaeger T.M. Qin Y. Fujiwara Y. Magram J. Sato T.N. Development. 1995; 121: 1089-1098PubMed Google Scholar, 32Arnold R. Burcin M. Kaiser B. Muller M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For each shift reaction 10–20 fmol of32P-labeled κB-binding oligonucleotide (5′-TCGAGATGGGGAATCCCCAGCCTCGA-3′) were employed. We tested the capacity of HPK1 to activate NFκB in Jurkat T cells, which endogenously express HPK1. Cotransfection of increasing amounts of HPK1 expression plasmid and a NFκB-dependent reporter resulted in HPK1-dependent NFκB activation (Fig.1 A), whereas expression of the kinase-deficient mutant HPK1(K46E) failed to activate NFκB. These results suggest that HPK1 is an activator of NFκB in Jurkat T cells. To investigate HPK1-dependent NFκB activation in a myeloid progenitor cell line, FDC-P1 cells (26Dexter T.M. Garland J. Scott D. Scolnick E. Metcalf D. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1036-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) were used, which also endogenously express HPK1. We demonstrated HPK1-dependent NFκB activation taking advantage of two retrovirally transduced FDC-P1 clones FDC-P1/C9 and FDC-P1/D4 that stably express an exogenous, HA-tagged variant of HPK1. FDC-P1/D4 cells harbor approximately double the amount of HPK1 kinase activity present in FDC-P1/C9 cells (Fig.1 B). FDC-P1/C9 cells contain about double the amount of HPK1 kinase activity of FDC-P1 wild-type cells. Comparing nuclear extracts derived from FDC-P1 wild-type cells and the cell clones C9 and D4, we observed an increase in NFκB bandshift activity that paralleled HPK1 kinase expression levels. These results provide an independent demonstration of HPK1-mediated NFκB transcription factor activation. To analyze the HPK1-driven NFκB activation in more detail and to circumvent the presence of endogenous HPK1, we used COS1 cells for further analysis. For subsequent transfection experiments we generated a double reporter gene system, in which NFκB-dependent transcription of a luciferase reporter gene was normalized against basal transcription of a galactosidase reporter gene (Fig. 1 C). To delineate the requirements for NFκB activation, we transiently expressed wild-type HPK1, the kinase-deficient variant HPK1(K46E), or the isolated kinase domain HPK1-Ko in COS1 cells. NFκB activity levels were compared with the activity level observed after treatment with the inflammatory cytokine TNFα, a well established inducer of NFκB (Fig. 1 D). HPK1 caused a robust activation of NFκB, comparable to TNFα stimulation, whereas HPK1(K46E) was not able to activate NFκB. Interestingly, HPK1-Ko failed to stimulate NFκB, although it still activated the SAPK/JNK pathway. These results confirm our observation in Jurkat T cells demonstrating again that HPK1 kinase activity is essential for NFκB activation. Furthermore, NFκB activation required the presence of full-length HPK1, whereas the C-terminal regions of HPK1 are dispensable for SAPK/JNK activation. We next addressed the question whether the potential to activate NFκB is shared by other members of subfamily I GCK-related kinases, besides HPK1. After transient expression of increasing amounts of HPK1, GLK, GCKR/KHS, or GCK in COS1 cells, we found a dose-dependent and profound activation of NFκB by HPK1 closely followed by GCKR/KHS (Fig. 1 E). Moderate NFκB activation by GCK was only seen at the highest expression level, whereas NFκB activation by GLK was largely blunted. At expression levels that resulted in comparable levels of autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 1 F, upper panel), the capacity of the GCK-related kinases to activate NFκB correlated with their ability to activate the SAPK/JNK p54β (Fig. 1 F, middle panel). These experiments clearly demonstrate that within the GCK subfamily I of Ste20 kinases HPK1 and the most closely related GCKR/KHS are potent activators of NFκB. We wondered whether NFκB activation by HPK1 was secondary to HPK1-mediated SAPK/JNK activation or caused by a component of the SAPK/JNK pathway. Three MAP3Ks, MEKK1 (15Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), MLK3 (14Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and TAK1 (33Zhou G. Lee S.C. Yao Z. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13133-13138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), have been implicated as potential downstream elements of HPK1 in SAPK/JNK activation. In our assay system HPK1 and the established NFκB activator MEKK1 (34Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 35Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) displayed comparable potency in activating NFκB, whereas MLK3 failed to activate NFκB (Fig.2 A, upper panel). By using identical conditions HPK1, MEKK1, and MLK3 all activate the SAPK/JNK p54β to a comparable extent (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Furthermore, we detected no synergism between HPK1 and MEKK1 in NFκB nor in SAPK/JNK p54β activation. Surprisingly, we found that coexpression of MLK3 potently inhibits HPK1-mediated NFκB activation, whereas it had no influence on SAPK/JNK p54β activation, suggesting that NFκB activation by HPK1 does not involve MLK3. To demonstrate formally that HPK1-mediated NFκB and SAPK/JNK activation utilize distinct effector pathways, we took advantage of a mutant form of SEK1/MKK4, SEK1(S220A,T224L), which we will refer to as SEK1(AL). Mutations of the critical activation loop residues Ser-220 and Thr-224 render SEK1 refractory to upstream activating kinases and turn it into a potent dominant-negative inhibitor of SAPK/JNK activation at the MAP2K level. SEK1(AL) potently inhibits SAPK/JNK activation in a dominant-negative fashion at the MAP2K level (36Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Whereas SEK1(AL) caused no change in HPK1 or MEKK1-induced NFκB activation (Fig. 2 B, upper panel), SAPK/JNK activation was profoundly inhibited (Fig. 2 B, lower panel), demonstrating that HPK1-mediated NFκB activation is independent of HPK1-mediated SAPK/JNK activation. To define further the level of HPK1 action and to test whether IKK functions downstream of HPK1, we coexpressed HPK1 and dominant-negative forms of NIK and IKKβ, NIK(KK429,430AA), and IKKβ(K44A). The dominant-negative variants of NIK and IKKβ both inhibited TNFα-stimulated as well as HPK1-mediated NFκB activation (Fig. 2 C). Kinase-active NIK displayed an NFκB activation potential comparable to that of HPK1, whereas no synergy between both kinases was detectable. Blockage of HPK1 signaling to NFκB by overexpression of dominant-negative NIK or IKKβ protein suggested that HPK1 might act upstream of the IKK complex. HPK1 kinase activity and phosphorylation status were not responsive to TNFα, neither did overexpression of HPK1 augment TNFα-mediated NFκB activation (not shown). Taken together these findings argue against a direct involvement of HPK1 in TNFα signaling. The surprising finding that MLK3 potently inhibited HPK1-mediated NFκB activation (Fig. 2 A) led us to speculate that the SH3 domain-driven interaction between MLK3 and HPK1 (14Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) could result in sequestration of HPK1 from an NFκB-activating complex. To test this hypothesis we coexpressed MLK3Δ, a truncation mutant of MLK3 consisting of the N terminus, which includes the SH3 domain and 21 amino acids of the adjacent kinase domain (14Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) with HPK1 (Fig.3 A). According to our hypothesis we detected a potent suppression of HPK1-driven NFκB activation. Therefore we reasoned that other HPK1-binding SH3 domain-bearing molecules should also interfere with NFκB activation. The small adaptor Grb2, which consists of a central SH2 domain flanked by SH3 domains, has been shown to associate with HPK1 (22Anafi M. Kiefer F. Gish G.D. Mbamalu G. Iscove N.N. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Coexpression of HPK1 and Grb2 resulted in a strong inhibition of HPK1-mediated NFκB activation, whereas MEKK1-mediated NFκB activation was not affected (Fig. 3 B). These results lend further support to our notion that SH3 domain interactions are likely critically involved in HPK1-mediated NFκB activation. Nonspecific inhibition of HPK1-mediated NFκB activation could be excluded by cotransfection of an SH3 domain-containing molecule that does not bind to HPK1. Because of the possibility of residual interactions between overexpressed SH3 domains and HPK1, we decided to generate HPK1 mutants, in which the three proline-rich SH3 domain-binding sites (P1, P2, and P4) were deleted either singularly or in combination. When we tested the HPK1 proline deletions for their ability to activate NFκB, none of them displayed an activity comparable to wild-type HPK1 (Fig. 3 C). The mutations did not impair protein stability, as they did not decrease HPK1-associated kinase activity or the capacity of HPK1 to activate SAPK/JNK (Fig. 3 D). These results demonstrate a strong dependence of NFκB activation on the proline-rich SH3-binding sites in HPK1, whereas those sites were dispensable for SAPK/JNK activation. Furthermore, we found a C-terminally HA-tagged version of HPK1 to be less efficient in activating NFκB as compared with the native protein (Fig. 3 C), indicating a critical role of the HPK1 C terminus in NFκB activation. Taken together our findings demonstrate that SH3 domain-mediated interactions are a prerequisite for NFκB activation and that HPK1-mediated SAPK/JNK and NFκB activation differ significantly in their molecular requirements. NFκB target genes have been implicated in a plethora of pro- and anti-apoptotic processes, and a number of NFκB regulators have been shown to be subject to caspase cleavage in apoptotic cells. Growth and survival of the hematopoietic progenitor cell line FDC-P1 is strictly IL-3-dependent (37Fairbairn L.J. Cowling G.J. Reipert B.M. Dexter T.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We tested HPK1 stability in apoptotic FDC-P1/D4 hematopoietic progenitor cells after induction of apoptosis by IL-3 withdrawal for 18 h. At this time point DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of the apoptotic cell death program, was maximal (not shown). By using Western blot analysis, we detected reduced HPK1 levels after IL-3 deprivation and observed the appearance of HPK1 cleavage products (Fig.4 A). These results were reproduced under identical conditions using the IL-3-dependent myeloid progenitor cell line 32D-Cl3 indicating that HPK1 is proteolytically degraded in hematopoietic cells rendered apoptotic after growth factor withdrawal. Caspases, the effector proteases during apoptosis (3"
https://openalex.org/W2023835465,"Neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells is induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) but not by epidermal growth factor (EGF). This differential response has been explained by the duration of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation; NGF induces sustained MAPK activation but EGF leads short-lived activation. However, precise mechanisms have not yet been understood. Here we demonstrate the difference between NGF and EGF in regulation of Rac1, a small GTPase involved in neurite outgrowth, in PC12 cells. NGF phosphoinositide 3-kinase dependently induces transient activation of Rac1 and accumulation of active Rac1 at protrusion sites on the cell surface, inducing filamentous actin-rich protrusions and subsequent neurite formation in a Rac1-dependent manner. On the other hand, EGF phosphoinositide 3-kinase independently induces more transient Rac1 activation but neither accumulates active Rac1 nor forms Rac1- and filamentous actin-rich protrusions. Difference in the Rac1 localization between NGF and EGF was also observed with the localization of exogenously expressed green fluorescent protein-tagged Rac1. The Rac1-mediated protrusion by NGF is independent of MAPK cascade, but the subsequent neurite extension requires the cascade. Thus, the differential activation of Rac1 and localization of active Rac1 contribute to the difference in the ability of NGF and EGF to induce neurite outgrowth, and we propose that the MAPK cascade-independent prompt activation of Rac1 and recruitment of active Rac1 at the protrusion sites trigger the initiation of neurite formation. Neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells is induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) but not by epidermal growth factor (EGF). This differential response has been explained by the duration of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation; NGF induces sustained MAPK activation but EGF leads short-lived activation.

The Rac1-mediated protrusion by NGF is independent of MAPK cascade, but the subsequent neurite extension requires the cascade. Thus, the differential activation of Rac1 and localization of active Rac1 contribute to the difference in the ability of NGF and EGF to induce neurite outgrowth, and we propose that the MAPK cascade-independent prompt activation of Rac1 and recruitment of active Rac1 at the protrusion sites trigger the initiation of neurite formation. nerve growth factor epidermal growth factor mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphoinositide 3-kinase filamentous actin green fluorescent protein Cdc42/Rac interacting binding glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells have been used as a model system for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth. After stimulation with nerve growth factor (NGF),1 they stop growing and begin to extend neurites. In contrast, epidermal growth factor (EGF) does not induce neurite outgrowth but stimulates proliferation of PC12 cells. The receptors for NGF and EGF belong to a family of tyrosine kinase receptors, and they transduce signals via similar signal transduction pathways, including a Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (1Carter A.N. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14563-14567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marshall C.J.

A. 1992; 89: 9121-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the sustained activation of Ras and MAPK by NGF is involved in neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar, 4Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). However, a previous study reported that the receptor-mediated sustained activation of MAPK alone is insufficient to induce neurite outgrowth (6Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, an additional signaling pathway is suggested to be required for the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Morphological analysis of NGF- and EGF-stimulated PC12 cells revealed that stimulation with NGF, but not with EGF, induces the rapid formation of filamentous actin (F-actin)-rich protrusions, followed by the extension of neuritic processes with growth cone-like structures at their tips (7Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. Viscarello R.R. Riley W.D. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Paves H. Neuman T. Metsis M. Saarma M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rapid redistribution of F-actin induced by NGF was reported to be suppressed by an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (9Jackson T.R. Blader I.J. Hammonds-Odie L.P. Burga C.R. Cooke F. Hawkins P.T. Wolf A.G. Heldman K.A. Theibert A.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of PI3K was shown to induce neuritic process formation (10Kita Y. Kimura K.D. Kobayashi M. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Ui M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kobayashi M. Nagata S. Kita Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16089-16092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of PI3K in the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. However, precise mechanisms involved in the cytoskeletal reorganization required for the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth have not yet been understood. The Rho family of small GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, serves as molecular switches by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, and has been implicated in the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in various cell types (12Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 13Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, activation of Rho induces the growth cone collapse and the retraction of neurites (14Jalink K. Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 15Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies using a dominant negative Rac1 show that Rac1 is involved in the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (16Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Lamoureux P. Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Lin C. Wagner J.A. Heidemann S.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 635-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains obscure how NGF regulates Rac1, inducing neurite outgrowth. Here we demonstrate that NGF PI3K dependently induces Rac1 activation and formation of cell surface protrusions where active Rac1 and F-actin are accumulated, whereas EGF PI3K independently activates Rac1 but fails to form Rac1- and F-actin-rich protrusions. We propose that the differential activation and localization of Rac1 contribute to the difference in the ability of growth factors to induce neurite outgrowth.

Mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS was kindly provided by Dr. S. Nagata (Osaka University). Human Rac1 was obtained as described previously (18Hasegawa H. Fujita H. Katoh H. Aoki J. Nakamura K. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20982-20988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). cDNA for Ha-Ras was obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). RasN17 and Rac1N17 were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis (19Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa K. Gene. 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and fused in-frame with a sequence encoding an initiating methionine followed by the Myc epitope tag sequence at the NH2 terminus contained in pEF-BOS. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rac1 was obtained by insertion of the coding sequence of wild-type Rac1 into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). The coding sequence for the Cdc42/Rac interacting binding (CRIB) domain (amino acids 70–150) of rat αPAK (20Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from PC12 cells, using primers 5′-AAGGGATTCAAGGAGCGGCCAGAGATTTCT-3′ containing a BamHI site and 5′-GAAGAATTCTAATCTTAAGCTGACTTATCT-3′ containing a stop codon followed by an EcoRI site. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced. The CRIB domain of αPAK was then expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST), purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and isolated from the beads with 16 mm reduced glutathione. The purified proteins were dialyzed with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified conditions in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm) in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well. Transient transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were fixed 48 h after transfection. Measurement of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities was performed according to the modified method of Benard et al. (21Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 1 × 107cells/dish, cultured for 24 h, and serum-starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 12 h. Cells were then stimulated with 50 ng/ml NGF or 200 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times and lysed for 5 min with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 8 μg of GST-CRIB. Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. After the beads were washed with the cell lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline, and then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-Rac1 (1:1000 dilution) or rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc42 antibody (1:100 dilution). The Rac1 and Cdc42 antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (DAKO), respectively, and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometry analysis was performed using NIH Image software, and the amounts of GST-CRIB-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 were normalized to the total amounts of Rac1 and Cdc42 in cell lysates, respectively. All steps were carried out at room temperature, and cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) between each step. At the indicated times, cells on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, PBS for 15 min. After residual formaldehyde had been quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl, PBS for 10 min, cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, PBS for 10 min, and incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Endogenous Rac1 was stained with an anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody in PBS at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h followed by the incubation with a rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon International Inc.) in PBS at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h. For detection of cells expressing Myc-tagged RasN17 or Rac1N17, cells were incubated with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (0.5 μg/ml) in PBS for 1 h followed by the incubation with a rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG in PBS for 1 h. In the case of double stainings with Myc-tagged RasN17 and endogenous Rac1, expressed Myc-tagged Ras mutants were visualized using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (MBL) in PBS at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon International Inc.) in PBS at a 1:250 dilution for 1 h. F-actin was stained with Alexa 488- or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in PBS (0.5 units/ml) for 1 h. Cells were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS. Confocal microscopy was performed using an MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories) equipped with a Nicon Eclipse E800 microscope and a Nicon Plan Apo 60 × 1.4 oil immersion objective. To detect active Rac1 in PC12 cells, we made use of the CRIB domain of rat αPAK with Myc epitope tag at the NH2 terminus. Using cell culture overlay technique described by Meriläinen et al. (22Meriläinen J. Palovuori R. Sormunen R. Wasenius V.-M. Lehto V.-P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 647-654PubMed Google Scholar) and Kulkarni et al. (23Kulkarni S.V. Gish G. Geer P.V.-D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), fixed PC12 cells were incubated with Myc-CRIB domain (100 μg/ml) for 1 h and the active Rac1 was detected using anti-Myc polyclonal antibody. Consistent with previous reports (16Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Lamoureux P.

To obtain direct evidence of the activation of endogenous Rac1 by NGF, we measured the amount of cellular GTP-bound Rac1 using the GST-fused CRIB domain of rat αPAK (GST-CRIB), which specifically binds to Rac in its active GTP-bound state (20Manser E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). NGF induced a rapid increase in the amount of cellular GTP-bound Rac1, the elevation reaching the maximum at 3 min (Fig. 2, a ande). The level decreased gradually but remained above the basal for over 60 min after the stimulation. In contrast, EGF induced a more transient activation of Rac1 within 1 min, and then the level quickly returned to the basal level within 5 min after the stimulation (Fig. 2, b and e). Cdc42 has been also reported to be implicated in neurite outgrowth similar to Rac1 (16Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We then measured the amount of cellular GTP-bound Cdc42 using GST-CRIB. However, the level of GTP-bound Cdc42 was not significantly affected by either NGF or EGF (Fig. 2, c, d, and e).Figure 2Activation of Rac1 by NGF and EGF.a and b, serum-starved PC12 cells were treated with 50 ng/ml NGF (a and c) or 200 ng/ml EGF (b and d) for the indicated times.

Immunofluorescence staining of Rac1 using an anti-Rac1 antibody revealed that in unstimulated cells Rac1 was present throughout the cytoplasm and at the cell surface (Fig.3 a and Table I). At 1 min after stimulation with NGF, cells spread with ruffles around the cell periphery, and Rac1 was co-localized with F-actin in membrane ruffles. At 3 min after the addition of NGF, corresponding to the time of the highest Rac1 activity, cells produced two to four cell surface protrusions, and Rac1 and F-actin were accumulated and co-localized at these protrusions. Within 15 min, these F-actin-rich protrusions had begun to extend and form the short processes where Rac1 remained to be accumulated, and the co-localization of F-actin and Rac1 at the tips of processes remained unchanged up to 30 min after the NGF stimulation. On the other hand, stimulation with EGF induced ruffles around the cell periphery at 1 min after the stimulation, and Rac1 and F-actin were co-localized to the ruffled area (Fig. 3 b). In sharp contrast to the NGF stimulation, the F-actin- and Rac1-rich ruffles declined within 3 min, and protrusions and process formation did not occur. To confirm the NGF-induced dynamic change in the localization of Rac1 observed above, PC12 cells were transfected with NH2-terminal GFP-tagged Rac1, and the fluorescence of GFP was monitored after the stimulation with NGF. GFP-Rac1 was also rapidly accumulated at the F-actin-rich protrusions in response to NGF with similar time course of the movement of endogenous Rac1 (Fig.4).Table IQuantification of Rac1 or F-actin distribution shown in Figs.

At least 100 cells were assessed in one experiment, and data are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate experiments. To determine whether the Rac1 accumulated at protrusions was the GTP-bound active form, we immunostained for active Rac1 using a Myc-CRIB domain which specifically binds to GTP-bound active Rac1. As shown in Fig. 5, NGF stimulation induced the active Rac1 accumulation at the protrusions where the active Rac1 and F-actin were co-localized. On the other hand, EGF induced the recruitment of active Rac1 to the cell periphery but the active Rac1 accumulation at the protrusions was not observed. The CRIB domain can bind to GTP-bound active form of Cdc42 as well as that of Rac1, but NGF did not increase GTP-bound active Cdc42 (Fig. 2 e). Therefore, Rac1 accumulated at the protrusions by NGF is the GTP-bound active form of Rac1. We next examined the requirement of Rac1 in the formation of F-actin-rich protrusions by using a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, Rac1N17. The transient expression of Rac1N17completely inhibited the NGF-induced rapid redistribution of F-actin and the formation of protrusions (Fig.6). This result indicates that the rapid cytoskeletal response to NGF, the formation of F-actin-rich protrusions at the cell surface, required the activation of Rac1. To determine whether the activation of MAPK cascade or PI3K was involved in the activation of Rac1, we examined the effect of LY294002 (30 μm) or wortmannin (1 μm), specific inhibitors of PI3K, or PD98059 (25 μm), a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase (also known as MEK), on the NGF- and EGF-induced Rac1 activation. Pretreatment with LY294002 or wortmannin markedly inhibited the NGF-induced activation of Rac1 at 1 and 3 min (Fig. 7, aand c), whereas the pretreatment did not significantly affect the EGF-induced Rac1 activation or the inhibition was very weak (Fig. 7, b and d). To confirm the action of the PI3K inhibitors, we examined the effects of PI3K inhibitors on the NGF-induced Akt phosphorylation, a known PI3K effect, by using anti-phospho-specific Akt antibody. LY294002 and wortmannin completely inhibited the NGF-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 7 f). These results indicate that the NGF-induced Rac1 activation is fully dependent on PI3K, whereas the EGF-induced activation is independent of PI3K. On the other hand, PD98059 had no effect on either the NGF- or the EGF-induced activation of Rac1 (Fig. 7, a, b, andc), although it could suppress the NGF- and the EGF-induced activation of MAPK (Fig. 7 g). These results indicate that the activation of MAPK cascade is not required for the activation of Rac1. We further examined whether NGF activated GFP-Rac1 in a PI3K-dependent manner. NGF activated exogenously expressed GFP-Rac1 and this activation was inhibited by LY294002 (Fig.7 e). We next examined the involvement of PI3K and MAPK in the rapid redistribution of F-actin and Rac1 after the stimulation with NGF. A previous study reported that the rapid F-actin redistribution induced by NGF was suppressed by wortmannin (9Jackson T.R. Blader I.J. Hammonds-Odie L.P. Burga C.R. Cooke F. Hawkins P.T. Wolf A.G. Heldman K.A. Theibert A.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, we found that the NGF-induced rapid F-actin redistribution was suppressed by LY294002 (Fig.8 a) and wortmannin (data not shown). In addition to the effect on F-actin redistribution, the NGF-induced rapid redistribution of Rac1 was also inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 8 a) and wortmannin (data not shown). The effect of PI3K inhibitors on the rapid redistribution of Rac1 was also examined in GFP-Rac1-transfected cells, and the NGF-induced redistribution of GFP-Rac1 was inhibited by pretreatment with LY294002 (Fig.8 b) and wortmannin (data not shown). These results indicate that the NGF-induced activation and rapid redistribution of Rac1 requires the PI3K activity. In contrast, when cells were pretreated with PD98059, NGF could induce the accumulation of F-actin and Rac1 at the cell surface protrusions (Fig. 8 a). However, in the presence of PD98059, cells did not produce even short processes by 15 min (Fig.8 a) or by 30 min (data not shown) after NGF stimulation, and they did not extend neurites (data not shown). The accumulation of F-actin and Rac1 at the protrusions in the PD98059-pretreated cells had disappeared within 60 min (data not shown). These results indicate that the activation of MAPK is not required for the NGF-induced rapid redistribution of F-actin and Rac1 but is crucial for the subsequent neurite outgrowth. Small GTPase Ras is a critical component in the signaling pathway of NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation (24Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 25Noda M. Ko M. Ogura A. Lim D.G. Amano T. Takano T. Ikawa Y.

To examine whether Ras is involved in the rapid redistribution of F-actin and Rac1 induced by NGF, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with a dominant negative mutant of Ras, RasN17. Expression of RasN17 completely suppressed the rapid redistribution of F-actin (Fig.9 a) and Rac1 (Fig.9 b) induced by NGF. To confirm the effect of RasN17 expression on the localization of Rac1, we co-transfected cells with RasN17 and GFP-Rac1. RasN17 completely suppressed the NGF-induced redistribution of GFP-Rac1 as well (Fig. 9 c). We further examined the effect of the dominant negative Ras on the NGF-induced GFP-Rac1 activation. RasN17 completely suppressed the NGF-induced GFP-Rac1 activation (Fig. 7 e). These results indicate that the activity of Ras is required for the rapid redistribution of F-actin and Rac1 induced by NGF in PC12 cells. PC12 cells differentially respond to NGF and EGF in neuronal differentiation, but the precise mechanism for this difference remains to be defined. In this study, we focused our attention on the regulation of Rac1 activity which is thought to be required for neuronal morphology (16Chen X.Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Lamoureux P. Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Lin C. Wagner J.A. Heidemann S.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 635-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we demonstrate here that NGF but not EGF PI3K dependently activates Rac1 and recruits active Rac1 to the protrusion sites, initiating the neurite formation. We suggest that a spatial determination mechanism of the signaling pathway involved in the activation of Rac1 plays a critical role in the initiation of the neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. In PC12 cells, NGF induces neurite outgrowth and eventual cessation of cell division, whereas EGF leads to a proliferative signal without neurite formation, although their receptors transduce signals via similar signal transduction pathways, including MAPK cascade. These differential responses are thought to be determined by the duration of MAPK activation; NGF induces sustained MAPK activation for several hours, but EGF leads short-lived activation (2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). However, the receptor-mediated persistent activation of MAPK alone is shown to be insufficient to induce neurite outgrowth (6Vaillancourt R.R. Heasley L.E. Zamarripa J. Storey B. Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study showed that although the sustained activation of MAPK is mediated by small GTPase Rap1, expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rap1 blocks the sustained activation of MAPK but fails to inhibit the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (27York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth is not merely determined by the sustained MAPK activation and another mechanism must exist for the neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. In this study, we have shown that NGF PI3K dependently activated and accumulated Rac1 at the F-actin-rich protrusions on the cell surface, whereas EGF PI3K independently activated Rac1 but failed to form Rac1- and F-actin-rich protrusions. Furthermore, we revealed that Rac1 accumulated at the protrusions by NGF was active Rac1. Considering the inhibition by dominant negative Rac1 of the NGF-induced formation of F-actin-rich protrusions and process formation, it is inferred that PI3K-dependent activation of Rac1 and accumulation of active Rac1 at the specific sites on the cell surface induces actin reorganization at the sites, resulting in the formation of the cell surface protrusions and subsequent extension of neurites. From these results taken together, we speculate that temporally and spatially regulated Rac1 activation initiates the neurite formation. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of PI3K in the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (9Jackson T.R. Blader I.J. Hammonds-Odie L.P. Burga C.R. Cooke F. Hawkins P.T. Wolf A.G. Heldman K.A. Theibert A.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we showed that inhibition of PI3K activity suppressed the activation and redistribution of Rac1 induced by NGF. Therefore, one role of PI3K in neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells is to regulate the activation and the localization of Rac1 in response to NGF. In this study, we found that dominant negative Ras could inhibit the NGF-induced redistribution of Rac1. Accumulated evidence shows that Ras induces the activation of Rac through PI3K (29Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 30Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A.

Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggest that there is a hierarchy of activation from Ras to Rac1 through PI3K in the NGF signaling pathway, and that this signaling pathway is important for the initiation of the neurite outgrowth by NGF. Activation of PI3K leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-P2 and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-P3. These products can bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of some GEFs for Rac1, such as Sos and Vav, and stimulate the activity of GEFs (32Das B. Shu X. Day G.-J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R.

White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Sos is well known to be located in the downstream signaling pathways of NGF (34Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and Sos, known as a GEF for Ras, activates Rac through its NH2-terminal Rac GEF domain containing the tandem Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domaina, and Ras-mediated PI3K activation and subsequent binding of PI3K products to the pleckstrin homology domain appear to be necessary for the activation of Rac by Sos (29Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 32Das B. Shu X. Day G.-J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The PI3K-dependent Sos activation may be involved in the regulation of the Rac1 activity by NGF in PC12 cells. In addition to the modulation of the GEF activity, the pleckstrin homology domain is known to play an important role in the localization of signaling molecules, including GEFs for Rac1 (35Lemmon1 M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We showed here that the NGF-induced redistribution of Rac1 depends on the PI3K activity. Therefore, it is conceivable that PI3K recruits a Rac1 GEF via association with the pleckstrin homology domain and induces the accumulation and activation of Rac1 at the protrusion sites on the cell surface. In contrast to NGF, EGF activated Rac1 in a PI3K-independent manner, indicating the existence of at least two distinct mechanisms in the activation of Rac1, PI3K-dependent and -independent pathways, in PC12 cells. NGF and EGF may utilize distinct GEFs for activation of Rac1 in PC12 cells. A previous report indicated the PI3K-independent, but protein kinase C-dependent activation of Rac2 in neutrophils (36Akasaki T. Koga H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18055-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a GEF for Rac1 by a protein kinase may be involved in the activation of Rac1 by EGF. The involvement of MAPK cascade in neuronal differentiation has been extensively investigated, and the MAPK cascade was shown to be required for the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (4Nguyen T.T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). We demonstrated here that inhibition of MAPK cascade by a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase had no effect on the formation of F-actin-rich protrusions as well as the activation and the redistribution of Rac1 induced by NGF. However, this inhibitor suppressed the subsequent induction of short processes and eventual neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that the MAPK cascade is required for the extension of neurites but not for the initiation of neurites induced by NGF, and that the initiation step and the subsequent extension step of the neurite outgrowth are regulated by different mechanisms. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that NGF and EGF differentially activate Rac1 in PI3K-dependent and -independent manners, respectively, and this PI3K-dependent activation of Rac1 and accumulation of active Rac1 to the protrusion sites on the cell surface initiate the neurite formation in PC12 cells. This initial marked activation of Rac1 and its recruitment to the protrusion sites are the initial steps for the formation of neurites and the steps do not require MAPK cascade. This work takes a close-up of an important role of Rac1 in the initiation of neurites, and will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of neurite formation and extension."

These are proteins containing aqueous pores and undergo conformational changes leading to the defined gating states “open” and “closed,” where open channels are conducting and closed channels are nonconducting. In many channels there are additional “inactivated” states, which are also nonconducting and which follow the open states because of an activating physiological stimulus. Among voltage-gated potassium channels, there are two major types of inactivation. N-type inactivation is mediated by an intracellular “ball,” located within the N terminus of either the pore-forming protein or a modulatory β-subunit, which plugs the ion channel pore (1Armstrong C.M.

Delay of inactivation was explained by two open states separating closed and inactivated states in a linear gating scheme. Inactivation of KCNQ1 is incomplete, supposedly resulting from a weak voltage sensitivity of the rates of both onset of and recovery from inactivation. Alternatively, the partial inactivation can also be caused by subconductance states. The lack of sensitivity to high extracellular TEA and potassium, together with delayed onset distinguish KCNQ1 inactivation from classical C-type inactivation inShaker-like channels. The weak voltage sensitivity of KCNQ1 inactivation and the lack of a Shaker-like ball structure within KCNQ1 differ from N-type inactivation (22Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys.

In contrast to the existing biophysical data on KCNQ1 inactivation, its molecular determinants have only been discussed tentatively so far. Franqueza et al. (24Franqueza L. Lin M. Shen J. Splawski I.

After expression inXenopus oocytes, some mutants showed overall altered gating characteristics compared with KCNQ1-WT, but in none of them inactivation was abolished. The LQT1 mutation L273F (8Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C. Millholland J.M. Van Raay T.J. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. De Jager T. Schwarz P.J. Towbin J.A. Moss A.J. Atkinson D.L.

The mutation is located in transmembrane segment S5, indicating a possible involvement of the S5 region in channel inactivation. Inactivation of KCNQ1 is abolished by coassembly with MinK (22Pusch M.

( Lond. ). 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting that interacting domains of these two proteins might also influence the inactivation process itself. Pusch et al. (25Pusch M. Bertorello L. Conti F. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 211-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have presented evidence for MinK interaction with the outer vestibule of KCNQ1. MinK also might directly interact with the pore region of KCNQ1 as suggested by both a yeast two-hybrid study and a cysteine-scanning study in MinK (26Romey G. Attali B. Chouabe C. Abitbol I.

Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It was our aim to gain insights into the as yet unknown molecular mechanism underlying KCNQ1 inactivation and its possible pathophysiological relevance. For the construction of chimeras, silent point mutations were introduced producing restriction endonuclease sites at corresponding positions in KCNQ1 and KCNQ2, namely aSacI site (at KCNQ1 amino acids Glu261-Leu262), an NsiI site (at KCNQ1 amino acids Asp301-Ala302-Leu303), and aBamHI-site (at KCNQ1 amino acids Gly348-Ser349). Other chimeric joining regions were created by recombinant polymerase chain reaction resulting in constructs described in Fig. 1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by polymerase chain reaction using cloned Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase (Stratagene). All constructs were reconfirmed by automated DNA sequencing. For Xenopus oocyte expression, capped cRNA was synthesized using the SP6 and T7 mMessage mMachine kits (Ambion). GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers for sequences used are as follows: hKCNQ1, AJ006345; hKCNQ2, NM004518; and MinK(KCNE1),M26685. Xenopuslaevis oocytes were obtained from tricaine-anesthetized animals. Ovaries were collagenase-treated (1 mg/ml, Worthington, type II) in OR2 solution (NaCl 82.5 mm, KCl 2 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, HEPES 5 mm, pH 7.4) for 120 min and subsequently stored in recording solution ND96 (NaCl 96 mm, KCl 2 mm, CaCl2 1.8 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, HEPES 5 mm, pH 7.4) with additional sodium pyruvate (275 mg/liter), theophylline (90 mg/liter) and Gentamycin (50 mg/liter) at 18 °C. Oocytes were individually injected with 10 ng of cRNA encoding WT or mutant KCNQ subunits, or coinjected with 10 ng of cRNA of WT or mutant KCNQ1 and 5 ng of hMinK cRNA. Standard two electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed at 22 °C with a Turbo Tec 10CX (NPI) amplifier, an ITC-16 interface combined with Pulse software (Heka) and Origin version 5.0 (Microcal Software) for data acquisition. Macroscopic currents were recorded 3–4 days after injection. The pipette solution contained 3 m KCl. All fitting procedures were based on the simplex algorithm. Student's t test was used to test for statistical significance, which was assumed withp < 0.05. To calculate the fraction of inactivated channels, a double exponential fit to the tail currents was done according to the formula:I(t) = As × exp(−t/τs) − Af × exp(−t/τf). The faster and the slower component represent recovery from inactivation and deactivation respectively, whereby As and τs are the amplitude and time constant for the slow component, and Af,and τf are the amplitude and time constant for the fast component. The fraction of inactivated channels is given by Af/As, where the amplitude As is related to the degree of activation, and the amplitude Afindicates the degree of inactivation. The method was previously described in detail (22Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Inactivation in KCNQ1 channels becomes apparent in a hook in the tail current when repolarizing the membrane potential after a depolarizing pulse (Refs. 22Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, and Fig.1D). This trait is also described for HERG channels where it is even more pronounced (28Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.-E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 29Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The hook is attributed to rapid recovery of channels from inactivation at a rate much faster than deactivation (Fig. 1D). Onset of KCNQ1 inactivation can be revealed using a double-pulse protocol (23Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar,29Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 30Schonherr R. Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 493: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A conditioning 2-s pulse to 40 mV is applied to activate and inactivate channels followed by a 20-ms hyperpolarizing interpulse, which transiently removes inactivation. During a final test pulse to 40 mV, onset of inactivation becomes visible (Fig. 1C). Throughout this study we considered both the hook and the onset of inactivation as a marker for the presence or absence of inactivation in mutant KCNQ1 channels. To define the structural determinants of KCNQ1 inactivation, we constructed a series of functional chimeras between the closely related channels KCNQ1 and KCNQ2. KCNQ2 is a component of the neuronal noninactivating M-current and is mutated in neonatal epilepsy (9Charlier C. Singh N.A. Ryan S.G. Lewis T.B. Reus B.E. Leach R.J. Leppert M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 10Singh N.A. Charlier C. Stauffer D. DuPont B.R. Leach R.J. Melis R. Ronen G.M. Bjerre I. Quattlebaum T. Murphy J.V. McHarg M.L.

Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, KCNQ2 did not inactivate like KCNQ1. In a gain of function approach, we transferred the ability to inactivate from KCNQ1 to KCNQ2. Substituting the S5/H5/S6 domain from KNCQ1 into KCNQ2, caused a dramatic change in the biophysical characteristics of the resulting construct (Q2S5-S6Q1) compared with KCNQ2-WT (Fig. 1). Macroscopic inactivation is conferred at positive voltages, suggesting that this part of the protein is necessary for the inactivation process. By contrast it was possible to substitute large segments of KCNQ2 into KCNQ1 without abolishing inactivation. A KCNQ1 construct including substituted KCNQ2 amino acids from the end of H5 to the end of S6 (Q1S6Q2, Fig. 1) maintained inactivation. Interestingly the KCNQ2 S6 region somehow enhances intrinsic KCNQ1 inactivation. Another KCNQ1 chimeric construct containing the KCNQ2 S5/H5 linker (Q1S5/H5linkerQ2) revealed that exchanging this region does not remove inactivation (Fig.1). Thus the borders of the crucial region for inactivation could be assigned to the S5 segment and parts of the H5 pore loop. Fig. 1A illustrates differences in the protein sequences of the related KCNQ channels in the described regions. With site-directed mutagenesis, we exchanged the different amino acids in KCNQ1 to the corresponding residues in KCNQ2. Expression of these point mutants showed that two single amino acid substitutions, G272C and V307L, are capable of abolishing inactivation (Fig. 1). Mutation G272C, adjacent to the site of clinical mutation L273F (as described above), caused additionally slightly slowed activation kinetics. To exclude the possibility that the introduced cysteine might be stabilizing the channel via formation of novel intramolecular disulfide bonds, we substituted glycine with threonine at this position. Now, activation and deactivation kinetics of G272T were very similar to KCNQ1-WT (TableI); however inactivation still was completely abolished. The other key mutation V307L located in the pore loop showed slightly slowed activation and deactivation kinetics compared with KCNQ1-WT (Table I), but again abolished inactivation. The slight changes in activation kinetics are not reflected by altered current-voltage relationships and thus shifted voltage dependence of activation cannot account for the lack of inactivation. A further observation was that in the noninactivating mutants, the slow component of deactivation was decreased or abolished (Table I). Possibly the slow component of deactivation in KCNQ1 is somehow connected to the inactivation process.Table IActivation and deactivation time constants of WT-KCNQ1 and mutant KCNQ1 channelsConstantsWT-KCNQ1KCNQ1(G272C)KCNQ1(G272T)KCNQ1(V307L)Activation, τfast33 ± 3 ms (9)103 ± 7 ms (9)41 ± 2 ms (8)76 ± 4 ms (9)Activation, τslow0.85 ± 0.09 s (9)0.68 ± 0.05 s (9)0.27 ± 0.0 s (8)0.67 ± 0.06 s (9)Deactivation, τfast222 ± 2 ms (9)267 ± 18 ms (9)238 ± 4 ms (8)420 ± 30 ms (9)Deactivation, τslow1.7 ± 0.4 s (9)—6.5 ± 0.1 s (8)—Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of cRNA.

Open table in a new tab Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of cRNA. Currents were activated by a 3-s pulse to 40 mV and followed by a hyperpolarizing pulse to −60 mV. Kinetics were analyzed by exponential fits to the rising phase for activation and to the tail current for deactivation. Values are mean ± S.E., numbers of oocytes are shown in parenthesis. To corroborate our results, we made additional point mutations in the inactivating KCNQ2 chimera Q2S5-S6Q1. Analogous substitution of glycine 272 in S5 (KCNQ1 numbering) and valine 307 in H5 (KCNQ1 numbering) by cysteine and leucine, respectively, again abolished inactivation in this chimeric construct. Effects on activation and deactivation kinetics were only minor (Fig. 2,A and B). Using a final approach, we attempted to introduce a KCNQ1-like inactivation into KCNQ2 through single amino acid exchanges. We constructed the KCNQ2 mutations C242G, L243F, and L272V. These positions correspond to the residues Gly273, Leu273, and Val307 in KCNQ1, which we recognized as being important for KCNQ1 inactivation. Introducing a phenylalanine at position 243 in KCNQ2 resulted in inactivating currents interestingly similar to the KCNQ1 mutant L273F (Fig.3A). The mutant KCNQ2(L272V) did not exert a KCNQ1-like inactivation as shown in Fig. 3B. In a construct containing both mutations L243F and L272V, an inactivation was apparent although the currents were small in amplitude (Fig. 3C). Substituting the cysteine at KCNQ2 position 242 by glycine individually or together with the mutations described above resulted in a mutant that did not produce measurable currents under our conditions. The only crystal structure of the pore-forming part of a potassium channel presently available derives from the KcsA channel ofStreptomyces lividans (32Doyle D.A. Morais C. abral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5743) Google Scholar). In this structure, we checked the locations of the residues equivalent to those that we identified as being involved in KCNQ1 inactivation. Interestingly, the amino acids in the KcsA channel, Leu40 and Val70 corresponding to the clinically relevant residue KCNQ1(L273) and the residue KCNQ1(V307) respectively, are in close vicinity within one subunit. The closest distances of these amino acids are around 4 Å for all four subunits, thereby enabling attractive interactions. Within the S5/H5/S6 region, KCNQ1 shares about 36% identity and 46% homology to KcsA. Accordingly the same residues in KCNQ1 can also be expected to be in close proximity. This raises the possibility that intramolecular interaction of transmembrane segment S5 and the helical part of the pore loop H5 is involved in the inactivation process, putatively stabilizing the three-dimensional conformation of the inactivated channel. Exchange of glycine at KCNQ1 position 272 by a side chain-containing amino acid can be anticipated to change the conformation of the encompassing S5 region and therefore possibly disrupt interaction of amino acids Leu273 and Val307. Introduction of a KCNQ1-like inactivation into KCNQ2 by exchanging leucine 243 with the more extensive phenylalanine in S5 supports the hypothesis of interaction of domains S5 and H5 facilitating KCNQ1 inactivation. We next examined the pathophysiological role of KCNQ1 inactivation by studying kinetics of the LQT1 mutant L273F, which is located next to Gly272 and in the KcsA channel model in close proximity to Val307. The mutant was analyzed previously (19Shalaby F.Y. Levesque P.C. Yang W.P. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Jenkins-West T. Blanar M.A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1733-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); the authors reported a pronounced macroscopic inactivation of KCNQ1(L273F) as well as a reduced current amplitude of KCNQ1(L273F)/MinK compared with KCNQ1-WT/MinK. We expressed homomeric mutant and heteromeric mutant/MinK channels and compared them to KCNQ1-WT andIKs channels (Fig.4). The greatly enhanced inactivation of KCNQ1(L273F) is shown in Fig. 3B. Tail current analysis after a 3-s preconditioning pulse to 40 mV resulted in 86 ± 3% inactivated mutant channels in contrast to only 31 ± 1% in KCNQ1-WT (Fig. 4, A and B; TableII). Around 30% inactivated WT channels were also calculated previously using the same analysis (22Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Time courses of inactivation and recovery were significantly affected compared with WT channels as well (Table II). After coinjecting the same amounts of KCNQ1-WT or KCNQ1(L273F) cRNA together with MinK cRNA, we observed a decreased current amplitude for mutantIKs channels consistent with previous data (19Shalaby F.Y. Levesque P.C. Yang W.P. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Jenkins-West T. Blanar M.A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1733-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C and D). The current-voltage relationship of activation was not shifted in mutantIKs channels compared with WT channels (Fig.4E). Most interestingly, using the double-pulse protocol, we demonstrated that MinK is no longer able to completely abolish the pronounced inactivation in KCNQ1(L273F) (Fig. 4D). Moreover, this inactivation in mutant IKs channels was accelerated compared with homomeric KCNQ1(L273F), further indicating functional assembly of the mutant KCNQ1 subunit with MinK (Table II). Tail currents of KCNQ1(L273F)/MinK channels displayed a weak hook confirming the persistence of inactivation in these heteromers (Fig.4D). By analyzing this hook, we calculated that more than 20% of mutant IKs channels were in the inactivated state after a 3-s activating pulse to 40 mV (Fig.4F). Thus, the significant number of inactivated,i.e. nonconducting, mutant IKschannels contributes to the decreased amplitudes of KCNQ1(L273F) and KCNQ1(L273F)/MinK compared with those of KCNQ1-WT and KCNQ1/MinK.In vivo this is expected to result in a decreased repolarizing IKs conductance constituting a new mechanism leading to LQT1 syndrome.Table IICharacteristics of inactivation in KCNQ1-WT and KCNQ1(L273F) in homomeric and heteromeric expression together with MinK in Xenopus oocytesτonsetτrecoveryInactivated channelsms%WT-KCNQ115 ± 1 (n = 12)45 ± 3 (n = 13)31 ± 1 (n = 12)KCNQ1(L273F)2-aSignificance of homomeric KCNQ1-WT versus KCNQ1(L273F).60 ± 6 (n = 6)98 ± 5 (n = 6)86 ± 3 (n = 6)WT-KCNQ1/MinK——0KCNQ1(L273F)/MinK2-bSignificance of homomeric KCNQ1(L273F) versus heteromeric KCNQ1(L273F)/MinK.26 ± 2 (n = 8)111 ± 3 (n = 8)24 ± 5 (n = 12)Oocytes were injected with 10 ng of KCNQ1 cRNA.

Fast N-type inactivation is realized by a ball plug-in mechanism, where a ball-forming domain of the channel binds to its receptor thereby blocking the ion pathway from the intracellular side (1Armstrong C.M.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This occurs independently of the membrane potential. KCNQ1 inactivation exerts slower inactivation gating and a weak voltage dependence. Further stressing the differences from the N-type mechanism, the identified residues at KCNQ1 positions 272, 273, and 307 are not expected to be accessible for a complex ball structure from the intracellular side and thus probably cannot account for a potential receptor site. In classical C-type inactivation, conformational changes in the outer vestibule of the pore are coupled to the inactivation process. This is reflected in the dependence of the inactivation to extracellular potassium and TEA (33LopezBarneo J. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Aldrich R.W. Recept. Channel. 1993; 1: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar, 34Choi K.L. Aldrich R.W Yellen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5092-5095Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In KCNQ1, TEA sensitivity of the inactivation rate is not determinable because of very low TEA affinity to the channel (22Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol.

Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, KCNQ1 inactivation is independent of extracellular potassium concentration; a principal difference from C-type behavior. In Shaker-like potassium channels, certain mutations within the P-region H5 and the sixth membrane-spanning region S6 have been shown to affect the time course of inactivation (33LopezBarneo J. Hoshi T. Heinemann S.H. Aldrich R.W. Recept. Channel. 1993; 1: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Neuron. 1991; 7: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Notably, also in our study KCNQ1 inactivation was enhanced by modification of this region (Q1S6Q2), but identified residues essential for KCNQ1 inactivation within the S5 region and the helical part of the H5 segment have not been reported to be substantially relevant for C-type inactivation. In conclusion, both C-type and KCNQ1 inactivation occur within the pore region spanning S5 to S6, but the defined critical structures appear to be different. In summary our results define geographical peculiarities for KCNQ1 inactivation, which were not yet reported for classical N- and C-type inactivation in Shaker-like potassium channels. KCNQ1 inactivation is characterized by an involvement of the pore region H5 and the S5 transmembrane region, putatively interplaying with each other. It is believed that KCNQ1 inactivation is abolished by interaction with MinK in native heteromeric IKschannels (22Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As suggested previously, interaction between KCNQ1 and MinK might involve the pore region of KCNQ1 (26Romey G. Attali B. Chouabe C. Abitbol I. Guillemare E. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16713-16716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Tai K.K. Goldstein S.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate an essential function of the pore region for KCNQ1 inactivation, therefore allowing the interesting possibility that MinK interaction may occur in the same region that is important for inactivation. MinK possibly abolishes inactivation by weakening the interplay between H5 and S5. In the LQT1 mutant L273F this interplay might be stronger, thereby stabilizing inactivation such that MinK no longer can abolish inactivation. This in turn may contribute to the deleterious phenotype of the LQT1 mutant. We thank K. Steinmeyer, H. Lerche, B. Attali, P. Ruppersberg, A. Wei, I. Gutcher, and E.

The expression of calsenilin can regulate the levels of a proteolytic product of PS2 (Buxbaum, J. D., Choi, E. K., Luo, Y., Lilliehook, C., Crowley, A. C., Merriam, D. E., and Wasco, W. (1998) Nat.

Here, we have used cultured mammalian cells that transiently or stably express calsenilin to extend the characterization of calsenilin and of the calsenilin-PS2 interaction. We have found that calsenilin has the ability to interact with endogenous 25-kDa C-terminal fragment (CTF) that is a product of regulated endoproteolytic cleavage of PS2 and that the presence of the N141I PS2 mutation does not significantly alter the interaction of calsenilin with PS2. Interestingly, when the 25-kDa PS2 CTF and the 20-kDa PS2 CTF are both present, calsenilin preferentially interacts with the 20-kDa CTF. Increases in the 20-kDa fragment are associated with the presence of familial Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations (Kim, T., Pettingell, W. H., Jung, Y., Kovacs, D. M., and Tanzi, R. E. (1997)Science 277, 373–376). However, the finding that the production of the 20-kDa fragment is regulated by the phosphorylation of PS2 (Walter, J., Schindzielorz, A., Grunberg, J., and Haass, C. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 1391–1396) suggests that it is a regulated physiological event that also occurs in the absence of the familial Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations in PS2.

Genetic studies of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) have led to the identification of three early onset FAD genes, which produce the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and the presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) proteins (6Tanzi R.E.

To date, more than 60 mutations in PS1 and at least 2 mutations in PS2 have been genetically linked to early onset FAD (8Van Gassen G. Annaert W. Van Broeckhoven C. Neurobiol.

The presenilins are multitransmembrane domain proteins whose primary subcellular location appears to be the membranes of the ER and Golgi. Proteolytic processing of both proteins, which results in a 35-kDa N-terminal fragment for both proteins, a 20-kDa CTF for PS1, and a 25-kDa CTF for PS2, has been reported for the presenilins in mouse and human brain as well as cultured cells (15Hendriks L.

In vivo, the majority of detectable presenilin appears in the form of the N- and C-terminal fragments that are tightly regulated at steady-state levels and form a stable complex after endoproteolytic processing (18Thinakaran G.

The presenilins have also been shown to be substrates for cleavage by caspase-3-like proteases (3Kim T. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E.

This cleavage results in the production of a smaller CTF. Notably, the presence of FAD mutations in the presenilins is associated with increased levels of these caspase-derived fragments, which are normally present at low levels and can only be detected after presenilin transfection. Recently, Walter et al. (4Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grunberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) reported that the phosphorylation of PS2 at a site within the C-terminal domain inhibits cleavage by caspase-3. This finding demonstrates that the phosphorylation state of PS2 controls its cleavage by caspase and suggests that cleavage of PS2 is a regulated biological event that occurs physiologically in the absence of FAD mutations.

Most interactors, including β-catenin, calmyrin, Bcl-XL, rab11, sorcin, and GSK-3β, bind to the large hydrophilic loop domain of the presenilins, whereas calsenilin and Go interact with the C-terminal domain. The interaction of the armadillo proteins, GSK-3β and Go appears to be specific for PS1, whereas μ-calpain, calmyrin, and sorcin interact only with PS2. In contrast, only calsenilin, filamins, Bcl-XL, and APP have the ability to interact with both PS1 and PS2. The characterization of interactors that are specific for either PS1 or PS2 may aid in the elucidation of distinct biological roles for the two proteins, whereas the characterization of proteins that interact with both presenilins (such as calsenilin) may provide information about common functions in both the normal and diseased brain. Calsenilin is a novel neuronal calcium-binding protein that interacts with the C terminus of the presenilins which was isolated using a yeast two-hybrid screen (1Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It is a member of the recoverin family of neuronal calcium-binding proteins, and it is 25% identical to recoverin, 29% identical to hippocalcin, and 33% identical to neuronal calcium sensor-1. The levels of the 20-kDa PS2 CTF are increased in the presence of calsenilin, suggesting that calsenilin either preferentially stabilizes the levels of this fragment or increases its formation (1Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have extended the characterization of calsenilin and the calsenilin-PS2 interaction and have found that the presence of the N141I mutation in PS2 does not appear to alter the interaction significantly. We have shown that calsenilin has the ability to interact with the endogenous 25-kDa PS2 CTF. Interestingly, calsenilin interacts preferentially with the 20-kDa PS2 CTF. As noted above, this smaller fragment is elevated as a result of the FAD-associated mutations in the presenilins, and its production is regulated by the phosphorylation state of PS2. Finally, we report that calsenilin itself is a substrate for caspase-3, and we have used site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that this cleavage takes place at a caspase-3 consensus motif that is proximal to the calcium binding domain of calsenilin. COS-7 and H4 human neuroglioma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/mld-glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. H4 cells stably expressing calsenilin were generated by transfection with a calsenilin-pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ (Invitrogen) construct using SuperFect (Qiagen), followed by selection and maintenance in the presence of 250 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen).

These lysates were used for coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Aliquots of cell lysates were precleared with protein A conjugated with magnetic beads (PerCeptive Diagnostics) for 2 h at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated using polyclonal antibodies to PS2 (anti-338) or calsenilin (anti-45). Rabbit-IgG (Pierce) was used as a negative control. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, samples were incubated with protein A-magnetic beads (30 μl/sample) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with the complementary antibody. For Western blot analysis, 50 μg of protein from each cell lysate was separated on 4–20% gradient or 14% Tris-glycine gel (Novex) under reducing conditions, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a semidry electrotransfer system (Hoefer). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature, probed with the primary antibody (anti-45 at 1:3,000; anti-338 at 1:5,000; anti-PS2Loop (18Thinakaran G.

Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescent substrate as described by the manufacturer (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). For the induction of apoptosis, H4 cells stably expressing calsenilin were seeded at 5 × 106 cells for each 150-mm dish. After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS, and medium containing either 1 μmstaurosporine (Sigma) or increasing concentrations of MG132 (Calbiochem) was added. For the inhibition of apoptosis, cells were pretreated with 100 μm zVAD-FMK (Enzyme System Products) for 1 h before induction of apoptosis. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points and lysed as described above. For the detection of apoptosis, anti-PARP (1:1000, PharMingen or New England BioLabs) and anti-caspase-3 (1:2,000, PharMingen) antibodies were used. For biochemical fractionation, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with calsenilin were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). When indicated, cells were also transiently transfected with wild type PS2. The extraction was carried out in the presence of 3 mmCaCl2 or 3 mm EGTA when appropriate. After resuspension, cells were lysed by sonicating three times for 30 s at 4 °C. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Postnuclear supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to separate the membrane pellet and cytosolic fraction, and complete lysis was confirmed by microscopy. The membrane pellets were suspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 by rocking for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing solubilized membrane proteins, was considered the membrane fraction. Equalized proteins of soluble cytosol and membrane pellet fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis. For Nycodenz gradient fractionation, cells were prepared as described (42Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and homogenized in H buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as described above) using a 25-gauge needle and a tight pestle metal Dounce homogenizer. The postnuclear supernatant was separated by density gradient centrifugation using step gradients consisting of 24, 19.33, 14.66, and 10% isotonic Nycodenz solutions (0.75% NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and fractionated with a density gradient fractionator. 22 0.6-ml fractions were collected from each gradient and analyzed by Western blot analysis using calsenilin, PS2, calnexin (1:2,000, StressGen), and 14-3-3 (1:2,000, StressGen) antibodies. H4 cells stably expressing calsenilin were cultured on four-chamber glass slides the day before transfection. Cells were then transiently transfected with vector, wild type, or N141I PS2 constructs. After 24 h, cells were washed briefly with PBS and the fixed for 20 min with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed three times, permeabilized with blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100 and 4% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 h, and rinsed three times with PBS. After overnight incubation with primary antibodies against calsenilin (polyclonal Ab 45, 1:200), PS2 (polyclonal Ab 338, 1:200), PDI (monoclonal Ab, 1:200, StressGen), GM130 (monoclonal Ab, 1:200, StressGen), or β-COP (monoclonal Ab, 1:200,StressGen) and three washes in PBS, secondary antibodies were applied (1:200 in PBS). Bodipy FL anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) and Cy3 anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. Control reactions omitting the primary antibodies resulted in no labeling with the secondary antibodies (data not shown). Sections were examined using conventional immunofluorescence microscopy and a Bio-Rad 1024 laser confocal microscope (Hercules). Mutant calsenilin constructs were generated using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with oligonucleotide primers designed to alter Asp61or Asp64 to an alanine. Mutant constructs were cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ and fully verified by sequencing. For in vitro cleavage, 15–25 μg of protein from total lysates was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 25 μl of caspase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of active recombinant human caspase-3 (PharMingen). Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-containing sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. We have reported previously that calsenilin interacts with full-length PS1 and PS2 (1Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To characterize the calsenilin-PS2 interaction further, we generated a polyclonal antibody (anti-45) that recognizes calsenilin when it is expressed in transfected cells (Fig.1B, lower panel, lane 5) and endogenous calsenilin in mouse and human brain. 2N. F. Zaidi, O. Berezovska E.-K. Choi, H. Chan, C. Lillihook, B. Hyman, J. Buxbaum, and W. Wasco, manuscript in preparation. Although this antibody was able to immunoprecipitate endogenous calsenilin from naive H4 cell lysates (see arrow in Fig.1 A) it was necessary to use at least 1 mg of total extract to detect immunoprecipitated endogenous calsenilin. In addition, endogenous calsenilin could not be detected by Western blot analysis of 50 μg of protein from total lysates (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). Taken together, these observations indicate that endogenous levels of calsenilin levels are relatively low in these cells. Accordingly, although we have successfully detected an endogenous presenilin-calsenilin complex in brain extract,2 it was difficult to detect this complex in cultured cells. To overcome this detection problem, we generated an H4 human neuroglioma cell line that stably expresses calsenilin, and we used these cells to assess the ability of exogenous calsenilin to interact with endogenous PS2. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, as increasing amounts of endogenous 25-kDa PS2 CTF were immunoprecipitated from increasing amounts of starting material, increasing amounts of calsenilin were coimmunoprecipitated. No calsenilin was detected when normal rabbit IgG was used as a control antibody for immunoprecipitation. This finding is significant because it demonstrates that calsenilin has the ability to interact with physiological levels of the 25-kDa PS2 CTF. Because the levels of the 20-kDa PS2 CTF are below the levels of detection in naive cells, we did not observe the coimmunoprecipitation of this fragment. As can be seen in Fig.2, the 20-kDa fragment can only be detected after overexpression of PS2. Also, because the levels of endogenous full-length PS2 are below the levels of detection, we did not observe the coimmunoprecipitation of full-length PS2 which we have observed previously after transfection with PS2 (1Buxbaum J.D.

In the present study we performed a tryptophan scanning analysis on the transmembrane α-helix of the Na,K-ATPase %1 subunit to investigate its role in the stabilization of the α subunit, the endoplasmic reticulum exit of α-% complexes, and the acquisition of functional properties of the Na,K-ATPase. Single or multiple tryptophan substitutions in the % subunits transmembrane domain had no significant effect on the structural maturation of α subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes nor on the level of expression of functional Na,K pumps at the cell surface. Furthermore, tryptophan substitutions in regions of the transmembrane α-helix containing two GXXXG transmembrane helix interaction motifs or a cysteine residue, which can be cross-linked to transmembrane helix M8 of the α subunit, had no effect on the apparent K+ affinity of Na,K-ATPase. On the other hand, substitutions by tryptophan, serine, alanine, or cysteine, but not by phenylalanine of two highly conserved tyrosine residues, Tyr40 and Tyr44, on another face of the transmembrane helix, perturb the transport kinetics of Na,K pumps in an additive way. These results indicate that at least two faces of the % subunits transmembrane helix contribute to inter- or intrasubunit interactions and that two tyrosine residues aligned in the % subunits transmembrane α-helix are determinants of intrinsic transport characteristics of Na,K-ATPase.

Over 200 members of this family have been identified (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Of these, only animal Na,K- and H,K-ATPase isozymes and bacterial K-ATPase isozymes, are oligomeric with 1 and 3 subunits, respectively, in addition to the catalytic subunit. Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α subunits have the highest sequence identity among the P-type ATPases. Based on the membrane topology, the catalytic α subunits of Na,K- and H,K-ATPases belong to the group of P2-ATPases (2Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) which according to the crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase contains 10 transmembrane (TM)1 segments (3Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The % subunits associated with Na,K- and H,K-ATPases are type II proteins with one TM segment, a short cytoplasmic tail, and a large ectodomain containing several sugar chains and 3 disulfide bridges. So far, three Na,K-ATPase % isoforms and one H,K-ATPase % subunit have been identified. The unique presence of % subunits in Na,K- and H,K-ATPases remains intriguing both from a functional and evolutionary point of view. At present, we know that the % subunit has two main functions. Of primary importance is its role as a specific chaperone which favors the correct membrane insertion and hence the resistance against proteolysis and cellular degradation of the newly synthesized α subunits of Na,K- and H,K-ATPases (4Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Häuptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-C858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Béguin P. Hasler U. Beggah A. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Biol.

Puppe W. Mollenkamp T. Zeeck A. Boddien C. Fendler K. Bamberg E. Drose S. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 137-146PubMed Google Scholar), it has been speculated that the % subunits of Na,K- and H,K-ATPases may be remnants of the bacterial KdpC subunit that have been eliminated in other P2-ATPases (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Based on topology studies on Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α subunits, we have also suggested that the K+ transport function common to all oligomeric P-type ATPases, is associated with a particular amino acid composition that is not compatible with efficient membrane insertion of the α subunits. This has required that during evolution, K+ transporting α subunits had to assemble with a helper protein in order to assist their correct membrane integration (9Geering K. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 174: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition to their chaperone function, % subunits also influence the cation sensitivity of oligomeric P-type ATPases expressed at the cell surface. The association of the α subunit with different % isoforms (10Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or N-terminal truncated % subunits (11Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Giradet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J.

An important issue concerning the structure-function relationship of Na,K- and H,K-ATPases is the identification of the matching interaction sites in the α and the % subunits that are responsible for the chaperone function and/or the transport-modulating effect of the % subunit. Experimental evidence suggests that α and % subunits interact in the extracytoplasmic, the TM, and the cytoplasmic domains. In α subunits of both Na,K-ATPase (13Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and H,K-ATPase (14Melle-Milovanovic D. Milovanovic M. Nagpal S. Sachs G. Shin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11075-11081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the most clearly defined interaction site is located in the extracytoplasmic loop between the TM segment M7 and M8. Interaction of the % subunit with this region was shown to be important for the correct membrane insertion and the structural maturation of the Na,K- and H,K-ATPase α subunit (5Béguin P. Hasler U.

According to results obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system, the M7 and M8 α-domain interacts with an extracytoplasmic region of the % subunit contained within the 64 amino acids adjacent to the TM domain (13Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, mutational and immunological studies suggest that other regions in the extracytoplasmic domain of the % subunit such as the 10 most C-terminal amino acids (15Beggah A.T. Béguin P. Jaunin P. Peitsch M.C. Geering K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14117-14124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or a YYPYYG sequence conserved in all known % subunits (16Geering K. Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Merillat A.M. Horisberger J.D. Mathews P.M. Lemas V. Fambrough D.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1169-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Okamoto C.T. Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C727-C738Crossref Google Scholar) might as well participate in α-% interactions and contribute to the stabilization of the α subunit. As suggested by results obtained using chimeras between different % isoforms (12Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Béguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,18Wang S.-G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), interactions in the ectodomains of the α and the % subunit might also be responsible for the % subunits effects on the cation sensitivity of Na,K-ATPase. Controlled proteolysis assays performed on Na,K-ATPase % subunits, indicate that α and % subunits also interact in the cytoplasmic domain (11Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Giradet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A mutational analysis indicates that these interactions are not necessary for the structural maturation of the α subunit (11Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Giradet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,12Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Béguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol.

Greasley P.J. von Heijne G. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29011-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that cytoplasmic α-% interactions contribute to some discrete steps in the catalytic cycle of Na,K-ATPase as suggested by Na+ occlusion and electrogenic binding assays (20Shainskaya A. Scneeberger A. Appell H-J. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2019-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interactions in the TM domains of the α and % subunits are the least well understood both in molecular and functional terms. So far, cross-linking experiments have provided evidence that the TM domain of the % subunit may be in contact with M8 of the α subunit (21Ivanov A. Zhao H. Modyanov N.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9778-9785Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Or E. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2802-2809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but nothing is known on the functional implications of this possible intersubunit interaction. In this study, we have aimed to identify amino acid residues in the % TM domain that interact with the α subunit and to determine the putative functional role of this interaction by using a tryptophan scanning analysis. Tryptophan scanning has previously been used to determine structural features of integral membrane proteins (23Sharp L.L. Zhou J. Blair D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7946-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Sharp L.L. Zhou J. Blair D.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9166-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Braun P. Persson B. Kaback H.R. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29566-29571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Tryptophan was chosen because of its moderately hydrophobic properties and its large size. The results of previous studies are consistent with the expectations that if tryptophan is introduced at several positions in a membrane segment, its large side chain is tolerated when facing the lipid bilayer but, when positioned inside the protein, it may disrupt function by breaking helix-helix interactions. Based on these predictions, we aimed to get structural and functional information on the TM domain of the Na,K-ATPase % subunit by replacing amino acids individually or in combination by tryptophan. % Subunit mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes together with α subunits and the stability and the transport properties of the resulting Na,K-ATPase α-% complexes were analyzed. Our results indicate that interactions in the TM domain of α and % subunits do not play a role in the α-stabilizing effect of the % subunit. On the other hand, mutations of two tyrosine residues, highly conserved in the TM domain of all known % subunits, significantly modulate the transport kinetics of the Na,K-ATPase. The results of this study thus provide evidence that the TM domain of the % subunit contributes to intrinsic functional properties of oligomeric P-type ATPases as opposed to the transport-modulating interactions in the ectodomain observed for % isoforms. Amino acids Ile36 to Gln56 of Xenopus Na,K-ATPase %1 (%NK) were individually replaced by tryptophan residues using the polymerase chain reaction method described by Nelson and Long (26Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Briefly, fragments of %1NK contained in a pSD5 vector (pSD5%1NK) were first amplified by polymerase chain reaction using sense oligonucleotides containing mutated sequences coding for tryptophan and an antisense oligonucleotide consisting of nucleotides 628–648 tailed by primer D of Nelson and Long (26Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The amplified fragments were then used as primers to elongate the inverse DNA strand which in turn was amplified using a sense oligonucleotide encoding the SP6 sequence of pSD5%NK and primer D of Nelson and Long (26Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The mutated DNA fragments were introduced into wild type pSD5%1NK using NheI andBamHI restriction sites. The Y40W mutant was used as a template for the preparation of Y40W/Y44W. G45W was used as a template for the preparation of G45W/G49W which in turn was used for the preparation of G45W/G49W/G53W. Y40F/Y44F, Y40S/Y44S, Y40C/Y44C, and Y40A/Y44A were prepared using sense oligonucleotides containing both mutated sequences. The chimera NK/HK in which the cytoplasmic and TM domains (Met1-Asp71) are derived fromXenopus Na,K-ATPase %1 and the ectodomain (Gln76-Lys291) from rabbit, gastric H,K-ATPase % subunit was prepared as previously described (27Jaunin P.

NK/HK Y40W/Y44W was prepared by amplifying a fragment of %1NK as described above using a sense oligonucleotide containing both mutated sequences, an antisense oligonucleotide encoding nucleotides 420–440 tailed by primer D of Nelson and Long (26Nelson R.M.

The mutated DNA fragment was introduced into wild type pSD5%3NK using NheI andStuI restriction sites. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. cRNAs coding forBufo Na,K-ATPase α1 (28Jaisser J. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. J. Biol.

Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4042) Google Scholar). Oocytes were obtained from Xenopusfemales as described (4Geering K. Theulaz I. Verrey F. Häuptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-C858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Routinely, 7 ng of Bufo marinus or α and 0.8 ng of Xenopus % subunit cRNAs were injected into oocytes. Oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's medium containing [35S]methionine (0.5 mCi/ml) for 6 h and then subjected to 24 and 72 h chase periods in the presence of 10 mm cold methionine. Digitonin extracts were prepared as described (11Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Giradet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and the α subunit was immunoprecipitated using aBufo α1 subunit antibody (32Girardet M. Geering K. Frantes J.M. Geser D.

Giradet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) allowing co-immunoprecipitation of the associated % subunit. The dissociated immune complexes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. Quantification of immunoprecipitated bands was performed with a laser densitometer (LKB Ultrascan 2202). Na,K pump activity was measured as the K+-induced outward current using the two-electrode voltage clamp method as described earlier (10Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Current measurements were performed 3 days after injection of oocytes withBufo α1 and either wild type or mutant % cRNAs. One day before performing measurements, oocytes were loaded with Na+ in a K+-free solution containing 200 nm ouabain, a concentration that inhibits the endogenous Na,K pumps but not the ouabain-resistant exogenous Bufo Na,K pumps (33Wang X.Y. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The K+ activation of the Na,K pump current was determined in a Na+-containing solution (80 mm sodium gluconate, 0.82 mm MgCl2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 10 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-HEPES, 5 mm BaCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, pH 7.4) or in a nominally Na+-free solution (sodium gluconate was replaced by 140 mm sucrose). The current induced by increasing concentrations of K+ (0.3, 1.0, 3.3, and 10 mm K+ in the presence of Na+ and 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, and 5.0 mmK+ in the absence of Na+) was measured either at −50 mV or during a series of nine 200-ms voltage steps ranging from −130 to +30 mV. To determine the kinetic parameters such as maximal currents (ImaxK) and half-activation constants (K1/2K+) the Hill equation was fitted to the data of the current (I) induced by various K+ concentrations ([K]) using a least square method: I = ImaxK/(1 + (K1/2K+/[K])nH). According to previous studies (10Jaisser F. Jaunin P. Geering K. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.-D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 605-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the Hill coefficient (nH) was set to a value of 1.6 for experiments performed in the presence of external Na+ and 1.0 for experiments performed in the absence of external Na+. Measurements of the half-activation constant for internal Na+ was performed as previously described (12Hasler U. Wang X. Crambert G. Béguin P. Jaisser F. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30826-30835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, in addition to Na,K-ATPase α and % cRNAs, oocytes were injected with cRNAs coding for α, %, and γ subunits (0.3 ng of each subunit/oocyte) of the rat epithelial Na+ channel, rENaC (34Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), and were incubated for 3 days in a modified Barth's solution containing 10 mm Na+. One day before measurements, oocytes were incubated in a Na+-free solution (50 mm NMDG-Cl, 40 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NMDG-HEPES, pH 7.4) in order to maximally reduce the internal Na+ concentration. Intracellular Na+ concentrations were calculated from the reversal potential of the amiloride-sensitive current obtained from a pair of I-V curves recorded with and without amiloride in a solution containing 5 mm Na+ (5 mm sodium gluconate, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmBaCl2, 95 mm NMDG-Cl, 10 mmNMDG-HEPES, pH 7.4). At each intracellular Na+concentration ([Na]i) the Na,K pump K+-activated current (IK) was measured in the presence of 20 μm amiloride and in the absence or presence of external Na+ (see above) by addition of 5 or 10 mmK+. Maximal pump currents (Imax,Na) and half-activation constants for Na+(K1/2Na+int) were determined by fitting the Hill equation [IK =Imax,Na/(1 + (K1/2Na+int/[Na]i)3)] to the measured IK and [Na]i values. Six to eight pairs of measurements of [Na]i and of the Na,K pump K+-activated current were performed successively on each oocyte at −50 mV. Between each pair of measurements, the oocytes were allowed to increase their intracellular Na+concentration by exposure to a 100 mm Na+solution (100 mm sodium gluconate, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4) in the absence of amiloride and at a holding potential of −50 to −100 mV. Measurements of the apparent affinity for external Na+ were performed using ouabain-sensitive Xenopus α1 subunits by measuring the inhibition of the K+-induced current by external Na+. 3 days after oocyte injection and 1 day before measurements, oocytes were loaded with Na+ in a K+-free solution. The Na,K pump current induced by 1 mm K+ was measured in a nominally Na+-free solution (120 mm NMDG-gluconate, 0.82 mm MgCl2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 10 mm NMDG-HEPES, 5 mm BaCl2, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, pH 7.4) and in the presence of 10, 30, 60, and 120 mm Na+ (NMDG-gluconate was replaced by sodium gluconate) during a series of nine 200-ms voltage steps ranging from −130 to +30 mV. The Na,K pump was then blocked by the addition of 100 μm ouabain and the same series of measurements was repeated. Currents specific for the Na,K pump could be deduced by subtracting the currents observed in the presence of ouabain from those observed in its absence. A nonsaturating concentration of K+ (1 mm) was chosen in order to reveal the competition of external Na+ with K+ ions for extracellular cation-binding sites. At each external Na+concentration, the averaged endogenous, ouabain-sensitive Na,K pump current was subtracted from total ouabain-sensitive currents measured in oocytes expressing exogenous Na,K pumps. The decrease in the Na,K pump current produced by exposure to external Na+ was used to determine the half-inhibition constant for external Na+(K1/2Na+ext) by fitting the Hill equation [I = Imax,Na(1–1/(1 + (K1/2Na+ext/[Na])nH)] to the data of the current (I) observed at each concentration of external Na+. Means of the Na,K pump currents produced in oocytes expressing α subunits and wild type or mutant % subunits were compared by unpaired Student'st test. Na,K-ATPase activity was measured in microsomal fractions prepared as previously described (11Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Giradet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) from oocytes expressing Xenopus α subunits and wild type %1 subunits or %1 Y40W/Y44W mutants. Before activity measurements, samples were freeze/thawed twice in liquid nitrogen. Na,K-ATPase activity was measured in triplicate by an enzyme-linked assay, according to Schoner et al. (35Schoner W. von Ilberg C. Kramer K. Seubert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), in which the resynthesis of ATP consumed by the ATPase is coupled by the pyruvate and lactate dehydrogenase reactions to NADH oxidation. The oxidation rate of NADH was recorded at 340 nm wavelength in the automated enzyme kinetic accessory of a DU-64 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments). The substrate concentrations of the reaction mixture were 5 mmKCl, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm ATP, and 4 mm MgCl2. To reduce nonspecific, mitochondrial ATPase activities, 5 mm NaN3 were added to the reaction mixture. Activity measurements were done in the presence or absence of 10−7-10−4morthovanadate. The specific enzyme activity was calculated as the difference between samples incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mm ouabain. In the absence of vanadate, ouabain-sensitive activities represented 20–30% of the total enzyme activity. Statistical analysis was done by unpaired Student's ttest. Fig. 1 A shows the membrane-spanning domain of the %1 subunit of XenopusNa,K-ATPase, as previously defined (19Hasler U. Greasley P.J. von Heijne G. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29011-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The TM domain of theXenopus %1 subunit comprises 23 amino acids and shows a sequence identity of 43% with Xenopus %2, 65% with %3, and 43% with the % subunit of gastric H,K-ATPase. Secondary structure prediction on the %1 TM domain revealed an α-helical structure with at least two distinct faces (Fig. 1 B). One face is characterized by three aligned residues with large lateral side chains (Tyr40, Tyr44, and Phe51) (numbering of amino acids correspond to Xenopus %1 subunits) whereas another face contains three aligned glycine residues (Gly45, Gly49, and Gly53) forming a cleft in the α-helix. The two tyrosine residues are conserved in all known % subunits whereas the three glycine residues are only found in Na,K-ATPase %1 isoforms and certain %3 isoforms. Other Na,K-ATPase % isoforms and H,K-ATPase % subunits contain 1 or 2 glycine residues corresponding to either Gly45 and/or Gly49. Three phenylalanine residues (Phe39, Phe43, and Phe51) are present in the TM domain of all Na,K-ATPase % isoforms whereas the H,K-ATPase % subunit contains a conservative substitution of tyrosine for Phe39. Na,K-ATPase %2 and %3 isoforms contain a fourth phenylalanine residue which is replaced by a cysteine residue (Cys46) in %1 isoforms (Fig. 1, A and B). In order to identify the amino acid residues in the % TM domain that interact with the α subunit and to determine the putative functional role of this interaction, amino acids encompassing Ile36 to Gln56 were substituted individually or in combination by tryptophan. We first tested whether tryptophan substitutions in the TM domain of the % subunit might interfere with the structural maturation of the α subunit. Bufo α subunits were expressed in Xenopus oocytes alone or together withXenopus wild type or mutant %1 subunits and the cellular expression of the α-% complexes was followed by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins after a pulse and various chase periods. As expected, α subunits expressed without % subunits were degraded during a 48-h chase period (Fig.2, lanes 10 and11). Similar to wild type %1 subunits (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3), all %-mutants assembled with and stabilized α-subunits as illustrated for the triple glycine mutant G45W/G49W/G53W (lanes 4–6) and the double tyrosine mutant Y40W/Y44W (lanes 7–9). In addition, all % subunit mutants assembled with α subunits became full"

Treatment of cells with G-CSF has been shown to activate multiple signal transduction pathways. We show here that Erk5, a novel member of the MAPK family, and its specific upstream activator MEK5 were activated in response to incubation of cells with G-CSF. Different from other members of the MAPK family including Erk1/2, JNK, and p38, maximal activation of Erk5 by G-CSF required the C-terminal region of the G-CSF receptor. Genistein, a specific inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases, blocked G-CSF-induced Erk5 activation. In contrast, inhibition of protein kinase C activity increased G-CSF-mediated activation of Erk5 and MEK5, whereas stimulation of protein kinase C activity inhibited activation of the two kinases by G-CSF. The proliferation of BAF3 cells in response to G-CSF was inhibited by expression of a dominant-negative MEK5 but potentiated by expression of a constitutively active MEK5. Expression of the constitutively active MEK5 also increased the survival of BAF3 cells cultured in the absence of or in low concentrations of G-CSF. Together, these data implicate Erk5 as an important signaling component in the biological actions of G-CSF.

G-CSF mediates its biological activities by binding to and activating its cognate receptor, a single transmembrane protein that belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily. The G-CSF receptor has no intrinsic kinase activity in the cytoplasmic domain and thus has to interact with cytoplasmic kinases for signal transduction. One of the major signaling events regulated by G-CSF is the activation of the Janus protein-tyrosine kinases including Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 (3Nicholson S.E. Oates A.C. Harpur A.G. Ziemiecki A.

In addition to the Jak/Stat cascade, G-CSF has also been shown to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which relay signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus (15Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 16Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). The MAPK module is composed of three kinases that establish a sequential activation cascade. A MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK or MEKK) activates a MAPK kinase (MAPKK or MEK), which in turn activates a MAPK via dual phosphorylation of a Thr-X-Tyr motif. The MAPK pathways are activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli via interaction with small GTPases including Ras and Rho family members and mediate distinct cellular responses. Members of MAPKs that are activated by G-CSF include Erk1/2, JNK, and p382 and activation of these kinases appears to be involved in G-CSF-stimulated cell proliferation (8Nicholson S.E. Novak U.

Erk5 shares the Thr-X-Tyr sequence in the dual phosphorylation site with other MAPKs, but has a unique long C-terminal tail, suggesting a distinct regulatory mechanism of its activation. Similar to other members of the MAPK family, Erk5 has been shown to phosphorylate transcription factors such as c-Myc and members of MEF2 family of transcription factors (24Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V.

Interestingly, unlike Erk1/2, JNK, and p38, maximal Erk5 activation requires the C-terminal region of the G-CSF receptor. We demonstrate that protein-tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C (PKC) exert differential effects on G-CSF-induced activation of Erk5 and MEK5. Furthermore, we provide evidence indicating that the MEK5/Erk5 pathway plays a positive role in the regulation of G-CSF-induced cell proliferation and survival. Murine BAF3 and 32D cells, stably transfected with cDNAs encoding either the wild-type or the truncated forms of the human G-CSF receptor, have been described (35Dong F. van Buitenen C. Pouwels K.

Med. 1991; 173: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. T. Honjo (Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and 10% WEHI-3B cell-conditioned media. BAF3 cells expressing the wild-type G-CSF receptor (BAF/WT) were electroporated with cDNAs encoding MEK5 or dominant-active mutant MEK5DD that were cloned in pCEFL mammalian expression vector (30Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells were selected in G418-containing medium, and individual clones were expanded and examined for expression of transfected proteins by Western blotting. Wortmannin was from Sigma. PD98059, SB 202190, PP1, genistein, and GF109203X were obtained from CalBiochem. U0126 was purchased from Promega. Rabbit anti-JNK and p38 antisera used for immunoprecipitation and kinase assays were raised against GST fusion proteins of murine JNK and p38. Anti-Erk2 antibody (TR10) was kindly provided by M. Weber (University of Virginia). Anti-Erk1/2 (Pan-Erk) antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-HA and -JNK1 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from PharMingen. Antibodies to Erk5 and MEK5 were purchased from StressGen. Anti-Erk5 antibody used for immunoprecipitation and anti-p38 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Phosphospecific Erk1/2 antibody was obtained from New England BioLabs. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cells were starved in the absence of serum and conditioned media for 4 h prior to stimulation with G-CSF for the times indicated. The preparation of whole cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, and in vitro kinase assays were essentially as described (38Dong F. Larner A.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 1656-1662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST·MEF2C fusion protein (amino acids 87–467) was used for assay of Erk5 activity, GST·ATF2(96) fusion protein for JNK and p38 activities, and myelin basic protein (MBP) for Erk2 activity. GST·Erk5 fusion protein used for assay of MEK5 activity has been described (34Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were prepared as described (27Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The expression vectors containing the HA-tagged Erk5, MEK5, and dominant-negative MEK5AA (Ser311 and Thr315 to Ala) have been previously described (27Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). BAF3 and 32D cells expressing the different G-CSF receptor forms were transfected by electroporation (Electro Square Porator; BTX Genetronics Inc.) (12Dong F. Liu X. de Koning J.P. Touw I.P. Henninghausen L. Larner A. Grimley P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6503-6509PubMed Google Scholar). Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 4 h prior to treatment with G-CSF for the indicated times. 105 cells were incubated in triplicate in 100 μl of serum-free medium in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of G-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 20 h. Cells were then pulsed with 1 μCi [3H]thymidine for 4 h and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. To investigate the involvement of Erk5 in G-CSF-dependent signaling pathway, we examined Erk5 activation in response to G-CSF in murine pro-B BAF3 cells expressing the wild-type G-CSF receptor (BAF/WT). Cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged Erk5 and were starved for 4 h prior to G-CSF stimulation for the indicated times. Whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. In vitro kinase assays using MEF2C as a substrate revealed that G-CSF treatment of cells resulted in transient and strong (more than 8-fold) activation of Erk5 at 15 min of treatment (Fig. 1 A). G-CSF also induced activation of endogenous Erk5 in BAF/WT cells, myeloid 32D cells stably transfected with the wild-type G-CSF receptor (32D/WT) and myeloid L-G cells that expressed the endogenous G-CSF receptor (Fig.1 B). Both 32D/WT and L-G cells were capable of differentiating into mature granulocytes in response to G-CSF (36Dong F. Brynes R.K. Tidow N. Welte K. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 37Lee K.H. Kinashi T. Tohyama K. Tashiro K. Funato N. Hama K. Honjo T. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Activation of endogenous Erk5 appeared weaker than that seen when assaying the transfected protein because of the poor efficiency of the anti-Erk5 antibody to immunoprecipitate the protein (data not shown). To determine which cytoplasmic regions of the G-CSF receptor play a role in the regulation of Erk5 activation, we assayed Erk5 activity in BAF3 cells expressing the truncated forms of the G-CSF receptor (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 B, G-CSF stimulation of BAF3 cells expressing the D715 receptor induced a weak increase in Erk5 activity. The kinetics of Erk5 activation was similar to that induced by the wild-type receptor (data not shown). In contrast, activation of endogenous or transfected Erk1/2, JNK, and p38 was strongly stimulated by the D715 receptor (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). No Erk5 activation was observed upon G-CSF stimulation of BAF3 cells expressing the D685 receptor over a period from 5 to 60 min (Fig. 2 Band data not shown). The D685 receptor was still able to mediate a weak activation of Erk1/2, JNK, and p38 and has previously been shown to activate Jak2, Stat5, and Akt (12Dong F. Liu X. de Koning J.P. Touw I.P. Henninghausen L. Larner A. Grimley P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6503-6509PubMed Google Scholar, 35Dong F. van Buitenen C. Pouwels K. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Mol. Cell.

Together, these results indicated that the C-terminal 98 amino acids of the G-CSF receptor play an important role in regulating Erk5 activation and that the region between amino acids 686 and 715 of the G-CSF receptor is indispensable for mediating G-CSF-induced Erk5 activation. MEK5 has been shown to be required for EGF-induced Erk5 activation (23Zhou G. Bao Z.-Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 24Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.J. Han J. Ulevitch R. Lee J.-D. EMBO. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 25English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We examined whether MEK5 was activated by stimulation of cells with G-CSF. Whole cell extracts were prepared from BAF/WT cells stimulated with G-CSF for different times. Endogenous MEK5 was immunoprecipitated and its activity measured within vitro kinase assay using GST·Erk5 fusion protein as a substrate. Incubation of cells with G-CSF stimulated MEK5 activity (Fig. 3 A). Activation of MEK5 by G-CSF occurred earlier than that of Erk5, usually 5 min after addition of G-CSF, and the signal started to diminish after 20 min and disappeared 60 min after G-CSF stimulation (data not shown). It appeared that G-CSF-stimulated activation of MEK5 was slightly more sustained than Erk5 activation, suggesting that the two kinases are down-regulated by different mechanisms. Treatment of 32D/WT and L-G cells with G-CSF also induced activation of endogenous MEK5 (data not shown). Activation of MEK5 was further examined in BAF3 cells expressing the truncated forms of the G-CSF receptor. As shown in Fig.3 B, the D715 mutant mediated a weak activation of MEK5 whereas the D685 receptor failed to induce MEK5 activation. Thus, MEK5 activation by G-CSF correlated well with that of Erk5 activation in cells expressing the different forms of the G-CSF receptor (see Fig.2). To determine the involvement of MEK5 in G-CSF-induced activation of Erk5, we cotransfected BAF/WT cells with HA-tagged Erk5 and MEK5AA, a dominant-negative form of MEK5 (27Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4289-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Expression of MEK5AA strongly inhibited Erk5 activation by G-CSF (Fig. 3 C), but had no significant effect on G-CSF-induced Erk1/2 activation (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 B, H2O2 treatment of BAF3 cells stimulated Erk5 activation, which was also blocked by MEK5AA. To investigate whether other signaling pathways have a role in regulating Erk5 activity, we tested the effects of different protein kinase inhibitors on G-CSF-induced Erk5 activation in BAF/WT cells (Fig. 4). Pretreatment of cells with tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (GN; lane 8) (39Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or MEK inhibitor U0126 (U; lane 5) (40Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) almost completely blocked G-CSF-mediated Erk5 activation. In contrast, another MEK inhibitor PD98059 (PD; lane 4) (41Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) had no effect on Erk5 activation although it blocked Erk1/2 activation by G-CSF (data not shown). The differential effects of PD98059 and U0126 on Erk5 activation by G-CSF contrasted to a recent report that both inhibitors blocked EGF-induced activation of Erk5 in COS-7 cells (34Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and the reason for this discrepancy is unknown. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor wortmannin (WM; lane 3) (42Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), the p38 inhibitor SB 202190 (SB; lane 7) (43Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar) or the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 (PP; lane 11) (44Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) had no significant or only minimal effects. Interestingly, G-CSF-induced Erk5 activation was strongly enhanced by pretreating cells with GF109203X (GF; lane 6), a specific inhibitor of PKC (45Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We further investigated whether stimulation of PKC activity would attenuate Erk5 activation by G-CSF. BAF/WT cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a well known PKC activator, prior to stimulation with G-CSF. As shown in Fig.5 A, PMA alone did not affect Erk5 activity but inhibited G-CSF-induced Erk5 activation by more than 60% as determined by phosphorimager analysis. In contrast, PMA alone induced Erk1/2 activation and further potentiated the activation of Erk1/2 by G-CSF, presumably by stimulating Raf-1 activity (46Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 47Cacace A.M. Ueffing M. Philipp A. Han E.K. Kolch W. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2517-2526PubMed Google Scholar). GF109203X alone induced Erk5 activation in BAF/WT cells and combination of GF109203X and G-CSF exerted a synergistic effect on Erk5 activation, leading to an ∼4.5-fold greater increase in Erk5 activity as compared with that induced by G-CSF alone. It appeared that GF109203X slightly potentiated G-CSF-induced activation of Erk1/2 although its effect on Erk1/2 activation by G-CSF was significantly weaker than on Erk5 activation. Depletion of PKC through overnight treatment of cells with PMA also potentiated Erk5 activation by G-CSF. Comparable results were obtained in 32D/WT cells although GF109203X alone did not stimulate Erk5 activity in 32D cells (Fig. 5 B). We examined whether G-CSF-induced activation of MEK5 is affected by alteration of PKC activity. As shown in Fig. 5 C, endogenous MEK5 activity was strongly induced by treatment of cells with GF109203X. The combination of G-CSF and GF109203X further dramatically enhanced the activity of MEK5. On the contrary, preincubation of cells with PMA inhibited G-CSF-induced activation of MEK5. These results suggest that PKC exerts the negative effect on G-CSF-induced Erk5 activation via inhibiting MEK5 activity either directly or indirectly. To investigate whether the Erk5 pathway is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, we transiently transfected BAF/WT cells with the dominant-negative mutant MEK5AA because we were unable to stably express MEK5AA in the cells. The transfection efficiency of BAF3 in several experiments was ∼50% as determined by expression of a transfected green fluorescence protein (GFP) construct (data not shown). As shown in Fig.6 A, expression of MEK5AA inhibited G-CSF-stimulated cell proliferation by ∼30% as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake assay. In contrast, expression of MEK5 did not inhibit cell proliferation induced by G-CSF. We stably expressed the constitutively active MEK5DD in BAF/WT cells to examine its effect on G-CSF biological responses. Expression of MEK5DD but not MEK5 stimulated Erk5 activity in BAF/WT cells in the absence of G-CSF (Fig. 6 B), but did not affect the activities of Erk1/2, JNK, p38, or Akt (data not shown). Interestingly, G-CSF stimulation of cells expressing MEK5DD decreased Erk5 activity, possibly because of activation of a negative regulatory pathway. In the absence of G-CSF, MEK5DD weakly stimulated the uptake of [3H]thymidine by the BAF/WT cells (about 3-fold increase as compared with cells not transfected or transfected with MEK5). Expression of MEK5DD potentiated cell proliferation stimulated by suboptimal concentrations of G-CSF (0.1–0.3 ng/ml, Fig.6 C). However, when stimulated with optimal concentration of G-CSF (10 ng/ml), the proliferation of cells expressing MEK5 or MEK5DD showed no significant differences. Together, these results indicated that Erk5 pathway is positively involved in regulating G-CSF stimulated-cell proliferation. We also examined the effect of expression of constitutively active MEK5DD on cell survival. Cells were washed and cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with no G-CSF or G-CSF at concentrations as indicated in Fig. 7. Cell viability was determined by exclusion of trypan blue staining after 30 and 54 h of incubation (Fig. 7, A and B). Expression of MEK5DD markedly enhanced the viability of cells cultured in the absence of G-CSF or in the suboptimal concentrations of G-CSF. The effect of MEK5DD was most significant at 54 h of culture at which time point MEK5DD reduced the concentration of G-CSF (as low as 0.03 ng/ml) required for maximal cell survival (Fig. 7 B). MEK5DD did not further significantly increase the viability of cells that were cultured in G-CSF at optimal concentrations (10 ng/ml). Treatment of cells with G-CSF has been shown to activate the Jak/Stat, MAPK (Erk1/2, JNK and p38), PI3-K, and Src family kinase cascades (2Avalos B.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 761-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of these signaling cascades has been associated with G-CSF-stimulated cell proliferation although each of these signaling events may also be uniquely involved in eliciting a specific cellular response to G-CSF (11Teglund S.

In this paper, we show that a novel MAPK family member Erk5 and its upstream activator MEK5 are activated upon G-CSF treatment of cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MEK5/Erk5 cascade positively regulates G-CSF-stimulated cell proliferation and survival. Although Erk5 has been shown to be activated by receptor-tyrosine kinases (33Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee D.-J. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 34Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), our data provide the first example that Erk5 pathway is critically implicated in cytokine receptor signal transduction and plays a central role in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival that are stimulated by G-CSF Erk5 activation by G-CSF is inhibited by pretreatment of cells with genistein, implying that protein-tyrosine kinases are involved in this process. It has been shown that significant cross talk occurs between distinct signal transduction pathways that are activated by a given cytokine. For instance, activation of Raf/Erk1/2 kinase signaling by both growth factors and interferons requires Jak2 or Jak1 (50Stancato L.S. Sakatsume M. David M. Dent P. Dong F. Petricoin E.F. Krolewski J.J. Silvernnoinen O. Saharinen P. Pierce J. Marshall C.J. Sturgill T. Finbloom D. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3833-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 51Sakatsume M.

We recently showed that G-CSF-induced activation of Akt requires the activity of Src family kinases whereas activation of Jaks appears to be not essential (38Dong F. Larner A.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 1656-1662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitor of Src family kinases PP1 (44Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar, 52Meng F. Lowell C.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4391-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) has no significant or only a minimal effect on Erk5 activation induced by G-CSF, suggesting that Src family kinases may not be critically involved in this activation process. It remains to be determined whether Jaks are required for G-CSF-stimulated activation of Erk5. In contrast to protein-tyrosine kinases, Erk5 activation in response to G-CSF is down-regulated by a PKC-dependent pathway. A recent report indicated that PKC activator PMA did not stimulate Erk5 activity, however, the role of PKC as a negative regulator of Erk5 activity was not examined (33Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee D.-J. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). PKC stimulates the activities of Erk1/2, JNK, and p38 (46Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22892-22898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, PMA activates Erk1/2 and strongly potentiates G-CSF-induced Erk1/2 activation. These data indicate that the PKC pathway, which has been shown to be activated by G-CSF (56Deshpande R.V. Peterson R.H. Moore M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), has differential effects on G-CSF-induced activation of Erk5 and Erk1/2. It is still unknown which PKC isoform(s) and by what mechanism the involved PKC isoform down-regulates G-CSF-stimulated Erk5 activation. The fact that G-CSF-mediated activation of MEK5 is also down-regulated by the PKC pathway indicates that either MEK5 itself or a more upstream molecule of the Erk5 signaling cascade is the target of regulation by PKC. The role of Erk5 in mediating cellular responses to extracellular stimuli is still unclear. Erk5 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate MEF2 family transcription factors including MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D (24Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.J. Han J. Ulevitch R. Lee J.-D. EMBO. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 27Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Pallante M. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell.

We have also observed that G-CSF stimulated MEF2A- and MEF2C-dependent luciferase reporters (data not shown). It was shown recently that Erk5 was required for EGF-stimulated cell proliferation and for Cot-induced transformation of NIH3T3 cells (30Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar,33Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee D.-J. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In transient transfection assays, we consistently observed that MEK5AA inhibited the proliferation of BAF/WT cells in response to G-CSF. Although the antiproliferative effects of MEK5AA appear modest, they are likely to be more dramatic than appreciated because only about 50% of cells are transfected under the conditions used for the assay (data not shown). In addition, expression of constitutively active MEK5DD significantly potentiated cell proliferation that was stimulated by suboptimal concentrations of G-CSF. Together, these data suggest that the MEK5/Erk5 pathway is positively involved in G-CSF-stimulated cell proliferation. More interestingly, our data also indicate that the MEK5/Erk5 pathway is an important mediator of the survival signals transduced by the G-CSF receptor. Expression of MEK5DD in BAF/WT cell protected cells from apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal and significantly reduced the concentrations of G-CSF required for inducing maximal cell survival. Notably, maximal survival of cells expressing MEK5DD required a G-CSF concentration of only 0.03 ng/ml whereas G-CSF at 0.1 ng/ml induced less than 40% of maximal proliferation of the same cells. It thus appears that the Erk5 pathway has a more significant effect on cell survival than on cell proliferation. Whether or not Erk5 is also implicated in the regulation of other biological activities of G-CSF remains to be investigated. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of the G-CSF receptor, a region required for induction of myeloid differentiation, plays an important role in the regulation of Erk5 activation in that truncation of this region markedly compromises the ability of the receptor to mediate Erk5 activation. In contrast, this carboxyl terminus does not play a major role in G-CSF-induced activation of Erk1/2, JNK, and p38. These results, together with the differential effects of PMA on Erk2 and Erk5 activation by G-CSF, suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in regulating G-CSF-induced activation of Erk5 and other members of the MAPK family. The results reported here provide a framework to explore the roles of Ekr5 and its downstream substrates in the biological actions of G-CSF.

Riboflavin synthase catalyzes a mechanistically complex dismutation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (Compound 1) affording riboflavin (Compound 3) and 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (Compound 4) (Fig. 1) (1Plaut G.W.E.

Stotz E.H. Comprehensive Biochemistry. Elsevier, Amsterdam1971: 11-45Google Scholar). The enzyme is a potential target for the chemotherapy of infections by Gram-negative bacteria which are unable to absorb riboflavin from the environment due to the absence of a transport system and are therefore absolutely dependent on its endogenous synthesis. Specifically, it has been shown that riboflavin-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium require riboflavin concentrations well above 10 mg/liter of culture medium (7Bandrin S.V. Beburov M.I.U. Rabinovich P.M. Stepanov A.I. Genetika. 1979; 15: 2063-2065PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang A. I Chuan Hsueh Pao. 1992; 19: 362-368Google Scholar). Similar levels of the vitamin are required for the growth of riboflavin-deficient mutants of the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida guilliermondii (9Oltmanns O. Lingens F. Z. Naturforsch.. Sect. B Chem. Sci. 1967; 22: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Logvinenko E.M. Shavlovsky G.M. Koltun L.V. Microbiology. 1972; 41: 978-979Google Scholar, 11Neuberger G. Bacher A.

Inhibitors of riboflavin biosynthesis may therefore also qualify as potential agents for the therapy of yeast infections, which are becoming progressively more important in immunocompromised patients. The riboflavin synthases of eubacteria and yeasts are homotrimeric proteins with an approximate subunit mass of 24 kDa. The sequence similarity between the N-terminal and C-terminal part of the enzyme suggested that each subunit folds into two domains with similar folding topology (12Schott K. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4204-4209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this hypothesis, preliminary crystallographic analysis of riboflavin synthase from E. coli provided evidence for pseudo d3 symmetry of the homotrimeric molecule (13Meining W. Tibbelin G. Ladenstein R. Eberhardt S. Fischer M. Bacher A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of the enzyme is incompletely understood despite the efforts of several research groups extending over a period of 4 decades (for review, see Refs. 6Plaut G.W. Smith C.M. Alworth W.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 899-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, and 14Bacher A. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Chemical Rubber & Co., Boca Raton, FL1991: 215-259Google Scholar). The dismutation reaction involves the transfer of a 4-carbon unit between the two identical substrate molecules and requires the simultaneous presence of two 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine molecules at the active site of the enzyme (15Beach R.L. Plaut G.W.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 2913-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Otto M.K. Bacher A. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9637-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is well in line with the hypothesis of two topologically similar folding domains and with the experimentally observed binding of two substrate molecules per enzyme subunit. Recently, the two-domain hypothesis received considerable support by the recombinant expression of N-terminal and C-terminal segments of riboflavin synthase from E. coli. Both recombinant proteins were shown to bind the intermediate analog, Compound 5, but not its diastereomer, Compound6 (Fig.2) 1S. Eberhardt, N. Zingler, K. Kemter, M. Cushman, and A. Bacher, submitted for publication.(19Goetz J.M. Poliks B. Studelska D.R. Fischer M. Kugelbrey K. Bacher A. Cushman M. Schaefer J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7500-7508Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal domain could bind riboflavin and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine with high affinity. Surprisingly, the N-terminal domain was found to form a homodimer in contrast to the heterotrimeric riboflavin synthase. The three-dimensional structure of riboflavin synthase is still unknown despite considerable efforts. Therefore, we decided to use systematic mutation analysis to identify catalytically relevant amino acid residues. 6,7-Bis(trifluoromethyl)-8-ribityllumazine hydrate (Compound 5) and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine were prepared by published procedures (20Cushman M.

Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany), Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany), or from Life Technologies, Inc. (Karlsruhe, Germany). T4 DNA ligase was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Karlsruhe, Germany). Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. (Karlsruhe, Germany) or MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany).

TheribC gene coding for riboflavin synthase of E. coli was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pERS (22Eberhardt S. Richter S. Gimbel W. Werner T. Bacher A. Eur. J.

The amplificate was purified, digested with XbaI and PstI, and ligated into plasmid pT7-7 (23Tabor S. Aususbel F.M. Breut R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Recombinant E. coli strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C in shaking flasks to an optical density of 0.7. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 0.5 mm, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −75 °C. A procedure modified after Mariniet al. (24Marini F.I.I.I. Naeem A. Lapeyre J.-N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2277-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used for site-directed mutagenesis. PCR was performed with Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany) to minimize the error rate. Plasmid pERS was used as template. The internal mismatch primers are shown in the Table I. The general scheme of mutagenic PCR involved two rounds of amplification cycles using one mismatch and two flanking primers (primers 1 and 2, Table I). During the first round, 5 amplification cycles were carried out with the respective mismatch primer and with one of the flanking primers. Then the second flanking primer was added and the reaction was continued for an 10 additional cycles. The amplificate was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, digested withXbaI and PstI, purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, and ligated into plasmid pT7-7 that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli XL1-blue cells (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Mutant clones were identified by the presence of the respective new restriction site. All plasmid constructs were sequenced by the automated dideoxynucleotide method (Sanger) using a 377 Prism DNA sequencer from Applied Biosystems (Weiterstadt, Germany). Purification procedures were performed at 4 °C, unless otherwise stated. Frozen cell mass (5 g) was thawed in 25 ml of 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). The suspension was subjected to ultrasonic treatment and was then centrifuged. The supernatant was dialyzed against 10 volumes of buffer A and centrifuged. The supernatant was passed through a column of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (2 × 18 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (flow rate, 1 ml min−1). The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A and developed with a linear gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl in buffer A (total volume, 280 ml). Riboflavin synthase was eluted from 200 to 240 ml. The enzyme fraction was brought to a concentration of 1 m(NH4)2SO4 by the slow addition of an equal volume of 2 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. The solution was passed through a column of phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (1.5 × 12 cm) pre-equilibrated with 1 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A (flow rate, 1 ml min−1). The column was washed with 40 ml of 1m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A and developed with a linear gradient of 1.0–0 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A (total volume, 120 ml). The enzyme was eluted from 80 to 95 ml. Fractions were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.9, containing 0.2 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer B). The dialyzed solution was stored at −75 °C. According to SDS−polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Läemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar), the protein samples contained less than 5% impurities. The oligomeric structure of mutant proteins was determined using a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel electrophoresis system as previously described (26Braun N. Tack J. Fischer M. Bacher A. Bachmann S. Weinkauf S. J. Crystal Growth. 2000; 212: 270-282Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined photometrically (ε280 = 47, 700 m−1 cm−1). Reaction rates were measured using a stopped-flow module SFM-4 and Diode Array Spectrometer (Bio-Logic, Claix, France) at 20 °C. All mixing solutions were prepared in buffer B. The reaction was initiated by rapid mixing of equal volumes of 8 μm enzyme solution and 25–160 μm 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine solution. The reference absorbance spectrum of 4 μm protein solution in reaction buffer was automatically subtracted from the experimental data. Absorbance spectra were collected and analyzed using Spectralys software from J&M Analytische Meß- und Regeltechnik GmbH (Aalen, Germany). Riboflavin concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient ε470 = 10,300 m−1cm−1. Equilibrium dialysis experiments were performed at 24 °C in buffer B using Dianorm microdialysis cells (Bachofer, Reutlingen, Germany) and Visking dialysis tubes (Medicell, London, United Kingdom). The protein concentration was 17 μm. The total ligand concentration was between 7.5 μm and 1.1 mm. The dialysis cells were allowed to equilibrate for 4 h under slow rotation. Control experiments had shown that the concentrations of Compound 5in the two parts of a microdialysis cell had reached equilibrium after 2 h of incubation. Ligand concentration was determined photometrically (ε340 = 7,943m−1 cm−1). Samples contained 20 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.9, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% D2O and protein (10.5−35.0 mg ml−1). Aliquots (5–30 μl) of 6,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)-8-ribityllumazine hydrate (epimer A) were added. After each addition, 19F NMR spectra were recorded at 338 MHz using an AM 360 NMR spectrometer from Bruker Instruments (Karlsruhe, Germany) at 24 °C. Experimental parameters were as follows: pulse angle, 30° (2 μs); repetition rate, 1.6 s; 32 K data set; 800 to 3000 scans. Chemical shifts were referenced to an external standard containing sodium trifluoroacetate, pH 7.0. The concentrations of bound and free ligands were calculated from19F NMR signal integrals. Plaut, Wood, and co-workers (4Paterson T. Wood H.C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1969; : 290-291Crossref Google Scholar, 15Beach R.L. Plaut G.W.E. J. Am. Chem.

Elsevier, Amsterdam1976: 737-746Google Scholar) had proposed a hypothetical mechanism for riboflavin synthase involving the initial addition of a nucleophile to the lumazine molecule serving as donor of the 4-C unit which is transferred between the two substrate molecules in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction (Fig. 1). More specifically, this hypothetical nucleophile could be either a water molecule or a polar amino acid residue. To check this hypothesis, we decided to mutate polar amino acid residues in search of the hypothetical nucleophile thought to be involved in covalent catalysis. Sequence comparison of all known or presumed riboflavin synthases of the fungal/eubacterial type showed that the similarity between the proteins from different species was relatively low (data not shown). More specifically, the enzymes from E. coli and the closely related Hemeophilus influenzae share 63% identical amino acid residues. Otherwise, the fraction of identical amino acids was in the range of 29 to 38%. The sequence comparison revealed 11 polar amino acid residues that were absolutely conserved (Fig. 3). Moreover, several other amino acids (Ser41, Asn45, Thr50, Thr67, Thr71, Asn83, Tyr133, Lys137, and Asp143) were rarely replaced. All these residues were selected for mutagenesis. In light of the relatively low overall conservation of the riboflavin synthase sequence, it was most notable that all enzymes invariably had the N-terminal sequence MFXG. A functional role of this sequence segment appeared likely, and it was therefore included in the mutagenesis study. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed by PCR and generated mutant genes were checked for sequence accuracy by restriction analysis of novel restriction sites and by full-length sequence analysis. Five mutated genes (C48S, T50R, T67R, T148R, and T165R) could not be expressed in recombinant E. coli strains. It was tentatively assumed that the mutated amino acid residues affected the folding and overall conformation rather than the active site of the enzyme, and the respective mutant genes were not studied in more detail. Four mutant genes (Y133A, D143G, D143N, and N181G) (TableI) afforded soluble proteins that were too unstable to be purified. One mutant gene (T3R) could be expressed to a level around 3% of cellular protein in recombinant E. coli host strains. All other mutant genes listed in Table I could be expressed to a level of ∼20% of cellular protein and were purified to a level of at least 95%. The migration properties of all mutants as well as the wild type enzyme, in gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions were very similar (data not shown). The catalytic activity of the mutant proteins was studied by single turnover experiments using a stopped-flow photometer. The respective mutant protein and the substrate, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, were rapidly mixed at a molar ratio of 6:1 to 20:1 and the absorbency at 470 nm was recorded. At this wavelength, the absorbency contribution of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine is low, and the recorded signal is dominated by the concentration of riboflavin formed. The maximal rate of riboflavin formation (V max) in the case of the wild type enzyme was 21 nmol mg−1 min−1(Table II), which is equivalent to a turnover number of 0.5 per min and subunit.Table IIProperties of riboflavin synthase mutantsProteinV maxK D of the low affinity binding site to Compound 5nmol mg−1 min−1μmWild type21 ± 3.441 ± 12F2A<0.000179 ± 15F2Δ<0.000157 ± 14F2Y0.42 ± 0.0887 ± 7.2T3R17 ± 5.66 ± 2.1S41A0.003 ± 0.00125 ± 8N45G17 ± 4.28.5 ± 1.4E66G3.8 ± 0.44.2 ± 1.1T71A20 ± 7.291 ± 18N83G15 ± 1.410 ± 3.1E85G11 ± 2.110 ± 1.2H97Q8.4 ± 0.85.0 ± 1.2H102Q0.08 ± 0.03103 ± 13K137A2.8 ± 0.316 ± 3.5S146G2.7 ± 0.117 ± 2.1E183G11 ± 0.214 ± 1.7D185L1.4 ± 0.112 ± 3.3Values are mean ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Values are mean ± S.E. A substantial number of absolutely or highly conserved, polar amino acid residues could be exchanged without significant impact on the catalytic rate. Thus, the replacement of residues Thr3, Asn45, Glu66, Thr71, Asn83, Glu85, His97, Lys137, Ser146, and Glu183 decreased the reaction velocity by less than 10-fold (Table II). The replacement of serine 41 by alanine was accompanied by a substantial reduction in catalytic capacity.V max decreased to 3 pmol mg−1min−1. Similarly, the replacement of histidine 102 by glutamine afforded a mutant protein with a decreasedV max of 83 pmol mg−1min−1. The replacement of the absolutely conserved phenylalanine 2 by alanine afforded soluble protein that had no detectable catalytic activity. No riboflavin whatsoever could be observed even after long-term incubation with substrate. Similarly, the deletion of phenylalanine 2 resulted in the complete loss of catalytic activity. The more conservative replacement of phenylalanine by tyrosine decreasedV max of the enzyme 50-fold, to 0.42 nmol mg−1 min−1. In the absence of protein structural data, we decided to perform protein perturbation studies to characterize the interaction of the mutant proteins with a ligand that binds to the catalytic site of riboflavin synthase. The fluorinated Compounds 5 and 6 have been used extensively in ligand binding studies with riboflavin synthase and lumazine synthase of Bacillus subtilis (17Scheuring J. Fischer M. Cushman M. Lee J. Bacher A. Oschkinat H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9637-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Cushman M. Patrick D.A. Bacher A. Scheuring J. J. Org.

Fluorine substitution favors the covalent hydration of the pteridine ring system to such an extent that the diasteromeric Compounds 5 and 6are not subject to epimerization. The covalent hydrate structure mimics the hypothetical intermediate, Compound 2, in the reaction mechanism proposed by Plaut, Wood, and co-workers (Fig. 1) (4Paterson T. Wood H.C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1969; : 290-291Crossref Google Scholar, 15Beach R.L. Plaut G.W.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 2913-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,27Plaut G.W.E. Beach R. Singer T.P. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1976: 737-746Google Scholar). Riboflavin synthase of B. subtilis has been shown to bind Compound 5 at a molar ratio of 1:1 per subunit (17Scheuring J. Fischer M. Cushman M. Lee J. Bacher A. Oschkinat H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9637-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Cushman M. Patrick D.A. Bacher A. Scheuring J. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 4603-4608Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Binding of Compound 5 to the enzyme was accompanied by downfield shifts of the19F NMR signals of both trifluoromethyl groups. Compound 6 (epimer B) could not be bound even at high concentration (20Cushman M. Patrick D.A. Bacher A. Scheuring J. J. Org. Chem. 1991; 56: 4603-4608Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A titration experiment performed with E. coli riboflavin synthase and Compound 5 is shown in Fig.4. Aliquots of the ligand were added, and19F NMR spectra were recorded after each addition. At the early stages of the titration experiment (Fig. 4, a andb), the 19F NMR signals of the free ligand are very low in intensity, and the spectra are dominated by the signals of the enzyme-bound ligand. With progressive saturation of the enzyme's binding sites, the signals of the free ligand increase. The position 7 trifluoromethyl group of the enzyme-bound ligand appears as a relatively broad signal with a line width of 180 Hz which is 1.4 ppm downfield shifted by comparison with the signal of the free ligand. The position 6 trifluoromethyl group of the enzyme-bound ligand affords a more complex signal pattern. At low ligand concentrations (Fig.4 a), a relatively intense signal with a line width of 160 Hz is observed at 14.2 ppm and a signal of lower intensity with a line width of 90 Hz at 15.7 ppm. The latter signal increases with progressive addition of ligand, thus suggesting that the enzyme has two different types of binding sites whose affinities to Compound5 differ significantly (TableIII).Table IIIChemical shifts of Compound 5 bound to E. coli riboflavin synthase or riboflavin synthase domainsProteinsChemical shift (ppm)6-CF3group7-CF3 groupWild type14.215.6−5.9−5.7F2Δ13.513.9−6.2−7.1F2A13.813.8−6.1−7.2F2Y14.315.2−6.3−7.0K137A14.2, 13.615.7−6.2−5.8S146G13.415.8−6.5−5.8E183G14.115.1, 15.6−5.9−6.4N-terminal domain15.6−6.4C-terminal domain14.1−5.5Binding site affinityHighLowHighLow Open table in a new tab The quantitative evaluation of the signal integrals afforded the nonlinear Scatchard plot shown in Fig.5 A. Besides the experimental values obtained from the NMR titration, the plot shows experimental values obtained by equilibrium dialysis. The data obtained by the two different experimental methods fit a model with ∼3.2 high affinity sites (K D = 2.0 μm) and 2.5 low affinity sites (K D = 41 μm) per enzyme molecule. Incidentally, it should be noted that the separate evaluation of the NMR signal integrals affords a K D value of 30 μm for the low affinity site (Fig. 5 B). These data are well in line with our recent finding that the recombinant N-terminal and C-terminal domains of E. coliriboflavin synthase can both bind Compound 5 (Fig. 4, TableIII). 1The abbreviations used are:PCRpolymerase chain reaction The comparison between the spectra of the wild type enzyme and the domains suggests tentatively that the ligand signal at 15.7 ppm is associated with the N-terminal domain of the wild type enzyme, whereas the signal at 14.2 ppm is associated with the C-terminal domain. polymerase chain reaction Titration experiments with Compound 5 were performed with all mutants listed in Table II. In most cases, the spectra were qualitatively similar to that obtained with the wild type enzyme.K D values obtained from 19F NMR titration differ from that of the wild type enzyme by less than a factor of 10 (Table II) and the number of ligand molecules bound per protein molecule (trimer) varied from 5.2 to 6.3 (relative standard error, 6–15%). The few exceptional cases are discussed in detail below. An NMR titration experiment with the catalytically inactive F2Δ mutant with a deletion of phenylalanine 2 is shown in Fig.6. The position 7 trifluoromethyl group of the bound ligand affords two signals with a distance of 0.9 ppm, respectively (Table III). On the other hand, the signals of the position 6 trifluoromethyl group are located very close to each other with a distance of 0.4 ppm (Fig. 6). The signal pattern suggests that the mutant retains the capacity to bind one ligand molecule each to the N-terminal and C-terminal domain. The signals of the ligand molecule assumed to represent the ligand bound to the N terminus are shifted upfield (by 1.7 ppm for the 6 trifluoromethyl group and 1.4 ppm for the position 7 trifluoromethyl group) by comparison with the wild type enzyme (Table III). Titration experiments with the F2Δ mutant indicate that the different binding sites bind the ligand with different affinity (Table III). The low affinity site is characterized by a dissociation constant of 57 μm. The dissociation constant for the high affinity site cannot be measured accurately for experimental reasons (the NMR signals of the free ligand are too small to be integrated in the early titration steps; the value of the dissociation constant is estimated to be less than 1 μm). The F2A mutant is very similar to the F2Δ mutant. It is catalytically inactive, and it modulates the NMR spectrum of Compound 5 in the same way as the deletion mutant (Table III). However, the conservative replacement of phenylalanine 2 by tyrosine affords a catalytically active protein (Table II) whose interactions with Compound 5 are similar to that of the wild type protein. Apart from the phenylalanine 2 modifications, only a small number of mutations analyzed in this study were conducive to substantial modification of the interaction with Compound 5 (Table III, Fig. 7). In two cases (K137A and S146G), the catalytic activity was reduced by approximately 1 order of magnitude, whereas the E183G mutant had almost normal catalytic activity. In all three mutants, two signals are clearly resolved for the position 7 CF3 group of the enzyme bound ligand. In the case of S146G mutant, the signal of the position 6 CF3group assumed to represent the ligand in association with the C-terminal domain is shifted upfield by comparison with the wild type enzyme. In the K137A and E183G mutants, there is tentative evidence for three enzyme bound species giving rise to additional signals for the position 6 CF3 group. Comparison of the NMR chemical shift values shown in Table IIIindicates that, except of Glu183, replacements of other amino acids in N- or C-teminal halves of riboflavin synthase affected exclusively (Lys137 and Ser146) or largely (Phe2) the NMR pattern afforded by the ligand molecule bound to the same half of the protein. The fact that all mutations listed in Table III have a visible effect on the appearance of the 6- and 7-trifluoromethyl groups of the ligand, relative to the wild type enzyme, suggests that residues 2, 137, 146, and 183 may be in close proximity to the ligand and to each other. The reaction catalyzed by riboflavin synthase involves the cleavage of two CN bonds and the formation of two CC bonds. It appears obvious that the reaction trajectory must involve a complex series of intermediates. Surprisingly, however, the reaction can proceed without enzyme catalysis under relatively mild conditions in aqueous solution (30Rowan T. Wood H.C.S. Proc. Chem. Soc. 1963; : 21-22Google Scholar). Notably, the catalyzed and the uncatalyzed reactions share the same regiospecificity (4Paterson T. Wood H.C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1969; : 290-291Crossref Google Scholar, 15Beach R.L.

In the uncatalyzed reaction, a water molecule could serve this purpose. Either a water molecule or a polar amino acid side chain could serve as a nucleophile in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The protein perturbation data provide evidence for the existence of two different types of binding sites whose affinities for Compound5 differ by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Evidence for two different types of binding sites had been obtained earlier by studies with riboflavin synthase from B. subtilis and 6-trifluoromethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine (16Otto M.K. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Cushman M. Patel H.H. Scheuring J. Bacher A. J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 5630-5643Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the19F NMR spectra produced by Compound 5 in this case not only differed substantially from those shown in Fig. 4, but also gave the molar ratio of 1:1 of bound ligand per subunit, indicating that only one type of binding site could bind the ligand.E. coli and B. subtilis proteins share only 33% identical amino acids (data not shown), so the structural difference between the ligand-binding sites of these two enzymes that leads to the different NMR signal pattern seems plausible. We have shown recently that the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the riboflavin synthase of E. coli can be expressed as recombinant proteins.1 Specifically, the N-terminal domain was shown to form a relatively stable, soluble homodimer whereas the full-length riboflavin synthase forms a homotrimer. The recombinant C-terminal domain has comparatively low stability and could not be obtained in pure form. Both recombinant domains were shown to bind Compound 5 by protein perturbation experiments similar to those reported in the present study. A comparison of the chemical shift values indicates that binding of Compound 5 to the N-terminal domain is associated with a relatively large downfield shift of the position 6 trifluoromethyl signal whereas the binding to the C-terminal domain has a more pronounced effect on the signals from the position 7 trifluoromethyl group. The replacement of serine 41 or histidine 102 reduced the catalytic activity of the enzyme by several orders of magnitude. The mutations did not decrease substantially the affinity of the enzyme for the putative intermediate analog, Compound 5. Moreover, the mutations appeared to have little impact on the environment of enzyme-bound Compound 5 as gleaned by 19F NMR spectrometry. If either of these amino acids were involved in covalent catalysis, the residual activity of the mutant proteins could be due to a water molecule replacing the amino acid nucleophile. Whereas the data are insufficient to prove a direct catalytic role of serine 41 or histidine 102, they rule out covalent catalysis by any of the other polar amino acid residues addressed in the present mutagenesis study. Whereas this study was primarily focused on conserved polar amino acid residues, the inclusion of the lipophilic N terminus appeared mandatory in light of the absolute conservation of the terminal MFXG motif. Deletion or nonconservative replacement of phenylalanine 2 afforded completely inactive proteins. Although these mutants could still bind two lumazine-type molecules, the chemical shifts of the ligand bound at the putative N-terminal-binding site were modulated significantly. This finding suggests that the N terminus of the polypeptide forms an essential part of the active site."
https://openalex.org/W2144504691,"The Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell subset, which represents up to 90% of the circulating gammadelta T cells in humans, was shown to be activated, via the T cell receptor (TcR), by non-peptidic phosphorylated small organic molecules. These phosphoantigens, which are not presented by professional antigen-presenting cells, induce production of high amounts of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha). To date, the specific signals triggered by these antigens have not been characterized. Here we analyze proximal and later intracellular signals triggered by isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), a mycobacterial antigen that specifically stimulates Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells, and compare these to signals induced by the non-physiological model using an anti-CD3 antibody. During antigenic stimulation we noticed that, except for the proximal p56(lck) signal, which is triggered early, the signals appear to be delayed and highly sustained. This delay, which likely accounts for the delay observed in TNF-alpha production, is discussed in terms of the ability of the antigen to cross-link and recruit transducing molecules mostly anchored to lipid rafts. Moreover, we demonstrate that, in contrast to anti-CD3 antibody, IPP does not induce down-modulation of the TcR.CD3 complex, which likely results in the highly sustained signaling and release of high levels of TNF-alpha."

By contrast, secretion is reduced when PKC activity is down-regulated by 24-h pretreatment with phorbol esters (5Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. O'Sullivan A.J.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). In this model, a Ca2+-independent core complex is formed between plasma membrane protein syntaxin and SNAP-25 and the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin/VAMP. Vesicular synaptotagmin is identified as a low affinity Ca2+ sensor for subsequent exocytosis (17Chapman E.R. Hansen P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Additional evidence suggests thattrans-SNARE pairing may precede membrane fusion but is not be required during fusion (18Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 19Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 20Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33667-33673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, the preceding interaction of SNAP-25 with syntaxin is found to enhance the interaction between syntaxin and synaptobrevin/VAMP, suggesting that SNAP-25 regulates the formation of the SNARE complex (22Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been reported that the phosphorylation of SNAP-25 by PKC actually decreases the interaction between syntaxin and SNAP-25. Thus, PKC makes the formation of the SNARE complex less likely. These data therefore suggest that the positive action of PKC on exocytosis is not likely to be mediated by SNARE proteins (23Shimazaki Y. Nishiki T. Omori A. Sekiguchi M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14548-14553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Alternatively, annexins have also been considered as possible mediators of exocytosis. Annexin 1 (ANX1), annexin 2 (ANX2), and annexin 7 (ANX7), which are members of the annexin family, have the ability to aggregate and fuse lipid vesicles (24Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Such a result has been interpreted to suggest that they might play a role in regulating membrane fusion. Indeed, both ANX1 and ANX2 are found to be phosphorylated by PKC both in vivo (25Michener M.L. Dawson W.B. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Isacke C.M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25976-25981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of these proteins by PKC markedly inhibits their aggregation and fusion activities in vitro (27Wang W. Creutz C.E.

Rojas E. Burns A.L. Prog. Brain Res. 1992; 92: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), has properties that have led us to give fuller credence to the possibility of its involvement in exocytosis. We have recently reported that ANX7 is a Ca2+-activated GTPase, both in vitro andin vivo, and that its GTPase activity is increased in secreting chromaffin cells (34Caohuy H. Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10797-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). More recently, we have reported that the heterozygous knockout anx7 (+/−) mouse suffers from an insulin secretion deficit from islets of Langerhans, as well as defective Ca2+ signaling processes in β-cells (35Srivastava M. Atwater I. Glasman M. Leighton X. Goping G. Caohuy H. Miller G. Pichel J. Westphal H. Mears D. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13783-13788Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, a homology analysis of anx7 has suggested to us the likelihood that this protein might be a target for PKC (36Hauptmann R. Maurerfogy I. Krystek E. Bodo G. Andree H. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and, therefore, a candidate for mediation of PKC action during exocytosis. In this study, we report that ANX7 is phosphorylated in stimulated bovine chromaffin cells, and the level of ANX 7 phosphorylation is well correlated with the release of catecholamines. ANX7 is also phosphorylated in vitro by various kinases, including PKC, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), and protein-tyrosine kinase pp60c-src. Significantly, only PKC-dependent phosphorylation of ANX7 enhances the membrane fusion activity of the protein, whereas phosphorylation by other kinases does not affect this activity, or may even decrease it, as in the case of pp60c-src. Thus, the selective activation by PKC on exocytosis in vivo and the activation of ANX7 membrane fusion in vitro suggests that ANX7 may act as a positive mediator of PKC for the exocytotic membrane fusion reaction in chromaffin cells. Chromaffin cells were isolated from bovine adrenal glands by collagenase digestion and purified on a Percoll gradient as described previously (37Brocklehurst K.W. Pollard H.B. Hutton J.C. Siddle K. Peptide Hormones : A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1990: 233-255Google Scholar). Isolated cells were further purified by a selective plating method (38Yanagihara N. Isosaki M. Ohuchi T. Oka M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 105: 296-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and maintained in a CO2 incubator under 5% CO2/95% air. Cultured chromaffin cells (5 × 106/dish, Falcon, 35 mm) were labeled with [33P]Pi (0.1 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in phosphate-free Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 8 h at 37 °C (39Tsutsui M. Yanagihara N. Miyamoto E. Kuroiwa A. Izumi F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1041-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Then, the cells were washed once with Ca2+-free extracellular buffer A (buffer B without 2.2 mm CaCl2 added). The cells were stimulated with extracellular buffer B (118 mmNaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 2.2 mm CaCl2) containing 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; ICN), 100 μm carbachol (Sigma) or 10 μm nicotine (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were rapidly washed twice with buffer A and then solubilized in lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation. For experiments with PKC inhibitors, 33P-labeled cells were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C with or without staurosporine (50, 100, and 200 nm, Calbiochem), calphostine C (50 and 500 nm; Calbiochem), or chelerythrine (0.7 and 1.0 μm, Calbiochem) in buffer A. The cells were then stimulated for 30 min with 100 nm PMA, 100 μmcarbachol, or 10 μm nicotine, followed by cell lysis for immunoprecipitation. Control experiments were performed using cells incubated with buffer B or buffer B containing Me2SO (for experiments using Me2SO-soluble compounds,e.g. PMA, staurosporine, calphostine C, and chelerythrine). For determining catecholamine secretion under the above conditions, parallel experiments were carried out using unlabeled chromaffin cells, and the media were then collected for measuring catecholamine concentrations. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5)), followed by incubation for 20 min on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting lysates were precleared by incubation for 30 min with 50 μl of a 10% (v/v) suspension of protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by centrifugation. The final lysates, with equal protein amounts determined by a BCA kit (Pierce), were then incubated with 10 μg of anti-ANX7 monoclonal antibody 10E7 for 6 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein G-Sepharose, washed four times by pelleting in cold lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by phosphorimaging (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics) or autoradiography. The assay for catecholamine release from chromaffin cells was performed exactly as described previously (37Brocklehurst K.W. Pollard H.B. Hutton J.C. Siddle K. Peptide Hormones : A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1990: 233-255Google Scholar). The release of catecholamines was expressed as a percentage of total cellular catecholamines. PS lipid vesicles were prepared fresh daily by the swelling method (40Reeves J. Dowben R. Cell. Physiol. 1968; 78: 49-60Google Scholar). Briefly, highly purified (>99%) brain phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids) in a 1:4 chloroform-methanol solution was dried slowly under nitrogen and then allowed to swell in 0.3 m sucrose at room temperature. The suspension was then sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The PS lipid vesicle pellet was resuspended in 0.3 m sucrose solution. Human recombinant ANX7 was isolated and purified as described previously (41Burns A.L. Magendzo K. Srivastava M. Rojas E. Parra C. de la Fuente M. Cultraro C. Shirvan A. Vogel T. Heldman J. Caohuy H. Tombaccini D. Pollard H.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1118-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli bacteria containing the anx7-expressing vector (pTrc-FLS) were grown in 1 liter of Luria broth at 37 °C. After reaching an A540 level of 0.6, the culture was incubated overnight in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (ICN). After incubation, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. Expressed recombinant ANX7 was then extracted from the E. coli paste, concentrated by precipitation with 0–20% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 and purified by gel filtration using Ultragel AcA54 (Biosphere). Partial purified ANX7 was further purified by binding to PS lipid vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ and extracting with EGTA. This purification step was repeated six times to finally yield a highly purified (≥98%) ANX7 preparation, determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. All phosphorylation assays using purified rat brain PKC were performed at 30 °C in a final volume of 30 μl as described elsewhere (42Uchida T. Filburn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12311-12314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain PKC with a purity of ≥95% was purchased from Calbiochem and contained the PKC isoforms α, β, and γ. Phosphorylation of ANX7 by PKC was examined at different pH values, and the reaction mixture contained the following: 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm PIPES (pH 6.8) or 25 mm MES (pH 6.1), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 nm PMA, 400 μg/ml PS liposomes, 0.05 unit (0.035 μg) of PKC, and 0.25 μg of purified human recombinant ANX7. All reactions were then incubated for 30 min. In other assays to determine the conditions of ANX7 phosphorylation, 0.25 μg of ANX7 was incubated for 60 min with or without 0.05 unit of PKC in 25 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgCl2, and the following conditions: no lipid or Ca2+ added; 1 mmCa2+ added, without lipid; lipid added, without Ca2+; or both Ca2+ and lipid added. These conditions were also examined in the presence of 100 nmPMA. To determine the mole ratio of ANX7 phosphorylation by PKC, ANX7 (0.25 μg) was incubated for the indicated time periods with 0.05 unit of PKC under the optimal phosphorylation condition (25 mmPIPES (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 100 nm PMA, and 400 μg/ml PS liposomes). In the assay to determine the optimal ANX7 concentration for phosphorylation, ANX7 (0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg) was incubated for 60 min with 0.05 unit of PKC under the optimal phosphorylation condition. The reactions containing 1 μg ANX7 were further incubated for 90, 120, and 160 min. In the assay to determine ANX7 phosphorylation as a function of Ca2+ concentration, ANX7 (0.25 μg) was incubated for 30 min with 0.05 unit of PKC in 25 mm MES (pH 6.1) or 25 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 nm PMA, 400 μg/ml PS liposomes, and the different free Ca2+ concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 mm). Free Ca2+ concentrations were determined as described (43Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-465PubMed Google Scholar). The above reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP in a final concentration of 0.1 mm (3000–4000 cpm/pmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and stopped by the addition of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The phosphorylation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis or autoradiography. As for ANX7 phosphorylation by PKA, PKG, and pp60c-src, the assays were carried out at 30 °C in a final volume of 30 μl as described (44Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjore J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S.

Purified human recombinant ANX7 (0.25 μg) was incubated for 30 min with 10 units of pp60c-src (Calbiochem (44Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjore J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)), 50 units of catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega (45Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)) or 200 units of PKG (Promega (46Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) plus 10 μm cGMP in 25 mm MES (pH 6.1), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2. All phosphorylation reactions were initiated and analyzed as described above for the PKC reactions. The phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (47Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). After autoradiography, labeled ANX7 bands were excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and then electroeluted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The eluate was dialyzed overnight in water to remove SDS. The dialysate was concentrated by lyophilization and was then resuspended in 6n HCl, followed by incubation at 110 °C for 2 h.O-Phosphoserine, O-phosphothreonine, andO-phosphotyrosine (Sigma Chemical Co.) at 5 mmeach were added to the sample, and a 5-μl aliquot was spotted on a thin layer cellulose plate (Merck), followed by electrophoresis at 1 kV for 30 min in a pH 3.5 buffer (pyridine/acetic acid/water, 1:33:40, v/v). Unlabeled phosphoamino acids were stained with ninhydrin (0.2% in acetone), and labeled phosphoamino acids were detected using the PhosphorImager. Extraction of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated protein from lipid vesicles was performed as described (29Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25976-25981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each of 30 reactions, 1 μg of ANX7 was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with 0.05 unit of PKC in 25 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 nm PMA, 400 μg/ml PS liposomes, and 0.1 mm ATP in a final volume of 30 μl. Unphosphorylated ANX7 was treated in a similar manner as described for phosphorylated ANX7, except ATP was omitted. All reactions were pooled and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet, containing lipid and lipid-associated ANX7, was resuspended in 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm EGTA, and 20 mm EDTA. The mixture was sonicated in a bath type sonicator and then incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g. The supernatant, containing ANX7, was collected and recentrifuged twice to remove residual lipid vesicles. After removing EGTA and EDTA, the concentration of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ANX7 was determined by immunoblotting using 125I-labeled secondary antibody and a known amount of ANX7 as a standard, and quantitated with the PhosphorImager. A parallel experiment using [γ-33P]ATP was also carried out to determine the stoichiometry of phosphorylation. The PS lipid vesicle fusion assay was performed as previously described (37Brocklehurst K.W. Pollard H.B. Hutton J.C. Siddle K. Peptide Hormones : A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1990: 233-255Google Scholar). Lipid vesicles were first diluted to an A540 of 0.6 in fusion reaction buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 40 mm histidine (pH 6.1), 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mmEGTA). Phosphorylated or unphosphorylated ANX7 (0.5 μg) was incubated with 0.5 ml of lipid vesicle suspension in a final volume of 1 ml of fusion reaction buffer. Fusion was initiated by the addition of 1 mm [Ca2+]final and then measured by the change in the turbidity at absorbance of 540 nm (A540) using a recording Hewlett-Packard spectrophotometer for 20 min at room temperature. For the Ca2+-dependent lipid vesicle fusion reaction mediated by phosphorylated or unphosphorylated ANX7, similar reactions were carried out as described above. Fusion was initiated by the addition of the indicated final Ca2+ concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.4, and 1 mm) and then monitored spectrophotometrically for 20 min. Free Ca2+ concentrations were determined as described elsewhere (43Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-465PubMed Google Scholar) and verified using a Ca2+-selective electrode. Simultaneous phosphorylation and lipid vesicle fusion reactions were carried out as described elsewhere (29Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25976-25981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction in a final volume of 1 ml contained 1 μg of ANX7, 0.5 unit of PKC, 0.3 m sucrose, 40 mm histidine (pH 6.1), 2 mmMgCl2, 100 nm PMA, 100 μm ATP, and 0.5 ml of lipid vesicle suspension. Controls were carried out in the absence of added ATP. Fusion and phosphorylation were simultaneously initiated by the addition of 1 mm[Ca2+]final at room temperature. Fusion was measured for 30 min as described above. To confirm that ANX7 phosphorylation occurred during fusion, parallel experiments were carried out in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP, and the stoichiometry was measured as described above. Fusion and phosphorylation reactions in the presence of other kinases were carried out as described for PKC experiments above, except no PMA was added and PKC was replaced by 2000 units of PKG (plus 10 μm cGMP), 500 units of PKAcat, or 100 units of pp60c-src. Data are presented as means ± S.D. A relationship between ANX7 phosphorylation and catecholamine secretion was assessed by a linear regression analysis (yaxis, mean value of ANX7 phosphorylation induced by PMA, carbachol, or nicotine, and inhibited by various PKC inhibitors; x axis, mean value of catecholamine secretion under similar conditions as in phosphorylation). The statistical significant values (p) were determined by using Student's t test. Using intact bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, we investigated whether ANX7 is phosphorylated under a variety of pro-secretory conditions, including treatment with PMA, carbachol, and nicotine. In these experiments, 33P-labeled cells were stimulated for 30 min with 100 nm PMA, 100 μm carbachol, 10 μm nicotine, or extracellular buffer B (control), and labeled endogenous ANX7 was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 10E7, followed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. As shown in Fig.1 (AI and BI), stimulation of cells with buffer B (control) results in a small amount of 33P incorporation into ANX7. In contrast, labeling of ANX7 is markedly increased by about 3- to 5-fold for all agonists tested (Fig. 1, AI (bar 2) and BI (bars 2 and 5)). As a further test for the involvement of PKC in the phosphorylation process, we examined whether the in vivo phosphorylation of ANX7 could be inhibited by various PKC inhibitors prior to stimulation with PMA or with other secretagogues. For these experiments we chose not only the relatively nonselective staurosporine (48Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar) but also the more selective calphostine C (49Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) and chelerythrine (50Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 AI, all three inhibitors substantially reduce labeling of immunoprecipitated ANX7 from cells stimulated with 100 nm PMA. Staurosporine, at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 nm, causes 35 ± 5, 54 ± 3, and 64 ± 7% inhibition of ANX7 labeling (mean ± S.D., n = 3), respectively (bars 3–5). In addition, calphostine C, at concentrations of 50 and 500 nm, causes 48 ± 7 and 64 ± 3% inhibition of ANX7 labeling, respectively (bars 6 and 7), whereas chelerythrine, at concentrations of 0.7 and 1 μm, also causes 42 ± 11 and 58 ± 16% inhibition of ANX7 labeling, respectively (bars 8 and9). Furthermore, calphostine C and chelerythrine both also cause a substantial reduction in labeling of immuno-precipitated ANX7 from cells stimulated with carbachol or nicotine (Fig. 1 BI). In these experiments, 50 nm calphostine C and 0.7 μm chelerythrine cause 44 ± 2 and 45 ± 7% inhibition in carbachol-induced labeling of ANX7, respectively (bars 3 and 4), and these two inhibitors at the same concentrations also cause 46 ± 6 and 49 ± 4% inhibition in nicotine-induced labeling of ANX7, respectively (bars 6 and 7). We further examined whether phosphorylation of ANX7 in vivocould be correlated with catecholamine secretion under the above conditions. Unlabeled cells were preincubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of 100 nm staurosporine, 50 nm calphostine C, or 0.7 μm chelerythrine. The cells were then stimulated with or without 100 nm PMA, 100 μm, or 10 μm nicotine fo"
https://openalex.org/W1963819396,"Ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBPs) are characterized by a conserved core domain with surrounding divergent sequences, particularly at the N-terminal end. We previously cloned two isoforms of a testis UBP, UBP-t1 and UBP-t2, which contain identical core regions but distinct N termini that target the two isoforms to different subcellular locations (Lin, H., Keriel, A., Morales, C. R., Bedard, N., Zhao, Q., Hingamp, P., Lefrancois, S., Combaret, L., and Wing, S. S. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. 20, 6568–6578). To determine whether the N termini also influence the biochemical functions of the UBP, we expressed UBP-t1, UBP-t2, and the common core domain, UBP core, in Escherichia coli. The three isoforms cleaved branched triubiquitin at >20-fold faster rates than linear diubiquitin, suggesting that UBP-testis functions as an isopeptidase. Both N-terminal extensions inhibited the ability of UBP-core to generate free ubiquitin when linked in a peptide bond with itself, another peptide, or to small adducts. The N-terminal extension of UBP-t2 increased the ability of UBP-core to cleave branched triubiquitin. UBP-core removed ubiquitin from testis ubiquitinated proteins more rapidly than UBP-t2 and UBP-t1. Thus, UBP enzymes appear to contain a catalytic core domain, the activities and specificities of which can be modulated by N-terminal extensions. These divergent N termini can alter localization and confer multiple functions to the various members of the large UBP family.

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 3Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Proteins destined to be degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are first covalently ligated with ubiquitin, a 76-amino acid peptide. This reaction involves the sequential action of three enzymes. Ubiquitin is first activated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)1 (4Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is then transferred to a specific cysteine residue of one of a family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) (5Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although some E2s can transfer ubiquitin to substrates directly in vitro, most E2s support ubiquitin conjugation to substrates by interaction with one of the many ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s) (6Peters J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 7Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 8Reiss Y. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10378-10383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These E2/E3 enzymes form an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of ubiquitin and the ε-amino group of the side chain of lysine residues of the target protein. A branched polyubiquitin chain is then formed on the protein through the ligation of additional monomers of ubiquitin to the side chain of a lysine residue of the previous ubiquitin in successive rounds of ubiquitination (5Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The covalent attachment of a polyubiquitin chain to proteins generally acts as a signal for their degradation by a multisubunit protease, the 26 S proteasome (9Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 10Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fu H. Larsen C.N. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Vierstra R. Baumeister W. Fried V. Finley D. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 21-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the families of enzymes involved in conjugation of ubiquitin, a very large family of deubiquitinating enzymes has recently been identified from various organisms (reviewed in Refs. 11Chung C.H. Baek S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 13D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These enzymes have several possible functions. First, they may have peptidase activity and cleave the products of ubiquitin genes. Ubiquitin is encoded by two distinct classes of genes. One is a polyubiquitin gene, which encodes a linear polymer of ubiquitins linked through peptide bonds between the C-terminal Gly and N-terminal Met of contiguous ubiquitin molecules (14Ozkaynak E. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1984; 312: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Each copy of ubiquitin must be released by precise cleavage of the peptide bond between Gly-76–Met-1 of successive ubiquitin moieties (15Falquet L. Paquet N. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Hoang-Van K. Jaton J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The other class of ubiquitin genes encodes ubiquitin C-terminal extension proteins, which are peptide bond fusions between the C-terminal Gly of ubiquitin and N-terminal Met of the extension protein (16Finley D. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 338: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 17Redman K.L. Rechsteiner M. Nature. 1989; 338: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Barrio R. del Arco A. Cabrera H.L. Arribas C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To date, the extensions described are ribosomal proteins consisting of 52 or 76–80 amino acids (19Redman K.L. Burris G.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Baker R.T. Board P.G. Genomics. 1992; 14: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These ubiquitin fusion proteins are processed to yield ubiquitin and the corresponding C-terminal extension proteins (21Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, deubiquitinating enzymes may have isopeptidase activities. When a target protein is degraded, deubiquitinating enzymes can cleave the polyubiquitin chain from the target protein or its remnants (22Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 23Huang Y. Baker R.T. Fischer-Vize J.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The polyubiquitin chain must also be disassembled by deubiquitinating enzymes during or after proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome, regenerating free monomeric ubiquitin (25Amerik A. Swaminathan S. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26Hadari T. Warms J.V. Rose I.A. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 719-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, deubiquitinating enzymes can facilitate the ability of the 26 S proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins. Third, deubiquitinating enzymes may hydrolyze ester, thiolester, and amide linkages to the carboxyl group of Gly-76 of ubiquitin (27Pickart C.M. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7903-7910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rose I.A. Warms J.V. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4234-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Wilkinson K.D. Cox M.J. Mayer A.N. Frey T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6644-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Such nonfunctional linkages may arise from reactions between small intracellular compounds such as glutathione and the E1-, E2-, or E3-ubiquitin thiolester intermediates. Fourth, deubiquitinating enzymes may compete with the conjugating system by removing ubiquitin from protein substrates, thereby rescuing them from degradation or any other function mediated by ubiquitination. Thus generation of ubiquitin by deubiquitinating enzymes from the linear polyubiquitin and ubiquitin fusion proteins and from the branched polyubiquitin ligated to proteins should be essential for maintaining a sufficient pool of free ubiquitin. Many deubiquitinating enzymes exist, suggesting that these deubiquitinating enzymes recognize distinct substrates and are therefore involved in specific cellular processes (11Chung C.H. Baek S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 13D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although there is recent evidence to support such specificity of these deubiquitinating enzymes (30Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 31Moazed D. Johnson D. Cell. 1996; 86: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Jensen D.E. Proctor M. Marquis S.T. Gardner H.P. Ha S.I. Chodosh L.A. Ishov A.M. Tommerup N. Vissing H. Sekido Y. Minna J. Borodovsky A. Schultz D.C. Wilkinson K.D. Maul G.G. Barlev N. Berger S.L. Prendergast G.C. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), the structure-function relationships of these enzymes remain poorly studied. Deubiquitinating enzymes can be divided broadly on the basis of sequence homology into two classes, the ubiquitin-specific processing protease (UBP or USP, also known as type 2 ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (type 2 UCH)) and the UCH, also known as type 1 UCH) (12Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 13D'Andrea A. Pellman D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). UCH (type 1 UCH) enzymes hydrolyze primarily C-terminal esters and amides of ubiquitin (27Pickart C.M. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7903-7910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but may also cleave ubiquitin gene products and disassemble polyubiquitin chains (30Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). They have in common a 210-amino acid catalytic domain, with four highly conserved blocks of sequences that identify these enzymes. They contain two very conserved motifs, the CYS and HIS boxes. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the two boxes play important roles in catalysis (33Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P.

Some UCH enzymes have significant C-terminal extensions (12Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 32Jensen D.E. Proctor M. Marquis S.T. Gardner H.P.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1097-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The functions of the C-terminal extensions are still unknown but appear to be involved in proper localization of the enzyme (24Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 32Jensen D.E. Proctor M. Marquis S.T. Gardner H.P. Ha S.I. Chodosh L.A. Ishov A.M. Tommerup N. Vissing H. Sekido Y. Minna J.

The active site of these UCH enzymes contains a catalytic triad consisting of cysteine, histidine, and aspartate and utilizes a chemical mechanism similar to that of papain (33Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Johnston S.C. Riddle S.M. Cohen R.E. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3877-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). UBP (type 2 UCH) enzymes are capable of cleaving the ubiquitin gene products (21Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and disassembling polyubiquitin chains after hydrolysis (15Falquet L. Paquet N. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Hoang-Van K. Jaton J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It appears that there is a core region of about 450 amino acids delimited by CYS and HIS boxes. Many of these isoforms have N-terminal extensions and a few have C-terminal extensions (12Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In addition, there are variable sequences in the core region of many of the isoforms. The functions of these divergent sequences remain poorly characterized. Recently, we identified UBP-t, an UBP enzyme that is primarily expressed in the testis as two isoforms with the same core region (347 residues) but distinct N termini. The N-terminal extension of UBP-t1 has 49 residues and that of UBP-t2 has 271 residues. The divergent N termini were found to target distinct subcellular compartments (35Lin H. Keriel A. Morales C.R. Bedard N. Zhao Q. Hingamp P. Lefrancois S. Combaret L. Wing S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6568-6578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). UBP-t1 is located primarily in the nucleus, whereas UBP-t2 is found primarily in a perinuclear location and can be associated with the centrosome. To evaluate whether in addition these N termini have functions in substrate specificity, we have tested the abilities of the two isoforms as well as the common core domain to cleave natural and semi-synthetic ubiquitin substrates. To express full-length UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 and only the common core region of UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 (UBP-core), DNA fragments encoding the proteins were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET11-d (Novagen). Plasmids were sequenced to confirm accurate amplification and cloning and then transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3). After induction of expression with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 28 °C, cells were harvested from 800 ml of culture and rinsed with PBS, and the cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C. Subsequent manipulations were on ice or at 4 °C. The frozen pellets were resuspended in110of the original culture volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and then proteins were differentially precipitated by ammonium sulfate (ICN Ultra Pure). The UBP-core was enriched in the 30–50% ammonium sulfate fraction. This fraction was dialyzed against 20 mm Mes, pH 6.2, 1 mm DTT overnight before being applied to a 5 × 100-mm propylsulfonic acid cation exchange column (Waters SP/HR15) equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (10 mm/min) in the same buffer. UBP-core was eluted at ∼0.14 m NaCl and in most fractions was >99% pure as evaluated by Coomassie Blue-stained acrylamide gels. The 30–40% ammonium sulfate fraction containing the UBP-t1 was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT overnight before being applied to a quaternary amine anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech MonoQ) equilibrated in the same buffer. Full-length UBP-t1 was eluted at ∼0.28m NaCl. The 35–45% ammonium sulfate fraction containing the UBP-t2 was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT overnight before being applied to the quaternary amine anion exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. Full-length UBP-t2 eluted at ∼0.31 m NaCl. The fractions of each step were screened by both Western blots with anti-UBP-core-specific antibody and activity assays. The activities of the enzymes in different fractions were monitored by determining their abilities to hydrolyze 125I-labeled Ub-PESTc (ubiquitin extended at the C terminus by MHISPPEPESEEEEEHYC) (36Baek S.H. Woo S.K. Lee J.I. Yoo Y.J. Cho C.M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These purification steps did not yield homogeneously pure UBP-t1 or UBP-t2 but succeeded in removing partially degraded forms. Control lysates prepared from uninduced cells show no activity under these conditions. The concentrations of active UBP-core, UBP-t1, and UBP-t2 were determined by inhibitor titration with ubiquitin aldehyde (24Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The enzymes were preincubated at 37 °C with different amounts of ubiquitin-aldehyde for 5 min, and then the isopeptidase activities were assayed with 2 μm125I-labeled branched triubiquitin (Ub3) as described below. Antibodies specific for the core region of UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 were prepared by immunizing rabbits with Freund's adjuvant mixed with UBP-core bearing an N-terminal His6tag. Antibodies were affinity-purified by passing crude anti-serum over an Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) column coupled to glutathioneS-transferase fused to the same UBP-core sequence. To detect UBP-core, UBP-t1, and UBP-t2, protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with anti-UBP-core antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-protein A and detection by chemiluminesence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chloramine-T method was used to label ubiquitin, diubiquitin, and triubiquitin with Na125I. Ub-PESTc was labeled with Na125I using Iodobeads (Pierce). Unincorporated 125I was removed by passing the reaction products over a Sephadex G-25 column. To measure the abilities of UBP-core, UBP-t1, and UBP-t2 to cleave some natural substrates and semi-synthetic ubiquitin derivatives, the different enzymes were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl as follows: 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin or ovalbumin, 2 μm125I-labeled substrate. After incubating at 37 °C for various times, the reactions were quenched as indicated below. For the substrate Ub-PESTc, the reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 1 ml of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the samples were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatants were counted for their radioactivities to detect the PESTc peptide bearing the iodinated tyrosine. For the linear diubiquitin (Ub2) or branched Ub3 substrates, the reaction was stopped with Laemmli sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 20% acrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. After detection by autoradiography, the monoubiquitin (Ub) band and Ub2 band (in the assay with Ub3) were excised from the dried gel and counted. The rate of cleavage of peptide bonds for linear Ub2 substrate was calculated as half of the Ub produced in this reaction. The rate of cleavage of isopeptide bonds for branched Ub3 substrate was calculated as (2/3 (Ub − Ub2)) + Ub2 produced in this reaction. To test the abilities of these UBP enzymes to cleave ubiquitin ester and ubiquitin linked to lysine by the α or ε amino groups, they were incubated with these substrates (16 μm) separately in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 3 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 20 or 30 min. The reactions were quenched with 40 μl of 0.1 n HCl and then injected onto a 4.6 × 250-mm C8 column equilibrated and eluted with 60% acetonitrile in 25 mm perchlorate to resolve the free ubiquitin product from the substrates (29Wilkinson K.D. Cox M.J. Mayer A.N. Frey T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6644-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fluorometric assays used ubiquitin-AMC as the substrate (37Stein R.L. Chen Z. Melandri F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12616-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In a typical assay, 80 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 μg/ml ovalbumin, 10 mm DTT) containing 6.6 nm enzyme were added to a 100-μl cuvette. When present, diubiquitin analogs were added, and after a 5-min preincubation at 37 °C to achieve thermal equilibrium, ubiquitin-AMC was added to a final concentration of 40 nm. Reaction progress was monitored by the increase in fluorescence emission at 450 nm (λex = 355 nm) that resulted from the cleavage of AMC from the substrate. To compare the abilities of these enzymes to cleave the substrates Ub-PESTc, linear Ub2, and branched Ub3, equivalent amounts of these enzymes (38 nm) were incubated with 2 μm substrate. The initial rates obtained with the different enzymes were compared. To compare the abilities of UBP-core, UBP-t1, and UBP-t2 to interact with the Ub-PESTc substrate, the apparent Km values for this substrate were determined. Variable concentrations of the substrate were assayed in reactions as described above. The products were monitored by removing aliquots from the reaction at various times. Initial velocities were calculated from the time courses and used in double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk) to determine apparent Km values and maximal velocities. To determine the dissociation constants for the inhibition of UBP-core by nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin, reactions were conducted using ubiquitin-AMC as substrate at five or more different concentrations of dimers. The dissociation constant was calculated by a non-linear curve-fitting analysis using fitting function v =vi + (vo −vf)/(1 + I/Ki) wherevo is the uninhibited rate, vf is the rate at high concentration of inhibitor, and Kiis the inhibition constant. In all cases inhibition was fully competitive, and vf = 0. To evaluate the abilities of these enzymes to remove ubiquitin from testis ubiquitinated proteins, rat testis extracts were prepared by homogenizing the tissues in 5 vol/g of wet weight of 0.25 msucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (at 4 °C), 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (to inactivate endogenous isopeptidases), 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and then frozen at −80 °C until analysis. Before assaying, the excess N-ethylmaleimide in the samples was neutralized by adding DTT to a final concentration of 5 mm. Aliquots (50 μg) of the protein were then incubated with equal amounts of each of the UBP enzymes (38 nm) for various times at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with Laemmli sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The ubiquitinated proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Sigma) followed by protein A coupled to horseradish peroxidase and a chemiluminescent detection method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To characterize the biochemical properties of UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 as well as their common core region, UBP-core (Fig.1 A), the proteins were expressed in E. coli. Since expressed proteins were susceptible to degradation, purification of the various enzymes was undertaken to remove degradation products (Fig. 1 B). UBP-core was purified to apparent homogeneity, as estimated by Coomassie Blue-staining of the protein on a polyacrylamide gel. UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 were enriched to levels of specific activity that were 17- and 27-fold greater, respectively, than in the crude bacterial lysates. Control lysates not expressing enzymes did not show activity in these assays, and the activities of all isoforms were found to be highly susceptible to inhibition by ubiquitin aldehyde, and therefore, they were quantitated by titration with this inhibitor. Since a key function of many deubiquitinating enzymes is to process the products of ubiquitin genes, we tested whether UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 can generate free ubiquitin from a fusion protein with another peptide, as in the case of the model substrate Ub-PESTc. UBP-core readily cleaved the α-peptide bond between ubiquitin and the PESTc extension, indicating that the core region itself has activity and therefore likely represents a functional domain. However, both UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 had very low activities (<20% that seen with UBP-core) with this substrate (Fig. 2). Thus the N-terminal extensions inhibited the hydrolytic activity inherent in the core domain. To test whether the N-terminal extensions of UBP exert this inhibitory effect by decreasing the abilities of the UBP core to interact with Ub-PESTc, we measured apparentKm values of Ub-PESTc for UBP-core, UBP-t1, and UBP-t2. Indeed, UBP-t2 and UBP-t1 had greater than 10-fold higherKm values with this substrate than did UBP-core (Table I). However, theVmax value of UBP-t2 was similar to that of the UBP-core enzyme, indicating that the N-terminal extensions of UBP can negatively influence binding of the core domain to the substrate without significantly affecting catalytic function.Table IKinetic constants of ubiquitin-PESTc for UBP-t1, UBP-t2, and UBP-coreEnzymeKmVmaxμmmol/min/mol enzymeUBP-core1.7 ± 0.70.48 ± 0.16UBP-t1>20NDUBP-t218.2 ± 3.80.59 ± 0.08Various concentrations of 125I-ubiquitin-PESTc were incubated with UBP-t1, UBP-t2, and UBP-core (all at 38 nm).

(ND, not determined). Open table in a new tab Various concentrations of 125I-ubiquitin-PESTc were incubated with UBP-t1, UBP-t2, and UBP-core (all at 38 nm). The initial velocities of PESTc peptide released were determined and used in double-reciprocal plots to determine Km andVmax. Shown are means ± S.E. of at least three determinations. (ND, not determined). To test whether these enzymes may be involved in processing the linear polyubiquitin that arises from the polyubiquitin genes, we tested the activities of these enzymes against linear Ub2. UBP-t1, UBP-t2, and UBP-core all had low abilities to generate free ubiquitin from Ub2. Interestingly, as occurred for Ub-PESTc, the initial velocities of UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 to cleave this α-peptide bond were lower than that of UBP-core (Fig.3). This confirms the previous observation (Fig. 2) that N-terminal extensions inhibit the ability of the core region to cleave linear peptide fusions. All of the above results would suggest that both UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 do not generate free ubiquitin from ubiquitin gene products. They also do not appear to be involved in processing the precursor forms of the ubiquitin-related proteins SUMO1 (sentrin) or NEDD8, as none of the three isoforms were able to cleave proSUMO1 or proNEDD8 (data not shown). Thus the core region alone has activity, but the N-terminal extensions limit that activity presumably by imposing constraints and selectivity on the ability of substrates to access the core domain. It has been postulated that ubiquitin may become linked to small thiols and amines in the cell arising from nucleophilic attack of these compounds on the reactive thiol ester linkage between ubiquitin and E1, E2s, or some E3s. Deubiquitinating enzymes may play an important role in regenerating ubiquitin from these nonproductive adducts. Indeed, the deubiquitinating enzymes UCH-L1 and UCH-L3 can efficiently hydrolyze these small thiols and amines from ubiquitinin vitro. To test the potential function of our UBP enzymes to hydrolyze such compounds, Ub ester and Nα-Ub-l-lysine were used as substrates. UBP-core had higher activity in hydrolyzing the ester and lysine from ubiquitin than both UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 (TableII). This indicates that the N-terminal extensions of both UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 inhibit the ability of the core region to hydrolyze small thiols and amines from ubiquitin and further supports the role of these extensions in imposing substrate selectivity.Table IIRates of hydrolysis of ubiquitin derivatives by UBP-t1, UBP-t2, and UBP-coreSubstrateRate of hydrolysisUBP-coreUBP-t1UBP-t2mol/min/mol enzymeUbiquitin ethyl ester4.31.20.72Nα-ubiquitin-l-lysine2.60.180.98Nɛ-ubiquitin-l-lysine3.50.310.63The indicated substrates (16 μm) were incubated with equal concentrations of the indicated enzymes (76 nm). Products of the reaction were resolved from substrate and quantitated by HPLC as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab The indicated substrates (16 μm) were incubated with equal concentrations of the indicated enzymes (76 nm). Products of the reaction were resolved from substrate and quantitated by HPLC as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Ubiquitin is conjugated to proteins through an isopeptide bond (through the ε-amino group of lysine). So it was of interest to examine whether UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 could cleave Ub-ε-amino lysine derivatives. When Nε-Ub-l-lysine was used as such a model isopeptidase substrate, UBP-core still had higher activity than UBP-t1 or UBP-t2 against the ε-isopeptide bond (Table II). Thus, at least for a small leaving group, UBP-core does not discriminate between isopeptide and peptide linkages. This is similar to UCH enzymes tested to date that also do not appear to discriminate between these two model substrates (30Larsen C.N. Krantz B.A. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3358-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Most biological functions of ubiquitin are mediated by the linkage of the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin in an isopeptide bond with the ε-amino group of the side chain of lysine residues of the protein substrate. Recognition of ubiquitinated proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome generally requires the presence of a polyubiquitin chain on the protein substrate in which each ubiquitin is linked to each other via these isopeptide linkages. To evaluate whether UBP-core, UBP-t1, and UBP-t2 can potentially disassemble such a polyubiquitin chain, Ub3, a branched triubiquitin chain linked via isopeptide bonds between the ε-amino group of lysine 48 in one ubiquitin molecule and the C-terminal of another ubiquitin molecule, was used as a substrate. All three enzymes had activity against this substrate, and the rates of cleavage were similar to that for Ub-PESTc but 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than that seen for linear Ub2 (Fig.4). Thus, the UBP core domain appears to prefer branched rather than linear ubiquitin polymers as substrate. The higher rate of cleavage of triubiquitin compared with diubiquitin was not due to the extra moiety of ubiquitin in the former, as diubiquitin did not accumulate over time in the reactions with triubiquitin as substrate (data not shown). In addition, UBP-t2 had higher activity than UBP-core. This indicates that the N-terminal extension of UBP-t2 not only suppresses peptidase activity but enhances isopeptidase activity. In contrast, UBP-t1 had lower activity than UBP-core in cleaving branched Ub3 (Fig. 4). This indicates that the N-terminal extensions can modulate the intrinsic activity of the core domain both positively and negatively. Although ubiquitin moieties joined by Gly-76–Lys-48 linkages appear to be most efficient at targeting for proteasomal-mediated degradation, linkages of Gly-76 to other lysine residues of ubiquitin have been observed. To evaluate whether these enzymes show preference for specific linkages, the ability of nonhydrolyzable ubiquitin dimer analogs joined in various linkages (38Yin L. Krantz B. Russell N.S. Deshpande S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10001-10010Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to inhibit these enzymes was tested. These dimer analogs were synthesized by using dichloroacetone to cross-link ubiquitin containing a terminal cysteine to another ubiquitin in which individual lysines have been mutated to cysteine. To determine inhibitory constants easily and accurately, a sensitive continuous fluorometric assay using ubiquitin-AMC as substrate was employed (Table III). At the low concentrations of ubiquitin-AMC used, only UBP-core and UBP-t2 had significant activities, and so UBP-t1 was not tested. The apparentKm of ubiquitin-AMC for UBP-core was similar to that of Ub-PESTc. However, in contrast to Ub-PESTc, where the affinity for UBP-t2 decreased 1 order of magnitude compared with UBP-core, the affinity of ubiquitin-AMC actually increased approximately 3-fold. When the ubiquitin dimer analogs were tested, diubiquitin linked by lysine 63 was found to be most inhibitory. However, the differences between the inhibition constants of the analogs were relatively small, suggesting that there is no significant preference of the enzymes for a particular linkage. Furthermore, even for the lysine 63-linked analog, the Ki value was relatively high (10−7m range) compared with an enzyme such as isopeptidase T in which diubiquitin linked by lysine 48 inhibits with a Ki in the range of 10−8m (38Yin L. Krantz B. Russell N.S. Deshpande S. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10001-10010Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that UBP-t2 shows enhanced activity against branched Ub3due to the presence in this isoform of a binding site for an additional ubiquitin moiety. To evaluate this possibility, theKi values of monoubiquitin and the dimers for UBP-core and for UBP-t2 were compared to see if the dimerKi values were lower for the UBP-t2 isoform. The ratios of Ki for UBP-core to Kifor UBP-t2 were similar for ubiquitin monomer and for all of the dimers, suggesting that the N-terminal extension in UBP-t2 does not confer an additional binding site for ubiquitin (Table III).Table IIIKinetic constants of ubiquitin-AMC for UBP-core and UBP-t2 and inhibition of these isoforms by ubiquitin and nonhydrolyzable ubiquitin dimer analogsEnzymeKmVmaxμmmol/min/ mol enzymeUBP-core2.43.82UBP-t21.01.05InhibitorKiUBP-coreUBP-t2Ki (UBP-core)/Ki (UBP-t2)nmRatioUbiquitin24008532.811–76Ub28804152.129–76Ub214005162.748–76Ub216904393.863–76Ub25601344.276–76Ub230009703.1Various concentrations of ubiquitin-AMC were incubated with the indicated enzymes (6.6 nm), and the release of fluorescent AMC was followed continuously as described under “Materials and Methods.” To determine inhibitor constants of ubiquitin and various ubiquitin dimer analogs, the rates of cleavage of ubiquitin-AMC were measured in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitor and then analyzed by a nonlinear curve-fitting analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Various concentrations of ubiquitin-AMC were incubated with the indicated enzymes (6.6 nm), and the release of fluorescent AMC was followed continuously as described under “Materials and Methods.” To determine inhibitor constants of ubiquitin and various ubiquitin dimer analogs, the rates of cleavage of ubiquitin-AMC were measured in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitor and then analyzed by a nonlinear curve-fitting analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” Since the various isoforms could disassemble a short branched polyubiquitin chain, we tested whether they had isopeptidase activity against a broader spectrum of ubiquitinated proteins in a testis extract. The UBP-core and UBP-t2 enzymes deubiquitinated ubiquitin from high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins, but the UBP-t1 enzyme had relatively low activity (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the observation that UBP-t1 was the least efficient among the three isoforms in cleaving branched triubiquitin (Fig. 4). UBP-core was most active, suggesting that the N termini impose varying degrees of substrate specificity on the isopeptidase activity. Without the addition of the enzymes, the levels of ubiquitinated proteins were stable, confirming that endogenous deubiquitinating enzymes had been inactivated by the presence of N-ethylmaleimide in the homogenization buffer. The activities of the UBP isoforms were inhibited by ubiquitin aldehyde, indicating that these cleavages were unlikely to be due to any contaminating bacterial proteases. In summary, the UBP core region containing the conserved elements of the UBP family of enzymes and delimited by the CYS and HIS boxes contains ubiquitin-specific protease activity. Thus we provide the first direct evidence that this core region represents a functional and quite possibly a structural domain also. Interestingly, this core domain appears to preferentially cleave isopeptide rather than peptide linkages (compare rates in Figs. 3 and 4), thus suggesting that the UBP family functions primarily in either the regeneration of ubiquitin from polyubiquitin chains produced after the action of the 26 S proteasome or in the editing or rescuing of ubiquitinated protein substrates before the action of the 26 S proteasome. Indeed, the isoforms were capable of removing ubiquitin from endogenous testis proteins (Fig. 5). The lower Ki values for the ubiquitin dimers compared with ubiquitin alone (Table III) would also be consistent with preferential binding of branched polyubiquitin to the core region of the enzyme. We have previously shown that the N-terminal extensions of UBP-t1 and UBP-t2 serve to localize the enzyme to different compartments of the cell (35Lin H. Keriel A. Morales C.R. Bedard N. Zhao Q. Hingamp P. Lefrancois S. Combaret L. Wing S.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6568-6578Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It should be noted that UBP-t2 is localized in a perinuclear pattern resembling that of the proteasome and is also the most active on branched polyubiquitin conjugates. It is intriguing to speculate that these indicators may suggest a role for UBP-t2 in metabolism of branched polyubiquitin at or near the proteasome. Our data demonstrate clearly and for the first time that these divergent N termini can also modulate the activity of the core domain. Interestingly, the activity can be both positively and negatively affected by the extension depending on the particular substrate. For the substrates for which measures of affinity could be determined, the parameters obtained were relatively high (in the micromolar range). Rates of cleavage were also relatively low. Thus, there are probably specific substrates for these enzymes, and the N-terminal extensions may play roles in recognizing these specific ubiquitinated proteins. Indeed, without N-terminal extensions, UBP-core efficiently removed ubiquitin from endogenous proteins. However, with N-terminal extensions, UBP-t2 did this at a slower rate, and UBP-t1, hardly at all (Fig. 5). Thus, it is quite possible that the N-terminal extensions are positioned near the S1′ site, and the different effects of the UBP-t2 extension on affinity for ubiquitin-AMC and ubiquitin-PESTc would support this model (Tables Iand III). In addition, given their precise localization in the cell, the enzymes may be co-localized with their substrates in specific compartments. Such co-localization would permit privileged delivery of substrates to the enzymes and diminish dependence of access to the enzymes on factors such as affinity constants and diffusion rates. Finally, the observations on UBP-testis in this and our previous work (35Lin H. Keriel A. Morales C.R. Bedard N. Zhao Q. Hingamp P. Lefrancois S. Combaret L. Wing S.S. Mol. Cell.

In the present study, we have assessed the influence of fU on DNA replication to elucidate its genotoxic potential. Oligonucleotide templates containing fU at defined sites were replicated in vitro by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment deficient in 3′–5′-exonuclease. Gel electrophoretic analysis of the reaction products showed that fU constituted very weak replication blocks to DNA synthesis, suggesting a weak to negligible cytotoxic effect of this lesion. However, primer extension assays with a single dNTP revealed that fU directed incorporation of not only correct dAMP but also incorrect dGMP, although much less efficiently. No incorporation of dCMP and dTMP was observed. When fU was substituted for T in templates, the incorporation efficiency of dAMP (fA =Vmax/Km) decreased to ¼ to ½, depending on the nearest neighbor base pair, and that of dGMP (fG) increased 1.1–5.6-fold. Thus, the increase in the replication error frequency (fG/fA for fUversus T) was 3.1–14.3-fold. The misincorporation rate of dGMP opposite fU (pKa = 8.6) but not T (pKa = 10.0) increased with pH (7.2–8.6) of the reaction mixture, indicating the participation of the ionized (or enolate) form of fU in the mispairing with G. The resulting mismatched fU:G primer terminus was more efficiently extended than the T:G terminus (8.2–11.3-fold). These results show that when T is oxidized to fU in DNA, fU promotes both misincorporation of dGMP at this site and subsequent elongation of the mismatched primer, hence potentially mutagenic. 5-Formyluracil (fU) is a major oxidative thymine lesion generated by ionizing radiation and reactive oxygen species.

High fidelity of DNA replication is achieved by two cellular functions that involve discrimination of correct versus incorrect nucleotides by DNA polymerases (1Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar,2Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). The overall error frequency of DNA replication is one in 108 to 1010 base pairs when they function properly. Fidelity of DNA replication also relies on the structural integrity of DNA itself that serves as a template for the newly synthesized strand. A number of endogenous and exogenous agents have been identified to induce structural deterioration of DNA (4Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Among them, reactive oxygen species generate a very complicated spectrum of DNA damage (5von Sonntag C.

These lesions are mostly restored by the base excision repair pathway both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, but if left unrepaired, they arrest DNA synthesis or direct misincorporation of nucleotides during DNA replication, hence exerting deleterious effects on cells (7Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair. 1. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 229-262Google Scholar, 8Wang D. Kreutzer D.A. Essigmann J.M. Mutat.

Replication blocks and nucleotide misincorporation have been related to lethality and mutation of cells, respectively, until recently. However, this concept is now challenged by the discovery of numerous error-prone and error-free DNA polymerases that can bypass the blocking lesions (9Friedberg E.C. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Proc.

Oxidative thymine lesions formed by ionizing radiation, Fenton-type reactions, and photosensitized reaction have been best characterized among the four DNA bases and can be classified into four subgroups depending on their structural features. The first group includes C-5—C-6 saturation products such as thymine glycol (5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymine) and 5,6-dihydro-5-hydroxythymine. 5,6-Dihydrothymine belongs to this group, although it is a reduction product formed by ionizing radiation. The second group is ring fragmentation products such as a urea residue and its analogues. The response of DNA polymerases to the first and second groups has been clarified fairly well by in vitro and in vivostudies (13Evans J. Maccabee M. Hatahet Z. Courcelle J. Bockrath R. Ide H.

Biol. 1994; 236: 514-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The third group includes 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin, a ring contraction product. The ability of this lesion to block DNA replication has been demonstrated recently (24Gasparutto D. Ait-Abbas M. Jaquinod M. Boiteux S. Cadet J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by in vitro DNA polymerase reactions using a defined oligonucleotide template. The fourth group contains methyl oxidation products such as 5-hydroxymethyluracil and 5-formyluracil (fU).1 Several lines of evidence indicate that 5-hydroxymethyluracil is neither a replicative block nor mutagenic (25Levy D.D. Teebor G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3337-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Mi L.-J. Mahl E. Chaung W. Boorstein R.J. Mutat. Res. 1997; 374: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and hence is an innocuous lesion.The genotoxic potential of fU belonging to the fourth group has been assessed in this (27Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Terato H. Masaoka A. Kobayashi M. Fukushima S. Ohyama Y. Yoshida M.

Biol. 1999; 75: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) laboratories. In our previous approach, we synthesized 5-formyl-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (fdUTP) and studied its incorporation into DNA by DNA polymerases. fdUTP efficiently substituted for dTTP and to a much less extent for dCTP. Moreover, the pH-dependent variation of the substitution efficiency for dCTP suggested involvement of an ionized (or enolate) form of fU as a key intermediate responsible for the mispairing with template G. Such a mutation mechanism involving ionized bases (thymine and 5-bromouracil (BrU)) was originally suggested by Lawley and Brookes (31Lawley P.D. Brookes P. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Later, the pH-dependent variation of the replication error frequency due to ionization of BrU and 5-fluorouracil was experimentally demonstrated by Yu et al. (32Yu H. Eritja R. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15935-15943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), providing the conceptional basis of the previous studies (27Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Terato H. Masaoka A. Kobayashi M. Fukushima S. Ohyama Y. Yoshida M. Ide H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25144-25150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Translesion bypass and nucleotide incorporation at the site of template fU were also studied (29Zhang Q.-M. Sugiyama H. Miyabe I. Matsuda S. Saito I. Yonei S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3969-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Zhang Q.-M. Sugiyama H. Miyabe I. Matsuda S. Kino K. Saito I. Yonei S. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides containing the site-specific lesion (33Sugiyama H. Matsuda S. Kino K. Zhang Q.-M. Yonei S. Saito I. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 9067-9070Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consistent with very efficient substitution of fdUTP for dTTP in our study, DNA polymerase readily passed through the fU site in the template. However, to our surprise, the primer extension study showed that fU directed incorporation of dCMP as well as correct dAMP, implying the formation of an fU:C mispair during DNA replication. The discrepancy between the two studies concerning the base pairing capacity of fU might have originated from several reasons. First, although overall Watson-Crick geometry of a newly formed base pair plays a dominant role in nucleotide selection by DNA polymerases (1Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 2Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), this process can also be affected by base pairing symmetry whether an X:Y base pair is formed from X(template):Y (dNTP) or X (dNTP):Y(template) (34Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Ahn J. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.-D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 36Einolf H.J. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13300-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Second, the sequence context can affect the selection of dNTP opposite the template lesion (7Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair. 1. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 229-262Google Scholar). Third, the base ionization mechanism somehow does not hold when fU is present in template DNA.In view of the potential influences of base pairing asymmetry, the sequence context, and deviations from the base ionization mechanism mentioned above, we have prepared oligonucleotide templates containing site-specific fU following the previously reported phosphoramidite method (33Sugiyama H. Matsuda S. Kino K. Zhang Q.-M. Yonei S. Saito I. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 9067-9070Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and we reexamined the base pairing capacity of template fU with the four possible nearest neighbor base pairs. The results show that fU in the template directs misincorporation of dGTP in a pH-dependent manner, supporting our previous results obtained by the analysis of fdUTP incorporation.DISCUSSIONfU is one of the major oxidative thymine lesions found in DNA and nucleoside that were exposed to ionizing radiation (44Kasai H.

Direct incorporation of fdUTP into permeated E. coli cells resulted in a small but significant increase in chromosomal lacI mutation with G:C → A:T transitions being most preferred (59Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4582-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). fdU was also mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium when added to the culture medium (44Kasai H. Iida A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Tanooka H. Mutat. Res. 1990; 243: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have assessed the genotoxic potential of fU in template DNA by utilizing in vitro DNA replication reactions. The product analysis of translesion synthesis revealed that fU constituted very weak blocks to DNA synthesis (Fig. 2). Thus, unlike other thymine lesions such as thymine glycol, urea residues, and 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin (13Evans J. Maccabee M. Hatahet Z. Courcelle J. Bockrath R. Ide H. Wallace S.S. Mutat. Res. 1993; 299: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Ide H. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8035-8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 15Ide H.

Toxicol. 2000; 13: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), fU will exert a weak to negligible cytotoxic effect due to inhibition of DNA replicationin vivo. Conversely, fU was shown to be a potentially mutagenic lesion based on the following results. First, the substitution of T by fU promoted misincorporation of incorrect dGMP (1.1–5.6 times as fG) and at the same time retarded incorporation of correct dAMP (¼ to ½ asfA), hence leading to 3.3–14.3-fold increases in the replication error frequency (fRE) relative to T (Fig. 4A). Second, the resulting mismatched primer terminus containing an fU:G pair was more readily extended (8.2–11.3 times asfEX) than that containing a T:G pair (Fig.4B) (see also the discussion below onfEX). This step will affect the probability that a genome DNA molecule is replicated to completion, and thereby scored as mutation. According to the present data, fU is moderately mutagenic, but for more quantitative estimation of the mutation frequency of fU, it is necessary to consider the influence of repair and the property of replicative DNA polymerases.The mismatch extension frequency (fEX) in the absence of proofreading depends explicitly on the binding constant of DNA polymerase to matched versus mismatched template-primer DNA as well as on the concentrations of the template-primer DNA and next correct dNTP (60Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, to evaluate the intrinsic mismatch extension frequency (fEX(int)), possible differential binding of DNA polymerase to matched and mismatched primer termini needs to be taken into account under standing start conditions,i.e. differential binding to T:A versus T:G and fU:A versus fU:G termini in this study. The relationship between fEX andfEX(int) has been formulated in Equation1 (60Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where [Dr] and [Dw] are the concentrations of template-primer DNA having correctly and incorrectly paired primer termini (Dr andDw), respectively, and Kr andKw are the equilibrium constants for dissociation of polymerase-Dr and polymerase-Dwcomplexes, respectively.fEX/fEX(int)=(1+[Dr]/Kr)/(1+[Dw]/Kw)Equation 1 In Equation 1, it is generally assumed that the affinity of DNA polymerase for a correctly paired terminus is similar to or higher than that for an incorrectly paired terminus (Kw≧ Kr). The values of [Dr] and [Dw] are both 33 nm in this study. When Pol I (exo−) has comparable affinities (Kr ≈ Kw) for the matched and mismatched termini (i.e. T:A and T:G, and fU:A and fU:G), fEX in TableIV approximately represents the intrinsic value. According to Equation 1, the largest discrepancy between fEXand fEX(int) occurs whenKw is much higher than [Dw] (Kw ≫ 33 nm). In this case, Equation 1can be transformed into Equation 2 by approximation.fEX/fEX(int)=(1+[Dr]/Kr)Equation 2 Although the Kr values of Pol I (exo−) are not known, those for Avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase and Drosophila melanogaster DNA polymerase α have been estimated as 5 and 20–50 nm, respectively (60Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Granted that theKr value of Pol I (exo−) is in a similar range (5–50 nm), the fEX values in Table IV are subjected to a 7.6-fold reduction. However, the correction factor given by Equation 2 is presumably similar for the T and fU templates since the affinities (Kr) of Pol I (exo−) for the structurally resembling T:A and fU:A termini are likely comparable. These considerations suggest that the relative difference in fEX(int) for the T versus fU templates remains similar to that shown in Fig.4B, although the absolute value offEX(int) may be lower than that obtained experimentally in this study (fEX).Concerning the mispairing mechanism of fU, we have previously suggested participation of the ionized (or enolate) form of fU based on the pH-dependent misincorporation of fdUTP opposite template G (27Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Privat and Sowers (61Privat E.J. Sowers L.C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 354: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) also proposed a similar mispairing scheme on the basis of pKa measurement of fdU and related nucleosides. Consistent with this mechanism, the efficiency of dGMP misincorporation opposite template fU increased around the pKa value of fU (pKa = 8.6), whereas the corresponding increase for T (pKa = 10.0) was much smaller than that for fU (Fig. 5, B andD). The result obtained for T also agrees with a small increase in the base substitution frequency of Pol I (exo−) in this pH range (62Eckert K.A. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13462-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike thymine bearing an electron donating methyl group, fU has an electron withdrawing formyl group that promotes ionization of fU in an acid-base equilibrium (Fig.6A). According to the pKa values, the fraction of the ionized form of fU increases from 4 to 50% in the pH range of 7.2–8.6 but that of thymine is virtually negligible (0.2–4%). Ionized fU can form a base pair with incoming dGTP through two hydrogen bonds (Fig. 6B, left). The base pair formed between ionized fU and dGTP essentially assume Watson-Crick geometry (or B form geometry) and can fit into the active site of DNA polymerase. Since the geometric recognition is key to discrimination of correct versus incorrect nucleotides by DNA polymerases (1Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), this geometry probably promoted misincorporation of dGMP opposite fU. Participation of base ionization promoted by electron withdrawing substituents has been demonstrated in the mispairing of 5-halogenated uracils (BrU and 5-fluorouracil) with G (32Yu H. Eritja R. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15935-15943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, fU and 5-halogenated uracils share a common mutation mechanism. Although participation of a rare enol tautomer of fU (Fig. 6A) in the mispairing with G cannot be fully ruled out, recent NMR studies show that the tautomeric equilibrium between keto and enol forms of fU is not significantly affected by oxidation of the methyl group of T to the formyl group (63La Francois C.J. Fujimoto J. Sowers L.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 64La Francois C.J. Jang Y.H. Cagin T. Goddard W.A.I., II Sowers L.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, involvement of the enol form of fU is unlikely in the mispairing with G. It is assumed that after dGMP incorporation, the resulting fU(ionized):G pair in Watson-Crick geometry shifts to wobble geometry (fU(keto):G) due to the acid-base equilibrium (Fig. 6B, right). However, a certain fraction of the base pair will still exist as an fU(ionized):G pair whose geometry can again promote incorporation of the next nucleotide. Probably this is the reason why the mismatched primer terminus containing an fU:G pair was more efficiently extended than that containing a T:G pair. Although there is no experimental evidence that directly shows the equilibrium between fU(keto):G and fU(ionized):G base pairs in duplex DNA, the presence of such a equilibrium has been demonstrated for BrU(keto):G and BrU (ionized):G pairs in a duplex oligonucleotide by the NMR study (65Sowers L.C. Goodman M.F. Eritja R. Kaplan B. Fazakerley G.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). According to the proposed mutation mechanism for fU, it is reasonable that 5-hydroxymethyluracil, another methyl oxidation product of T, does not direct misincorporation (25Levy D.D. Teebor G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3337-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Mi L.-J. Mahl E. Chaung W. Boorstein R.J. Mutat. Res. 1997; 374: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) since the hydroxymethyl group has electron donating nature and cannot promote ionization of the base. Although a mutation mechanism involving an altered acid-base equilibrium has been previously demonstrated for 5-halogenated uracils (32Yu H. Eritja R. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15935-15943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to our knowledge, fU is the first example adapting to this mechanism among oxidative DNA base lesions.To assess the sequence context effect on the base pairing property of fU, the 3′-nearest neighbor base of template fU and the paired base (i.e. the primer terminus base pair) was systematically changed, and the nucleotide incorporated opposite fU was analyzed. fU with the four possible nearest neighbor base pairs directed incorporation of dAMP and to a less extent dGMP but not dCMP and dTMP (Fig. 3). Thus, 3′-nearest neighbor base exhibited no influence concerning the type of base pairs formed from template fU. Combining the result with fdUTP (27Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Terato H. Masaoka A. Kobayashi M. Fukushima S. Ohyama Y. Yoshida M. Ide H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2132564346,"This is the first report on a bacterial verterbrate-type GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK). The pck gene of Mycobacterium smegmatis was cloned. The recombinant PCK was overexpressed inEscherichia coli in a soluble form and with high activity. The purified enzyme was found to be monomeric (72 kDa), thermophilic (optimum temperature, 70 °C), very stable upon storage at 4 °C, stimulated by thiol-containing reducing agents, and inhibited by oxalate and by α-ketoglutarate. The requirement for a divalent cation for activity was fulfilled best by Mn2+ and Co2+ and poorly by Mg2+. At 37 °C, the highest Vm value (32.5 units/mg) was recorded with Mn2+ and in the presence of 37 mmdithiothreitol (DTT). The presence of Mg2+ (2 mm) greatly lowered the apparent Kmvalues for Mn2+ (by 144-fold in the presence of DTT and by 9.4-fold in the absence of DTT) and Co2+ (by 230-fold). In the absence of DTT but in the presence of Mg2+ (2 mm) as the co-divalent cation, Co2+ was 21-fold more efficient than Mn2+. For producing oxaloacetate, the enzyme utilized both GDP and IDP; ADP served very poorly. The apparent Km values for phosphoenolpyruvate, GDP, and bicarbonate were >100, 66, and 8300 μm, respectively, whereas those for GTP and oxaloacetate (for the phosphoenolpyruvate formation activity) were 13 and 12 μm, respectively. Thus, this enzyme preferred the gluconeogenesis/glycerogenesis direction. This property fits the suggestion that in M. smegmatis, pyruvate carboxylase is not anaplerotic but rather gluconeogenic (Mukhopadhyay, B., and Purwantini, E. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1475, 191–206). Both in primary structure and kinetic properties, the mycobacterial PCK was very similar to its vertebrate-liver counterparts and thus could serve as a model for these enzymes; examples for several immediate targets are presented.

Barring four exceptions, all known bacterial PCKs are ATP-dependent (2Barbieri J.T. Austin F.E. Cox C.D. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Schöcke L. Weimer P.J.

In most cases, the PCK activity has been postulated to catalyze the first committed step in gluconeogenesis, the formation of PEP from OAA (8Utter M.F. Kolenbrander H.M. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, Inc., New York1972: 117-168Google Scholar, 9Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar). In adipose tissue, GTP-PCK primes glycerogenesis, especially under fasting conditions, when pyruvate, lactate, and amino acids serve as the precursors for PEP (9Hanson R.W. Patel Y.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 203-281PubMed Google Scholar); this tissue does not synthesize glucose. It is the gluconeogenesis role that makes GTP-PCK a potential target in the treatment for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (10Valera A. Pujol A. Pelegrin M. Bosch F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9151-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In parasites and in certain bacteria, GTP-PCK fulfills an anaplerotic role by carboxylating PEP to OAA (2Barbieri J.T.

For all of these reasons, this enzyme has been a focus of intense mechanistic studies since its discovery (1Matte A. Tari L.W. Goldie H. Delbaere T.J. J. Biol.

The ATP- and GTP-dependent PCKs show very little primary structure similarity to each other (1Matte A. Tari L.W. Goldie H. Delbaere T.J. J. Biol.

Recently, the crystal structure for the PCK from Escherichia coli, an ATP-dependent enzyme, has been solved (14Matte A. Goldie H. Sweet R.M. Delbaere L.T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 126-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). But until now the GTP-dependent enzymes have been refractory to such studies (13Hlavaty J.J. Nowak T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1373-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Also, a bacterial model for a GTP-dependent PCK has not been presented. Certain mycobacteria are major human and animal pathogens. They are also ubiquitous in nature, where they play important roles in the biogeochemistry of the earth (15Hartmans S. de Bonte J.A.M.

But there is a general lack of metabolic information for these bacteria. It has been recently reported that in Mycobacterium smegmatis the pyruvate carboxylase (PYC), an OAA-synthesizing enzyme, may not play an anaplerotic role (19Mukhopadhyay B. Purwantini E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1475: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One assumption has been that this PYC may have a role in gluconeogenesis and/or glycerogenesis. A direct corollary of this hypothesis is that M. smegmatis would possess a PCK that kinetically prefers the PEP synthesis direction. Such a preference would allow a combination of PYC and PCK activities to constitute a beginning of the gluconeogenesis and/or glycerogenesis route. An analysis of recently determined whole genome sequence ofMycobacterium tuberculosis (20Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S.

We chose the enzyme from M. smegmatis for this investigation, because this nonpathogenic organism is a widely studied model for the mycobacteria. It is also amenable to genetic manipulations (21Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.D. Pascopella L. Udani R.A. Jones Jr., W.D. Barletta R.G. Bloom B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), which are essential for studying the physiological aspects as well as the structure-function relationships of this important enzyme. In this report we describe the cloning, overexpression, and biochemical and molecular genetic characterization of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from M. smegmatis. Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 (22Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol.

Acta. 2000; 1475: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). E. coliDH5α (supE44 hsdR17 recA endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) (23Hanahan D. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) was the overexpression host. These strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. The E. coli transformants were selected on plates or grown in liquid medium containing 100 μg of ampicillin per ml, except for the cultures raised for overexpression of PCK, where a level of 400 μg/ml was used. Generally, all DNA manipulations were performed according to standard methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA fromM. smegmatis mc2155 was isolated as described (26Husson R.N. James B.E. Young R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Each polymerase chain reaction was carried out by using thePfuTurbo ® DNA polymerase from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and a typical reaction mixture (100 μl in volume) had the following composition: reaction buffer (Stratagene), 0.189 μg ofM. smegmatis chromosomal DNA, 10 pmol of each of the primers, 1 μl of Me2SO, and 2 mmMgSO4 (over the level of 2 mm provided by the buffer). The amplification conditions were as follows: initial melting at 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles comprising denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 7 min; and a final finishing extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Thepck coding region from M. smegmatis chromosomal DNA was amplified by use of the primers 5′-TGACCTCAGCGACCATCCCCGGTCTGGATACCGCGCC-3′ (MsmPCK1F) and 5′-CTAACCTAGGCGCTCCTTCAGGGCGTCGAACTCATC-3′ (MsmPCK2R) and was cloned into the EcoRV site of the vector pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene), generating the plasmid pBE129. The sequence for each strand of this clone was determined. The sequences of two more such clones, generated from two independent amplification reactions, were also determined, and they were found to be the same as that for the first. For obtaining an overexpression construct, the pck coding sequence was amplified from pBE129 by use of 5′-GGGCTGCAGGAATTCATATGACCTCAGCGACC-3′ (MsmPCK3F) oligonucleotide as the 5′-primer (the engineered NdeI restriction site is underlined) and 5′-GATCTAACCTAGGGGATCCTTCAGGGCGTCG-3′ (MsmPCK4R) as the 3′-primer (the BamHI site is underlined). After digestion with NdeI and BamHI, the polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into similarly restricted pET19b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). In the resultant plasmid, pBE129–19b, thepck coding sequence was placed under the control of the T7 promoter, and the corresponding open reading frame was fused to an NH2-terminal His10 sequence via an enterokinase cleavage site. E. coli C41(DE3) (24Miroux B. Walker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) was transformed with pBE129–19b to obtain the strain E. coli BE129-19b. Thepck coding sequence in pBE129-19b was found to be identical to that in pBE129. This sequence has been submitted to GenBankTM with the accession number AF332191. E. coli BE129-19b was grown under vigorous agitation in LB supplemented with ampicillin (400 μg/ml). When the A600 of the culture reached a value of ∼0.6 (as measured by using a model DU640 UV-visible spectrophotometer; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA), the PCK expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cultivation was allowed to proceed for an additional 3 h. Then the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g at 4 °C and stored at −20 °C. Each enzyme purification step was performed at 4 °C. Typically, 6.5 g of E. coli BE129–19b cell paste was thawed in 6.5 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. The cells were disrupted by three passages through a prechilled (on ice) French pressure cell at 1.28 × 108 pascals. The broken cell slurry was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and 9 ml of supernatant was recovered. (For preliminary trials, as indicated under “Results,” this supernatant was further clarified via centrifugation at 100,000 ×g). The supernatant was mixed with 0.74 ml of 4m NaCl and 0.1 ml of 1 m imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7 (final concentrations: 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole). This solution was loaded onto a 1-ml column bed (diameter, 13 mm) of Superflow Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Inc.) under a gravity flow; before use, the column bed was equilibrated with 10 ml of a solution containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 300 mmNaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. To remove unbound and weakly bound proteins, the matrix was washed with 10 ml of equilibration solution and then with the following in sequence (each containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and 10 mmimidazole): 2 ml of 0.5 m NaCl; 2 ml of 1 mNaCl; 3 ml of 2 m NaCl; and 2 ml of 0.3 m NaCl (to lower the NaCl concentration). The elution was carried out in steps with the following solutions (each containing 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and 0.3 m NaCl): 5 ml of 50 mm imidazole; 2 ml of 100 mm imidazole; 2 ml of 150 mm imidazole; 2 ml of 200 mm imidazole; and 5 ml of 250 mm imidazole. The fractions collected from these applications were assayed for PCK activity, and the active fractions (100, 150, and 200 mm imidazole washes) were pooled. The proteins in this pool were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitate obtained at each step (corresponding to ammonium sulfate concentrations of 40, 50, 60, and 70% of saturation at 0 °C) was recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g and was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7. The solution corresponding to the pellet obtained between 50 and 60% ammonium sulfate saturation contained about 81% of the total activity. It was diluted with an equal volume of a solution containing 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and 2 mammonium sulfate. The diluted solution was centrifuged at 14,000 × g to remove particulate matters. The enzyme in this supernatant was concentrated in a Microcon 10 concentrator (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), washed on the concentrator's membrane with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 100 mm NaCl (the buffer used for the gel filtration experiment as described below), recovered, and stored in the same buffer at 4 °C. The His tag in the rMsmPCK-His10 was removed by the action of recombinant enterokinase (Novagen, Inc.) in the rEK cleavage/capture buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2), and the cleaving enzyme was removed from the digest by use of the EKapture-Agarose (Novagen, Inc.) at 4 °C. To capture the uncleaved or His-tagged protein from the enzyme solution, it was passed through a 1-ml Superflow Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column bed that was preequilibrated with the rEK cleavage/capture buffer. Then the column bed was washed with 3 ml of the same buffer. The effluents from the loading and wash steps, containing the recombinant enzyme without the His10 tag (rMsmPCK), were combined. The pooled product was concentrated, washed with the gel filtration buffer (see above), and stored in the same buffer at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed with a slab gel according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). The Tris-HCl Ready Gels from Bio-Rad were used for nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The methods for size exclusion chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric measurements, and the determination of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence have been described previously (19Mukhopadhyay B. Purwantini E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1475: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein was assayed according to Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar) by using the dye reagent from Bio-Rad. Two methods were used for assaying the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity, and these were modifications of previously described procedures (29Noce P.S. Utter M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9099-9105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ash D.E. Emig F.A. Chowdhury S.A. Satah Y. Schramm V.L. J. Biol.

One was performed in the direction of oxaloacetate formation. Here, the progress of the PCK reaction was followed by coupling it to the malate dehydrogenase (MDH) reaction and by monitoring NADH + H+ oxidation at 340 nm (29Noce P.S. Utter M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9099-9105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thermophilic MDH fromThermus flavus (Sigma), which was also highly active at 37 °C, was used for this purpose. Unless stated otherwise, the reaction mixture contained 100 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.2, 100 mm KHCO3, 2 mm PEP, 2 mm IDP, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 37 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 units/ml MDH, and 0.25 mm NADH + H+. Each assay was initiated with enzyme addition and conducted at 37 °C. The other assay was performed in the direction of PEP formation (30Ash D.E. Emig F.A. Chowdhury S.A. Satah Y. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7377-7384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Meyuhas O. Boshwitz C.H. Reshef L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 100 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.2, 3 mm malate, 0.2 mm GTP, 1 mm NAD+, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 37 mm DTT, and 6 units/ml MDH. To a temperature-equilibrated reaction mixture MDH was added, and the absorbance at 340 nm was allowed to increase and stabilize. At this stage, PCK was added and progress of the reaction was followed by a further increase in the absorbance at 340 nm. Here, the PCK reaction tends to disturb the established equilibrium of the MDH reaction by consuming OAA, and to counter this effect MDH makes more OAA from malate by reducing NAD+ (30Ash D.E. Emig F.A. Chowdhury S.A. Satah Y. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7377-7384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Meyuhas O. Boshwitz C.H. Reshef L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This assay was also conducted at 37 °C. For pH studies, the HEPES-NaOH buffer was replaced with a buffer that was obtained by adjusting a solution of 50 mm MES, 100 mm Tris, and 50 mm glacial acetic acid to the desired pH value with NaOH; over the pH range used (pH 6–9), the ionic strength of this buffer remained essentially constant (32Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Unless mentioned otherwise, values of the PCK activity are for the OAA formation reaction. All initial rate data were analyzed by using the KinetAsyst program version 1.01 (Intellikinetics, State College, PA). A multiple alignment was generated by use of the ClustalW program (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar) at the PBIL (Pôle Bio-Informatique Lyonnais) site on the World Wide Web. The same program was used for comparing a pair of primary structures to each other. The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene (pck) from M. smegmatis was cloned by polymerase chain reaction by use of the primers that were designed based on the putative pck gene of M. tuberculosis (20Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

The recombinant enzyme was overproduced inE. coli under the control of the T7 promoter. It was synthesized with activity in an NH2-terminal His10-tagged form (rMsmPCK-His10). Fig.1 A shows SDS-PAGE patterns for the whole cell lysate, low spin cell extract (18,000 ×g supernatant) and high spin extract (150,000 ×g supernatant) of E. coli (pBE129–19b) cells that had been induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. These centrifugation steps were sequential (the low spin step followed by the high spin), and no concentration or volume reduction step was involved. Through these steps the protein concentration in the extract dropped 2-fold, but, as seen in Fig. 1 A (analyses with 5 μl of extract from each step), the level for the soluble fraction of heterologously expressed enzyme apparently did not decrease to the same extent. Thus, most of the synthesized rMsmPCK-His10 was present in the cell in a soluble form. Starting from either low-spin (18,000 × g) or high spin (100,000 × g) cell extracts, the recombinant enzyme was purified by use of a Ni2+ affinity-based chromatographic step and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The use of a high spin extract prevented clogging of the column and provided a higher flow rate during chromatography. Nevertheless, both types of extracts provided final products of the same quality. Typically, from 10 g of cell paste, 33 mg of His-tagged enzyme with specific activities of 18–22 OAA-forming units/mg of protein was obtained. Such a preparation exhibited a single band in a native gel (Fig.1 B) and thus was considered homogeneous. The corresponding SDS-PAGE pattern (Fig. 1 C) showed that the enzyme was composed of one or more subunits of an apparent mass of 74 kDa. The His tag was removed from homogeneous rMsmPCK-His10 by the action of enterokinase. Fig. 1 B shows a native-PAGE pattern for the non-His-tagged recombinant protein (rMsmPCK), and Fig. 1 D shows the corresponding SDS-PAGE pattern. The specific activities (OAA forming) of such rMsmPCK preparations were in the 17–20 units/mg range. Upon storage for 2 months at 4 °C in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 100 mm NaCl, the purified rMsmPCK-His10 retained about 75% of the original activity, and the corresponding value for rMsmPCK after a 1-month storage was 76%. Very recently, we obtained a rMsmPCK-His10 preparation with an initial specific activity of 41 units/mg, and it retained 85% of its activity after 5 months of storage at 4 °C. The data in Fig.5 B were obtained with this enzyme. The NH2-terminal sequence for the rMsmPCK was determined to be HMTSATIPGLDTAP. Of this sequence, the first His residue originated from the vector sequence, and the MTSAT sequence that followed was from the polymerase chain reaction primer (designed based on the NH2terminus of putative M. tuberculosis PCK; accession number,P96393; Ref. 20Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

Squares S. Squares R. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6555) Google Scholar); the MTSAT element is also present at the equivalent position in the putative Mycobacterium leprae PCK (accession number, CAB08805). The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrum of the purified rMsmPCK showed three major peaks at them/z values of 71,209 (M + H+), 35,711 (M + 2H+), and 23,917 (M + 3H+). Hence, the subunit molecular mass for the rMsmPCK was 71.2 kDa. From the gel filtration chromatography data, the Stokes radii of the native forms of rMsmPCK and rMsmPCK-His10 were determined to be 38.7 and 39.2 Å, respectively. From the same set of data, the apparent native molecular masses for the non-His-tagged and His-tagged forms of the recombinant enzyme were estimated to be 83.2 and 85.1 kDa, respectively. Thus, both these forms appeared to be monomers. However, a final conclusion in this line must await an accurate determination of the native molecular mass for these proteins by use of a more appropriate method; the molecular mass data derived solely from a gel filtration data set are unreliable (34Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function: Biophysical Chemistry. 2. W. H. Freeman Co., New York1980: 674-675Google Scholar).

(2000)Science 289, 905–920). We have localized the two dimers of L7/L12 within the structure of the 70 S ribosome using two reconstitution approaches together with cryo-electron microscopy and single particle reconstruction. First, the structures were determined for ribosomal cores from which protein L7/L12 had been removed by treatment with NH4Cl and ethanol and for reconstituted ribosomes in which purified L7/L12 had been restored to core particles. Difference mapping revealed that the reconstituted ribosomes had additional density within the L7/L12 shoulder next to protein L11. Second, ribosomes were reconstituted using an L7/L12 variant in which a single cysteine at position 89 in the C-terminal domain was modified with Nanogold (Nanoprobes, Inc.), a 14 Å gold derivative. The reconstruction from cryo-electron microscopy images and difference mapping placed the gold at four interfacial positions.

The finding of multiple sites for the C-terminal domain of L7/L12 suggests that the conformation of this protein may change during the steps of elongation and translocation. The ribosome is the platform for all protein synthesis and the catalyst of peptide bond formation. The centrality of the ribosome is shown by its universality, its conservation throughout all forms of life, and its frequent targeting by toxins and antibiotics (1Cundliffe E. Gale E.F. Cundliffe E. Reynolds P. Richmond M. Waring M. The Molecular Basis of Antibiotic Action. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 402-547Google Scholar). The ribosome has been the subject of scores of studies that have linked the structure of the particle with its mechanism of action in protein synthesis. Traditional electron microscopy studies have played a central role in allowing visualization of the ribosome and its subunits and in the placement of component proteins, segments of its large RNA molecules, and functional sites (2Moore P.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 35-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Green R. Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).Cryo-electron microscopy (EM)1 adds new dimensions to these investigations while confirming the basic observations of earlier work; it allows a description of a native particle frozen in vitreous ice and undistorted by drying and staining, and it permits visualization of the interior of the particle rather than simply its stained or shadowed surfaces. Cryo-EM reconstructions of the ribosome have been generated through independent investigations in two different laboratories. This work has resulted in the attainment of greater resolution in the description of the overall structure of the ribosome (4Matadeen R. Patwardhan A. Gowen B. Orlova E.V. Pape T. Cuff M. Mueller F.

Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Earnest T.N. Noller H.F. Science. 1999; 285: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar).Electron density for protein L7/L12 was not apparent even in the recent 2.4 Å resolution 50 S ribosome structure (14Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2779) Google Scholar), and the exact position of the molecule within the ribosome remains nebulous. The protein L7/L12 is central to the translocation step of translation, and it is the only ribosomal protein that is present in multiple copies (for review see Ref. 15Traut R.R. Oleinikov A. Makarov E. Jokhadze G. Perroud B. Wang B. Nierhaus K. Franceschi F. Subramaniam A. Erdmann V. Wittmann-Leibold B. The Translational Apparatus. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 521-532Crossref Google Scholar). The monomer of L7/L12 has a molecular mass of 12 kDa and is organized in the ribosome as two dimers bound to one copy of protein L10, which in turn anchors the pentamer to the large subunit. The L7/L12 monomer includes two distinct structural domains that are thought to be linked by a flexible hinge (residues 37–52); the elongated helical N-terminal domains (residues 1–36) are responsible for dimer interaction and binding to L10, and the larger globular C-terminal domains (residues 53–120) interact with elongation factors. The crystal structure of the Escherichia coli L7/L12 C-terminal domain has been solved at 1.7 Å resolution (16Leijonmarck M. Liljas A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 555-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Models of the E. coli L7/L12 indicate that the dimer can span up to 125 Å when extended (17Traut R.R. Dey D. Bochkariov D.E. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Hamman B. Jameson D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A recent crystal structure of L12 from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima shows two alternative conformations for the hinge region, an extended coil or a long α-helix that folds back on the N-terminal domain forming a compact overall protein structure (18Wahl M.C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The flexible hinge conformation agrees better with the body of evidence that indicates that theE. coli L7/L12 protein has a great deal of overall flexibility (19Dey D. Oleinikov A.V. Traut R.R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).L7/L12 is easily and selectively dissociated from and reconstituted into the ribosome (20Hamel E. Koka M. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When it is removed, one of the most recognizable features seen in images of negatively stained 50 S particles such as the stalk (or arm) disappears. The stalk and full activity are restored when L7/L12 is added back, and the ribosome nomenclature has equated L7/L12 and the stalk. A body of evidence suggests that L7/L12 exists in at least two conformations, and its mobility is essential for its function (19Dey D. Oleinikov A.V. Traut R.R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1995; 77: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. Jameson D.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1670-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The experiments described in this study demonstrate a direct approach to the placement of ribosomal proteins that is based on ribosome reconstitution and is related to the classic “single omission reconstitutions” of Nomura (23Nomura M.

C.1990: 3-55Google Scholar). The cryo-EM structure of 70 S ribosomes, which lack a single protein component, L7/L12, is compared with that of the reconstitutes, which include the protein. Some conformational changes are observed in the ribosome upon the binding of L7/L12 in regions previously noted to be conformationally flexible (4Matadeen R. Patwardhan A. Gowen B. Orlova E.V.

In addition, we have incorporated a variant form of L7/L12 that has been modified with Nanogold, a 14 Å gold complex (24Hainfeld J.F. Furuya F.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) that is easily seen in cryo-electron micrographs. Difference mapping, together with Nanogold labeling, places the N-terminal domains of protein L7/L12 on the 50 S subunit body next to protein L11 and indicates four allowed sites for the L7/L12 C-terminal domains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation and Characterization of RibosomesE. coli ribosomes were isolated (25Olson H.M. Lasater L.S. Cann P.A. Glitz D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15196-15204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tight couples were prepared as described previously (26Frank J. Penczek P. Grassucci R. Srivastava S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The treatment of 70 S ribosomes with 0.5m NH4Cl and 50% ethanol at 0 °C dissociated protein L7/L12 and generated cores that were isolated by sedimentation (27Tokimatsu H. Strycharz W.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type and Cys-89 L7/L12 were prepared as described previously (28Zecherle G.N. Oleinikov A. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5889-5896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of 70 S core particles with an 8-fold molar excess of either native or Nanogold-modified L7/L12 yielded wild type and Nanogold-modified reconstituted ribosomes, respectively. Wild-type reconstitutes were separated from free protein by sedimentation through a 10% sucrose pad (28Zecherle G.N. Oleinikov A. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5889-5896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nanogold-modified reconstituted 70 S ribosomes were isolated on 10–30% sucrose gradients in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mmNH4Cl, and 10 mm MgCl2 by centrifugation in a Sorvall AH-650 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C. The fractions, which contained 70 S ribosomes, were used for microscopy after dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm NH4Cl, and 10 mmMgCl2. Ribosomes and reconstituted ribosome preparations were analyzed by electron microscopy of negatively stained samples as described previously (25Olson H.M. Lasater L.S. Cann P.A. Glitz D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15196-15204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To observe 50 S subunits, portions of our ribosome preparations were dissociated by incubation in buffer containing 1 mm Mg2+ and were negatively stained. The methods used in the extraction of ribosomal proteins (29Louie D.F. Resing K.A. Lewis T.S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were adapted from these previously published procedures.Preparation of Nanogold-labeled Protein L7/L12Immediately after reduction with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NH4Cl for 1 h at 37 °C and the removal of the reducing agent by passage through two successive Bio-Rad Bio-Spin 6 columns equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, approximately 4 nmol of recombinant Cys-89 L7/L12 in 70–80 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, were added to an excess of monomaleimido-Nanogold reagent (Nanoprobes Inc., Stony Brook, NY) suspended in 30 μl of isopropyl alcohol. Water was added to obtain a final volume of 180 μl, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nanogold-modified protein was isolated by size exclusion HPLC on a Beckman Spherogel-TSK 2000 SW column (7.5 × 300 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 20 μl of aliquots of each of the 500-μl fractions were run on duplicate 12.5% Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gels (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar). One gel was stained for proteins with silver stain (Bio-Rad), and the other gel was stained for Nanogold with the LI Silver stain (Nanoprobes, Inc.). The fractions with the highest concentration of the separated labeled protein were concentrated and used for ribosome reconstitution as described above.Cryo-electron MicroscopyRibosome samples were prepared for cryo-electron microscopy according to previously published procedures (33Dubochet J. Adrian M. Chang J.J. Homo J.C. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Schultz P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 34Wagenknecht T. Frank J. Boublik M. Nurse K. Ofengand J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 5-μl droplet of sample was applied to a holey carbon-coated molybdenum grid that was freshly coated with a thin (∼20 Å) carbon film. After 30–50 s, the grid was blotted from both sides for 2–3 s (35Cyrklaff M. Adrian M. Dubochet J. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1990; 16: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and plunged into an ethane slush. The grid was immediately transferred to and stored in liquid nitrogen. Microscopy was performed on a Philips CM120 transmission cryo-electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) equipped with a LaB6filament, a Gatan cryo-holder (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA), and a Gatan slow-scan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (yttrium-aluminum garnet (YAG) scintillator, 1024 × 1024 pixels). Images were collected under low dose conditions (<20 electrons/Å2) at a nominal magnification of × 45,000 and at three defocus levels (−0.5, −1.0, and −1.5 μm). The digital images have a pixel size of 4.1 Å as determined by calibration with a catalase crystal.Image ProcessingInteractive selection of individual ribosome images as 100 × 100 pixel fields, the exclusion of density from nearby particles, and the application of a circular mask were performed with the QVIEW software package (36Shah A.K. Stewart P.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Subsequent processing was performed with the IMAGIC software package (37van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Initially, a set of 4447 images of 70 S tight couple particles (collected at −1.5 μm defocus and low-pass filtered to 30 Å and density inverted) was translationally aligned and then subjected to multivariate statistical analysis and classification essentially as described previously (38Chiu C.Y. Cary R.B. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to obtain 500 class-sum images. The Euler angles of the 347 class-sum images with the highest membership were calculated by angular reconstitution, and a preliminary three-dimensional reconstruction was calculated by exact filtered back projection (39Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. Technol. 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). After three rounds of refinement by the anchor set method (37van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), the three-dimensional reconstruction of the 347 class-sum images was used as an initial reference to find the Euler angles of the individual 4447 particle images, low-pass filtered to 23 Å. After two rounds of refinement, the final reconstruction of these images was used in turn as an initial reference model for the determination of the Euler angles of images of L7/L12-reconstituted ribosomes and core particles.Images collected at three different defocus values (−0.5, −1.0, and −1.5 μm) were combined analytically after deconvolution and correction for the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope as described previously (38Chiu C.Y. Cary R.B. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), with the exception that the decay constant was 25 nm2, and the Fermi filter resolution cutoff was 1/8.2 Å−1. The data sets of L7/L12-reconstituted ribosomes and core particles each underwent three rounds of anchor set refinement. The final reconstruction of L7/L12-reconstituted ribosomes included data from 8565 images, and that of the core particles included data from 9739 images. The Euler angles for 486 contrast transfer function-corrected particle images of Nanogold-labeled ribosomes were determined by using the wild type L7/L12-reconstituted ribosome reconstruction as a reference. After calculating a preliminary Nanogold-labeled reconstruction, a subset of the best 317 Nanogold-labeled particle images was selected by comparison of the particle images with their corresponding reprojections.The resolution of the reconstructions was calculated by the Fourier shell correlation method, splitting the data sets into two halves, calculating two half-reconstructions, and assuming the 0.5 correlation threshold as the resolution limit (40Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I.S. Grassucci R.A. Jünemann R. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Ribosome reconstructions were displayed with the AVS visualization package (Advanced Visualization System, Inc.) at isosurface threshold levels chosen to include a volume of 2.9 × 106 Å3. The difference map between the wild type L7/L12-reconstituted ribosome and the core ribosome was calculated in IMAGIC after filtering the input maps to a 26 Å resolution. Difference maps were also calculated using reconstructions obtained from randomly generated half-sets of our core and reconstituted ribosome images. These maps gave the same results as the one with the entire data sets. Difference density not clearly associated with the ribosome was removed with a circular mask (260 Å diameter), and small regions of disconnected density were computationally removed. The difference density between the reconstituted and core ribosome reconstructions is displayed with the isocontour level set at three standard deviations (3ς) above the mean value.The resolution of the Nanogold-labeled reconstruction was evaluated both by the Fourier shell correlation between two half-reconstructions and by the Fourier shell correlation between the full non-split Nanogold reconstruction with the full reconstruction of the wild type L7/L12-reconstituted ribosome. Difference maps were calculated between the Nanogold-labeled ribosome and the wild type reconstituted ribosome after filtering the input maps to either 45 Å or 60 Å resolution. The 45 Å resolution Nanogold difference density is displayed with the isocontour level set at five standard deviations (5ς) above the mean value.RESULTSPreparation and Characterization of Cores and Reconstituted RibosomesE. coli ribosomes and tight couples were prepared by well established procedures (25Olson H.M. Lasater L.S. Cann P.A. Glitz D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15196-15204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L7/L12 is easily extracted from ribosomes as described previously (for details see Refs.20Hamel E. Koka M. Nakamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 22Dey D. Bochkariov D.E. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1670-1676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We chose the gentlest possible condition that afforded the maximal removal of L7/L12 and the minimal extraction of other ribosomal proteins. 70 S tight couples were treated with NH4Cl and ethanol on ice, and the resulting 70 S ribosome cores were isolated by sedimentation. It is well established that L7/L12 forms the characteristic stalk observed in negatively stained 50 S subunits (41Olson H.M. Sommer A. Tewari D.S. Traut R.R. Glitz D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6924-6932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the removal of L7/L12 in our core preparation, we used EM to examine negatively stained 50 S subunits of our ribosome preparations. In the tight couple 50 S subunits, the L7/L12 stalk was readily identified, whereas in the 50 S subunits of the cores, a complete absence of stalks was noted. To establish that recombinant wild type L7/L12 or Nanogold-labeled L7/L12 is incorporated specifically into ribosomes, we viewed 50 S subunits of the reconstitutes and observed nearly complete restoration of stalks.The protein composition of our ribosome preparations was confirmed by HPLC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Ribosomal proteins were extracted from 70 S tight couples, 70 S cores, and L7/L12 70 S reconstituted ribosomes and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. In Fig.1 A, the arrowidentifies a double peak that elutes last in the chromatogram of the tight couple ribosomal protein extract. This double peak elutes at the same position as a purified L7/L12 standard and contains a species of molecular mass compatible with protein L7/L12 as determined by mass spectrometry. The elution profile of an extract from 70 S cores lacks the L7/L12 double peak (Fig. 1 B), whereas the L7/L12 double peak is restored in the chromatogram of the protein extract from L7/L12-reconstituted ribosomes as shown in Fig. 1 C. No other major differences were observed among the chromatograms. Also, the analysis of the supernatant of the NH4Cl/ethanol extract of tight couples revealed that the protein L7/L12 accounted for approximately 95% of the protein, and that none of the minor peaks was compatible with ribosomal proteins. We conclude that our means of extraction of L7/L12 yields cores that are greatly depleted in protein L7/L12 while not removing any significant amounts of other ribosomal proteins. In addition, the cores incorporate purified wild type or Nanogold-labeled L7/L12 protein efficiently. The level of L7/L12 in the reconstituted ribosomes was estimated to be ∼75% by evaluating the relative peak areas in the HPLC profiles and >90% by EM of negatively stained samples.Structures of Wild Type L7/L12-reconstituted Ribosomes and of 70 S Core Particles and Difference MappingOur goal was to separately determine and then compare the structures of ribosomal core particles and reconstitutes as a means of identifying the location of protein L7/L12 within the ribosome. A preliminary reconstruction of 70 S tight couples was used as a reference model for determining the orientational angles of particle images of both 70 S cores and L7/L12-reconstituted ribosomes. After correction of the particle images for the contrast transfer function of the electron microscope and three rounds of refinement, the two final reconstructions had a resolution of 26 Å at the 0.5 correlation cutoff of the Fourier shell correlation (Fig.2) (40Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I.S. Grassucci R.A. Jünemann R. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional maps of the L7/L12-reconstituted ribosome (green) and the 70 S cores (blue) are shown in Fig. 3. As shown by HPLC and mass spectroscopy, the preparations of L7/L12-reconstituted ribosomes and the 70 S cores differ only in the four copies of protein L7/L12. The absence of this protein results in a difference of 48 kDa in the 2.5-MDa mass of the entire ribosome. Thus, difference mapping is needed to visualize the location of L7/L12. A difference map was calculated between the reconstituted and core particle reconstructions revealing significant difference density in the L7/L12 shoulder region (red). The volume of the observed difference density corresponds to 19 kDa of protein. Because the N-terminal domain is known to anchor L7/L12 to the ribosome and the hinge region is flexible, we propose that the difference density corresponds to four copies of the N-terminal domain (15 kDa) and a portion of the four hinge regions (4 of 6 kDa). We presume that the C-terminal domains of L7/L12 are not observed in the difference map because of either static or dynamic structural disorder.Figure 2Resolution assessment of cryo-EM reconstructions.

Pre-steady-state kinetic experiments have been employed to investigate the cooperative interactions between the motor domains of the MC1 dimer and to establish the ATPase mechanism. Our results indicate that the active sites of dimeric Ncd free in solution are not equivalent; ADP is held more tightly at one site than at the other. Upon microtubule binding, fast release of ADP from the first motor domain is stimulated at 18 s−1, yet rate-limiting ADP release from the second motor domain occurs at 1.4 s−1. We propose that the head with the low affinity for ADP binds the microtubule first to establish the directional bias of the microtubule·Ncd intermediate where one motor domain is bound to the microtubule with the second head detached and directed toward the minus-end of the microtubule. The force generating cycle is initiated as ATP binds to the empty site of the microtubule-bound head. ATP hydrolysis at head 1 is required for head 2 to bind to the microtubule. The kinetics indicate that two ATP molecules are required for a single step and force generation for minus-end directed movement generated by this non-processive dimeric motor.

Conventional kinesin, the founding member of the kinesin superfamily, moves membranous organelles from the neuron cell body to the synapse (reviewed in Refs. 5Hirokawa N.

The motor domains of Ncd and kinesin are ∼40% identical in amino acid sequence, and their three-dimensional atomic structures are nearly superimposable (8Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 9Sablin E.P. Kull F.J. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J.

Despite this high degree of similarity, there are striking differences in their motor behavior that are important for biological function in vivo. First, Ncd translocates to the minus-end of microtubules, while kinesin moves to the plus-end (2Walker R.A. Salmon E.D. Endow S.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 4McDonald H.B. Stewart R.J. Goldstein L.S.B.

Additionally, kinesin is a highly processive motor, taking several steps per encounter with the microtubule, while Ncd has been shown to be non-processive, both mechanically and chemically (12Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 13DeCastro M.J. Ho C.H. Stewart R.J.

Ncd and kinesin also differ in their motility and ATPase rates; Ncd is a much slower motor.Comparison of the kinesin and Ncd crystal structures suggests that despite the structural similarity of the individual catalytic motor domains, there is a different overall orientation of the heads within the Ncd dimer in comparison to those of the kinesin dimer, both in solution and when bound to the microtubule (16Kozielski F.

The neck linker, a sequence of ∼15 amino acids directly adjacent to the catalytic core, has been implicated in specifying the direction of movement for kinesin superfamily members and to be important for force generation (17Sablin E.P.

There is high sequence homology among minus-end directed kinesin motors, yet this neck linker sequence is different from that of the plus-end directed kinesins. Furthermore, analysis of kinesin-Ncd chimeric motors showed that the amino acid sequence of the neck linker did indeed determine the polarity of microtubule movements (22Henningsen U. Schliwa M.

The neck linker became immobile and extended toward the microtubule plus-end, yet the catalytic core did not shift its orientation on the microtubule significantly. Furthermore, in the presence of ADP, the neck linker returned to a state of high mobility comparable to solution conditions in the absence of microtubules (K·ADP).

This image is quite different from the Mt·kinesin EM reconstructions and has been cited as a structural intermediate important for Ncd minus-end directed movement. Our experimental approach has been to explore the mechanistic features of the Mt·Ncd ATPase that establish this intermediate and to account for the structural transitions during the ATPase cycle to explain the direction of Ncd motion and its non-processive motility.Previous studies have defined a minimal kinetic mechanism for the Mt·Ncd complex (14Pechatnikova E.

However, it is still unclear how the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis for Ncd may relate to its reversed directionality. Here we report that the two heads of dimeric Ncd are not identical. Gel filtration and stopped-flow kinetics reveal that the two heads within the dimer are different in solution in the absence of microtubules, with one head binding ADP weakly and one head binding ADP tightly. Stopped-flow experiments indicate that the two heads of the dimer release ADP at different rates after interacting with the microtubule. We propose that the head with the low affinity for ADP binds the microtubule first to establish the intermediate captured by cryo-EM with the detached head directed toward the minus-end of the microtubule. The kinetics reveal cooperative interactions within the dimer that account for the orientation of this directionally biased Mt·Ncd intermediate. The kinetics also establish a distinctive ATPase mechanism for Ncd and provide insight into the mechanochemistry variability among kinesin superfamily members. Ncd1 is a microtubule-activated ATPase of the kinesin superfamily involved in spindle assembly and stabilization during female meiosis and the early divisions of the Drosophila embryo (1Endow S.A.

Conventional kinesin, the founding member of the kinesin superfamily, moves membranous organelles from the neuron cell body to the synapse (reviewed in Refs. 5Hirokawa N.

The motor domains of Ncd and kinesin are ∼40% identical in amino acid sequence, and their three-dimensional atomic structures are nearly superimposable (8Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 9Sablin E.P. Kull F.J. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J.

Despite this high degree of similarity, there are striking differences in their motor behavior that are important for biological function in vivo. First, Ncd translocates to the minus-end of microtubules, while kinesin moves to the plus-end (2Walker R.A. Salmon E.D. Endow S.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 4McDonald H.B. Stewart R.J. Goldstein L.S.B.

Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Additionally, kinesin is a highly processive motor, taking several steps per encounter with the microtubule, while Ncd has been shown to be non-processive, both mechanically and chemically (12Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1989; 342: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 13DeCastro M.J. Ho C.H. Stewart R.J.

Ncd and kinesin also differ in their motility and ATPase rates; Ncd is a much slower motor. Comparison of the kinesin and Ncd crystal structures suggests that despite the structural similarity of the individual catalytic motor domains, there is a different overall orientation of the heads within the Ncd dimer in comparison to those of the kinesin dimer, both in solution and when bound to the microtubule (16Kozielski F.

The neck linker, a sequence of ∼15 amino acids directly adjacent to the catalytic core, has been implicated in specifying the direction of movement for kinesin superfamily members and to be important for force generation (17Sablin E.P.

For Ncd, the neck linker includes 13 amino acids N-terminal to the catalytic core. There is high sequence homology among minus-end directed kinesin motors, yet this neck linker sequence is different from that of the plus-end directed kinesins. Furthermore, analysis of kinesin-Ncd chimeric motors showed that the amino acid sequence of the neck linker did indeed determine the polarity of microtubule movements (22Henningsen U. Schliwa M.

The neck linker became immobile and extended toward the microtubule plus-end, yet the catalytic core did not shift its orientation on the microtubule significantly. Furthermore, in the presence of ADP, the neck linker returned to a state of high mobility comparable to solution conditions in the absence of microtubules (K·ADP). These results with monomeric kinesin K349 viewed within the context of the alternating site mechanism of ATP hydrolysis (26Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This image is quite different from the Mt·kinesin EM reconstructions and has been cited as a structural intermediate important for Ncd minus-end directed movement. Our experimental approach has been to explore the mechanistic features of the Mt·Ncd ATPase that establish this intermediate and to account for the structural transitions during the ATPase cycle to explain the direction of Ncd motion and its non-processive motility. Previous studies have defined a minimal kinetic mechanism for the Mt·Ncd complex (14Pechatnikova E. Taylor E.W. Biophys.

However, it is still unclear how the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis for Ncd may relate to its reversed directionality. Here we report that the two heads of dimeric Ncd are not identical. Gel filtration and stopped-flow kinetics reveal that the two heads within the dimer are different in solution in the absence of microtubules, with one head binding ADP weakly and one head binding ADP tightly. Stopped-flow experiments indicate that the two heads of the dimer release ADP at different rates after interacting with the microtubule. We propose that the head with the low affinity for ADP binds the microtubule first to establish the intermediate captured by cryo-EM with the detached head directed toward the minus-end of the microtubule. The kinetics reveal cooperative interactions within the dimer that account for the orientation of this directionally biased Mt·Ncd intermediate.

Peet R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1985; 43: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that p56lck associates with the cytoplasmic domains of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors (2Barber E.K. Dasgupta J.D. Schlossman S.F. Trevillyan J.M.

Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1991; 252: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). By a series of biochemical analysis, it has been shown that p56lck plays a key role in signal transduction mediated through the T cell receptor (TCR) complex in mature T cells (4Alberola-Ila J. Takaki S. Kerner J.D. Perlmutter R.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 125-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 5Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin.

It also contributes to signaling through the pre-TCR complex, thereby playing an essential role in thymocyte development. lck-deficient mice and transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant negative form of p56lckck exhibit severe impairment in the expansion of CD4/CD8-double negative immature thymocytes (6Molina T.J. Kishihara K. Siderovski D.P. van Ewijk W. Narendran A. Timms E. Wakeham A. Paige C.J. Hartmann K.U. Veillette A. Mak T.W.

A simple doubling of wild type p56lck expression levels in immature thymocytes in transgenic mice was sufficient to block maturation of thymocytes (8Abraham K.M. Levin S.D. Marth J.D. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the transcriptional control of the lck gene must be tightly regulated to express adequate amounts of p56lck at the right developmental stage during thymopoiesis. The lck gene is transcribed from two structurally unrelated promoters (9Voronova A.F. Adler H.T. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell.

The lck proximal promoter is positioned immediately adjacent to the first coding exon, and is active in the thymus, but is essentially silent in peripheral T cells. The distal promoter is located far 5′-upstream from the proximal promoter and is active during all developmental stages of T-lineage cells. Since the proximal promoter becomes active only at an early developmental stage of T-lymphopoiesis (14Reynolds P.J. Lesley J. Trotter J. Schulte R. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1991; 173: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the transcriptional regulators of this promoter play a critical role in the developmental program for T-lineage cells. The 5′-flanking sequence of the lck proximal promoter that is critical for the thymocyte-specific and developmental stage-specific expression has been defined by transgenic mouse models (16Allen J.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2758-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Transgenic animals bearing truncations in the mouse lck proximal promoter revealed that as little as 584 bases of the 5′-flanking sequence can confer appropriate developmentally regulated expression of heterologous reporter genes. The 5′ sequence critical for the promoter activity contains several binding sites for nuclear proteins. Among those nuclear proteins, “B-factor,” which binds to the G-rich stretch within the −365 to −328 region was reported as a candidate for the critical transcriptional regulator. B-factor is only found in cells expressing the lck transcript derived from the proximal promoter, namely thymocytes and thymoma cell lines such as LSTRA and EL4 (16Allen J.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2758-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the B-factor and identified an 86-kDa Krüppel-type zinc finger protein, which had been cloned previously as a binding protein to the CD3δ gene enhancer, as a component of the B-factor. The NH2-terminal half of the protein is 90% identical to htβ, a 49-kDa protein that binds to the human TCR Vβ8.1 gene promoter and the TCR α gene silencer (17Wang Y. Kobori J.A. Hood L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that mtβ is the murine homologue of htβ, and the reported amino acid sequence of htβ is a part of its full-length protein. mtβ is ubiquitously expressed in various cell lines and tissues. We re-evaluated distribution of the B-factor and found it is also expressed in various cell lines and tissues. However, the transcriptional activity of mtβ measured by reporter constructs carrying the B-factor binding site is observed only in T-lineage cells. The transcription from the lck proximal promoter is greatly impaired by introducing mutations in the B-factor binding site or by expression of mtβ antisense mRNAs. Our results demonstrate that mtβ is one of the critical transactivators driving the lckproximal promoter and that its activity is regulated in a tissue-specific manner.

For −3200/pGL2, the NotI-BamHI (positions −3200 to +37) fragment of the p1017 plasmid (20Chaffin K.E. Beals C.R. Wilkie T.M. Forbush K.A. Simon M.I. Perlmutter R.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3821-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) containing the entirelck proximal promoter region was blunt-ended and ligated to the XhoI, HindIII-digested, blunt-ended pGL2-Basic plasmid. For −433GL2, two SmaI fragments (position −3200 to −1675 and −1675 to −433) were removed from −3200/pGL2 and self-ligated. For −240/pGL2, two KpnI fragments (position −3200 to −584 and −584 to −240) were removed from −3200/pGL2. For −584/pGL2, the KpnI fragment (position −584 to −240) from −3200/pGL2 was inserted into theKpnI site of −240/pGL2. To construct reporter plasmids carrying the B-factor binding site and TATA box, −365/−328 and −365/−328mut oligonucleotides (see section above) were inserted upstream of the TATA box of pLuc-S (gift from Drs. P. Doerfler and M. Busslinger (21Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)), resulting in pLuc-wild and pLuc-mut, respectively. Point mutations were introduced into the mtβ binding sites of −3200/pGL2 and −433/pGL2 by PCR-based directed mutagenesis using −365/−328mut oligonucleotides to generate −3200-mut/pGL2 and −433-mut/pGL2, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from various cell lines using the acid guanidine isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA were fractionated through electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in the presence of 0.66 m formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membranes (GeneScreen, DuPont). Mouse multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from OriGene Technology (Rockville, MA). Membranes carrying RNA were hybridized with a 2.0-kilobase EcoRI fragment of mtβ cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random priming method. After hybridization, membranes were analyzed using a BAS1000 Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). After removing the mtβ probe, the membranes were re-hybridized with a human β-actin probe to normalize the amount of RNA loaded per lane. A 1135-base pairEcoRV-ApaI fragment encoding Ser51 to Gly428 and a 1510-base pair ScaI-NotI fragment encoding Thr446 to Gly769 of mtβ protein were subcloned into the bacterial expression vectors pGEX-4T-1 and pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. The resulting plasmids were used to transform BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI). Recombinant glutathione S-transferase-mtβ fusion proteins were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and affinity-purified by binding to glutathione-linked Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion proteins were further purified by gel filtration and used to immunize rabbits. Rabbit polyclonal anti-mtβ antibodies were immunopurified on Sepharose-4B beads covalently coupled with the respective glutathione S-transferase-mtβ fusion proteins used as immunogens. Cells were harvested and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) for 5 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, resulting clear cell lysates were subjected to SDS-8% PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 10% methanol). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS overnight at 4 °C, membranes were incubated with appropriately diluted primary antibodies. Membranes were washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit IgG (Cappel Organon Technica, Durham, NC). After washing, bound antibodies on membranes were detected using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and x-ray film (Fuji Film). Splenic B cells were purified by negative sorting using anti-CD43 monoclonal antibody and a magnetic cell sorting system (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Splenic T cells were purified by negative sorting using anti-B220 and anti-Mac1 monoclonal antibodies and magnetic cell sorting. Total RNA or mRNA purified using Micro-FastTrack kit (Invitrogen) was subjected to cDNA synthesis using random hexamers (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Serial dilution (3- or 2-fold) of the cDNA reaction mixtures was subjected to PCR amplification using the following primers: distal-sense, 5′-ATGTGAATAGGCCAGAAGAC-3′; proximal-sense, 5′-TCTGAGCTGACGATCTCGG-3′; lck antisense, 5′-GATCTTGTAATGTTTCACCAC-3′; β-actin-sense, 5′-ACACTGTGCCCATCTACCAG-3′; β-actin-antisense, 5′-CTAGAAGCACTTGCGGTGCA-3′; G3PDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phophate dehydrogenase)-sense, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; G3PDH-antisense, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′; HGPRT (hypoxantine guanine phophoribosyltransferase)-sense, 5′-CGTCGTGATTAGCGATGATGAACC-3′; HGPRT-antisense, 5′-ACTGCTTAACCAGGGAAAGCAAAG-3′. The conditions for PCR amplification were 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for the lck or HGPRT transcripts and 27 cycles of the above for β-actin or G3PDH transcripts using a PCR Thermal Cycler MP (TaKaRa). The resulting PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Cells (3 × 106) were suspended in 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transferred to a 4-mm gap cuvette and mixed with 10 μg of reporter firefly luciferase plasmids, 1 μg of renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (Promega). In some experiments, 10 μg of pcDNA3-mtβ or a control pcDNA3 was added in addition to the reporter plasmids. Cells were transfected at 960 microfarads and 250 V using a Gene Pulser electroporation apparatus (Bio-Rad). Cells were harvested 12 h after transfection, and luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using the Dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized by the renilla luciferase activity to normalize for the transfection efficiency of each sample. In experiments using pcDNA3-ASmtβ, EL4 cells were transfected with 15 μg of pcDNA3-ASmtβ or control pcDNA3, together with 3 μg of reporter firefly luciferase plasmids and 1 μg of pRL-TK. Cells were harvested 30 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured. To analyze the amounts of mtβ protein and the endogenous lck transcripts, cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3-ASmtβ or pcDNA3, together with 1 μg of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). Cells expressing GFP were sorted using a FACS Vantage cell sorter (Becton-Dickinson) at 30 or 36 h after transfection. Sorted cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-mtβ or anti-tubulin antibodies or were subjected to RT-PCR analysis. A nuclear factor termed “B-factor” binds to a G-rich stretch located at −365 to −328 from the transcriptional initiation site of the lck proximal promoter, and its expression correlates well with the activity of the promoter (16Allen J.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2758-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Becauselck expression driven by the proximal promoter occurs early during lymphopoiesis (14Reynolds P.J. Lesley J. Trotter J. Schulte R. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1991; 173: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the B-factor would be one of the transcription factors playing critical roles in early lymphopoiesis. Ikaros regulates the early lymphopoiesis or the commitment for lymphocytes as demonstrated in theIkaros-deficient mice (22Georgopoulos K. Bigby M. Wang J.H. Molnar A. Wu P. Winandy S. Sharpe A. Cell. 1994; 79: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Ikaros has been shown to bind to a G-rich sequence of the CD3δ gene enhancer (23Georgopoulos K. Moore D.D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), although the high affinity binding sites for Ikaros are not G-rich (24Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We examined whether the B-factor contains Ikaros orIkaros-related proteins by EMSAs. Nuclear extract of a thymoma cell line, LSTRA, contains the B-factor binding to the −365 to −328 G-rich sequence (−365/−328) of the lck proximal promoter (Fig. 1 A) as shown previously (16Allen J.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2758-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The binding was specific, since it was competed by unlabeled −365/−328 oligonucleotides, but not by the −365/−328 oligonucleotides carrying mutations in the G-rich sequence (−365/−328mut). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the binding of B-factor to the −365/−328 probe was competed by δA sequences, a functional element of the CD3δ gene enhancer. The δA consists of a CRE (cyclic AMP response element)-like region and a G-rich site similar to the B-factor binding site (25Georgopoulos K. Morgan B.A. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The binding of B-factor to δA was mediated by the G-rich site, because mutation at the G-rich site (δA-G) but not at the CRE-like site (δA-CRE) abrogated the competition with the −365/−328 probe. This binding characteristic of B-factor to δA sequence was similar to that of Ikaros(23Georgopoulos K. Moore D.D. Derfler B. Science. 1992; 258: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, the high affinity Ikaros binding oligonucleotides (IkarosBS) (24Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) did not show any competition with −365/−328. During the cloning of Ikaros, a cDNA clone encoding a zinc finger protein (mtβ, see below) was simultaneously cloned by its ability to bind to the CD3δ enhancer.2 We examined whether antibodies against Ikaros or mtβ could react with B-factor. Anti-Ikaros antibodies did not affect B-factor complex formation (Fig. 1 C), confirming thatIkaros is not a component of B-factor. Interestingly, anti-mtβ antibodies efficiently supershifted the B-factor complex (Fig. 1 D). A similar result was obtained using nuclear extracts of EL4, a lymphoma cell line in which the lckproximal promoter is active (Fig. 1 E). These results demonstrate that mtβ is a component of the B-factor that binds to the −365 to −328 region of the mouse lck proximal promoter. The deduced amino acid sequence of mtβ contains an amino-terminal acidic domain, four tandem C2H2 Krüppel-type zinc finger motifs (26Bray P. Lichter P. Thiesen H.J. Ward D.C. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9563-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and two basic domains, located upstream and downstream of the zinc finger cluster (data not shown). A data base search by BLAST identified a human homologue, htβ, a 49-kDa protein that binds to the Vβ8.1 promoter and the Vα silencer of the T cell receptor genes (17Wang Y. Kobori J.A. Hood L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence encoding the NH2-terminal half of the mtβ is 90% identical to htβ, and their deduced amino acid sequences are 95% identical. The 3′-half of the mtβ coding region has 91% identity with the 3′-untranslated region of the reported htβ cDNA. These indicate that mtβ is the murine homologue of htβ and that the reported htβ cDNA sequence has a one-base deletion that causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon. During this study, several cDNAs that have identical sequences with mtβ have been reported: BFCOL1 that binds to the proximal promoters of the type I collagen genes (27Hasegawa T. Takeuchi A. Miyaishi O. Isobe K. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4915-4923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and BERF-1, a 89-kDa protein that binds to a muscle-specific enhancer of the β-enolase gene (28Passantino R. Antona V. Barbieri G. Rubino P. Melchionna R. Cossu G. Feo S. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 484-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the rat and human homologue of the protein, ZBP-89, has been shown to bind to promoter regions of the gastrin gene (29Merchant J.L. Iyer G.R. Taylor B.R. Kitchen J.R. Mortensen E.R. Wang Z. Flintoft R.J. Michel J.B. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and the ornithine decarboxylase promoter (30Law G.L. Itoh H. Law D.J.

It has subsequently been reported that the same zinc finger protein also binds to the p21WAF1 gene (31Hasegawa T. Xiao H. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the matrix metalloproteinase-3 gene (32Ye S. Whatling C. Watkins H. Henney A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the pTα gene (33Reizis B. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the vimentin gene (34Wieczorek E. Lin Z. Perkins E.B. Law D.J. Merchant J.L. Zehner Z.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12879-12888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We then asked whether recombinant mtβ forms the B-factor complex. Recombinant mtβ expressed in COS7 cells was detected as a band around 105 kDa in immunoblots (Fig. 2 A). An endogenous simian homologue of mtβ in COS7 cells was detected at the same position as the recombinant mtβ when the blot was overexposed (data not shown). mtβ protein appeared to migrate more slowly in SDS-PAGE than its estimated molecular size, as is consistent with the observation for BFCOL1 by Hasegawa et al. (27Hasegawa T. Takeuchi A. Miyaishi O. Isobe K. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4915-4923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In EMSA, a residual amount of the B-factor complex was detected in COS7 cells that derived from the endogenous simian mtβ-homologue protein. Overexpression of mtβ resulted in a significant increase of the amount of the B-factor complex (Fig. 2 B). The entire complex was supershifted by the addition of anti-mtβ antibodies. These results strongly indicate that mtB by itself, or in combination with proteins present in COS7 cells, forms the B-factor complex that binds to the −365 to −328 region of the lck promoter. In a previous study, the strong correlation between the lckproximal promoter activity and amounts of B-factor has been reported (16Allen J.M. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2758-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the expression of mtβ mRNA in various cell lines and tissues. As shown in Fig.3 A, two mRNA species, with estimated sizes of 9.0 and 4.2 kilobase, were detected. Mtβ mRNA expression was observed in all cell lines tested and was independent of the lck proximal promoter activity. In mice, the mtβ transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. The mRNA was abundant in thymus where the proximal promoter is active; however, significant amounts of mRNA were also detected in all tissues, especially in the heart, kidney, and liver (Fig.3 B). We conclude that there is no correlation betweenlck proximal promoter activity and the expression levels of mtβ mRNA. The expression level of mtβ protein might be controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. To test this possibility, we measured mtβ protein levels by immunoblots of whole cell extracts isolated from various cell lines and primary mouse lymphoid cells. The mtβ protein was det"

It is also involved in preventing the development of colorectal tumors. Studies using “knockout” approaches demonstrated that Cdx-2 is haplo-insufficient in certain tissues including the intestines but not the pancreatic islets. The mechanisms, especially transcription factors, which regulate Cdx-2 expression, are virtually unknown. We found previously that Cdx-2 expression could be autoregulated in a cell type-specific manner. In this study, we located an octamer (OCT) binding site within the mouse Cdx-2 gene promoter. This site, designated as Cdx-2POCT, is involved in the expression of the Cdx-2 promoter. Both pancreatic and intestinal cell lines were found to express a number of POU (OCT binding) homeodomain proteins examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. However, it appears that Cdx-2POCT interacts only with OCT1 in the nuclear extracts of the intestinal cell lines examined, although it interacts with OCT1 and at least two other POU proteins that are to be identified in the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell nuclear extract. Co-transfecting OCT1 cDNA but not five other POU gene cDNAs activates the Cdx-2 promoter in the pancreatic InR1-G9 and the intestinal Caco-2 cell lines. In contrast, Cdx-2POCT cannot act as an enhancer element if it is fused to a thymidine kinase promoter.

Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 277: 193-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A given transcription factor is always able to exert multiple biological functions via regulating the expression of different downstream target genes in tissue/cell type-specific manners. This is mainly attributed to the temporal and spatial expression property of a given transcription factor, its ability to bind tocis-elements within different downstream target promoters, and more importantly, its ability to recruit other transcription factors or nuclear co-activators and/or repressors (1Graef I.A.

However, malfunctions in the pancreata have not been detected in the Cdx-2 heterozygotic mice. Therefore, Cdx-2 is haplo-insufficient for selected tissues including the intestines but not the pancreas. Although the physiological and pathological significance of Cdx-2 has been well recognized, the mechanisms, especially transcription factors, which regulate the expression of Cdx-2, remain virtually unknown. We have isolated the mouse Cdx-2 promoter and examined the transcriptional properties of this promoter in pancreatic and intestinal cell lines. We have found that Cdx-2 activates the expression of its own promoter in a cell type-specific manner (12Xu F. Li H. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34310-34316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have dissected the Cdx-2 gene promoter and demonstrated that Cdx-2 binds to two separated AT-rich motifs, namely the TATA and DBS sites, within a proximal region of the Cdx-2 promoter. The DBS site is critical for autoactivation, whereas the TATA site may serve as an attenuating component for the autoregulatory loop (12Xu F. Li H. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34310-34316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Members of the POU HD protein family share a common feature of harboring a bipartite DNA binding domain consisting of a POU-specific domain and a POU homeodomain joined by a short variable linker (13Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Many POU proteins act as transcriptional regulators via recognizing a conserved 8-base pair octamer (OCT) binding element (13Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). POU proteins are expressed in early embryogenesis and in diverse organs and/or systems and play fundamentally important roles in the organ development, cell type specification, and growth and differentiation of cells (14Treier M. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In this study, we located an OCT binding site in the mouse, Cdx-2 promoter, designated as Cdx-2POCT. We demonstrate here that Cdx-2POCT is critical for Cdx-2 promoter expression. OCT1 and other to-be-identified POU proteins are expressed in pancreatic islet, and intestinal cell lines examined. It appears that Cdx-2POCT physically interacts with only OCT1 expressed in intestinal cell lines, whereas Cdx-2POCT interacts with OCT1 and at least two other yet to-be-identified POU proteins expressed in a pancreatic A cell line. Although OCT1 was found to bind to and activate Cdx-2 promoter in pancreatic and intestinal cell lines, Cdx-2POCT itself cannot act as an enhancer element when it is fused to a heterologous promoter. In addition, the fusion promoters cannot be activated by OCT1 co-transfection. We conclude that OCT1 and other to-be-identified POU proteins play important and complicated roles in modulating Cdx-2 expression in cell type-specific manners. Radioisotopes were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides were provided by ACGT Co. (Toronto, Canada). Restriction enzymes and DNA modification enzymes were of molecular biology grade and were purchased from several sources.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34310-34316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cdx-2-LUC (−138 to +137) and its mutant were constructed by subcloning the correspondent polymerase chain reaction products into a promoter-less luciferase reporter gene plasmid. The forward primers used in polymerase chain reaction are Cdx-2pOCT and Cdx-2pOCT(M) as indicated in Fig. 1 B. The reverse primer represents the mouse Cdx-2 DNA sequence from +119 to +137 (GAGCTTCTGCCTCCCGGG). OCT1, OCT2A, and OCT2B expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Winship Herr (16Cleary M.A. Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), OCT3A was a gift from Dr. Graeme Bell (17Takeda J. Seino S. Bell G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4613-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and the Skn-1a and Skn-Ii were gifts of Dr. Bogi Andersen (18Andersen B. Schonemann M.D Flynn S., E. Pearse R.V., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Construction of Cdx-2 expression plasmid and its antisense counterpart (Cdx-2(AS)) has been described previously (19Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1306-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OCT1(AS) was generated by flipping the 1.1-kb EcoRI fragment in the pCG-OCT1 expression vector (16Cleary M.A. Stern S. Tanaka M. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Human colon cancer cell lines HT-29, COLO-205, SW480, and Caco-2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured according to instruction. Cultivation of the baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblast, pancreatic islet cell lines InR1-G9, In111, RIN-56, and HIT, and the intestinal endocrine L cell lines GLUTag and STC-1 have been described previously (8Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Xu F. Li H. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34310-34316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1306-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Drucker D.J. Jin T. Asa S. Young T. Brubaker P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1646-1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BHK, InR1-G9, and Caco-2 cell lines were transfected by a calcium phosphate precipitation method (12Xu F. Li H. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34310-34316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested for the luciferase (LUC) reporter gene analysis 16 h after the transfection. Nuclear proteins from the cultivated cell lines were prepared as described by Schreiber et al. (21Schreiber E. Matias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3921) Google Scholar). EMSA and supershifting analysis were performed as described previously (19Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1306-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We located an OCT binding site within the proximal portion of the mouse Cdx-2 promoter, which we designated as Cdx-2POCT (Fig.1 A). To examine the contribution of this OCT binding site to the expression and autoregulation of the Cdx-2 promoter, we generated a pair of Cdx-2-LUC fusion gene constructs, Cdx-2-LUC (−138 to +137 wild type) and Cdx-2-LUC (−138 to +137 mutant). These two fusion genes are identical with the exception that Cdx-2-LUC (−138 to +137 mutant) carries a mutated OCT binding site (Fig. 1 B). We then transfected these two fusion genes into the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell line (Fig.2 A) and the intestinal Caco-2 cell line (Fig. 2 B). The mutated promoter was found to activate the reporter gene in both cell lines ∼30% compared with the wild type promoter indicating that this OCT binding site is critical for Cdx-2 expression. The wild type promoter could be activated >10-fold by Cdx-2 cDNA co-transfection, whereas the mutant promoter could be activated <5-fold. This result suggests that Cdx-2POCT could also be implicated in Cdx-2 autoregulation (12Xu F. Li H. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34310-34316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, the wild type Cdx-2 promoter could be activated approximately 5-fold by OCT1 cDNA co-transfection, whereas the mutant promoter has no response to OCT1 co-transfection (Fig. 2). Cdx-2 (AS) and OCT1 (AS), which contain Cdx-2 or OCT1 cDNA, respectively, in the antisense orientation, cannot activate Cdx-2 promoter (Fig.2). We then conducted an examination of the expression of nuclear proteins that are able to physically interact with Cdx-2POCT in pancreatic and intestinal cell lines by EMSA. When the pancreatic islet A cell line InR1-G9 was examined, four DNA protein complexes were obtained designated as C1–C4 (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 10). The formation of these four complexes could be effectively competed by unlabeled native Cdx-2POCT probe (lanes 3 and 4) but not by an unlabeled nonspecific probe (lanes 5 and 6). Therefore, these complexes all represent specific DNA binding events. Complexes C1, C2, and C3 could be effectively competed by another OCT binding probe (22Jin T. Branch D.R Zhang X. Qi S. Youngson B. Goss P.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (lanes 7 and 8, see below), indicating the likelihood that these three complexes all represent POU protein binding events. When the mouse large intestinal endocrine L cell line GLUTag was examined, only one complex, C3, was clearly observable (lane 11). When the human colon cancer cell line Caco-2 was examined, the only observable complex was C1 (lane 16). The C1 complex was determined to represent the ubiquitously expressed POU protein OCT1 by a supershifting analysis (compare lane 14with 15 and lane 16 with 17). The above results would suggest that either the intestinal cell lines express fewer number of POU proteins or most POU proteins expressed in intestinal cell lines cannot bind to Cdx-2pOCT. To examine these two possibilities, we then conducted EMSA to examine four human colon cancer cell lines using a synthetic OCT probe (22Jin T. Branch D.R Zhang X. Qi S. Youngson B. Goss P.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). DNA sequence of the synthetic OCT probe is shown in Fig. 1 B. This artificial probe has been used successfully previously by us to examine the expression of POU proteins in normal and malignant human mammary gland epithelial cell lines (22Jin T. Branch D.R Zhang X. Qi S. Youngson B. Goss P.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When this probe was used, nuclear extracts from four intestinal cell lines were found to form a number of complexes (Fig. 4 A). Among these complexes, C1, C2, and C4 were observable for all four colon cancer cell lines examined (lanes 1–4). The formation of C1, C2, and C3 in the Caco-2 cell line was completely competed by the unlabeled OCT probe (lanes 7 and 8) but not by the mutant OCT probe (lanes 9 and 10), indicating that they represent POU protein binding. The native Cdx-2pOCT probe was found to inhibit the formation of C1 and C4 but not C2 and C3 (lane 6). This result would suggest that the POU proteins in C2 and C3, expressed by the Caco-2 cell line, are unable to bind to Cdx-2pOCT. To further examine this observation, we conducted EMSA using the native Cdx-2POCT probe against four colon cancer cell lines. As shown in Fig.4 B, the nuclear extracts from all these cell lines examined were found to form only one major complex, C1 (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, our results suggest that with the exception of OCT1, the other to-be-identified POU proteins are also expressed in the intestinal cell lines examined in this study. However, they are not capable of binding to Cdx-2POCT. When the synthetic OCT probe was applied to the pancreatic islet cell line InR1-G9, three complexes from C1 to C3 were obtained (Fig.5). Supershifting analyses further revealed that C1 represents OCT1 (lane 2). The identities of C2 and C3 cannot be determined using antibodies against two other POU proteins, namely OCT2 and OCT11 (Skn-1a/Skn-1i) (lanes 3–5). We also cannot detect OCT2 and OCT11 expression in the pancreatic and intestinal cell lines used in this study by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Our observations indicated that OCT1 is expressed in most pancreatic and intestinal Cdx-2-expressing cell lines, and OCT1 physically interacts with the Cdx-2 promoter. We then examined if co-transfection of OCT1 and other POU gene cDNAs would activate Cdx-2 promoter. We found that OCT1 activated Cdx-2 promoter nearly 6-fold in the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell line (Figs. 2 A and 6A) and ∼4-fold in the intestinal Caco-2 cell line (Figs. 2 B and 6B). Among the other five POU genes examined, only OCT2A showed a moderate activation on the Cdx-2 promoter. Because OCT2 is not expressed in any of the Cdx-2-expressing cell lines examined, such a moderate activation may have no biological significance. To examine whether the 31-bp native Cdx-2POCT itself could act as an enhancer element, we fused this element with the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (19Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1306-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in either 5′ to 3′ (forward) or 3′ to 5′ (reverse) orientations. The Cdx-2POCT-TK-LUC fusion genes together with the wild type TK-LUC were then transfected into the pancreatic InR1-G9 and the BHK fibroblast cell lines. As shown in Fig.7 A, these fusion promoters show a 40–70% activity compared with that of wild type TK promoter when transfected into the InR1-G9 cell line. Therefore, the 31-bp Cdx-2POCT itself cannot act as an enhancer element for this Cdx-2-producing cell line. In contrast, these two fusion promoters are 10–20-fold more active compared with the parental TK promoter when they were transfected into the BHK fibroblasts (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, these two fusion promoters showed a negative response to OCT1 co-transfection in both InR1-G9 and BHK cell lines examined. These results suggest that OCT1 activates Cdx-2 promoter through binding to Cdx-2POCT in a DNA content-dependent manner. Figure 7Cdx-2POCT cannot act as an enhancer element when fused to a heterologous promoter. TK-LUC, a reporter gene construct in which the luciferase reporter gene expression is driven by a thymidine kinase gene promoter;OCT-TK-LUC(F) and OCT-TK-LUC(R), the 31-bp Cdx-2POCT was inserted in front of the TK promoter in 5′-3′ (forward) or 3′ to 5′ (reverse) orientation. Pancreatic InR1-G9 cells (A) or BHK fibroblasts (B) were transfected by the combination of the indicated reporter gene and the cDNA plasmids (5 μg). Luciferase activity was measured 16 h after transfection. The data are expressed as mean relative luciferase activity (n = 3) ± S.E. normalized to: 1) the activity obtained after transfection of the promoter-less SK-LUC in the same experiment, and 2) total amount of protein utilized in each assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In 1991, James and Kazenwadel (4James R.

With the exception of the detection of Cdx-1 (23Duprey P. Chowdhury K. Dressler G.R. Balling R. Simon D. Guenet J.-L. Gruss P. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), they also obtained a portion of a novel caudal cDNA, which they named Cdx-2 (4James R. Kazenwadel J. J. Biol.

Cdx-2 and Cdx-3 are now considered to be the same gene in different rodents. We and others (8Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Laser B.

Cdx-2 is expressed in intestinal epithelia along the entire crypt-villus axis of the small intestine and in crypts of the colon (7Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). It is also expressed in pancreatic A and B cell lines (5German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J.

Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). More recently, the Cdx-2 expression in human gastric cancer cell lines has been reported (25Bai Y.Q.

CDX2 expression was found to be ceased in the colon cancer cells of patients at later stages, and mutations in the CDX2-coding region has been found in both colon cancer patients and colon cancer cell lines (26Ee H.E.

More importantly,Cdx-2 +/− mice were found to develop multiple malfunctions including a homeotic shift on vertebrae, stunted growth, abnormalities on tails, and the development of multiple intestinal neoplasia within three months of their birth. However, no observable malfunction has been found in the pancreata of these heterozygotic mice (10Chawengsaksophak K. James R. Hammond V.E. Kontgen F. Beck F. Nature. 1997; 386: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), and proglucagon gene expression appears normal in theCdx-2 +/−mice. 3D. Drucker, personal communication. Such extraordinary multiple malfunctions observed in the heterozygotic null mutants suggest that 1) Cdx-2 is haplo-insufficient for selected tissues, and normal cellular phenotype in these tissues requires the expression of both alleles, 2) Cdx-2 has a broad spectrum of downstream target genes, and 3) Cdx-2 requires co-factors to achieve its diverse and cell type-specific biological functions. Indeed, about a dozen potential downstream target genes of Cdx-2 have been identified including insulin (5German M.S. Wang J. Chadwick R.B. Rutter W.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 12: 2293-2300Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cdx-2, therefore, provides a very good model system for addressing a fundamentally important biological question: How can a single transcription factor exert its multiple biological functions in tissue/cell type-specific manners? One of the essential steps for understanding tissue-specific biological functions of Cdx-2 is to investigate mechanisms controlling its expression in different types of cells. For this purpose, we isolated the mouse Cdx-2 promoter and examined the transcriptional properties of this promoter in pancreatic islet, intestinal endocrine, and human colon cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that Cdx-2 is able to activate it own promoter in pancreatic and intestinal cell lines that express CDX2/Cdx-2, but repress its own promoter in fibroblasts (12Xu F. Li H. Jin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34310-34316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This observation, on one hand, provided an explanation for why one wild type Cdx-2 allele is sufficient for certain tissue such as pancreas. On the other hand, it raised a question why one functional allele is insufficient for other tissues including intestines. We proposed that, except for Cdx-2 itself, other transcription factors and signals might determine whether Cdx-2 expression in a given cell reaches the threshold for triggering the autoregulatory loop. Some of these factors or signals may function only, or more effectively, in one type of cells such as pancreatic cells. If this hypothesis is correct, it would provide an explanation as to why various abnormalities observed amongCdx-2 +/− mice vary, in degree, time, and location, from one mouse to another. In this study, we assessed the contribution of Cdx-2POCT in Cdx-2 expression. Because the mutant promoter shows ∼30% activity compared with that of the wild type, we conclude that this site is important for Cdx-2 expression. In addition, because the mutant promoter loses more than a 2-fold response to Cdx-2 activation, we suggest that this binding site might be also involved in the autoregulation process. To examine POU proteins that are expressed and capable of binding to Cdx-2POCT, we conducted EMSA using both the typical synthetic OCT binding probe (22Jin T. Branch D.R Zhang X. Qi S. Youngson B. Goss P.E. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and the native 31-bp Cdx-2POCT probe. Our results indicated that although Cdx-2POCT forms four specific DNA-protein complexes with the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell line, it forms only one complex, C3, with the intestinal endocrine cell line GLUTag and one complex, C1, with the colon cancer cell line Caco-2. Because Cdx-2 haplo-insufficient occurs in intestines but not pancreata, our results would suggest that pancreatic islet cells might express more POU proteins as transcriptional activators for Cdx-2. To further examine this, we need to identify each individual complex formed between the InR1-G9 cell line and the Cdx-2POCT probe. The C1 complex was found to represent the ubiquitously expressed POU protein OCT1. However, four colon cancer cell lines examined do express OCT-binding proteins other than OCT1 detected by EMSA using the synthetic OCT binding probe. These observations would suggest that, except for OCT1, other POU proteins expressed in pancreatic and intestinal cell lines have different binding affinity to the 31-bpcis-element Cdx-2POCT. This could be due to the expression of different profiles of POU proteins by pancreatic islets and intestine cells. Alternatively, the same POU protein(s) expressed in pancreatic and intestine cells may have different binding affinities. The latter hypothesis is plausible because the binding ability of POU proteins could be influenced by posttranslational events including phosphorylation status (35Grenfell S.J. Latchman D.S. Thomas N.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Inamoto S. Segil N. Pan Z.Q. Kimura M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

Grenfell et al.(35Grenfell S.J. Latchman D.S. Thomas N.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind differentially to three octamer binding sequences, the one from the H2B promoter (ATGCTAATAA, similar to the synthetic OCT probe utilized in this study), a TAATGARAT motif, and a perfect consensus overlapping octamer/TAATGARAT motif (ATGCTAATGAGAT). The binding activity of these octamer probes could be modulated by PKA, PKC, and casein kinase 2 (35Grenfell S.J. Latchman D.S. Thomas N.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Inamoto et al. (36Inamoto S. Segil N. Pan Z.Q. Kimura M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29852-29858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) found that MAT1 is able to target cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase to Oct factors and lead to their phosphorylation. This may play a role in the recruitment of transcription factor IIH to the preinitiation complex or in subsequent initiation and elongation reactions (36Inamoto S. Segil N. Pan Z.Q. Kimura M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29852-29858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Zhang et al. (37Zhang H. Shepherd A.T. Eason D.D. Wei S. Diaz J.I. Djeu J.Y. Wu G.D. Blanck G. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 457-465PubMed Google Scholar), however, shown that Oct-1 is a repressor for HLA-DRA. Expression of the tumor suppressor gene Rb leads to the phosphorylation of Oct-1 relieving its repressive effect on HLA-DRA. To assess the overall contribution of POU proteins in regulating Cdx-2 expression in different types of cells, it is necessary to examine the phosphorylation status of these POU proteins in each type of cells in both physiological and pathological conditions. The expression of POU genes in the gastrointestinal tract has not been actively examined. Hussain et al. (39Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 7: 7186-7194Crossref Google Scholar), however, demonstrated that both InR1-G9 and GLUTag cell lines do express Brn-4, a class III POU gene that acts as a regulator for proglucagon gene expression. Because the C3 complex is observed for both InR1-G9 and GLUTag cell lines (Fig. 3, lanes 10 and 11), it is possible that this complex represents Brn-4. This complex was not observed for the four colon cancer cell lines examined. It will be interesting to examine whether Brn-4 or the protein component for the complex C3 is a tissue-specific transcriptional activator for Cdx-2 in proglucagon producing cells. Another interesting observation is that although OCT1 activates Cdx-2 promoter via binding to Cdx-2POCT, this 31-bpcis-element itself cannot act as an enhancer element for the heterologous TK promoter. Furthermore, the Cdx-2POCT-TK fusion promoters do not respond to OCT1 activation. Therefore, OCT1 activates Cdx-2 promoter in a DNA content-dependent manner. Because OCT1 activates both the −769 to + 137 and the −138 to +137 Cdx-2 gene promoters, the cis-element(s) critical for this content-dependent activation should be downstream of the Cdx-2POCT itself. The to-be-definedcis-element(s) may overlap with Cdx-2 binding sites and the area with which components for general transcription machinery might interact. It is possible that OCT1 and other to-be-identified POU proteins may interact with other transcription factors that bind to yet-to-be-defined cis-element(s) downstream of Cdx-2POCT for activating Cdx-2 expression. This contact may promote further protein-protein interactions and recruitment events that interface more effectively with the transcriptional machinery. Indeed, it has been shown previously that OCT1 requires different co-factors such as OCA-B (40Schubart D.B. Rolink A. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Botteri F. Matthias P. Nature. 1996; 383: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor (41Murphy S. Yoon J.B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell.

To identify co-factor(s) that are essential for OCT1 to activate Cdx-2 expression will add more to our understanding of cell type-specific autoregulation and cell type-specific functions of Cdx-2. In summary, we demonstrated in this study the complexity of the role of the 31-bp cis-element Cdx-2POCT in regulating Cdx-2 expression and autoregulation. The complexity has been shown at three different levels: 1) expression of POU proteins may occur cell type specifically, 2) binding affinity of POU proteins to Cdx-2POCT also shows cell type specificity, 3) activation of Cdx-2 promoter via Cdx-2POCT by OCT1 depends upon its native DNA content. We suggest that POU proteins play important and sophisticated roles in modulating Cdx-2 expression in a cell type-specific manner. We thank Drs. Winship Herr, Graeme Bell, and Bogi Andersen for providing cDNAs of OCT1, OCT2A, OCT2B, OCT3A, Skn-1a, and Skn-1I and Dr. Vincent Giguere for the TK-LUC luciferase reporter gene."

Based on the flexibility of T cell receptor/antigen/major histocompatibility complex recognition, it has been proposed that a self-peptide could replace a viral epitope for T cell recognition and therefore participate in pathophysiological processes in which T cells are involved. To address this issue, we used, as a molecular model of viral antigen, the H-2Db-restricted immunodominant epitope nucleoprotein (NP)-(396–404) (FQPQNGQFI) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We identified peptide sequences from murine self-proteins that share structural and functional homology with LCMV NP-(396–404) and that bound to H-2Db with high affinity. One of these self-peptides, derived from tumor necrosis factor receptor I (FGPSNWHFM, amino acids 302–310), maintained LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells in an active state as observed both in vitro in cytotoxic assays and in vivoin a model of virus-induced autoimmune diabetes, the rat insulin promoter-LCMV NP transgenic mouse. The natural occurrence and molecular concentration at the surface of H-2b spleen cells of tumor necrosis factor receptor I-(302–310) were determined by on-line μ-high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and supported its biological relevance.

The functional properties of these peptides depend on their structure, and their interaction with the TCR can lead to either full or partial T cell activation or antagonism (5Jameson S.C. Bevan M.J.

Although the development of autoimmune disease has been commonly associated with CD4-bearing T cells (4Wucherpfennig K.W. Strominger J.L. Cell. 1995; 80: 695-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar), there are now both clinical and experimental observations that strongly suggest that autoreactive CD8+ T cells may also be involved (13Misko I.S.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which autoreactive CD8+ T cells are activated or maintained in a functional state remain mostly unknown. In this study, we explored the possible role of MHC class I-restricted self-peptides in these mechanisms because of their potential importance in clinical disease. Our aim was (i) to identify putative self-molecular mimics of a viral antigen, (ii) to characterize their structural and functional properties, and (iii) to determine their biological relevance. For this, we used the H-2Db-restricted immunodominant epitope located in nucleoprotein (NP)-(396–404) (FQPQNGQFI) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a model of choice for dissecting the molecular or cellular mechanisms involved in an autoreactive CD8+ T cell response. Indeed, the H-2Db-restricted CD8+ T cell response mounted against the LCMV NP is directed toward the immunodominant epitope sequence NP-(396–404) (15Gairin J.E. Mazarguil H. Hudrisier D.

The LCMV-infected mouse typically undergoes activation and massive expansion of CD8+ T cells, which consistently stay at a high level throughout the animal's life span, even in the absence of detectable virus and/or viral antigen (18Murali-Krishna K. Lau L.L. Sambhara S. Lemonnier F. Altman J. Ahmed R. Science. 1999; 286: 1377-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 19Gallimore A. Glithero A. Godkin A. Tissot A.C. Pluckthun A. Elliott T.

These cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) represent a potential source of autoreactivity, particularly if their cytolytic function remains intact. The H-2b transgenic mice, which express LCMV NP under the control of the rat insulin promoter (RIP), represent an in vivo model of autoimmune disease (21Ohashi P. Oehen S. Buerki K. Pircher H.

Lewicki H. Cell. 1991; 65: 319-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) in which LCMV NP-(396–404) can be the target of autoreactive CTLs. After LCMV infection or adoptive transfer of anti-LCMV CTLs, these RIP-LCMV NP mice develop insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), a virus-induced autoimmune disease in which both CD4+ and CD8+T cells are involved (23Wong F.S. Karttunen J. Dumont C. Wen L. Visintin I. Pilip I.M. Shastri N. Pamer E.G. Janeway C.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In these mice, the destruction of β cells and ensuing IDDM have been attributed to MHC class I-restricted CD8+ T cells (22Oldstone M.B.A. Neremberg M. Southern P. Price J. Lewicki H. Cell. 1991; 65: 319-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 24von Herrath M.G. Dockter J.

Med. 1996; 183: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the finding that IDDM does not develop in MHC class I-deficient mice or CD8-depleted mice (24von Herrath M.G. Dockter J. Oldstone M.B.A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 231-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) provides additional support for the involvement of CD8+ T cells and, consequently, of MHC class I-restricted self-peptides. Here, we first identified a set of six nonameric sequences from endogenous proteins sharing structural and functional homology with LCMV NP-(396–404). Five of these endogenous peptides bound with high affinity to H-2Db and generally acted as antagonists of lysis by LCMV-specific CTLs. In the presence of H-2b cells pulsed with three of these peptides, LCMV-specific CTLs were maintained in long-term culture. We then selected one of these peptides, tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFR)-(302–310), which activated LCMV NP-specific CTLs, allowing them to kill LCMV-infected cells in a peptide-specific, MHC-restricted manner. Adoptive transfer of TNFR-(302–310)-activated CTLs into RIP-LCMV NP × RIP-B7.1 transgenic mice provoked a specific destruction of β cells of the islets of Langerhans and caused IDDM. Using on-line μ-high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), we demonstrated the presence of TNFR-(302–310) at the surface of H-2b spleen cells, a finding supporting its biological relevance. The T2 human mutant cell line transfected with H-2Db (T2-Db) (26Alexander J. Payne J.A. Murray R. Frelinger J.A. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1989; 29: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was used in binding experiments. The murine H-2b cell lines MC57 and RMA and the H-2d cell line BALB/cl7 were used as target cells in CTL assays. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (MC57, RMA, and BALB/cl7) or Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (T2-Db) containing 8% bovine serum,l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Geneticin (400 μg/ml) was added to Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium to maintain selection of positively transfected T2-Db cells. C57BL/6 (H-2b) and BALB/c (H-2d) mice were obtained from the breeding colony at the Scripps Research Institute. CTL clone NP18, specific for the H-2Db-restricted LCMV epitope NP-(396–404) (27Lewicki H. Tishon A. Borrow P. Evans C. Gairin J.E. Hahn K.M. Jewell D.A. Wilson I.A. Oldstone M.B.A. Virology. 1995; 210: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), was restimulated weekly with LCMV-infected MC57 cells and spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice. Polyclonal CTLs were generated by cultivating naive spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice with 1 μm LCMV NP-(396–404) without interleukin-2 for 10 days and then restimulated weekly using LCMV NP-(396–404)-coated RMA cells and spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice in the presence of interleukin-2 (30 units/ml). CTLs used in long-term culture studies or adoptive transfer experiments were generated from C57BL/6 and control BALB/c mice infected with 105 plaque-forming units of the LCMV Arm strain intraperitoneally. 45–60 days later, a single suspension of spleen cells was cultured with or without peptide-pulsed (1 μg/ml) or LCMV-infected macrophages. Peptide binding to H-2Dbwas determined in a competition assay as previously described (28Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). T2-Db cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled KAIENAEAL (100 nm) for 75 min at 37 °C in the presence of proteases inhibitors. Total binding and nonspecific binding were measured in the absence or presence of 1 mm unlabeled peptide, respectively. Cells were washed with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and the fluorescence (mean fluorescence intensity (mfi)) was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Becton-Dickinson). Assays were performed with increasing concentrations (10−10 to 10−5m) of unlabeled competitors. Specific binding to H-2Db was defined as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. The percentage inhibition of binding was calculated as 100 × (1 − (mfi in presence of competitor − (mfi(nonspecific binding)/mfi(specific binding)))). The 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) corresponds to a peptide concentration inhibiting half the maximal specific binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled KAIENAEAL to H-2Db. An algorithm was used to search for murine nonameric peptides sharing functional homology with LCMV NP-(396–404) in the Swiss Protein Database. Criteria (illustrated in Fig. 1) were as follows: at P1, all 20 amino acids except Leu, Ile, Met, and Val; at P2, Ala, Asn, Cys, Gln, Gly, and Ser; at P3, Leu, Met, Ile, Val, Pro, and Ala; at P4, all amino acids; at P5, Asn; at P6, all amino acids; at P7, all amino acids; at P8, Phe; and at P9, Leu, Ile, and Met. Restrictions at P1, P2, P3, P5, and P9 were imposed according to published studies (29Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G.

LCMV-infected or peptide-pulsed uninfected target cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with51Cr and washed, and LCMV-specific CTLs were added at the indicated effector/target ratio. Target and effector cells were incubated at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 μl. After a 5-h incubation period, fractions (100 μl) were removed and counted for51Cr activity. The percent specific lysis was calculated as 100 × ((cpm(experimental release) − cpm(spontaneous release))/(cpm(total release) − cpm(spontaneous release))). Total release and spontaneous release were determined by incubating the labeled cells with 1% Nonidet P-40 and culture medium, respectively. In all experiments, samples were run in triplicate, and the mean values are given. Antagonism was assayed in a 5-h 51Cr release assay as described above, except that RMA cells were prepulsed with a suboptimal concentration of LCMV NP-(396–404) (giving 30–40% lysis) during 51Cr labeling, extensively washed, and incubated with a 1, 10, or 100 μm concentration of the indicated peptides for 30 min at 37 °C before CTLs were added at an effector/target ratio of 5:1. RMA cells (3 × 103cells/well) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of the indicated peptides (1 × 10−10 to 1 × 10−5m). CTLs (15 × 103 cells/well) were then added and incubated with target cells for 24 h at 37 °C. The IFN-γ present in the supernatant was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using R4-6A2 and biotinylated XMG1.2 as the pair of antibodies (a kind gift of Dr. J.-C. Guery). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to detect biotinylated XMG1.2, followed by incubation witho-phenylenediamine hydrochloride (Sigma). The color was red at 490 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Titertek Multiskan Plus MKII, EFLAB, Finland) and normalized to the values obtained for a standard curve of recombinant murine IFN-γ (Sigma). CTLs (1 × 104) were mixed with RMA cells (5 × 104) previously γ-irradiated (10,000 rads) and pulsed with peptide (1 μm). Cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C and with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine during the last 16 h. The level of [3H]thymidine incorporation was then determined by scintillation counting. H-2b or H-2d double RIP-LCMV NP × RIP-B7.1 transgenic mice expressing LCMV NP × B7.1 in β cells of islets of Langerhans were adoptively transferred with 2 × 107 long-term cultured T cells maintained as described above and inoculated intraperitoneally. Blood glucose levels were monitored, and pancreatic tissues were studied by immunohistochemistry for evidence of CTL infiltration as previously described (22Oldstone M.B.A. Neremberg M. Southern P.

Zeh III, H.J. Salter R.D. Lotze M.T. J. Immunother. 1993; 14: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, splenocytes (1–2 × 109 cells) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 0.131 m citric acid and 0.066 m Na2HPO4 at pH 3.0 for 2 min. The eluted material was desalted on Waters Sep-Pak column according to the manufacturer's instructions, vacuum-concentrated, and centrifuged in 1% trifluoroacetic acid on a Centricon 3 (3-kDa cutoff; Amicon, Inc.) at 3800 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The filtered material was vacuum-concentrated and resuspended in 100 μl of 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were separated on a reversed-phase C18 column (Aquapore, 7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm; Brownlee) using a Waters 600S controller system. Samples (25 μl) were injected and separated using a system gradient of 5–36% solvent B for a 60-min period at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Solvent A was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, and solvent B was 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN. Fractions (200 μl) were collected, lyophilized, and stored at −80 °C until analysis by on-line μ-HPLC/ESI-MS. The collected HPLC fractions were injected on a reversed-phase C18 microcolumn (PepMapTM, 3 μm, 0.3 × 150 mm; LC Packings). Elution was performed with a gradient of 5–55% solvent B in 25 min. Solvent A was 0.05% acetic acid in 95:5 (v/v) H2O/CH3CN, and solvent B was 0.05% acetic acid in 20:80 (v/v) H2O/CH3CN. The flow rate was set at 400 μl/min and split to 4 μl/min before the column. MS data were recorded on a Finnigan MAT TSQ700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source either by scanning the range of masses corresponding to m/z values between 300 and 1800 every 3 s or by using the “single ion monitoring” mode, where the quadrupole is set to transmit only one particular m/zvalue, corresponding to an ion of interest, centered in a 1-m/z unit window. Low energy collision-activated dissociation MS/MS experiments were conducted in the “selected reaction monitoring” mode, where the first quadrupole is set to transmit the precursor ion of interest and the third quadrupole is scanned over a 10-m/z unit mass range centered on them/z value of the fragment ion of interest. Argon was used as the collision gas at a collision pressure of 1.2 millitorr. The collision energy was 28 eV in the laboratory frame of reference. The H2-Db structure was obtained from crystallographic data of H-2Db with influenza virus peptide NP-(366–374) (33Young A.C.M. Zhang W.G. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The LCMV NP-(396–404) and TNFR-(302–310) nonamers were introduced manually using the program O. Side chain conformation was based on the most probable rotamer and the probable hydrogen bonds. After transfer of H-2Db data to Insight II (Biosym Technologies), minimization was done using the VA09A (1000 iterations without constraints) algorithm. We first identified the residues of LCMV NP-(396–404) involved in MHC binding and those serving as TCR contacts. Binding assays of monoalanine-substituted analogs (TableI) confirmed Asn400 at P5 and Ile404 at the C terminus as H-2Db anchors. Pro398 at P3 contributed significantly to MHC binding, likely by pointing down to the MHC-binding groove (33Young A.C.M. Zhang W.G. Sacchettini J.C. Nathenson S.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and/or, as a proline residue, by inducing structural constraints to the peptide backbone (34Gairin J.E. Oldstone M.B.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2903-2907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The impact of alanine substitution on the ability of NP-(396–404) to sensitize target cells to lysis by LCMV-specific CTLs was then assessed. Results obtained with the NP-(396–404)-specific CTL clone NP18 (35Byrne J.A. Oldstone M.B.A. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 682-686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are shown in Table I. The strongest effect was observed at position 8, where substitution of Ala for Phe yielded a peptide totally unable to sensitize target cells even at the highest concentration tested, indicating that Phe403 is the critical (main) TCR contact. CTL sensitization properties were also profoundly altered, but not abolished, after substitution of Phe396 at P1 and Gln399 at P4, indicating that these two residues also play a role, although of lesser importance, as TCR (auxiliary) contacts. Substitution of residues at positions 2 (Gln), 6 (Gly), 7 (Gln), and 9 (Phe) had little effect. The effects observed at positions 3 and 5 were expected as a consequence of the weak MHC-binding properties of the analogs. Similar results were obtained with polyclonal populations of CTLs obtained from C57BL/6 mice either infected with LCMV Arm or immunized with synthetic NP-(396–404) (data not shown). These three main (Phe403) and auxiliary (Phe396 and Gln399) TCR contacts identified in the NP-(396–404) sequence undoubtedly represent the overall CTL response against this antigen.

We next screened the Swiss Protein Database for murine nonameric self-peptides fulfilling the following requirements (Fig. 1 B). The two H-2Db anchors must be present at P5 (Asn) and P9 (Met, Leu, or Ile) (29Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar) as well as the main CTL contact at P8 (Phe) of NP-(396–404). Additional criteria were imposed at P1, P2, and P3, for which some residues affect peptide presentation by H-2Db (30Sigal L.J. Goebel P. Wylie D.E. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Laval F. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. J. Biol.

Finally, no restriction was applied to P4, P6, and P7, at which structural modification has no or little impact on NP binding. About 30 peptides were extracted from the registered murine proteins, with a high proportion of redundant sequences (i.e. different members of the same protein family registered under different code numbers). From them, we selected the only six sequences from non-redundant proteins (TableII). In addition to the two main MHC anchors and the main TCR contact (minimal functional homology), some of these peptides presented a higher sequence homology by sharing one or two other residues with LCMV NP-(396–404). The six murine self-peptides (mimicry peptides) were then tested for binding to H-2Db. As shown in Table II, five of them bound efficiently to H-2Db with affinities comparable to (lysosomal acid phosphatase-(177–185) and lactate dehydrogenase-(282–290)), higher than (protein kinase C-(351–359) and TNFR-(302–310)), or lower than (N-cadherin-(569–577)) that of NP-(396–404). Only one peptide, IgVH-(91–99) (IgV region heavy chain), was a weak H-2Db binder and, for this reason, was not studied further.Table IISelf-peptides from murine proteins with minimal functional homology to LCMV NP-(396–404)PeptideSequenceHomologyOrigin of proteinCellular locationTissue distributionIC50 for H-2DbaffinitynmNP-(396–404)FQPQNGQFI—Viral nucleoproteinCytosolInfected cells, broad5.7 ± 1.4TNFR-(302–310)FGPSNWHFM5 /9 (56%)TNFR-IMembraneTumor, lymphoid cells0.65 ± 0.34LAP-(177–185)RSIQNAQFL5 /9 (56%)Lysosomal acid phosphataseLysosomeUbiquitous8.7 ± 1.8PKC-(351–359)FGIDNFEFI4 /9 (44%)Protein kinase CλCytosol, membraneSkin, lung0.12 ± 0.04IgVH-(91–99)DNPKNTLFL4 /9 (44%)Ig heavy c"
https://openalex.org/W2079672511,"The central region (residues 125–385) of the integrin β2 subunit is postulated to adopt an I-domain-like fold (the β2I-domain) and to play a critical role in ligand binding and heterodimer formation. To understand structure-function relationships of this region of β2, a homolog-scanning mutagenesis approach, which entails substitution of nonconserved hydrophilic sequences within the β2I-domain with their homologous counterparts of the β1I-domain, has been deployed. This approach is based on the premise that β1 and β2 are highly homologous, yet recognize different ligands. Altogether, 16 segments were switched to cover the predicted outer surface of the β2I-domain. When these mutant β2 subunits were transfected together with wild-type αM in human 293 cells, all 16 β2 mutants were expressed on the cell surface as heterodimers, suggesting that these 16 sequences within the β2I-domain are not critically involved in heterodimer formation between the αM and β2 subunits. Using these mutant αMβ2 receptors, we have mapped the epitopes of nine β2I-domain specific mAbs, and found that they all recognized at least two noncontiguous segments within this domain. The requisite spatial proximity among these non-linear sequences to form the mAb epitopes supports a model of an I-domain-like fold for this region. In addition, none of the mutations that abolish the epitopes of the nine function-blocking mAbs, including segment Pro192–Glu197, destroyed ligand binding of the αMβ2 receptor, suggesting that these function-blocking mAbs inhibit αMβ2 function allosterically. Given the recent reports implicating the segment equivalent to Pro192–Glu197 in ligand binding by β3 integrins, these data suggest that ligand binding by the β2 integrins occurs via a different mechanism than β3. Finally, both the conformation of the β2I-domain and C3bi binding activity of αMβ2 were dependent on a high affinity Ca2+ binding site (K d = 105 μm), which is most likely located within this region of β2.

Like all integrins, the β2 subfamily members are expressed on cell surfaces as heterodimers, but their expression is restricted primarily to leukocytes. αMβ2 plays a multifunctional role on leukocytes. As examples, this integrin is important in leukocyte adhesion and transmigration through endothelium, in activation of neutrophils and monocytes, in phagocytosis of foreign material, and in apoptosis (1Plow E.F.

C3bi and Fg are two particularly important ligands of αMβ2; C3bi is critical to phagocytosis of opsonized foreign particles, and Fg, which interacts with αMβ2 via its γ-module (8Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), is involved in leukocyte adhesion and migration. Central to the ligand binding function of αMβ2 is its I(A) domain. The αMI-domain is an inserted segment of ∼200 amino acids and is highly homologous to several I-domains found in integrin α subunits (9Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of several I-domains (αM, αL, αX, α2, etc.) have been solved (10Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 11Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). These I-domains are composed of six or seven α-helices and six β-sheets arranged in a Rossman-type fold. A cation binding site, termed the MIDAS motif, is located within the I-domain. In the MIDAS motif, cation coordination is provided by a DXSXS sequence and by other two distant (in terms of primary sequence) oxygenated residues (10Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In addition to the α subunits with their I-domains, the β subunits also contribute to ligand binding to integrins. Studies of the β subunits have been focused primarily on their central regions (residues ∼125–385 in a typical β subunit of >700 amino acids). This region is predicted to contain a MIDAS motif, and candidate residues for cation coordination have been identified by mutagenesis (14Lin C.K.E. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Gonzalez E.R. McDonald S.

Protein sequence analysis suggests that this region may also fold into an I-domain-like structure (10Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 18Tuckwell D.S. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, due to the low homology between the I-domains of the α and β subunits, it is uncertain whether this putative I-domain region does, indeed, fold into an I-domain, or merely contains a MIDAS motif. What is clear is that this region does play a critical role in mediating ligand binding to integrins. In β3, it was reported that bound RGD peptides can be cross-linked to this region (19D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Lam S.C.T. Plow E.F. Science. 1988; 242: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 20Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol.

Substituting this segment within the β1I- or β5I-domain with its homologous counterpart from β3 imparts β3ligand specificity to the β1 or β5 integrin (21Lin E.C. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Carron C.P.

A natural mutation of Arg214 to Gln in β3 abolishes ligand binding of αIIbβ3, and a synthetic peptide containing the sequence of β3 (211) blocks Fg binding to purified αIIbβ3 (23Bajt M.L. Ginsberg M.H. Frelinger III, A.L. Berndt M.C. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3789-3794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar observations implicate the β1I-domain in the ligand binding functions of the β1 integrins. For example, it was shown that both activating and inhibiting mAbs recognize a small stretch of β1 (residues 124–160 and 207–218) (24Shih D.T. Boettiger D. Buck C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the D134 XSXS sequence of the proposed MIDAS motif within β2 was implicated in the binding of Fg, C3bi, and ICAM-1 to αMβ2 (26Bajt M.L. Goodman T.G. McGuire S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 94-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These data indicate that this putative I-domain is important to ligand binding functions of the β2 integrins as well. Recently, we have deployed homolog-scanning mutagenesis (28Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) to identify several segments critical to Fg and C3bi binding within the αMI-domain (8Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This approach entails switching sequences within the αMI-domain to their homologous sequences within the αLI-domain. This approach is feasible because the αMI- and αLI-domains are highly homologous, but αMβ2 and αLβ2 recognize different ligands. In the study reported here, we have applied this same strategy to the putative β2I-domain region. Our data are consistent with folding of the region into an I-domain-like structure. However, our results suggest that ligand recognition by the region of the β2subunit is achieved in a distinct fashion from that involved in ligand recognition by the β3 integrins. In addition, we show that the epitopes of several blocking mAbs map to this region but their inhibitory activity is likely to be achieved via an allosteric mechanism. Finally, we show that the conformation and ligand binding functions of the β2I-domain are enhanced selectively by Ca2+, suggesting a unique cation-specific effect on the β2I-domain. Taken together, these results provide insight into the structure-function relationships of αMβ2, which may also extend to other integrins in general. Human kidney 293 cells and the expression vector, pCIS2M, were gifts from Dr. F. J. Castellino (University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN). The cDNAs of CD11b and CD18 were obtained from Dr. B. Karan-Tamir (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). The recombinant γ-module of Fg was provided by Dr. Medved (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). The mAbs used in this study were obtained from the following sources. mAb 6.5E was provided by Dr. D. P. Andrew (Amgen Inc., Boulder, CO); mAb MHM23 was from Dako (Carpinteria, CA); IB4 and TS1/18 were from the ATCC (Rockville, MD); mAb 44 was from Sigma; CLB-LFA-1/1,54 (CLB54) was from RDI (Flanders, NJ); YFC118.3 and R3.3 were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); H20A was from VMRD Inc. (Pullman, WA); 6.7 was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA); 685A5, MEM-48, and 7E4 were from Biodesign (Kennebunk, ME). The detailed procedures used for homolog-scanning mutagenesis and to establish stable cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant αMβ2 receptors in human kidney 293 cells have been published (30Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similar methods were used to express the αMβ2 heterodimer and the single β2 subunit on the surface of the Chinese hamster ovary cells. To obtain cell lines with similar expressions, each mutant cell line was subcloned by cell sorting using an αM-specific mAb (2LPM19c). Up to 20 colonies were selected and analyzed for integrin expression by FACS analysis. Cells with receptor expression levels similar to wild-type αMβ2 were chosen, and five different subclones were used for the subsequent studies reported in this work. To exclude the possibility of subcloning artifacts, all studies were repeated using the original pool of each mutant receptor. Cells expressing wild-type and mutant αMβ2 were washed once with DPBS, biotinylated with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl 6-biotinamidohexanoate, Pierce), and lysed with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, 25 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an αM-specific mAb 44a and a β2-specific mAb 6.7. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 7% acrylamide gels, and the surface-expressed αMβ2 was visualized by Western blotting using a horseradish peroxidase-avidin conjugate. The ligand binding activity of the β2 mutants was assessed using two classic αMβ2 ligands, C3bi and Fg, according to our published methods (27Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For adhesion of αMβ2-expressing cells to Fg, the recombinant γ-module (10 μg/ml) was deposited at the center of each well in a 24-well non-tissue culture polystyrene plate. After blocking with 400 μl of 0.05% polyvinylpyrrolidone in DPBS, a total of 2 × 106 cells in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The unbound cells were removed by three washes with DPBS, and the adherent cells were quantified by cell-associated acid phosphatase as described previously (27Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A total of 106 cells expressing wild-type or mutant αMβ2 in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 1 mm Mg2+ and 1 mm Ca2+ was incubated with 1 μg of mAb for 30 min at 4 °C. A subtype-matched mouse IgG served as a control. After washing with PBS, cells were mixed with FITC-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG(H+L) F(ab′)2 fragment (1:20 dilution) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and kept at 4 °C for another 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of DPBS. The FACS analyses were performed using FACScan (Becton-Dickinson), counting 10,000 events. Mean fluorescence intensities were quantified using the FACScan program, and these values were used to compare αMβ2 expression levels or the reactivity of the different αMβ2mutants with specific mAbs. As shown in Fig.1, the purported I-domain within integrin β2 shares considerable sequence homology with the corresponding region of the β1 subunit. The major sequence differences are confined to regions that are predicted to be hydrophilic and surface-oriented based on hydropathy plots and molecular modeling, and, thereby, are the segments that are likely to contribute to the unique functions of the β2 integrins. For example, the β2 subunit partners with an entirely separate set of α subunits from β1, and the β2 integrins recognize a set of ligands very distinct from the β1 integrins (there is no known peptide sequence recognized by both β1 and β2 integrins). Based on the sequence homology between the β1I- and β2I-domains, we sought to systematically probe the function of the hydrophilic and unique segments of this region (residues 125–385) using homolog-scanning mutagenesis. Accordingly, we replaced 16 non-conserved segments of three to nine residues within the β2I-domain with the corresponding segments from the β1 subunit (Fig. 1). These 16 segments covered the entire hydrophilic region of the β2I-domain predicted from hydropathy plots and molecular modeling. The primers used for mutagenesis are listed in Table I. The DNA sequence of the entire I-domain was confirmed for each mutant before and after transfer back into the pCIS2M expression vector containing the cDNA of β2.Table IPrimers used in the homolog-scanning mutagenesis of the putative β2I-domainMutant namesFromToMutagenic primers (from 5′ to 3′)1Arg144–Lys148RNVKKENVKSATGCTTGATGACCTCGAGAATGTCAAGTCCCTAGGTGGCGACCTG2Leu154–Glu159LRALNEMNEMRRCTAGGTGGCGACCTGATGAACGAGATGCGCAGGATCACCGAGTCCGGC3Glu162–Gly164ESGSDFAGCCAATGCGGAAGTCGGAGGTGATCTCG4Asn181–Asp185NTHPDSTTPATGGGTTTCGCAGCTTGGCAGGGGTGGTGGACACGAACGGCAGCAC5Pro192–Glu197PNKEKETSEQNAAGCTGCGAAACCCATGTACAAGCGAACAGAACTGCCAGCCCCCGTTT6Gln199–Ala203QPPFATTPFSAAGGAGAAAGAGTGCACCACCCCGTTTAGCTTCAGGCACGTGCTG7Asn213–Glu220NSNQFQTEKGEVFNELCTGAAGCTGACCAACAAGGGAGAAGTCTTTAATGAACTCGTCGGGAAG CAGCTG8Pro247–Glu249PEEGSLGCGCCAGCCGATCAGGCTTCCGCAGGCGGCGACCTG9Ala262–Asp265ATDDSTDAGCTGCTGGTGTTTTCTACTGATGCCGGCTTCCATTTC10Asp290–Glu298DNLYKRSNENNMYTMSHYCGCTGTCACCTGGAGAACAACATGTACACAATGAGCCACTACTTCGACTAC CCATCGGTG11Gly305–His309GQLAHAHLVQGACTACCCATCGGTGGCCCATCTGGTGCAGAAGCTGGCTGAAAAC12Ser324–Thr329SRMVKTEEFQPVCCCATCTTCGCGGTGACCGAGGAGTTCCAGCCCGTGTACGAGAAACTCACC13Thr334–Ile336TEIKNLGGCTGACTTGGGGATGAGGTTCTTGAGTTTCTCGTAGGT14Glu344–Asp348ELSEDTLSANAAGTCAGCCGTGGGGACCCTCTCCGCCAACTCCAGCAATGTGGTC15His354–Asn358HLIKNQLIIDTCCAGCAATGTGGTCCAGCTCATCATCGACGCTTACAATAAACTC16His371–Lys379HNALPDTLKNGKLSEGVTAGGGTCTTCCTGGATAATGGCAAGCTCTCCGAGGGCGTGACAGTCACCTAC GACTCCTTC Open table in a new tab A large number of natural mutations occur within the β2I-domain, which abolish surface expression and/or heterodimer formation (31Arnaout M.A. Dana N.

Nevertheless, when the β2 mutants were co-transfected with wild-type αM in human kidney 293 cells, all 16 mutants were expressed on the cell surface as heterodimers and the subunits had appropriate molecular weights. As shown in Fig.2, immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled cells with 44a, a mAb specific for the αM subunit, yielded two bands of ∼165 kDa (αM) and 95 kDa (β2) on SDS-PAGE. The patterns were similar to those obtained for wild-type αMβ2 (27Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, FACS analyses were conducted on these 16 mutants using a panel of β2-specific mAbs (TableII). All 16 β2 mutants were recognized by three different mAbs to the β2 subunit MEM48, 7E4, and 6.7, as well as by the αM-specific mAb 44. To exclude selection artifacts, we established at least five independent stable cell lines for each mutant β2 integrin that expressed similar levels of receptors on their cell surfaces, as judged by FACS analysis using mAb 44. Heterodimer formation, as well as other results described below, was similar for all five clones.Table IIReactivity of function-blocking monoclonal antibodies with the β2I-domain mutantsMutants44MEM48/6.7/7E4TS1/18CLB54YFC118.3H20A/R3.3/MHM23/IB4685A56.5EWild++++++++1 Arg144–Lys148++++−−−±2 Leu154–Glu159++−−−+±+3 Glu162–Gly164++++++++4 Asn181–Asp185++++++++5 Pro192–Glu197+++++−−±6 Gln199–Ala203++++++++7 Asn213–Glu220++++++−+8 Pro247–Glu249++++++++9 Ala262–Asp265++++++++10 Asp290–Glu298++++++++11 Gly305–His309++++++++12 Ser324–Thr329++++++++13 Thr334–Ile336++++++++14 Glu344–Asp348++−+++++15 His354–Asn358+++−−+++16 His371–Lys379++++++++FACS analysis was performed using 1 μg of each mAb and 106αMβ2-expressing cells.

To help locate the functional sites within the β2I-domain, we sought to map the epitopes of several β2-specific function-blocking mAbs: MHM23, IB4, 6.5E, TS1/18, CLB54, YFC118.3, R3.3, H20A, 685A5, and 7E4. The ability of these mAbs to block β2 integrin functions, such as αMβ2-mediated adhesion and C3bi binding and αLβ2-mediated binding to ICAM-1, has been well documented (38Lorenz H.M. Harrer T.

Representative FACS analyses using mAb IB4 with five of the αMβ2 mutants are shown in Fig.3 A and a summary of the FACS analyses for all 16 mutants and 12 β2-specific mAbs is shown in Table II. Among these 12 mAbs, 3 (6.7, MEM-48, and 7E4) reacted well with all 16 mutants, but not the mock-transfected 293 cells. The other nine mAbs recognized the β2I-domain, and their epitopes consisted of at least two noncontiguous sequences. For example, mAb IB4 reacted well with wild-type αMβ2, and mutants αMβ2(Leu154–Glu159), αMβ2(Asn213–Glu220) and αMβ2(His354–Asn358), but its binding to the two mutants αMβ2(Arg144–Lys148) and αMβ2(Pro192–Glu197) was ablated (Fig. 3A), suggesting that these two segments (Arg144–Lys148 and Pro192-Glu197) contribute to the epitope of IB4. As shown in Table II, in addition to IB4, mAbs MHM23, H20A, R3.3, and perhaps 6.5E also depended on segments Arg144–Lys148 and Pro192–Glu197 for their interactions with αMβ2. mAb 685A5 required segments Arg144–Lys148, Pro192–Glu197, and Asn213–Glu220; mAb TS1/18 required segments Leu154–Glu159 and Glu344–Asp348; mAb CLB54 required segments Leu154–Glu159 and His354–Asn358; and finally mAb YFC118.3 required segments Arg144–Lys148, Leu154–Glu159, and His354–Asn358. These epitopes can be roughly divided into two different groups (see Fig. 8). The first contains segments Leu154–Glu159, Glu344–Asp348, and His354–Asn358, and is important for αMβ2 interaction with mAbs TS1/18, CLB54, and YFC118.3, and the second contains segments Arg144–Lys148, Pro192–Glu197, and Asn213–Glu220, and is important for αMβ2 binding of mAbs MHM23, H20A, IB4, R3.3, and 685A5. To further support our epitope mapping results and this grouping of the mAbs, we performed two additional experiments. First, competition was performed between mAbs MHM23, IB4, and R3.3 from group 2, TS1/18 from group 1, and 7E4, which recognizes an epitope that is likely located outside of the β2I-domain. In these experiments, αMβ2-expressing cells were incubated first with the competitor mAb, IB4, R3.3, TS1/18, or 7E4, and then the reporter mAb MHM23 was added. Binding of MHM23 was measured by FACS analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 B. As predicated, mAbs IB4 and R3.3, which belong to the same group as MHM23 (group 2), blocked more than 95% of the binding of mAb MHM23 to αMβ2. In contrast, mAb TS1/18 (group 1) and mAb 7E4 had little effect on MHM23 binding. The specificity of these assays was confirmed by the ability of unlabeled MHM23 but not a control IgG to block the binding of the fluorescence-labeled MHM23 to the cells. Second, the ability of mAb IB4 to block adhesion of αMβ2-expressing cells to a representative ligand, the γ-module of fibrinogen, was assessed using wild-type and two different αMβ2 mutants. As shown in Fig. 3 C, cells expressing these three different αMβ2 receptors all adhered well to the γ-module in the presence of a control IgG. Addition of mAb IB4 completely inhibited adhesion of cells expressing the wild-type and one of the mutant receptors αMβ2(Leu154–Glu159). However, mAb IB4 had no effect on adhesion by the second mutant αMβ2(Arg144–Lys148). These results are consistent with the FACS data presented in Fig.3 A, which show that the epitope of mAb IB4 was destroyed in mutant αMβ2(Arg144–Lys148) but not in mutant αMβ2(Leu154–Glu159).Figure 8Epitopes of function-blocking mAbs in the β2I-domain.

We previously demonstrated that secretion of dense granule proteins in permeabilized parasites was augmented by the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) (Chaturvedi, S., Qi, H., Coleman, D. L., Hanson, P., Rodriguez, A., and Joiner, K. A. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 2424–2431). As now demonstrated by pharmacological and electron microscopic approaches, GTPγS enhanced release of dense granule proteins in the permeabilized cell system. To investigate the role of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) in this process, a cDNA encoding T. gondii ARF1 (TgARF1) was isolated. Endogenous and transgenic TgARF1 localized to the Golgi of T. gondii, but not to dense granules. An epitope-tagged mutant of TgARF1 predicted to be impaired in GTP hydrolysis (Q71L) partially dispersed the Golgi signal, with localization to scattered vesicles, whereas a mutant impaired in nucleotide binding (T31N) was cytosolic in location. Both mutants caused partial dispersion of a Golgi/trans-Golgi network marker. TgARF1 mutants inhibited delivery of the secretory reporter,Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, to dense granules, precluding an in vivo assessment of the role of TgARF1 in release of intact dense granules. To circumvent this limitation, recombinant TgARF1 was purified using two separate approaches, and used in the permeabilized cell assay.

Warren G. Cell. 2000; 100: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The components involved in both constitutive secretion as well as regulated release in secretory cells are broadly conserved evolutionarily (2Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Although this suggests that the same should be true in protozoan parasites, the presence of unusual secretory organelles in these organisms confounds this simple hypothesis. By the same argument, parasites provide a unique means to explore selected issues in regulation of secretion from preformed organelles (reviewed in Ref.3Ngô H. Hoppe H.C. Joiner K.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 67-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have used this logic to explore the organization of the secretory pathway in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. This parasite is an obligate intracellular pathogen that resides in the host cell within a specialized compartment, the parasitophorous vacuole (PV),1 which is separated from the host cell cytoplasm by the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM). The success of infection depends on the ability of the parasite to modify the PV and the PVM by secreting proteins to the extra-parasite environment (reviewed in Ref. 4Coppens I. Joiner K.A. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2001; http://www.ermm.cbcu.cam.ac.uk./01002277h.htmPubMed Google Scholar). Thus, secretion is a critical feature of parasite survival. T. gondii has a well-developed secretory system that includes endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and three morphologically distinct secretory organelles: micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules (DG), which discharge sequentially during and after cell invasion (reviewed in Ref. 5Stedman T. Joiner K.A. Gordon S. Advances in Cell and Molecular Biology of Membranes and Organelles. JAI Press, Greenwich, CT1999: 233-261Google Scholar). Micronemes and rhoptries are morphologically unique organelles, which discharge only at the time of cell invasion, and are therefore strictly regulated. Dense granules are morphologically similar to dense matrix granules in specialized secretory cells. Although a burst of dense granule exocytosis is described immediately following cell invasion by T. gondii, potentially consistent with regulated release (6Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dubremetz J.F. Achbarou A. Bermudes D. Joiner K.A. Parasitol. Res. 1993; 79: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), substantial dense granule release occurs throughout the intracellular residence of the organism, consistent with a constitutive process. We have previously argued that soluble proteins are delivered quantitatively and by bulk flow to dense granules (8Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), rather than to more conventional constitutive secretory vesicles, containing surface proteins of the parasite such as SAG1, making the dense granule pathway highly unique. Because constitutively secreted dense granule proteins are packaged in a distinctive organelle, T. gondii provides a more tractable system for studying control of vesicle docking and fusion at the plasma membrane than is the case in many other cells. For this reason, we previously developed a permeabilized cell secretion assay, using the pore forming protein streptolysin O (9Chaturvedi S. Qi H. Coleman D.L. Hanson P. Rodriguez A. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2424-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar), to explore the machinery mediating the unusual exocytic process for dense granules. Release was not only constitutive, but also calcium-independent (9Chaturvedi S. Qi H. Coleman D.L. Hanson P. Rodriguez A. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2424-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), an important distinction when compared to release of dense matrix granules in mammalian cells. Addition to permeabilized parasites of hamster NSF and bovine α-SNAP increased the secretion of the stably transfected dense granule secretory reporter β-lactamase (BLA). In contrast, bovine Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor blocked BLA secretion, suggesting altogether that the NSF/SNAP/SNARE/Rab machinery participates in dense granule release. The non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS significantly enhanced BLA secretion in the presence of an ATP regenerating system (ARS), indicating that one or more GTP binding proteins were implicated in dense granules exocytosis. To pursue this last point, we have now characterized the role of the GTP binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF1) in dense granule release. ARF proteins, which are broadly conserved, were first characterized by their ability to activate the cholera toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins (11Kahn R. Gilman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1-6Google Scholar). ARFS exist in two stages, bound to guanidine nucleotides: the GDP-bound “off” form, which is cytosolic, and the GTP-bound active form, which interacts with Golgi membranes and phospholipid vesicles. A major function of ARF1 is to drive, in a GTP-dependent cycle, the assembly of sets of cytosolic coat proteins onto Golgi membranes facilitating vesicle budding and conferring the timing for the release of coat proteins to the cytosol (12Kahn R. Kern F. Clark J. Gelmann E. Rulka C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2606-2614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). ARF1 was initially described to recruit the COPI coat involved in traffic between the ER and Golgi. More recent data demonstrate that ARF1 plays a role in generating clathrin-coated vesicles, by first recruiting adaptor complexes on vesicles at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and immature secretory vesicles (14Dittie A.S. Hajibagheri N. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E.

Our interests for the current work relate to the role of ARF1 in secretion from the trans-Golgi network. In mammalian cells, ARF1 stimulates release of nascent secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (19Chen Y. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5297-5300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), acting through phospholipase D (20Chen Y.G. Siddhanta A. Austin C.D. Hammond S.M. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A role of ARF1 in regulated exocytosis in mammalian cells has also been identified (21Glenn D. Thomas G. O'Sullivan A. Burgoyne R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2023-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,22Fensome A. Cunningham E. Prosser S. Khoon Tan S. Swigart P. Thomas G. Hsuan J. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this situation, ARF1 enhances the regulated secretion of preformed granules, release of which is induced physiologically by a rise in intracellular calcium following secretagogue addition. Although no evidence has previously existed to support a role for ARF1 in the docking and fusion of constitutively secreted vesicles, we provide such evidence in the current paper. The finding that ARF1 can facilitate docking and fusion of constitutively secreted dense granules was made possible by the unusual features of the T. gondii secretory system. An expressed sequence tag (EST) clone encoding a fragment of an ARF1 homologue (W66111/gi:374337) was identified from the T. gondii dbEST sequence data base. The ARF1 open reading frame in this sequence appeared to be interrupted by an unknown fragment. To subclone a full-length ARF1 cDNA, T. gondii RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for use as the PCR template. A 3′-RACE PCR strategy was employed in which the 5′-end (sense strand) oligonucleotide primers TARFUT (5′-AAA CAC GCG TCC TCT CTC TGC AAG CGA-3′) and TARF1 (5′-GGG CAC CAT GGG TTT GAG CGT CAG C-3′) were used in sequential PCR reactions with the 3′-(antisense) oligo-dT17 polyadenylation site anchor primer. In the first round, TARFUT and oligo-dT17 primers were used for cDNA amplification with Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Branchburg, NJ). The products were purified on QIAquick PCR columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and used as template in a second round PCR reaction with primers TARF1 and oligo-dT17. The resulting products were again purified on QIAquick columns and subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). To identify 3′-RACE PCR product clones from the resulting colonies, an internal ARF1 probe was generated by PCR from T. gondii cDNA using the known EST sequence with primers TARF1 and TARF2 (5′-GCG ATC TCT GTC GTT GCT GT-3′). The single PCR product was agarose gel-purified and labeled by random oligonucleotide priming with [32P]dCTP and the Rediprime II kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Colony hybridization with this probe identified several clones which contained ∼0.8-kbp inserts, and sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of a full ARF1 homologue open reading frame (ORF) and 3′-untranslated region. For expression in the parasite, an HA epitope tag with aBglII cloning site was engineered for targeting of the 3′-antisense end of the ARF1 ORF in primer ARFHAR (5′-ACT AGA TCT AAG CGT AGT CTG GGA CGT CGT ATG GGT AAT CGA TGT TTT TCT GCG CAA G-3′). The TgARF1 RACE clone ORF was PCR-amplified with TARF1, encoding anNcoI site, and ARFHAR, and subcloned into theNcoI-BglII cloning site of pNTPRab11, utilizing the T. gondii NTPase3 promoter cassette for expression. 2T. Stedman and K. A. Joiner, unpublished. The TgARF1 cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ (accession numberAF227524). Site-directed mutagenesis of TgARF1-HA was performed using a two-independent PCR amplification approach followed by triple ligation. For TgARFQ71L, the 237-bp PCR product from primers TARF1 and ARFQ71L (5′-GAA GTA GTG GCG CCA CAG AGG ACG AAT CTT GTC CAG TCC ACC G-3′) was digested with NcoI and NarI. A 333-bp TgARF1 fragment was prepared by digestion with NarI and BglII, and the two products were subcloned in vector pNTPRab11 following removal of the Rab11 open reading frame with digestion by NcoI and BglII. A plasmid encoding the untagged TgARF1T31N mutation was obtained from Kristen Hager and David Roos (University of Pennsylvania) and used for amplification with TARF1 and ARFHAR, digested with NcoI and BglII, and subcloned into pHXNTPRab11 as above. TgARF1 lacking the 17 N-terminal residues (TgARF1d17-HA) (19Chen Y. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5297-5300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Jones D. Bax B.

Plasmid sequences were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing at the WM Keck Sequencing Center, Yale University School of Medicine. The TgARF1 coding sequence with a C-terminal epitope tag (HA) was subcloned into pET-24d for overexpression in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, which do not express β-lactamase (BLA). This precludes contamination of purified TgARF1-HA with BLA, which is essential for subsequent assays monitoring BLA release from stably transfected T. gondii. Even highly purified preparations of human ARF1 and ARF1 mutants (obtained from D. Shields, New York, NY) generated in standard vectors have sufficient residual BLA contamination to invalidate secretion assays. 3A. Liendo and K. A. Joiner, unpublished observations. TgARF1 was inserted into the pET vector between the restriction sitesNcoI (at the initiating Met of ARF) and BamHI. Expression of the protein was induced with isopropylthio-β-galactoside (IPTG, 1 mm) for 4 h at 37 °C and bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation. TgARF1-HA was solubilized from the bacterial pellet using a French press at 8,000 p.s.i. in buffer A (50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DDT and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g. Two different protocols were used to purify recombinant TgARF1. First, the protocol described for human and bovine ARF1 (25Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J. Rothman J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was used, consisting of a DEAE-Sephacel column as a first step. The second purification step consisted of a gel filtration column, AcA 54 Ultrogel, equilibrated in buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). The column was developed in the same buffer at a flow rate of 19 ml/h; 2.5-ml fractions were collected. Pooled fractions containing ARF1-HA from the Ultrogel column were concentrated using a Centricon-3 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Samples were kept at −80 °C. Second, a purification protocol for soluble TgARF1-HA was developed using as a first step a dye column, Cibacron G3, equilibrated in buffer A. Subsequent wash with 1m NaCl was performed, and the elution of the active protein was performed with 1.2 m NaCl. Fractions containing TgARF1-HA were pooled and concentrated using Centricon-3 concentrators (Amicon). The second step was a gel filtration column, AcA 54 Ultrogel, as described above. Purified recombinant TgARF1-HA was frozen immediately at −80 °C. The expression of recombinant protein TgARF1-HA was monitored using SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were performed as previously described (8Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:1000) or a goat anti-human ARF1 (1:500), followed by goat anti-mouse or rabbit anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugation (1:2000) and analysis using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK). T. gondii tachyzoites were maintained by serial passage in monolayers of either African Green Monkey (Vero) cells or human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) grown in modified Eagle's minimal medium or α-minimal essential medium, respectively, supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum. The RH strain and a stable transgenic clone of the RH strain, expressing the soluble foreign secretion reporter E. coli β-lactamase (BLA) were described previously (8Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The stable transgenic clone of the RH strain, expressing bacterial alkaline phosphatase fused with the LDL receptor (BAP-LDLR) is as previously described (26Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For experiments with extracellular parasites, infected cells were scraped, and parasites were isolated by two passages through a 27-gauge needle. Permeabilization of extracellular parasites with SLO was performed using a protocol described earlier (9Chaturvedi S. Qi H. Coleman D.L. Hanson P. Rodriguez A. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2424-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Assessment of permeabilization was done by staining SLO permeabilized parasites with 4 μg/ml propidium iodide for 5 min at room temperature. The percentage of positive nuclear staining was quantitated by fluorescence microscopy. The detailed technique is described in Karsten et al. (8Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent HFF cell monolayers (12-mm coverslips) were infected with transiently transfected parasites. Transient transfection was performed by electroporation. After 16–24 h, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco, Richmond, CA) (1:200), followed by FITC or tetramethyl rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500). Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol and observed with an epifluorescence microscope. Images were captured with a charge-coupled device camera. Confluent monolayers of HFF cell were infected with a Toxoplasmastable line expressing BAP-LDLR (26Hoppe H.C. Ngô H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described earlier after 16–24 h of infection. As previously described (8Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a purified rabbit anti-BAP polyclonal was used as the first antibody (1:1000) and a goat anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated was used as secondary antibody (1:500). Purified recombinant ARF1-HA was sent to Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. for production of a polyclonal rabbit antiserum. Localization of endogenous TgARF1 in T. gondii was done by IFA. HFF cells were infected with tachyzoites (RH) for 16–24 h. After fixation and permeabilization as described above, cells were stained with the anti-TgARF1-HA antibody (1:100) followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500). Secretion assays were performed as described in a previous study (9Chaturvedi S. Qi H. Coleman D.L. Hanson P. Rodriguez A. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2424-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, extracellular parasites (5 × 107parasites/ml) expressing the soluble secretory reporter BLA were incubated with various reagents in modified potassium acetate buffer (115 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, parasites were centrifuged at 760 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was further centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Determination of BLA in parasite supernatants was done by the method described earlier (9Chaturvedi S. Qi H. Coleman D.L. Hanson P. Rodriguez A. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2424-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. 40 μl of parasite supernatant (5 × 107 parasites/ml) were added to each well of 96-well plate. 160 μl of nitrocefin mix (0.2 mmnitrocefin, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0) was added to develop the reaction. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Plates were read at 492 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Infected Vero cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde in 0.25 m Hepes, pH 7.4, for 2 days at 4 °C. Sections were obtained in the Yale Center for Cell Imaging using a Leica Ultracut microtome with fetal calf serum cryoattachment at −108 °C. Immunolabeling was performed with rabbit anti-TgARF1 antisera (1:50) followed by protein A-gold (1:70, from the laboratory of J. Slot, Utrecht, Holland). The sections were contrasted with neutral uranyl acetate (2%), infiltrated with methyl cellulose (1.8%) and uranyl acetate (0.5%), air-dried, and examined with a Philips 410 transmission electron microscope. Extracellular parasites were permeabilized with SLO as described previously (9Chaturvedi S. Qi H. Coleman D.L. Hanson P. Rodriguez A. Joiner K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 2424-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GTPγS and tannic acid arrest of secretion is similar to the methodology described in Newman et al. (29Newman T.M. Tian M. Gomperts B.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 209-220PubMed Google Scholar). For 8 min at 37 °C, permeabilized parasites were incubated with or without 100 μm GTPγS, 2% tannic acid, and an ATP-regenerating system containing 2 mm ATP. Between washes, samples were fixed sequentially with 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tretroxide in 100 mmsodium cacodylate buffer. Fixed samples were processed for Epon embedding and sectioned for transmission electron microscopy using standard protocols. Binding of [35S]GTPγS to TgARF1-HA was determined essentially as described previously (11Kahn R. Gilman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1-6Google Scholar). Purified recombinant TgARF1-HA or TgARF1 mutants were incubated at 30 °C with 1 μm [35S]GTPγS (2.8 × 106 cpm) in 100 μl of 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. After 2 h at 30 °C, samples were filtered through nitrocellulose filters. The filters were washed three times with the same buffer. Radioactivity retained by the nitrocellulose filters was quantified with a liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard 2500 TR). We have previously argued that soluble proteins are delivered to and retained quantitatively in T. gondii dense granules, via a bulk flow pathway (8Karsten V. Qi H. Beckers C.J.M. Dubremetz J.F. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1323-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because this result was not expected, we considered at the time the alternative that a portion of dense granule proteins was released via a budding process from forming dense granules, analogous to the situation in pancreatic β-cells (27Kuliawat R. Klumperman J. Ludwig T. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Failure to block dense granule protein release using Brefeldin A was interpreted at the time to provide evidence that all release was from preformed dense granules. However, it has recently been demonstrated that Brefeldin A can augment release of endosomes containing soluble proteins previously routed through immature secretory granules (28Turner M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14025-14030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine if this process was operative in T. gondii, parasites were treated with wortmannin, which blocks trafficking of lysosomal proenzymes to endosomes, by inhibiting AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles formation from immature secretory granules (28Turner M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14025-14030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). No inhibition of either BLA or GRA3 secretion was observed in intact parasites (TableI). This result supports the original argument that soluble proteins in T. gondii are delivered and retained quantitatively within dense granules.Table IWortmannin does not alter release of T. gondii dense granule proteinsTreatmentGRA3 releaseBLA releaseA405A492Control0.29 ± 0.050.52 ± 0.12Wortmannin0.26 ± 0.080.56 ± 0.09Monolayers of HFF cells infected 16 h previously with parasites stably expressing BLA were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with media alone or media containing 0.5 μm wortmannin.

Affinity chromatography was utilized to purify UPase from colon 26 and NIH 3T3 cells using the uridine phosphorylase inhibitor 5′-amino benzylacyclouridine linked to an agarose matrix. Vimentin copurification with UPase was confirmed using both Western blot analysis and MALDI-MS methods. Separation of cytosolic proteins using gel filtration chromatography yields a high molecular weight complex containing UPase and vimentin. Purified recombinant UPase and recombinant vimentin were shown to bind in vitro with an affinity of 120 pm and a stoichiometry of 1:2. Immunofluorescence techniques confirm that UPase is associated with vimentin in both NIH 3T3 and colon 26 cells and that depolymerization of the microtubule system using nocodazole results in UPase remaining associated with the collapsed intermediate filament, vimentin. Our data demonstrate that UPase is associated with both the soluble and insoluble pools of vimentin. Approximately 60–70% of the total UPase exists in the cytosol as a soluble protein. Sequential extraction of NIH 3T3 or colon 26 cells liberates an additional 30–40% UPase activity associated with a detergent extractable fraction. All pools of UPase have been shown to possess enzymatic activity. We demonstrate for the first time that UPase is associated with vimentin and the existence of an enzymatically active cytoskeleton-associated UPase.

The ability of cells to maintain a constant supply of pyrimidine and purine nucleotides is dependent on both de novosynthetic and salvage pathways. The relative importance of either thede novo or the salvage pathway in the maintenance of nucleotide pools is variable and dependent on the cell or tissue type (reviewed in Refs. 1Connolly G.P.

Primary antibodies against UPase were prepared at Yale (rabbit anti-UPase polyclonal antibody to human recombinant UPase) (35Liu M.-P. Cao D. Russell R. Handschumacher R.E. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 5418-5424Google Scholar), or purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) (mouse anti-Vimentin Clone V9). Secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and Texas red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit) or (fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas red-conjugated sheep anti-mouse) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). Antibodies for vimentin (V9 or monoclonal antibody clone 13.2) or polyclonal goat anti-vimentin were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Immunoaffinity support for antibody immobilization and antibody purification was purchased from Pierce. Affi-Gel-10-activated agarose and protein assay reagent were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). 5′-Amino benzylacyclouridine and benzylacyclouridine (BAU) were a generous gift from Dr. S. Chu at Brown University (Providence, RI). Cells (NIH 3T3 and colon 26) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. NIH 3T3 cells were purchased from ATCC, and colon 26 cells were derived from the solid tumor (grown in vivo) using standard procedures. Colon 26 cells were originally obtained from Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL) and grown subcutaneously in BALB/C mice. The BAU affinity column was prepared by coupling amino-BAU to an Affi-Gel-10-agarose matrix as previously described (35Liu M.-P. Cao D. Russell R. Handschumacher R.E. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 5418-5424Google Scholar). Antibody affinity columns were prepared using a cyanoborohydride coupling procedure (Pierce) following manufacturer guidelines. Vimentin antibody was purchased from Sigma (goat anti-vimentin and clone V9 mouse anti-vimentin were both used to prepare affinity columns). In all affinity chromatographic procedures, cells (colon 26 or NIH 3T3) or solid tumors (colon 26) were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (containing 2 mm dithiothreitol), using a Dounce homogenization apparatus or tissue homogenizer, respectively. Cell lysates were prepared at 4 °C, and the supernatant from the 30,000 × g centrifugation was applied to the column. Following sample application, the column was washed with ∼10 volumes of buffer or until the column effluent contained no detectable protein (Bio-Rad Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 dye reagent). Sample elution was accomplished using 4–8 column volumes of 0.1 m glycine (antibody affinity column) or 20 mm uridine (BAU affinity column). The eluted proteins were concentrated using Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filters (Millipore) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot techniques. Cell lysates from colon 26 cells grown as a monolayer in 150-cm2 dishes were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl pH 7.4 (TBS). Cytosolic fractions were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h and applied to a Sephacryl-s300 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been calibrated using known molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mobile phase was 20 mmTris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Protein elution of standards was monitored in fractions using the Bio-Rad Coomassie Blue G-250 dye reagent. The ability of UPase and vimentin to form a stoichiometric complex was evaluated using purified recombinant vimentin (cytoskeleton) directly applied to nitrocellulose membranes. Known quantities of recombinant vimentin (431–3.4 pm) or similar protein concentrations of BSA as a negative control was applied to nitrocellulose membranes and allowed to air dry. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk. Purified UPase was directly coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and used to probe the nitrocellulose membranes containing BSA and vimentin. The concentration of UPase bound to vimentin was calculated from a standard curve containing 5–0.15 μg of horseradish peroxidase-UPase directly applied to nitrocellulose and exposed to ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at the same time as the vimentin membrane. Large quantities of human UPase recombinant protein were prepared using the pQE expression system (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Briefly, human UPase cDNA was released from pMal/Hup with EcoRI and HindII (35Liu M.-P. Cao D. Russell R. Handschumacher R.E. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 5418-5424Google Scholar) and inserted into pBluescript KS II vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) generating a pBlue/Hup construct. Then, human UPase cDNA was released by BamHI and HindIII and inserted into a pQE 30 vector, generating a prokaryotic expression vector, pQE/Hup, that produces the full-length human UPase recombinant protein. After the construct was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions, a single M15 transformant was incubated overnight in LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was diluted 1:100 in 1 liter of LB broth and grown untilA600 reached 0.5. The growth was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min, 7000 × g at 4 °C, and resuspended in 30 ml lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The bacterial suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, followed by sonication at 300 watts for 6 × 10 s with 10-s intervals, and the lysate was clarified by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C (Sorvall, Newton, CT). Protein binding was performed at 4 °C for 2 h by addition of 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin into the supernatant. The resin-protein mix was then loaded onto the column and washed with wash buffer (same as lysis buffer except for imidazole increased to 40 mm). UPase protein tagged with 6× histidine remained on the column and was eluted by imidazole step-gradient buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, plus imidazole at 120, 180, 240, and 300 mm). The presence of UPase in the fractions was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Coomassie Blue staining and confirmed by enzyme activity assay. UPase enzyme activity was measured by uridine conversion to uracil, using TLC chromatographic separation as described previously (35Liu M.-P. Cao D. Russell R. Handschumacher R.E. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 5418-5424Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were prepared using 50 mm Tris-HCl. The cell pellet remaining following disruption by Dounce homogenization was sequentially extracted using 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, and the supernatant following the 30,000 × g centrifugation was analyzed for enzyme activity. Finally, the pellet remaining after Triton X-100 solubilization was extracted using radioimmune precipitation (RIPA) buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS), and the supernatant was analyzed for enzyme activity. Enzyme activity was measured as the percent conversion of [3H]uridine to [3H]uracil (scintillation counting) following separation on silica TLC plates (Kieselgel 60, Merck), using an 85:15:5 mixture of chloroform and methanol to acetic acid, respectively. The effect of detergents on UPase enzymatic activity was evaluated using purified recombinant UPase to which the detergents were added to the final concentrations used in the extraction methods. No significant alteration in activity was noted in the presence of the detergents used. For whole cell immunofluorescence analyses, cells were grown to 50–70% confluence on glass cell culture slides. After a brief wash with PBS, cell monolayers were fixed with 3.8% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were washed briefly in PBS (5 min) and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min), and nonspecific binding was blocked using 3% BSA or serum of the same specificity as the secondary antibody when available (10 min). Incubation with the primary antibody was performed for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the excess unbound antibody (two times 5 min with PBS), sample was exposed for 1 h to secondary antibody at room temperature. The excess secondary antibody was washed with PBS, and the slides were mounted in fluorescent antibody-compatible medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Photographs were taken using a Ziess Axiophot microscope and camera apparatus. All experiments included a negative nonspecific serum (preimmune serum) control to ensure specificity of the observed fluorescence. In the case of dual antibody detection, reagent compatibility was determined using normal or preimmune serum and secondary antibodies as negative controls singly and in combination. Cytoskeleton immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (36Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Methods Enzymol... 1998; 298: 570-592Google Scholar). Cells grown to 70% confluence on glass slide covers were rinsed briefly in PBS, and then soluble proteins were extracted for 3–5 min at room temperature using cytoskeleton buffer (100 mmPIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA containing 4% polyethylene glycol and 1% Triton X-100). Following extraction, cell cytoskeletons were rinsed three times with cytoskeleton stabilizing buffer without detergent. The immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described above. The unknown protein band was excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel and digested overnight using trypsin as described (37Stone K.L. DeAngelis R. LoPresti M. Jones J. Papov V. Williams K. Electrophoresis.. 1998; 19: 1046-1052Google Scholar). The peptides were subsequently analyzed using MALDI-MS and the Profound peptide data base at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer/W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (38Fenyo D. BioInformatics.. 1999; 15: 339-340Google Scholar, 39Fenyo D. Zhang W. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem... 1996; 68: A721-A726Google Scholar). Uridine phosphorylase was purified from NIH 3T3 and colon 26 cells using an affinity column coupled to the high affinity uridine phosphorylase inhibitor, 5′-amino-benzylacyclouridine. For colon 26 cells, solid tumor homogenate was affixed to the BAU column. The Coomassie Blue-stained blot of UPase eluted using 20 mmuridine is shown in Fig. 1 (lane 1). The one-step purification procedure results in the isolation of UPase and the copurification of a 58-kDa species. The identification of the lower band as UPase using Western blot analysis is shown in Fig. 1 (lane 2). No cross reactivity of the UPase antibody with the upper band was noted. The lower band at 34 kDa in Fig. 1, lane 1, represents purified UPase, and the upper band (∼58 kDa) was identified as vimentin using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) of the tryptic digest (Fig.2). The tryptic digest of the Coomassie Blue-stained 58-kDa band excised from acrylamide gel covered 57% of the protein using a mass tolerance of ±0.2 atomic mass unit for monoisotopic and ±0.5 atomic mass unit for observed average masses.Figure 2The tryptic digest of the upper band shown in Fig. 1 was identified as vimentin using MALDI-MS. The internal standards were 100 fmol of bradykinin, which has a protonated, monoisotopic mass of 1060.57, and adrenocorticotropic hormone clip, which has a protonated, monoisotopic mass of 2465.2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We analyzed NIH 3T3 cells to evaluate whether the copurification of UPase with vimentin was a phenomenon specific to colon 26 tumor cells, which contain highly elevated levels of UPase. UPase was purified from NIH 3T3 and colon 26 cell lines using the BAU column as described, and the results of the Western blots are shown in Fig.3 (A and B), respectively. In both cases, vimentin was identified in the BAU eluate using Clone V9 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) as shown in Figs.3 A, lane 2, and 3B, lane 2. We, and others (35Liu M.-P. Cao D. Russell R. Handschumacher R.E. Pizzorno G. Cancer Res... 1998; 58: 5418-5424Google Scholar, 40Bose R. Yamada E.W. Biochemistry.. 1974; 13: 2051-2056Google Scholar) have previously shown that the majority of the UPase in cells exists in a soluble form that is readily extractable using near-physiologic buffers (40Bose R. Yamada E.W. Biochemistry.. 1974; 13: 2051-2056Google Scholar). This is in contrast to what is known about the intermediate filament vimentin, which is one of the most insoluble proteins known. In fact, it has been shown that less than 1% of the total vimentin exists in cells as soluble tetramers (41Soellner P. Quinlan R.A. Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1985; 82: 7929-7933Google Scholar). The fact that UPase and vimentin are copurified in cell/tumor extracts using physiologic buffers suggests that a fraction of UPase exists in combination with this soluble pool of vimentin. To confirm the association of UPase with vimentin in the cytosol, we performed gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl-s300 column to separate the UPase monomer from that which is associated with vimentin. As shown in Fig. 4 A, UPase elutes from the column as two distinct peaks. The high molecular mass species elutes at ∼400–500 kDa, and the low molecular mass peak elutes as a broad peak with a mean value of about 34 kDa, suggesting that it exists predominantly as a monomer in the cytoplasm. The shoulder on the low molecular mass peak may indicate that UPase exists in both monomeric and dimeric forms or is associated with another protein, under these experimental conditions. Vimentin coelutes from the Sephacryl-s300 column in the same fractions containing the high molecular mass UPase, again suggesting they exist in the cytosolic pool as a complex. The Western blot shown in Fig. 4 B shows the UPase and vimentin present in each fraction depicted in Fig. 4 A. Confirmation of the association of UPase with the soluble pool of vimentin was also confirmed using a combination of gel filtration chromatography and immune precipitation (data not shown). The stoichiometry of the UPase-vimentin complex, was estimated using a slot blot binding assay to measure direct protein-protein interactions. Purified recombinant human UPase was directly coupled to horseradish peroxidase and used to probe known concentrations of purified recombinant vimentin (inset, Fig.5, lane A) or BSA (inset, Fig. 5, lane B) and the Scatchard transformation is shown in Fig. 5. Using this technique, the stoichiometry of UPase binding to vimentin is calculated at ∼1:2 and the Kd of the complex is 120 pm. We wanted to determine whether UPase could be found in combination with the polymeric form of vimentin, so NIH 3T3 cells and colon 26 cells were sequentially extracted using Tris-buffered saline, followed by 1% Triton X-100, and finally RIPA buffer. The detergent extracts were utilized to solubilize cytoskeleton (including vimentin) and associated proteins while maintaining optimum enzyme activity (TableI) and UPase-vimentin association (Fig.6). Extracts from each of these conditions were affinity-purified using anti-vimentin chromatography. The results from these experiments demonstrate that UPase and vimentin exist together in a complex in each of these fractions. Fig.6 B shows a Western blot of UPase isolated from colon 26 cell lysates purified using anti-vimentin affinity column and indicates the presence of a UPase-vimentin complex in each of these fractions. Although the extraction of vimentin from both the Tris and Triton X-100 fractions are similar (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1 and2), less vimentin was retained on the affinity column in the RIPA solubilized fraction, probably a function of lower antibody efficiency in the presence of detergents contained in the RIPA buffer. The predominant form of UPase exists in the Tris-soluble fraction in combination with the soluble tetrameric vimentin. Further solubilization of the cell pellet with Triton X-100 liberates a smaller percentage of UPase (∼15–30% based on enzymatic activity shown in Table I) suggesting less UPase is associated with the polymeric membrane-associated form of vimentin liberated using this technique. Finally, there is a very small percentage of UPase released by the final RIPA solubilization of the pellet, which is between 10–20% based on enzymatic activity (Table I) and is difficult to visualize on the Western blot shown in Fig. 6. This additional pool of UPase is also associated with the polymeric form of vimentin. Taken together, both the Triton X-100 and RIPA buffer extracted UPase represent between 25–50% additional UPase enzymatic activity found in association with the polymeric and membrane-associated vimentin pool.Table IFraction of total UPase associated with the soluble and detergent insoluble cytoskeletonCell lineTrisTriton X-100RIPA% of total UPase enzyme activityNIH 3T362.1 (6.0)22.7 (8.2)15.3 (2.3)Colon 2659.3 (2.9)24.8 (4.1)15.8 (4.9)Cells grown to 70% confluence were trypsinized and extracted sequentially using 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100 and RIPA buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enzymatic activity was measured as a fraction of the total in three independent extractions and the mean of these data are shown with the standard error of the mean in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Cells grown to 70% confluence were trypsinized and extracted sequentially using 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100 and RIPA buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enzymatic activity was measured as a fraction of the total in three independent extractions and the mean of these data are shown with the standard error of the mean in parentheses. Western blots of NIH 3T3 (lanes 1–3) and colon 26 cells (lanes 4–6) sequentially extracted without detergent (lanes 1 and 4), using 1% Triton X-100 (lanes 2 and 5) and RIPA buffer (lanes 3 and 6) are shown in Fig.7. The distribution pattern of vimentin in these fractions is shown in the upper panel(A), and the distribution of UPase in the same fractions is shown in the lower panel (B). Although UPase and vimentin copurify in all three fractions as determined by affinity chromatography (Fig. 6), there is an inverse relationship between the relative abundance of each protein in these fractions. Although the majority of UPase exists in the Tris buffer-soluble fraction (lanes 1 and 4) for NIH 3T3 and colon 26 cells, respectively, less than 1% of the total vimentin has been shown to exist in this pool (41Soellner P. Quinlan R.A. Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1985; 82: 7929-7933Google Scholar) (Fig. 7 A, lanes 1 and4). Although 99% of the vimentin exists in the polymeric form and is extractable using detergents (Fig. 7 A,lanes 3 and 6), less than 20% of the total UPase is present in this fraction (RIPA) based on enzyme activity (TableI). Further evidence for the association of UPase with the polymeric form of vimentin was demonstrated using NIH 3T3 cells from which soluble proteins were extracted in the presence of cytoskeleton stabilizing agents (36Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Methods Enzymol... 1998; 298: 570-592Google Scholar). We extracted NIH 3T3 cells grown on glass slides with cytoskeleton-stabilizing buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 4% polyethylene glycol as described (36Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G.

The mutations, but not the fusion to the C-terminal end of the wild-type, reduced the exonuclease activity. The residual exonuclease activity of the mutant proteins has been kinetically studied, together with potential alterations in metal binding at the active site. Comparison of the catalytic rate and dissociation constant of the D10G, E114G, and E88K mutants and the control fusion protein support: (i) a critical function of Asp10 in the catalytic event, (ii) a role of Glu114 in the exonucleolytic reaction, being secondarily involved in both catalysis and DNA binding, and (iii) a nonessential function of Glu88 for the exonuclease activity of Spn pol I. Moreover, the pattern of metal activation of the mutant proteins indicates that none of the three residues is a metal-ligand at the active site.

Such detailed study have provided a prototypical molecular model of DNA-dependent DNA polymerization and important insights into the architecture of the primer and nucleotide binding sites. By contrast, despite the mutational and structural analysis of several 5′-3′ exonucleolytic domains of eubacterial polymerases (7Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28531-28538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of the exonucleolytic reaction still remains obscure. Sequence comparisons and enzymatic studies indicate that the eubacterial pol1 I-associated 5′ nucleases share significant sequence homology with the polymerase-independent 5′ nucleases from several bacteriophages (13Gutman P.D. Minton K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4406-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic 5′ nucleases are also related to mammalian FEN-1 proteins and several yeast proteins of the RAD2 family, having two large blocks of sequence similarity that bear some resemblance to the bacterial and bacteriophage nuclease sequences (14Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 15Robins P. Pappin D.J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28535-28538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some clues to identify important residues in the bacterial 5′-3′ exonuclease family derive from the multiple sequence alignment of 10 bacterial and bacteriophage nucleases (13Gutman P.D. Minton K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4406-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Six conserved sequence motifs containing 14 invariant amino acids were identified, 9 of which were carboxylate residues. The presence of highly conserved carboxylate residues led to the proposal that some of these amino acids could be involved in metal binding at the active site of the 5′-3′ exonucleases, as occurs in other enzymes catalyzing phosphoryl transfer reactions (1Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been further supported by structural data from the 5′ nucleases from bacteriophage T5 (10Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and Taq pol (9Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and from T4 RNase H (11Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In these three proteins, the 5′ nuclease active site consists of a set of carboxylate residues, which coordinate metal ligands that are essential for the nuclease activity. However, several intriguing differences among the three active sites exist, which pose some important questions. DNA polymerase I of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn pol I) is a bifunctional protein having two enzymatic activities: DNA polymerase and 5′-3′ exonuclease (16López P. Martı́nez S. Dı́az A. Espinosa M. Lacks S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4255-4263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These activities are located on different domains of the protein that are arranged in the same order in all pol I-like DNA polymerases (17Dı́az A. Pons M.E. Lacks S.A. López P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2014-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pons M.E. Dı́az A. Lacks S.A. López P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Like other DNA polymerases of the family, both enzymatic activities of Spn pol I are involved in DNA-repair processes (19López P. Martı́nez S. Dı́az A. Espinosa M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4869-4871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dı́az A. Lacks S.A. López P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unlike that of Escherichia coli (21Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 636-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the exonucleolytic domain has proved to be essential for pneumococcal cell viability (20Dı́az A. Lacks S.A. López P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the exonuclease activity of Spn pol I showed an essential role for Asp10 and Asp190 in the exonucleolytic reaction, since the substitution of these carboxylate residues by Ala led to an almost total inactivation of the nuclease domain in Spn polID10A protein (22Amblar M. Sagner G. López P. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 63: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and to a drastic reduction of the catalytic efficiency as well as to an altered metal binding in the Spn polID190A mutant protein (23Amblar M. López P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the overproduction and purification of a His-tagged fusion form of Spn pol I and the introduction of mutations at three residues of the exonucleolytic domain of the protein: Asp10 and Glu114 (proposed metal ligands in other nucleases) and Glu88 (highly conserved among prokaryotic 5′ nucleases). We also report the use of these enzymes in a kinetic study to explore the roles of the conserved carboxylate residues in the exonucleolytic reaction. Finally, we present a three-dimensional model of the putative 5′-3′ exonucleolytic domain of Spn pol I, built by homology modeling, in order to provide us with a framework to support some structural explanations of the Spn pol I mutant activities. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs. T7 DNA polymerase and inorganic pyrophosphatase were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Taq pol from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Pfu pol from Stratagene. Unlabeled oligonucleotide primers were synthesized in a Gene Assembler (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at the Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas (Madrid, Spain). The E. coli strains used were JM109 (endA1 recA1gyrA96 thi hsdR17 (r K- m K+) relA1supE44 I− Δ(lac-proAB) F′ (traD36proA + B + lacIqZΔM15) (24Yanish-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11471) Google Scholar) for cloning experiments and BL21(DE3) (F- r B- m B- gal ompT (int::PlacUV5− T7gen1 imm21 nin5) (25Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4839) Google Scholar) for expression of enzymes to be purified. The pMA6 plasmid was constructed by cloning a 5.3-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment from plasmid pSM29 (26Martı́nez S. López P. Espinosa M. Lacks S.A. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), containing the pneumococcal polA gene, into theEcoRI site of the phagemid pAlter-1 vector (Promega). By site-directed mutagenesis, two new restriction sites were introduced at both sides of the polA gene on pMA6 plasmid:EcoRI (between the −10 and −35 boxes) and XhoI (at the stop codon of the gene). Then, the mutated polA gene was excised from the pMA6 derivative by digestion at the newly createdEcoRI and XhoI restriction sites and ligated to the pET21b (fusion vector derived from the E. coli pET5 expression vector; Ref. 27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, named pMA9, contains the polA gene fused at its 3′ end to an His tag coding sequence under the control of T7 gene φ10 promoter (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the stop codon of the structural gene was replaced by a DNA fragment encoding the amino acid sequence LE(H)6obtaining the fusion derivative named Spn pol I-(His), which can be selectively bounded to chelating Sepharose resin through the histidine residues. Plasmid pMA10 was derived from pMA9 by removal of the 80-bpXbaI-EcoRI fragment containing the ribosome binding site of φ10 gene and the T7 tag coding region. Expression plasmids for pol I derivatives having mutations at the 5′-3′ exonucleolytic domain of the protein, were obtained by swapping the 399-bp EcoRI-NheI restriction fragment from pMA10 for the corresponding PCR mutagenic products. The sequence of the mutated polA genes was determined by thermal cycle sequencing of the resulting recombinant plasmids using Taq pol, the Abitrin 377 automatic sequencer and the corresponding kit supplied by Applied Biosystems Inc., at the Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas. Introduction of the restriction sites EcoRI and XhoI at the pneumococcal polA gene was carried out using ECR (5′-CAATGGTATTTTTTGAATTCTTTCCTTTATA-3′) and XHO (5′-CTGGTACGAGGCTAAACTCGAGGGGGGCTAGTCCTC-3′) oligonucleotides, and the Altered Site in vitro mutagenesis system from Promega. Mutations of the 5′-3′ exonucleolytic domain coding region ofpolA gene were obtained by using the high yield method for site-directed mutagenesis by PCR and three primers as described by Steingberg et al. (28Steinberg R.A. Gorman K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primer used was 5′-AAATTATTATTGATTNNNGGGTCTTCTGTAGCT-3′, where N corresponds to degenerated position within the 10th codon, at which the four nucleotides can be introduced. ECR and A-PCR (5′-AGGGATATTATCCGACTTATCACCCA-3′) oligonucleotides were used as primers for the amplification reaction. PCR products were digested withEcoRI and NheI and subcloned into the expression plasmid pMA10. The resulting reaction mixture was introduced inE. coli JM109 strain by electroporation, and a set of the clones obtained were sequenced to determine the mutation efficiency. The PCR mutagenic procedure was first carried out using Taq pol during the amplification reaction. The analysis of 36 clones showed that 21 of them contained mutations at non-targeted positions of thepolA gene, such as insertions or deletions (resulting in frameshift mutations), or multiple base substitutions. Only 4 of the 36 clones contained different mutations (GCG, CAG, CGU, and UAG) at the 10th codon (GAU), giving the amino acid substitutions D10A, D10Q, D10R, and D10stop, respectively. One of the non-targeted mutations obtained during PCR reactions caused a change at codon 88 (GAG by AAG), resulting in the E88K amino acid substitution in Spn pol I. Then, a second round of PCR mutagenesis was carried out using Pfu pol (enzyme with high fidelity of polymerization). Of the 37 clones analyzed, 17 were found to carry plasmids with mutations at the 10th codon. Moreover, this analysis revealed five new mutations, in which codon number 10 was replaced by AGU, GUG, ACU, AAA, or GGC. Such changes correspond, respectively, to the amino acid substitutions D10S, D10V, D10T, D10K, and D10G. Only one clone contained, in addition to D10A mutation, the amino acid substitution E114G (change of GAG by GGG at codon 114). Since Glu114 is highly conserved in the family of prokaryotic 5′-3′ exonucleases (13Gutman P.D. Minton K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4406-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the mutation at this position was subcloned as a single amino acid substitution of Spn pol I into the expression plasmid pMA10, making use of NdeI andXhoI sites of polA gene that are bracketing the 114th codon. Plasmid pMA10 and its derivatives were transferred to the E. coliBL21(DE3) overproducer strain. The expression of the wild-type pol I enzyme and its fusion derivatives was achieved by IPTG induction of the host strain BL21(DE3) (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) containing the corresponding expression plasmid (pSM23 for wild-type enzyme (26Martı́nez S. López P. Espinosa M. Lacks S.A. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and pMA10 set plasmids for fusion proteins). Cells containing the corresponding plasmid were grown in M9 medium, supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.45 at 600 nm, and then induced by addition of 0.75 mmIPTG. Samples were withdrawn at different induction times and crude extracts prepared to test enzymatic activities. The crude extracts were also examined by 0.1% SDS, 8% PAGE. Quantification of the proportion of Spn pol I and mutant forms in crude extracts was performed by scanning the gels with the Molecular Analyst system (Bio-Rad). Cell pastes obtained from 1.5-ml IPTG-induced cultures of the appropriate strain were washed by suspension in 1 ml of buffer I (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol), centrifuged, and suspended in 58 μl of lysis buffer II (323 μg/ml lysozyme in buffer I). The resulting suspensions were incubated 5 min at 37 °C, supplemented with 92 μl of buffer I, and incubated for another 5 min at 37 °C. Then, samples were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 37 °C and subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing at −70 °C and 37 °C, respectively. The viscosity of the extracts was reduced by passage through a 0.36-mm inner diameter needle; extracts were then centrifuged and the supernatant stored at −70 °C. Cells from 100-ml IPTG-induced cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 50 ml of buffer A (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmHPO4Na2, pH 7.6), and suspended in 10 ml of the same buffer. Cell lysis was achieved by incubation with 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 0 °C and three cycles of freezing and thawing. The crude extracts were ultracentrifuged at 81,000 ×g, 50 min, and the soluble fraction recovered. After addition of 10 mm imidazole, the clarified extracts were added to 4 ml of Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously charged and equilibrated in buffer A plus 10 mm imidazole. The mixture was incubated by end-over-end rotation with gentle agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was sedimented by centrifugation at 2000 × g, 3 min, and washed three times by addition of five volumes of 10 mmimidazole/buffer A and incubation for 5 min at 4 °C as described above. After washing, the resin was again incubated with two volumes of 40 mm imidazole/buffer A, and the protein was eluted by incubation with an equal volume of 100 mm imidazole/buffer A. The imidazole was removed from the sample by dialysis against buffer A plus 50% glycerol, allowing at the same time the concentration and equilibration in the storage buffer. Quantification of the proteins was carried out by gel fractionation of the sample and scanning of the gels with a Molecular Analyst system (Bio-Rad). Polymerase activity was determined on activated calf thymus DNA following the method described previously (18Pons M.E. Dı́az A. Lacks S.A. López P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). One unit of polymerase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the incorporation of 10 nmol of dNTP into DNA in 30 min at 37 °C. The nuclease activity in DNA-containing 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis and removal of SDS was assayed as previously described by Rosenthal and Lacks (29Rosenthal A.L. Lacks S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 76-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Exonuclease activity, assayed using salmon sperm DNA, was determined in the presence of 0.1 mmMnCl2 after 30 min at 37 °C, as described previously (16López P. Martı́nez S. Dı́az A. Espinosa M. Lacks S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4255-4263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The salmon sperm substrate, (previously nicked with pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I) was labeled with [3H]dTTP using Spn polIc269 (an Spn pol I derivative that only contains the polymerase domain; Ref. 18Pons M.E. Dı́az A. Lacks S.A. López P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Exonuclease activity was also tested using a 5′-32P-labeled (5′-CCAGTCACGACGTTGT-3′) or 3′-32P-labeled (5′-CCAGTCACGACGTTGTA-3′) oligonucleotide annealed to M13mp2 ssDNA as described (23Amblar M. López P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The concentration of DNA substrate, MnCl2 or MgCl2 and enzymes as well as reaction time are indicated under “Results.”; In the case of reactions with 5′ end-labeled substrate, the concentration of mutant proteins used was as high as possible without exceeding the inhibitory concentration of 8% glycerol in the reaction (enzymes were stored in 50% glycerol). One unit of exonuclease activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required for the release of 10 nmol of nucleotide from DNA in 30 min at 37 °C. To measure the 5′-3′ exonuclease rates, experiments were performed using the 3′-32P-labeled 17-mer oligonucleotide annealed to M13mp2 ssDNA as substrate, as described previously (23Amblar M. López P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The assays were carried out with the preferred divalent metal ion at the optimal concentration for the nuclease activity (0.1 mmMnCl2) and increasing substrate concentrations. The amount of each enzyme was adjusted to obtain linear conditions, and samples (2 μl) were removed at appropriate times during incubation at 37 °C. The products were fractionated in a 20% polyacrylamide gel, where the degradation products are distinguished as discrete bands. A typical experiment is depicted in Fig. 1. The experimental objective was to determine the velocity of exonucleolysis (νn,n−1) by measuring the proportion of reaction products of n and n− 1 nucleotides in the gel. Since every primer that reached positionn− 1 also reached position n, the velocity at the site can be expressed by the following equation.νn,n−1=∑i=mnIit∑i=mn-1IiInEquation 1 t is the reaction time, Ii is the integrated intensity at site i expressed as a percentage of total substrate, and m is the length of the final product of the reaction. The velocity of the conversion reaction ν15,14 and ν14,13 was measured in order to minimize the contribution of both initial DNA-protein complex formation and the high dissociation rate at 11-mer product observed for all proteins analyzed (Fig. 1 and results not shown). The velocities remained essentially constant for tup to 30 min for all fusion proteins, indicating that the DNA-enzyme complexes at the point of analysis were in steady state (data not shown). In addition, the concentration of the 15-mer and 14-mer substrates remained lower than 5% of the total DNA, indicating that only one turnover was measured. The relationship of velocity and concentration of primed M13mp2 DNA substrate conformed to the Michaelis-Menten equation, as indicated by linearity in the Lineweaver-Burk plots (30Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. 2nd Ed. Portland Press, London1995: 30-32Google Scholar) of [1/v] versus[1/primed M13mp2] (Fig. S1). The double-reciprocal plots depicted in Fig. S1 (available as supplemental material in the on-line version of this article) were fitted by a linear least-squares regression analysis and used to determine, from the intercepts, Vmax(corresponding to the maximum value ofI n−1/In) andK m (corresponding to the value of [primed M13mp2] when I n−1/In is at half-maximum). The catalytic rate of the exonuclease reaction (kcat) was calculated asVmax/[Etotal], ([Etotal] being the concentration of enzyme used in the assay). Formation of DNA-Spn pol I derivative complexes was measured by using alkali-treated nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, type HAWP 45 μm) as described by McEntee et al. (31McEntee K. Weinstock G. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The DNA substrate was obtained by PCR amplification of the BglII-XbaI 2239-bp polA gene fragment using ECR and A-PCR oligonucleotides and [α-32P]dCTP and Taq pol enzyme, which generate dsDNA with 3′ protruding ends. The resulting 616-bp dsDNA was treated withNheI restriction enzyme, and the 414-bp product, which contains only one 5′ protruding end, was purified by gel electrophoresis. As the presence of metal ion in the binding buffer was required to detect specific DNA retention on the filters (data not shown), it was necessary to standardize conditions of the binding assay to minimize 5′-3′ exonuclease activity. The standard binding reaction was carried out in 30 μl of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 2.6% glycerol, 0.1 mm MnCl2) with 0.6 nmof the α-32P-labeled 414-bp PCR product and increasing amounts of protein. The mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 15 °C in order to reach DNA-protein equilibrium and the reactions stopped by addition of 150 μl of ice-cold buffer B. Samples were filtered, washed with 9 ml of the same buffer, and dried, and their radioactivity measured by scintillation counting. The quantification of the amount of Spn pol I derivative-DNA complexes retained on the filters was corrected by subtracting the nonspecific retention of labeled DNA in the absence of pol I derivatives and in the presence of an equal bovine serum albumin concentration. A three-dimensional model of the putative 5′-3′ exonucleolytic domain of Spn pol I was built from its amino acid sequence, the 2.4-Å resolution x-ray structure of the 5′-3′ exonucleolytic domain of Taq pol (9Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and 2.5-Å resolution x-ray structure of the T5 5′ nuclease (10Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) by using knowledge-based protein modeling methods. Their cartesian coordinates were from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, with identification codes 1TAQ and 1EXN, respectively. The structural conserved regions and the definition of the corresponding connecting loops were identified from the multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences of Spn pol I, Taq pol, and T5 5′ nuclease (Fig. 6). This alignment was initially identified from the multiple alignment of the nuclease domains of 38 prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins (Fig. S2, available as supplemental material in the on-line version of this article). The overall conformation of the 5′-3′ exonucleolytic domain of Spn pol I was subjected to energy minimization until convergence, using a combination of steepest descent and conjugate gradients algorithms. The energy calculations were carried out under the AMBER force field (33Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1996; 7: 230-246Crossref Scopus (3603) Google Scholar). Computations were performed on a Power Challenge R10000 by using the BIOSYM software package, release 95.0 (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA). After a 3.5-h IPTG induction of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing pMA10, Spn pol I-(His) was the major protein product in cell extract, corresponding to about 9% of the total protein content (Fig.2 A, lane 4). This yield was very similar to the 10% obtained with cells harboring pSM23 (26Martı́nez S. López P. Espinosa M. Lacks S.A. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which encodes Spn pol I (Fig.2 A, lane 3). The nuclease activity in cell extracts from both BL21(DE3)[pMA10] and BL21(DE3)[pSM23] cultures, was detected in situ using a DNA containing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 B). In both extracts, a degradation band was detected corresponding to a polypeptide of ∼100 kDa, the predicted size for Spn pol I and its fusion derivative (Fig.2 B, lanes 2 and 3). In addition, other bands of activity were observed that presumably corresponded to proteolytic fragments of the pneumococcal enzymes, since they were not detected in extracts carrying the pET5 vector (Fig.2 B, lane 1). Quantification of the amount of Spn pol I and Spn pol I-(His) (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 4) versus their nuclease activity (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2and 3) revealed that the fusion of the His tag did not affect the 5′-3′ exonuclease specific activity. However, this fusion resulted in a 5-fold reduction of the polymerase activity of the pneumococcal enzyme (producing 60 units of polymerase activity/mg of protein after a 3.5-h induction, compared with 318 units for the vector coding for the wild-type Spn pol I, after correction for the endogenous polymerase activity (3 units) of the host organism). Thus, the Spn pol I-(His) construct is appropriate for mutational analysis of the 5′-3′ exonuclease activity of the pneumococcal enzyme. Spn pol I-(His) was purified from IPTG-induced cultures by binding to a chelating Sepharose resin (Fig. 2 C). By testing different concentrations of imidazole-eluting agent, we developed a purification procedure yielding 0.37 mg of Spn pol I-(His)/liter of induced culture. The purity of the protein sample was greater than 60% (Fig.2 C, lane 8), with polymerase and exonuclease specific activities of 614 and 1049 units/mg of protein, respectively. The Asp10 of Spn pol I is highly conserved among the 5′ nucleases (7Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and structural data support the involvement of this residue in the active site (9Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D. Suh S.W."
