https://openalex.org/W2001257668,"Replay of behavioral sequences in the hippocampus during sharp wave ripple complexes (SWRs) provides a potential mechanism for memory consolidation and the learning of knowledge structures. Current hypotheses imply that replay should straightforwardly reflect recent experience. However, we find these hypotheses to be incompatible with the content of replay on a task with two distinct behavioral sequences (A and B). We observed forward and backward replay of B even when rats had been performing A for >10 min. Furthermore, replay of nonlocal sequence B occurred more often when B was infrequently experienced. Neither forward nor backward sequences preferentially represented highly experienced trajectories within a session. Additionally, we observed the construction of never-experienced novel-path sequences. These observations challenge the idea that sequence activation during SWRs is a simple replay of recent experience. Instead, replay reflected all physically available trajectories within the environment, suggesting a potential role in active learning and maintenance of the cognitive map.

Hippocampal replay content is inconsistent with current proposals for replay generation The content of hippocampal replay reflects the behavioral demands of the task “Replay” content includes never and rarely experienced shortcut trajectories Hippocampal replay may help in learning a cognitive map and prevent catastrophic interference Individual place cells in the hippocampus fire in particular locations (place fields) within an environment (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O'Keefe J.

These sequences are repeated or “replayed” during sharp wave ripple complexes (SWRs), a network event observed in the hippocampal local field potential (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978O'Keefe J. Nadel L.

Replay of behavioral sequences in the hippocampus provides a possible mechanism for several critical functions in which the hippocampal formation plays a role: consolidation of experiences into long-term memory (Marr, 1971Marr D.

To understand the role of SWRs and replay in hippocampal function, recent studies have blocked CA3 output (the site of SWR generation; Ylinen et al., 1995Ylinen A. Bragin A. Nadasdy Z. Jando G. Szabo I. Sik A. Buzsáki G. Sharp wave-associated high-frequency oscillation (200 Hz) in the intact hippocampus: network and intracellular mechanisms.J.

Hippocampal CA3 output is crucial for ripple-associated reactivation and consolidation of memory.Neuron. 2009; 62: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and have directly disrupted SWRs after learning, during sleep (Girardeau et al., 2009Girardeau G.

Neurosci., abstract), showing that these manipulations impair performance on hippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks. Although these studies show that SWRs are clearly important for correct task performance, they cannot specify the nature of learning taking place during these events. The information or content expressed by replay determines what is learned (Marr, 1971Marr D. Simple memory: a theory of archicortex.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1971; 262: 23-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar, Buzsáki, 1989Buzsáki G.

Wilson M.A. Reverse replay of behavioural sequences in hippocampal place cells during the awake state.Nature. 2006; 440: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar); thus, by studying the content of replay, we can begin to understand the properties of this learning process. SWRs and associated sequence replay occur both in slow-wave sleep and during awake rest states. During the awake rest state, representations of previous experiences are reactivated (Jensen and Lisman, 2000Jensen O. Lisman J.E.

Models of forward replay suggest that they reflect previous experience and extend forward due to Hebbian learning from those experiences (Wilson and McNaughton, 1994Wilson M.A. McNaughton B.L.

Memory trace reactivation in hippocampal and neocortical neuronal ensembles.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This is supported by evidence that reactivation increased with experience on a track (Jackson et al., 2006Jackson J.C. Johnson A. Redish A.D. Hippocampal sharp waves and reactivation during awake states depend on repeated sequential experience.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12415-12426Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, O'Neill et al., 2006O'Neill J. Senior T. Csicsvari J.

Johnson A. Redish A.D. Hippocampal sharp waves and reactivation during awake states depend on repeated sequential experience.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12415-12426Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Karlsson and Frank, 2009Karlsson M.P. Frank L.M. Awake replay of remote experiences in the hippocampus.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, others have found preferential reactivation (Cheng and Frank, 2008Cheng S. Frank L.M. New experiences enhance coordinated neural activity in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2008; 57: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and replay (Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J. Wilson M.A. Reverse replay of behavioural sequences in hippocampal place cells during the awake state.Nature. 2006; 440: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) in novel environments, suggesting that the frequency of replay may be inversely related to experience and therefore the relationship between replay content and experience may not be straightforward. As we will show, detailed identification of the trajectories represented during replay reveals trajectories never actually experienced and depend on the task contingency more than the specific experiences within a day. Likewise, backward replay was thought to begin at the animal's location in the environment and step backward to replay the immediate past (Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J. Wilson M.A. Reverse replay of behavioural sequences in hippocampal place cells during the awake state.Nature. 2006; 440: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, Csicsvari et al., 2007Csicsvari J.

Neurosci. 2007; 26: 704-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that backward replay arises from a decaying remnant signal in recently active neurons (Buzsáki, 1989Buzsáki G. Two-stage model of memory trace formation: a role for “noisy” brain states.Neuroscience. 1989; 31: 551-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar, Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J.

Reactivation of experience-dependent cell assembly patterns in the hippocampus.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, it was recently shown that backward replay is not restricted to beginning at the animal's location in the environment (Davidson et al., 2009Davidson T.J. Kloosterman F. Wilson M.A. Hippocampal replay of extended experience.Neuron. 2009; 63: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), which precludes backward replay reflecting only the immediate past. Nevertheless, the environment in Davidson et al., 2009Davidson T.J. Kloosterman F. Wilson M.A. Hippocampal replay of extended experience.Neuron. 2009; 63: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar was a linear track, which means that these replays still occurred over recent trajectories. In fact, all previous reports of backward sequence replay (Foster and Wilson, 2006Foster D.J. Wilson M.A. Reverse replay of behavioural sequences in hippocampal place cells during the awake state.Nature. 2006; 440: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, Davidson et al., 2009Davidson T.J. Kloosterman F. Wilson M.A. Hippocampal replay of extended experience.Neuron. 2009; 63: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) have been taken from linear tracks in which animals run back and forth, which means that the positions being replayed still reflected recent trajectories taken by the animal. As we will show, backward replay could also reflect remote paths (trajectories not experienced for greater than 10 min), and occurred in large proportions (49% backward to 51% forward) on tracks in which the vast majority of experience occurred in only one direction of travel. In addition, we will show examples of backward replay in which the animal only traveled that complete path in the forward direction, implying that the backward sequential activation of place cells can reflect trajectories never actually experienced by the animal. One of the key ideas underlying the concept of a cognitive map is that it should enable the planning of novel trajectories never experienced by the animal (Tolman et al., 1946Tolman E.C. Ritchie B.F. Kalish D. Studies in spatial learning. I. Orientation and the short-cut.J. Exp. Psychol. 1946; 36: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978O'Keefe J. Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon Press, Oxford1978Google Scholar). Rats can take correctly directed paths involving trajectories that have never been experienced (Tolman et al., 1946Tolman E.C. Ritchie B.F. Kalish D. Studies in spatial learning. I. Orientation and the short-cut.J. Exp. Psychol. 1946; 36: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, Alvernhe et al., 2008Alvernhe A. Van Cauter T. Save E. Poucet B.

Neurosci., abstract). The cognitive map has been hypothesized to entail a representation of the structure of the environment which enables rats to mentally traverse alternate paths, potentially including trajectories never actually experienced (Tolman, 1948Tolman E.C. Cognitive maps in rats and men.Psychol. Rev. 1948; 55: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar, O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978O'Keefe J. Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map.

Previous studies have identified sequential representations that may reflect such planning (Wood et al., 2000Wood E.R. Dudchenko P.A. Robitsek R.J. Eichenbaum H.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), but all of these previous studies have only identified sequences reflecting trajectories that had been previously experienced. Identification of sequences never experienced by the animal would provide very strong support for the concept of the cognitive map. Finally, an open question is: how might a map be constructed and maintained to be a balanced representation of the entire environment, even when only parts of the environment are recently visited? Oversampling can produce catastrophic interference and degradation of nonrecently experienced representations. The hippocampus has been suggested to be involved in the prevention of this sort of catastrophic interference (O'Reilly and McClelland, 1994O'Reilly R.C. McClelland J.L. Hippocampal conjunctive encoding, storage, and recall: avoiding a trade-off.Hippocampus. 1994; 4: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, McClelland et al., 1995McClelland J.L. McNaughton B.L. O'Reilly R.C. Why there are complementary learning systems in the hippocampus and neocortex: insights from the successes and failures of connectionist models of learning and memory.Psychol. Rev. 1995; 102: 419-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar). A mechanism by which trajectories that have not been recently visited are preferentially activated in the network would provide a potential solution to this problem. Previous studies investigating the content of replay have primarily utilized simple tasks in which all trajectories in the environment are equally well experienced and recent. Here we use a new task with multiple possible paths and different behavioral contingencies which manipulates the frequency and recency of experiences to address the relationship between the animal's actual behavior during a given session and the content of what is replayed during the awake state. To investigate the relationship between experience and the content of hippocampal replay, we recorded neural ensembles from the CA1 region of hippocampus in six rats trained on a spatial decision task with two possible paths (Figure 1A ), allowing for the separation of recent and nonrecent experiences. The maze consisted of two choices with a daily changing contingency: the rat was rewarded for turning left (L), turning right (R), or alternating left and right turns (A) at the final choice point. During training sessions, the reward contingency was stable; during recording sessions, it switched approximately midway through the session. Thus, results were analyzed in half-sessions which could be L, R, or A. This means that within a session, rats sampled both loops of the maze, but how long ago each loop was experienced and the total amount of experience on each loop of the maze could differ depending on the contingency. The animals learned the contingency quickly at the onset of the recording session and again after the contingency switch (Figures 1B and 1C). Place cells did not “remap” after the switch (i.e., place cells maintained the same place fields after the switch; see Figure S1 available online). The vast majority of experience on this track occurred in one direction (Figures S2 and S3). We analyzed sequences (replays) of place cell activity during SWR events as rats paused at the reward locations. A sequence detection algorithm was applied to quantify the degree to which spiking activity during SWRs represented a coherent sequence, identifying 1719 replays across 31 sessions from 6 rats (see Experimental Procedures). The median number of active cells during these events was 10, with a median “sequence score” of 90 (see Experimental Procedures). In general, replays varied in their starting location and direction and were identified as occurring on either the left, right, or central stem of the maze.

However, we also observed frequent replays of spatially distal portions of the environment (rat on the opposite side of the maze as the replay, “opposite-side replay,” n = 534, 307 fwd, 227 bwd; Figure 2B). The median number of active cells (MAC) and the median sequence score (MSS) were similar across all categories (same-side, fwd: MAC = 8 and MSS = 65; same-side, bwd: MAC = 10 and MSS = 85; opposite-side, fwd: MAC = 10 and MSS = 86; opposite-side, bwd: MAC = 11 and MSS = 96). These data show that forward and backward replay robustly occurred over both loops in the maze when the animal paused at a reward site on one side of the maze. This is consistent with recent studies showing reactivation of experiences from previous"
https://openalex.org/W2123661628,"To investigate the role of microRNAs in regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination, we utilized transgenic mice in which microRNA processing was disrupted in OL precursor cells (OPCs) and OLs by targeted deletion of Dicer1. We found that inhibition of OPC-OL miRNA processing disrupts normal CNS myelination and that OPCs lacking mature miRNAs fail to differentiate normally in vitro. We identified three miRNAs (miR-219, miR-138, and miR-338) that are induced 10–100× during OL differentiation; the most strongly induced of these, miR-219, is necessary and sufficient to promote OL differentiation, and partially rescues OL differentiation defects caused by total miRNA loss. miR-219 directly represses the expression of PDGFRα, Sox6, FoxJ3, and ZFP238 proteins, all of which normally help to promote OPC proliferation. Together, these findings show that miR-219 plays a critical role in coupling differentiation to proliferation arrest in the OL lineage, enabling the rapid transition from proliferating OPCs to myelinating OLs."
https://openalex.org/W2063653640,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate various biological processes, but evidence for miRNAs that control the differentiation program of specific neural cell types has been elusive. To determine the role of miRNAs in the formation of myelinating oligodendrocytes, we selectively deleted a miRNA-processing enzyme, Dicer1, in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Mice lacking Dicer1 display severe myelinating deficits despite an expansion of the oligodendrocyte progenitor pool. To search for miRNAs responsible for the induction of oligodendrocyte maturation, we identified miR-219 and miR-338 as oligodendrocyte-specific miRNAs in spinal cord. Overexpression of these miRNAs is sufficient to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. Additionally, blockage of these miRNA activities in oligodendrocyte precursor culture and knockdown of miR-219 in zebrafish inhibit oligodendrocyte maturation. miR-219 and miR-338 function in part by directly repressing negative regulators of oligodendrocyte differentiation, including transcription factors Sox6 and Hes5. These findings illustrate that miRNAs are important regulators of oligodendrocyte differentiation, providing new targets for myelin repair."
https://openalex.org/W2037500812,"Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play an important role in the motivational systems underlying drug addiction, and recent work has suggested that they also release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. To assess a physiological role for glutamate corelease, we disrupted the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 selectively in dopamine neurons. The conditional knockout abolishes glutamate release from midbrain dopamine neurons in culture and severely reduces their excitatory synaptic output in mesoaccumbens slices. Baseline motor behavior is not affected, but stimulation of locomotor activity by cocaine is impaired, apparently through a selective reduction of dopamine stores in the projection of VTA neurons to ventral striatum. Glutamate co-entry promotes monoamine storage by increasing the pH gradient that drives vesicular monoamine transport. Remarkably, low concentrations of glutamate acidify synaptic vesicles more slowly but to a greater extent than equimolar Cl(-), indicating a distinct, presynaptic mechanism to regulate quantal size."

Knowing that these reactions are involved in fine-tuning insect immune responses, Kumar et al. (p. 1644 , published online 11 March) investigated how the peroxidase/duox system in malaria-vector mosquitoes protects the gut flora by modulating midgut antibacterial responses. Generating immune reactions resulted in a loss of mosquito egg viability, but modulating host responses allowed malaria parasites to persist among the surviving commensal flora. The peroxidase/duox system appears to promote dityrosine bond formation between proteins across the surface of midgut epithelial cells to form a layer that inhibits immune recognition and mediator release. Interference with the formation of this layer might provide a target for mosquito and malaria control."
https://openalex.org/W2006641069,"An understanding of sleep requires the identification of distinct cellular circuits that mediate the action of specific sleep:wake-regulating molecules, but such analysis has been very limited. We identify here a circuit that underlies the wake-promoting effects of octopamine in Drosophila. Using MARCM, we identified the ASM cells in the medial protocerebrum as the wake-promoting octopaminergic cells. We then blocked octopamine signaling in random areas of the fly brain and mapped the postsynaptic effect to insulin-secreting neurons of the pars intercerebralis (PI). These PI neurons show altered potassium channel function as well as an increase in cAMP in response to octopamine, and genetic manipulation of their electrical excitability alters sleep:wake behavior. Effects of octopamine on sleep:wake are mediated by the cAMP-dependent isoform of the OAMB receptor. These studies define the cellular and molecular basis of octopamine action and suggest that the PI is a sleep:wake-regulating neuroendocrine structure like the mammalian hypothalamus.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmYjllNTQ0ZDUyNTU5YTAyZDEyNjVkOTNmMzU2NWRjMSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM0NjgwMTIwfQ.C5tKeExNbqC1lMTbtqGwVLhhGTOrIMSAfUSAUajhYQXaQ24Gwfw2I7ia9jrjZ_UKvkAFt1NWF8FyZkGo44rCwJo0N6Q8oAo8oKPsAh0L5P9I6A4wxmsVMeNgtcYs6L-Xs8MXW6quqtxUhH24b-LpdyIFnYFC3X1Z0wmO3WMxNfHTT9vUTsbPxJ9C9iT5utXViPCtvPtVAPlunj5hzmlv9YmWHpzTImRC6pHFEnre223y965ixE1vqvIjZ84Mri43plbR4RGGcZfN9LKp5FF-lvRYBSzkO3uOpAiSrsTCLdbkwOnHK7OcaGQg6Td0-zbtt9jWCbV1ghPj73yrK7MriQ(mov, (20.31 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2165286432,"Background The genus Cronobacter (formerly called Enterobacter sakazakii) is composed of five species; C. sakazakii, C. malonaticus, C. turicensis, C. muytjensii, and C. dublinensis. The genus includes opportunistic human pathogens, and the first three species have been associated with neonatal infections. The most severe diseases are caused in neonates and include fatal necrotizing enterocolitis and meningitis. The genetic basis of the diversity within the genus is unknown, and few virulence traits have been identified. Methodology/Principal Findings We report here the first sequence of a member of this genus, C. sakazakii strain BAA-894. The genome of Cronobacter sakazakii strain BAA-894 comprises a 4.4 Mb chromosome (57% GC content) and two plasmids; 31 kb (51% GC) and 131 kb (56% GC). The genome was used to construct a 387,000 probe oligonucleotide tiling DNA microarray covering the whole genome. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was undertaken on five other C. sakazakii strains, and representatives of the four other Cronobacter species. Among 4,382 annotated genes inspected in this study, about 55% of genes were common to all C. sakazakii strains and 43% were common to all Cronobacter strains, with 10–17% absence of genes. Conclusions/Significance CGH highlighted 15 clusters of genes in C. sakazakii BAA-894 that were divergent or absent in more than half of the tested strains; six of these are of probable prophage origin. Putative virulence factors were identified in these prophage and in other variable regions. A number of genes unique to Cronobacter species associated with neonatal infections (C. sakazakii, C. malonaticus and C. turicensis) were identified. These included a copper and silver resistance system known to be linked to invasion of the blood-brain barrier by neonatal meningitic strains of Escherichia coli. In addition, genes encoding for multidrug efflux pumps and adhesins were identified that were unique to C. sakazakii strains from outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units."
https://openalex.org/W2042765141,"Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has become a gold standard for the quantification of nucleic acids and microorganism abundances, in which plasmid DNA carrying the target genes are most commonly used as the standard. A recent study showed that supercoiled circular confirmation of DNA appeared to suppress PCR amplification. However, to what extent to which different structural types of DNA (circular versus linear) used as the standard may affect the quantification accuracy has not been evaluated. In this study, we quantitatively compared qPCR accuracies based on circular plasmid (mostly in supercoiled form) and linear DNA standards (linearized plasmid DNA or PCR amplicons), using proliferating cell nuclear gene (pcna), the ubiquitous eukaryotic gene, in five marine microalgae as a model gene. We observed that PCR using circular plasmids as template gave 2.65-4.38 more of the threshold cycle number than did equimolar linear standards. While the documented genome sequence of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana shows a single copy of pcna, qPCR using the circular plasmid as standard yielded an estimate of 7.77 copies of pcna per genome whereas that using the linear standard gave 1.02 copies per genome. We conclude that circular plasmid DNA is unsuitable as a standard, and linear DNA should be used instead, in absolute qPCR. The serious overestimation by the circular plasmid standard is likely due to the undetected lower efficiency of its amplification in the early stage of PCR when the supercoiled plasmid is the dominant template."
https://openalex.org/W2005122845,"Degraded sensory experience during critical periods of development can have adverse effects on brain function. In the auditory system, conductive hearing loss associated with childhood ear infections can produce long-lasting deficits in auditory perceptual acuity, much like amblyopia in the visual system. Here we explore the neural mechanisms that may underlie ""amblyaudio"" by inducing reversible monaural deprivation (MD) in infant, juvenile, and adult rats. MD distorted tonotopic maps, weakened the deprived ear's representation, strengthened the open ear's representation, and disrupted binaural integration of interaural level differences (ILD). Bidirectional plasticity effects were strictly governed by critical periods, were more strongly expressed in primary auditory cortex than inferior colliculus, and directly impacted neural coding accuracy. These findings highlight a remarkable degree of competitive plasticity between aural representations and suggest that the enduring perceptual sequelae of childhood hearing loss might be traced to maladaptive plasticity during critical periods of auditory cortex development."
https://openalex.org/W2124418433,"TRPV1 receptors feature prominently in nociception of spinal primary afferents but are also expressed in unmyelinated cranial visceral primary afferents linked to homeostatic regulation. Cranial visceral afferents enter the brain at the solitary tract nucleus (NTS) to control the heart, lungs, and other vital organs. Here we identify a role for central TRPV1 in the activity-dependent facilitation of glutamatergic transmission from solitary tract (ST) afferents. Fast, synchronous ST-NTS transmission from capsaicin-sensitive (TRPV1+) and -insensitive (TRPV1-) afferents was similar. However, afferent activation triggered long-lasting asynchronous glutamate release only from TRPV1+ synapses. Asynchronous release was proportional to synchronous EPSC amplitude, activity, and calcium entry. TRPV1 antagonists and low temperature blocked asynchronous release, but not evoked EPSCs. At physiological afferent frequencies, asynchronous release strongly potentiated the duration of postsynaptic spiking. This activity-dependent TPRV1-mediated facilitation is a form of synaptic plasticity that brings a unique central integrative feature to the CNS and autonomic regulation."

The serine/threonine phosphoacceptor sites are distributed throughout the protein and, with a few exceptions, are in regions of the protein that lack intrinsic structure (Fig. 1A). Cell-based assays to uncover the particular phosphorylation events that result in Rb-E2F dissociation and reversal of Rb growth suppression have shown that phosphorylation at many different sites is capable of inactivating Rb (11Brown V.D.

Insights into the distinct molecular effects of these phosphorylations is therefore critical to understanding the significance of multiple, seemingly redundant pathways toward Rb-E2F dissociation. One possibility is that different phosphorylation events control the two separate Rb-E2F interactions. Indeed, we previously found that phosphorylation of sites in RbC induces an intramolecular interaction between RbC and the pocket domain that specifically blocks the RbC-marked box association (17Rubin S.M. Gall A.L. Zheng N. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2005; 123: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that phosphorylation of sites in the pocket domain is capable of reducing E2FTD binding (22Xiao B. Spencer J. Clements A. Ali-Khan N. Mittnacht S. Broceño C. Burghammer M.

Here, we identify unambiguously the key phosphorylation events and characterize the domain rearrangements in Rb that result in inhibition of the E2FTD-pocket domain association. Phosphorylation of Thr356/Thr373 in RbIDL and Ser608/Ser612 in RbPL are each sufficient for partial inhibition of E2FTD binding, but both are necessary for complete inhibition. We show that phosphorylation stimulates an intramolecular interaction between RbPL and the pocket domain that overlaps with the E2FTD binding site. Our data confirm a role for RbPL, RbIDL, and the structured RbN in Rb inactivation and provide the first molecular insights into how phosphorylation disrupts a key cell cycle and growth regulatory complex. Human Rb constructs containing a single domain (e.g. RbN or pocket domain) could be expressed with high yields in Escherichia coli. Constructs containing multiple domains required expression in Sf9 cells to obtain quantities suitable for biophysical assays. Thus, Rb55–928, Rb55–787 (wild type and mutants), and Rb380–928 were all expressed in Sf9 cells as His6 fusion proteins. Cells were infected at a density of ∼2 × 106/ml with baculovirus containing the desired gene and incubated for 2–3 days. Proteins were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification and heparin sulfate chromatography. Rb352–787, Rb380–787 (wild type and mutants), and RbPΔPL (Rb380–787, with 578–642 deleted) were expressed in E. coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Cells were induced overnight at room temperature. The proteins were purified with glutathione affinity chromatography, the glutathione S-transferase tag was cut off, and the Rb domain was isolated by heparin sulfate chromatography. RbPL592–624, Rb338–379, Rb55–379, and E2FTD (E2F1, residues 372–437) were expressed as His6 fusion proteins in E. coli. Cells were induced for 2–4 h at 37 °C, and proteins were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and anion exchange chromatography. Isotopically labeled RbPΔPL and RbPL592–624 were prepared for NMR as described, except that upon induction, E. coli were switched to M9 minimal medium including [15N]ammonium chloride, [13C]glucose, and D2O as necessary. PP1 catalytic domain (α isoform) was expressed in E. coli and purified with anion exchange and heparin sulfate chromatography. Recombinant Cdk6-CycK (herpesvirus cyclin) and Cdk2-CycA were expressed and purified as described previously (25Jeffrey P.D. Tong L. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26Russo A.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Rb protein constructs were concentrated to ∼1–5 mg/ml following purification and then phosphorylated in a reaction containing 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 250 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 2% Cdk6-CycK or 10% Cdk2-CycA (percentage of mass of the total substrate in the reaction). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Use of either kinase resulted in similar phosphate incorporation in the reaction described in supplemental Fig. 1. Kinase-treated Rb55–928 was digested with either trypsin or chymotrypsin and analyzed for phosphate incorporation using a Thermo Finnigan liquid chromatography/MS/MS (LTQ) linear ion trap. All MS/MS spectra were processed using Bioworks 3.3. Peptide identifications with better than 0.01 peptide probability were accepted and manually inspected. Phosphatase reactions were carried out with 10% PP1 (percentage of mass of substrate) in the presence of 1 mm MnCl2, 250 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 1 h. We have found by mass spectrometry and radioisotope labeling assays that these conditions lead to nearly quantitative dephosphorylation (data not shown). Initially, proteins were purified following the enzymatic treatment and prior to isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) or NMR with size exclusion chromatography; subsequently it was found this step was not necessary because results were unaffected by the purification step. ITC experiments were conducted with a MicroCal VP-ITC calorimeter. Typically, ∼0.5–1 mm E2FTD and 25–50 μm Rb were used in each experiment. Proteins were dialyzed overnight prior to the assay in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Data were analyzed with the Origin calorimetry software package assuming a one-site binding model. n values, reflecting the stoichiometry of the Rb-E2FTD complex, were between 0.8 and 1.2. Experiments were repeated for each Rb construct 2–4 times, and the reported error is the S.D. of each set of measurements. Purified Rb protein constructs were dialyzed into an NMR buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% D2O (pH 6.1). For binding experiments involving labeled RbPL592–624, HSQC spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with an HCN 5-mm cryoprobe (27Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Experiments observing labeled RbPΔPL and experiments to assign RbPL592–624 were conducted with an Avance II 900-MHz spectrometer (Bruker-Biospin, Boston, MA) at the Central California 900-MHz NMR facility (Berkeley, CA). The amide resonances were assigned via 1H-15N to side chain correlations observed in two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC-TOCSY (100-ms mixing time) and two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC-NOESY (350-ms mixing time) experiments and via 13Ca (i, i − 1) and 13Cb (i, i − 1) linkages observed in a three-dimensional HNCACB experiment (28Norwood T.J.

To determine the precise sequences and phosphorylation sites within Rb required for inhibition of E2FTD binding, we applied an ITC assay to quantitatively measure affinities with purified proteins. We first expressed in Sf9 insect cells an Rb construct containing amino acids 55–928 (Rb55–928). Rb55–928 contains all three domains of Rb and all 15 conserved Cdk consensus sites. Rb55–928 is phosphorylated by endogenous Sf9 kinases (33Lin B.T. Gruenwald S. Morla A.O. Lee W.H. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), so Rb55–928 was dephosphorylated with the Rb phosphatase PP1. As seen in Fig. 2A, the affinity of E2FTD for the PP1-treated protein (dephosRb55–928) is Kd = 0.04 ± 0.02 μm. This value is comparable with the affinity of E2FTD for unphosphorylated pocket domain purified from bacteria (Rb380–787; Kd = 0.045 ± 0.007 μm), which is the Rb domain necessary and sufficient for E2FTD binding (21Lee C.

We next phosphorylated Rb55–928 with recombinant Cdk-cyclin using reaction conditions that result in quantitative phosphorylation of accessible Cdk consensus sites (supplemental Fig. 1). Phosphorylation was detected at 13 of 15 Cdk consensus sites using phosphopeptide mapping with liquid chromatography/MS/MS (Table 1). Notably, we did not detect phosphorylation at Ser230 or Ser567 despite the large quantity of purified kinase used in the reaction. Both sites are buried in structured domains and have not been observed to be phosphorylated in vivo (14Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E.

Calorimetric assays show that E2FTD binds to phosRb55–928 with Kd = 11 ± 3 μm (Fig. 2A), which is ∼250-fold weaker than its association with dephosRb55–928 or unphosphorylated Rb380–787.

Open table in a new tab To identify which Rb domains are required for inhibiting E2FTD association, we carried out a series of ITC experiments using Rb truncation mutants that were phosphorylated in our recombinant Cdk reaction. The results of these assays are summarized in Fig. 2B, and sample ITC data are shown in supplemental Fig. 2. E2FTD binds an RbC truncation mutant (phosRb55–787) with Kd = 13 ± 3 μm, indicating that deletion of RbC has no effect on the phosphorylation-induced change in E2FTD affinity. Therefore, association of phosRbC with the pocket domain is not necessary for inhibition of E2FTD binding, although it remains possible that it has a redundant effect. Part of RbC binds the E2F-DP marked box domains, and previous data demonstrate that RbC phosphorylation specifically inhibits that association (17Rubin S.M. Gall A.L. Zheng N. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2005; 123: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Next, three different N-terminal domain truncation mutants (phosRb380–928, phosRb352–787, and phosRb380–787) were used in binding assays. E2FTD binds significantly tighter to each of these phosphorylated constructs than to phosRb constructs containing the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2B). These differences in affinity demonstrate that RbN is required for the full inhibition of E2FTD binding that occurs upon Rb phosphorylation. To define further which phosphorylation events are necessary for inhibition of E2FTD-pocket binding, we purified Rb55–787 constructs containing alanine mutations such that only specific sites were phosphorylated by kinase. E2FTD binds to wild-type dephosRb55–787 with Kd = 0.3 ± 0.2 μm and phosRb55–787 with Kd = 13 ± 3 μm (Table 2). Our mass spectrometry data indicate that within residues 55–787, Rb is phosphorylated at Ser780 and three pairs of other Cdk consensus sites: Ser249/Thr252 in RbN, Thr356/Thr373 in RbIDL, and Ser608/Ser612 in RbPL (Table 1). We purified and phosphorylated three mutant Rb55–787 constructs, each with Ser780 and one of the three pairs of phosphoacceptor sites left intact (Table 2). The affinity of E2FTD for the phosRb55–787 protein with the Thr356/Thr373 and Ser608/Ser612 sites mutated (Kd = 0.33 ± 0.02 μm) is equivalent to its affinity for wild-type dephosRb55–787. This measurement indicates that Cdk phosphorylation of Ser249, Thr252, and Ser780 has no effect on E2FTD binding. The affinities of E2FTD for phosRb55–787 with only either Ser608/Ser612/Ser780 or Thr356/Thr373/Ser780 intact were similar (Kd = 2.7 ± 0.6 μm and Kd = 2.9 ± 0.1 μm, respectively), and both are weaker than wild-type dephosRb55–787 but stronger than wild-type phosRb55–787. Together these data demonstrate that phosphorylation of Thr356/Thr373 and Ser608/Ser612 can both partially inhibit E2FTD binding, but neither pair of phosphoacceptor sites is sufficient alone to reproduce the full inhibition observed upon phosphorylation of wild-type protein. To confirm that phosphorylation of both pairs of sites is together sufficient for inhibition, we generated phosRb55–787Δ249/252 (only Ser249/Thr252 mutated) and found that the affinity of E2FTD for this construct (Kd = 25 ± 1 μm) is similar to wild-type phosRb55–787 (Kd = 13 ± 3 μm).TABLE 2ITC measurements of E2FTD binding to mutants of phosRb55–787ConstructMutationsAccessible phosphorylation sitesE2FTD KdμmdephosRb55–787NoneNAaNot applicable.0.3 ± 0.2phosRb55–787NoneSer249, Thr252, Thr356, Thr373, Ser608, Ser612, Ser78013 ± 3phosRb55–787Δ356/373/608/612T356A, T373A, S608A, S612ASer249, Thr252, Ser7800.33 ± 0.02phosRb55–787Δ249/252/356/373S249A, T252A, T356A, T373ASer608, Ser612, Ser7802.7 ± 0.6phosRb55–787Δ249/252/608/612S249A, T252A, S608A, S612AThr356, Thr373, Ser7802.9 ± 0.1phosRb55–787Δ249/252S249A, T252AThr356, Thr373, Ser608, Ser612, Ser78025 ± 1a Not applicable. Open table in a new tab It is noteworthy that the E2FTD affinity for phosRb55–787Δ249/252 is ∼25-fold weaker than its affinity for phosRb352–787. Both constructs contain the necessary four phosphorylation sites (Thr356, Thr373, Ser608, and Ser612); however, full inhibition of E2FTD binding was only observed for phosRb55–787Δ249/252, which contains RbN in addition to the required phosphorylation sites. This result suggests further the requirement of RbN for phosphorylation-induced inhibition of E2F, despite the fact that there is no requirement for phosphorylation of the RbN sites. We conclude that the structured RbN must be critical for the mechanism of inhibition. It is also significant that phosphorylation of Ser608/Ser612 causes similar inhibition in the absence of RbN (∼15-fold; compare in Fig. 2 Kd values for Rb380–787 and phosRb380–787) and in the presence of RbN (∼9 fold; compare in Table 2 Kd values for dephosRb55–787 and phosRb55–787Δ249/252/356/373). Therefore, the effect of Ser608/Ser612 phosphorylation does not require RbN. In sum, our data demonstrate two distinct and independent mechanisms for E2FTD inhibition, each relying on phosphorylation of a specific pair of sites (Thr356/Thr373 or Ser608/Ser612). Having identified the required phosphorylation events for E2FTD inhibition, we next explored the conformational changes in Rb that cause inhibition. The calorimetry data indicate that the partial inhibition induced by phosphorylation of Ser608/Ser612 does not require RbN. Ser608 and Ser612 are located in RbPL, which comprises a disordered stretch of amino acids linking the two pocket subdomains (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that phosphorylation induces an intramolecular association between the phosphorylated sequence in the linker and the pocket in a manner analogous to that previously observed for phosRbC (17Rubin S.M. Gall A.L. Zheng N. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2005; 123: 1093-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To test this model, we attempted to detect a weak interaction between isolated, phosphorylated RbPL and the pocket domain in trans. ITC experiments titrating phosRbPL into the Rb pocket domain did not yield any significant heat signal (data not shown). Alternatively, we applied an NMR assay that is more sensitive in detecting the anticipated weak intermolecular association. We first generated a uniformly 15N-labeled phosRbPL592–624 construct that contains the phosphorylation sites Ser608 and Ser612 as well as the only sequence of conserved amino acids within RbPL (Fig. 3A). The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of phosRbPL592–624 shows little chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension; this observation is consistent with a lack of structure in the pocket linker (Fig. 3B). We next purified a pocket domain construct (RbPΔPL), previously used in crystallization experiments (21Lee C. Chang J.H. Lee H.S. Cho Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3199-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Xiao B. Spencer J. Clements A. Ali-Khan N. Mittnacht S. Broceño C. Burghammer M. Perrakis A. Marmorstein R. Gamblin S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2363-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), in which the entire RbPL is deleted. Superposition of the HSQC spectrum of phosRbPL592–624 alone (Fig. 3B, black) and a spectrum of phosRbPL592–624 in the presence of unlabeled RbPΔPL (Fig. 3B, red) shows that chemical shift changes and peak broadening occur in the presence of Rb pocket. This observation is consistent with binding on the fast to intermediate exchange time scale and the increased correlation time of forming a complex. When the HSQC experiment is repeated using unphosphorylated RbPL592–624, no spectral changes are observed in the presence of RbPΔPL, indicating that the association is phosphorylation-dependent (Fig. 3C). We next tested whether phosRbPL592–624 and E2FTD directly compete for binding to the Rb pocket. Excess E2FTD was added to the sample containing both 15N-labeled phosRbPL592–624 and unlabeled RbPΔPL pocket. The resulting spectrum (Fig. 3D, red) shows reduced peak broadening compared with the spectrum taken without E2FTD (Fig. 3B, red). This observation is consistent with excess E2FTD displacing phosRbPL592–624 from the pocket domain such that the spectrum in the presence of E2FTD resembles that of free phosRbPL592–624 (Fig. 3D, black). phosRbPL592–624 and E2FTD thus do not bind simultaneously to the pocket domain. The NMR and calorimetry data together demonstrate that RbPL phosphorylation induces a phosRbPL-pocket association that inhibits E2FTD binding. Upon assigning the HSQC peaks to specific amino acids in RbPL592–624, comparison of peak broadening reveals that the effect is most dramatic for Thr601–Val610 (Fig. 3B). Residues Asp604–Tyr606 are well conserved in orthologs (Fig. 3A) and have some sequence similarity to residues Asp425–Phe427 of the C terminus of E2F1TD. The DLF sequence in E2F1TD makes critical binding contacts to Phe482 and Arg467 in the pocket domain of Rb (Fig. 4A) (21Lee C. Chang J.H. Lee H.S. Cho Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3199-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We supposed that phosRbPL also binds at this site in the pocket. To test this idea, we compared peak broadening in HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled phosRbPL in the presence of unlabeled RbPΔPL, RbPΔPL/F482A, and RbPΔPL/R467A (Fig. 4). The RbPΔPL mutants do not induce the significant peak broadening that is observed with the wild type Rb pocket, suggesting that the affinity of the mutant constructs for phosRbPL is weaker. These data demonstrate that Phe482 and Arg467 are important for mediating binding between phosRbPL and the pocket and accordingly that the phosRbPL and E2FTD binding sites in the pocket domain overlap. To confirm an important role for residues Asp604–Leu607 in the inhibition of E2FTD binding, we tested the affinity of E2FTD for Rb380–787 mutants in which these residues were mutated to alanine individually or in combination (Table 3). E2FTD binds phosphorylated wild-type Rb380–787 (Kd = 0.7 ± 0.4 μm) with approximately 15-fold less affinity than unphosphorylated protein (Kd = 0.045 ± 0.007 μm). E2FTD binds all of the unphosphorylated mutant proteins in Table 3 with similar affinity as wild type (data not shown). We found that mutation of Met605 had little effect on the affinity of E2FTD for phosphorylated Rb pocket, whereas mutation of Asp604, Tyr606, and Leu607 each had a modest effect. Mutation of Asp604–Tyr606 in combination produced an Rb pocket construct in which phosphorylation does not inhibit E2FTD binding significantly. We conclude that Asp604, Tyr606, and Leu607 all probably contribute to the mechanism of E2FTD inhibition due to Rb phosphorylation at Ser608/Ser612.TABLE 3ITC measurements of E2FTD binding to mutants of phosRb380–787ConstructMutationsAccessible phosphorylation sitesE2FTD KdunphosRb380–787NoneNAaNot applicable.0.045 ± 0.007 μmphosRb380–787NoneSer608, Ser612, Ser7800.7 ± 0.4 μmphosRb380–787Δ604D604ASer608, Ser612, Ser7800.4 ± 0.2 μmphosRb380–787Δ605M605ASer608, Ser612, Ser7800.9 ± 0.2 μmphosRb380–787Δ606Y606ASer608, Ser612, Ser7800.22 ± 0.09 μmphosRb380–787Δ604/605/606D604A, M605A, Y606ASer608, Ser612, Ser7800.11 ± 0.05 μmphosRb380–787Δ607L607ASer608, Ser612, Ser7800.3 ± 0.2 μmphosRb380–787Δ608S608ASer612, Ser7800.15 ± 0.01 μmphosRb380–787Δ612S612ASer608, Ser7800.7 ± 0.1 μmphosRb380–787Δ608/612S608A, S612ASer7800.06 ± 0.04 μma Not applicable. Open table in a new tab Finally, we asked whether phosphorylation at Ser608 and Ser612 are both required for inhibiting binding between E2FTD and the Rb pocket. We constructed serine to alanine mutants for Ser608 and Ser612 separately and used ITC to quantify changes in E2FTD-phosRb380–787 binding (Table 3). The phosphorylated S612A mutant has a similar affinity for E2FTD (Kd = 0.7 ± 0.1 μm) as wild type phosRb380–787 (Kd = 0.7 ± 0.4 μm), whereas the phosphorylated S608A mutant does not bind E2FTD as weakly (Kd = 0.15 ± 0.01 μm). These data indicate that Ser608 phosphorylation is sufficient for E2FTD inhibition, whereas Ser612 phosphorylation has only a modest effect. Our ITC data demonstrate that RbN and phosphorylation at the RbIDL sites are together capable of inhibiting E2FTD binding. We examined whether phosRbN-RbIDL (phosRb55–379) associates with the pocket by conducting NMR experiments that monitor signals from the pocket domain. A uniformly labeled 2D-15N sample of RbPΔPL results in a well resolved 1H-15N TROSY spectrum (supplemental Fig. 3) (35Singh M. Krajewski M. Mikolajka A. Holak T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37868-37876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We compared the effects of the addition of unlabeled phosRbN-RbIDL (Fig. 5A), phosRbPL (Fig. 5B), or E2FTD (Fig. 5C) on the spectrum (full spectra in supplemental Fig. 3). Titration of unlabeled phosRb55–379 or phosRbPL results in peak broadening indicative of binding with an intermediate exchange time scale. The subset of peaks that broaden in each experiment is different, suggesting that the manner in which phosRbPL and the pocket domain associate is distinct from how phosRb55–379 associates with the pocket. Interestingly, the peaks that broaden upon the addition of both phosRbN-RbIDL and phosRbPL also undergo chemical shift changes upon the addition of E2FTD (Fig. 5C). This observation suggests that the phosRbN-RbIDL and phosRbPL binding sites in the pocket domain partially overlap with the E2FTD binding site. Binding of both has an independent and additive effect toward E2FTD inhibition, as observed in the calorimetry experiments. We have applied a calorimetry assay with purified proteins to identify unequivocally which phosphorylation events in Rb are capable of inhibiting E2FTD binding, and our data reveal two distinct mechanisms for this inhibition. In the first mechanism, Ser608/Ser612 phosphorylation induces an intramolecular association between RbPL and the pocket domain. This association occludes the E2FTD binding site in the pocket such that both phosRbPL and E2FTD cannot bind simultaneously. These results mark a novel role for RbPL, which has previously been poorly characterized. Interestingly, both the Rb paralogs p107 and p130 contain linkers in their pocket domains that have a phosphorylation site within a similar sequence context. This homology suggests that a similar phosphorylation-induced structural change may be conserved in the pocket protein family. The second mechanism for E2FTD inhibition requires both RbN and phosphorylation at sites in RbIDL. Previously, it has been reported that RbN and the Rb pocket domain associate in a manner that is phosphorylation-independent (16Hassler M. Singh S. Yue W.W. Luczynski M. Lakbir R. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Bader T. Pearl L.H. Mittnacht S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 371-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our data here suggest that RbN and phosRbIDL together bind to the pocket domain in a manner that partially overlaps the E2FTD binding site. Further structural studies are required to examine in detail how phosphorylation changes the interactions between RbN-RbIDL and the pocket. A critical advantage of our analysis with recombinant proteins is complete control of the sites and extent of phosphorylation. Previous investigations aimed at identifying the critical phosphorylation events that regulate Rb-E2F binding had mixed results (11Brown V.D. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3246-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

These studies generally relied on transient transfections of mutagenized proteins in cancer cell lines. Thus, specific conclusions may have been influenced by substoichiometric degrees of phosphorylation at the acceptor sites that varied depending on the mutant and kinase. In an in vitro reaction with large quantities of recombinant kinase, we have achieved nearly quantitative phosphate incorporation, allowing unambiguous interpretation of the molecular effects of phosphorylation. Nevertheless, our results agree with and further explain several key observations from these previous cellular assays. Importantly, in transfection experiments assaying E2F binding, repression of E2F transcription, and growth suppression, cumulative mutation of multiple phosphoacceptor sites was required to abolish the effect of Cdk phosphorylation (11Brown V.D.

With previous results, our data reveal that multiple phosphorylation events (Thr356/Thr373, Ser608/Ser612, Ser788/Ser795, and Thr821/Thr826) are capable of inhibiting one of the two interfaces stabilizing the overall complex (Fig. 1), and thus many different combinations of Cdk phosphorylation must all be sufficient to inactivate Rb by disrupting the complex. Previous studies, which analyzed the effects of Rb phosphorylation at specific sites in cancer cell models, support our molecular characterization of Rb-E2F inhibition in several ways. First, phosphorylation reverses Rb repression of E2F-dependent transcription even if all of the RbC sites have been mutated (13Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 24Chew Y.P. Ellis M. Wilkie S. Mittnacht S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This observation points to a role for phosphorylation outside of RbC in specifically regulating the E2F transactivation domain and is consistent with our calorimetry data. Second, mutation of Ser608/Ser612 in addition to all of the RbC sites results in an Rb construct that cannot be regulated by phosphorylation, directly demonstrating the importance of Ser608/Ser612 phosphorylation in Rb inactivation (13Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Third, Cdk phosphorylation cannot regulate Rb when RbN is deleted and RbC phosphorylation sites are mutated (13Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Our data confirm that RbN is required for full phosphorylation-induced E2FTD inhibition. Interestingly, our calorimetry and NMR data suggest that RbN is not required for the partial E2FTD inhibition induced specifically by Ser608/Ser612 phosphorylation. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the quantitative calorimetry assay used here is more sensitive than the cellular assays in detecting partial inhibition of E2FTD binding. The implications of multiple possible phosphorylation pathways to E2F dissociation are intriguing. Different phosphorylation sites are probably preferentially phosphorylated by different Cdk-cyclins (34Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 36Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and thus diverse upstream regulators can affect Rb-E2F stability. On the other hand, although the sites have seemingly redundant roles in combining to inhibit E2F binding, each phosphorylation event is unique in the structural change it induces in Rb. The resulting conformations can differentially influence interactions of Rb with other proteins. For example, the intramolecular association of phosRbC with the pocket domain upon Thr821/Thr826 phosphorylation competes with the binding of LXCXE-containing proteins in addition to inhibiting the RbC-E2F marked box interface (12Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 17Rubin S.M. Gall A.L. Zheng N. Pavletich N.P.

Inhibition of the E2FTD-pocket association through Ser608/Ser612 phosphorylation, however, would still permit LXCXE protein interactions. Thus, in generating distinct phosphorylated Rb structures, the different E2F inhibition mechanisms resulting from various phosphorylation pathways allow for multiple signaling outputs.

https://openalex.org/W2074412639,"The morphologies of individual bones are crucial for their functions within the skeleton, and vary markedly during evolution. Recent studies have begun to reveal the detailed molecular genetic pathways that underlie skeletal morphogenesis. On the other hand, understanding of the process of morphogenesis itself has not kept pace with the molecular work. We examined, through an extended period of development in zebrafish, how a prominent craniofacial bone, the opercle (Op), attains its adult morphology. Using high-resolution confocal imaging of the vitally stained Op in live larvae, we show that the bone initially appears as a simple linear spicule, or spur, with a characteristic position and orientation, and lined by osteoblasts that we visualize by transgenic labeling. The Op then undergoes a stereotyped sequence of shape transitions, most notably during the larval period occurring through three weeks postfertilization. New shapes arise, and the bone grows in size, as a consequence of anisotropic addition of new mineralized bone matrix along specific regions of the pre-existing bone surfaces. We find that two modes of matrix addition, spurs and veils, are primarily associated with change in shape, whereas a third mode, incremental banding, largely accounts for growth in size. Furthermore, morphometric analyses show that shape development and growth follow different trajectories, suggesting separate control of bone shape and size. New osteoblast arrangements are associated with new patterns of matrix outgrowth, and we propose that fine developmental regulation of osteoblast position is a critical determinant of the spatiotemporal pattern of morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018638393,"Background Foraging bumblebees are normally associated with spring and summer in northern Europe. However, there have been sightings of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris during the warmer winters in recent years in southern England. But what floral resources are they relying upon during winter and how much winter forage can they collect? Methodology/Principal Findings To test if urban areas in the UK provide a rich foraging niche for bees we set up colonies of B. terrestris in the field during two late winter periods (2005/6 & 2006/7) in London, UK, and measured their foraging performance. Fully automatic radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology was used in 2006/7 to enable us to record the complete foraging activity of individually tagged bees. The number of bumblebees present during winter (October 2007 to March 2008) and the main plants they visited were also recorded during transect walks. Queens and workers were observed throughout the winter, suggesting a second generation of bee colonies active during the winter months. Mass flowering shrubs such as Mahonia spp. were identified as important food resources. The foraging experiments showed that bees active during the winter can attain nectar and pollen foraging rates that match, and even surpass, those recorded during summer. Conclusions/Significance B. terrestris in the UK are now able to utilise a rich winter foraging resource in urban parks and gardens that might at present still be under-exploited, opening up the possibility of further changes in pollinator phenology."
https://openalex.org/W2108553054,"A canonical feedforward circuit is proposed to underlie sensory cortical responses with balanced excitation and inhibition in layer 4 (L4). However, in another input layer, L6, sensory responses and the underlying synaptic circuits remain largely unclear. Here, cell-attached recordings in rat primary auditory cortex revealed that for the majority of L6 excitatory neurons, tonal stimuli did not drive spike responses, but suppressed spontaneous firings. Whole-cell recordings further revealed that the silencing resulted from tone-evoked strong inhibition arriving earlier than excitation. This pattern of inputs can be attributed to a parallel feedforward circuit with both excitatory and inhibitory inputs disynaptically relayed. In contrast, in the other neurons directly driven by thalamic input, stimuli evoked excitation preceding relatively weak inhibition, resulting in robust spike responses. Thus, the dichotomy of L6 response properties arises from two distinct patterns of excitatory-inhibitory interplay. The parallel circuit module generating preceding inhibition may provide a gating mechanism for conditional corticothalamic feedback."
https://openalex.org/W2049944911,"The cellular mechanisms underlying pathological alcohol seeking remain poorly understood. Here, we show an enhancement of nucleus accumbens (NAcb) core action potential firing ex vivo after protracted abstinence from alcohol but not sucrose self-administration. Increased firing is associated with reduced small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK) currents and decreased SK3 but not SK2 subunit protein expression. Furthermore, SK activation ex vivo produces greater firing suppression in NAcb core neurons from alcohol- versus sucrose-abstinent rats. Accordingly, SK activation in the NAcb core significantly reduces alcohol but not sucrose seeking after abstinence. In contrast, NAcb shell and lateral dorsal striatal firing ex vivo are not altered after abstinence from alcohol, and SK activation in these regions has little effect on alcohol seeking. Thus, decreased NAcb core SK currents and increased excitability represents a critical mechanism that facilitates motivation to seek alcohol after abstinence."

https://openalex.org/W2043479124,"Background Jawed vertebrates generate their immune-receptor repertoire by a recombinatorial mechanism that has the potential to produce harmful autoreactive lymphocytes. In mammals, peripheral tolerance to self-antigens is enforced by Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Recombinatorial mechanisms also operate in teleosts, but active immunoregulation is thought to be a late incorporation to the vertebrate lineage. Methods/Principal Findings Here we report the characterization of adaptive autoimmunity and Foxp3-based immunoregulation in the zebrafish. We found that zebrafish immunization with an homogenate of zebrafish central nervous system (zCNS) triggered CNS inflammation and specific antibodies. We cloned the zebrafish ortholog for mammalian Foxp3 (zFoxp3) which induced a regulatory phenotype on mouse T cells and controlled IL-17 production in zebrafish embryos. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate the acquisition of active mechanisms of self-tolerance early in vertebrate evolution, suggesting that active regulatory mechanisms accompany the development of the molecular potential for adaptive autoimmunity. Moreover, they identify the zebrafish as a tool to study the molecular pathways controlling adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2048311842,"Disruption of the nucleolus often leads to activation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway through inhibition of MDM2 that is mediated by a limited set of ribosomal proteins including RPL11 and RPL5. The effects of ribosomal protein loss in cultured mammalian cells have not been thoroughly investigated. Here we characterize the cellular stress response caused by depletion of ribosomal protein S9 (RPS9).Depletion of RPS9 impaired production of 18S ribosomal RNA and induced p53 activity. It promoted p53-dependent morphological differentiation of U343MGa Cl2:6 glioma cells as evidenced by intensified expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and profound changes in cell shape. U2OS osteosarcoma cells displayed a limited senescence response with increased expression of DNA damage response markers, whereas HeLa cervical carcinoma cells underwent cell death by apoptosis. Knockdown of RPL11 impaired p53-dependent phenotypes in the different RPS9 depleted cell cultures. Importantly, knockdown of RPS9 or RPL11 also markedly inhibited cell proliferation through p53-independent mechanisms. RPL11 binding to MDM2 was retained despite decreased levels of RPL11 protein following nucleolar stress. In these settings, RPL11 was critical for maintaining p53 protein stability but was not strictly required for p53 protein synthesis.p53 plays an important role in the initial restriction of cell proliferation that occurs in response to decreased level of RPS9. Our results do not exclude the possibility that other nucleolar stress sensing molecules act upstream or in parallel to RPL11 to activate p53. Inhibiting the expression of certain ribosomal proteins, such as RPS9, could be one efficient way to reinitiate differentiation processes or to induce senescence or apoptosis in rapidly proliferating tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967937627,"Background The mosquito Wyeomyia smithii overwinters in a larval diapause that is initiated, maintained and terminated by day length (photoperiod). We use a forward genetic approach to investigate transcriptional events involved in the termination of diapause following exposure to long-days. Methods/Principal Findings We incorporate a novel approach that compares two populations that differentially respond to a single day length. We identify 30 transcripts associated with differential response to day length. Most genes with a previously annotated function are consistent with their playing a role in the termination of diapause, in downstream developmental events, or in the transition from potentially oxygen-poor to oxygen-rich environments. One gene emerges from three separate forward genetic screens as a leading candidate for a gene contributing to the photoperiodic timing mechanism itself (photoperiodic switch). We name this gene photoperiodic response gene 1 (ppdrg1). WsPpdrg1 is up-regulated under long-day response conditions, is located under a QTL for critical photoperiod and is associated with critical photoperiod after 25 generations of recombination from a cross between extreme phenotypes. Conclusions Three independent forward genetic approaches identify WsPpdrg1 as a gene either involved in the photoperiodic switch mechanism or very tightly linked to a gene that is. We conclude that continued forward genetic approaches will be central to understanding not only the molecular basis of photoperiodism and diapause, but also the evolutionary potential of temperate and polar animal populations when confronted with rapid climate change."
https://openalex.org/W1996924573,"Efficient proliferation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inside macrophage requires that the essential response regulator MtrA be optimally phosphorylated. However, the genomic targets of MtrA have not been identified. We show by chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase I footprinting that the chromosomal origin of replication, oriC, and the promoter for the major secreted immunodominant antigen Ag85B, encoded by fbpB, are MtrA targets. DNase I footprinting analysis revealed that MtrA recognizes two direct repeats of GTCACAgcg-like sequences and that MtrA∼P, the phosphorylated form of MtrA, binds preferentially to these targets. The oriC contains several MtrA motifs, and replacement of all motifs or of a single select motif with TATATA compromises the ability of oriC plasmids to maintain stable autonomous replication in wild type and MtrA-overproducing strains, indicating that the integrity of the MtrA motif is necessary for oriC replication. The expression of the fbpB gene is found to be down-regulated in Mtb cells upon infection when these cells overproduce wild type MtrA but not when they overproduce a nonphosphorylated MtrA, indicating that MtrA∼P regulates fbpB expression. We propose that MtrA is a regulator of oriC replication and that the ability of MtrA to affect apparently unrelated targets, i.e. oriC and fbpB, reflects its main role as a coordinator between the proliferative and pathogenic functions of Mtb."

We have previously demonstrated that Wnt signaling in hMSC enhanced osteoblast differentiation and inhibited adipogenesis by comparing two hMSC cell lines overexpressing mutated forms of the Wnt co-receptor LRP5: T253I (hMSC-LRP5T253) and T244M (hMSC-LRP5T244) conducting high and low level of Wnt signaling, respectively. To explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, we compared gene expression profiles of hMSC-LRP5T253 and hMSC-LRP5T244 treated with Wnt3a using whole genome expression microarrays and found that TNFRSF19 is differentially up-regulated between the two cells lines. Bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase assay of its promoter revealed that TNFRSF19 transcript 2 (TNFRSF19.2) is a target of canonical Wnt signaling. Knocking down TNFRSF19 in hMSC-LRP5T253 cells decreased Wnt3a-induced osteoblast differentiation marker alkaline phosphate activity and its overexpression in hMSC-LRP5T244 cells increased alkaline phosphate activity. In addition, TNFRSF19 was negatively regulated by adipogenic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP).

We have previously reported that patients with activated mutation T253I of LRP5 was responsible for the high bone mass phenotype in a large family in Denmark.

The hMSC-LRP5T244 cells exhibited the opposite phenotype (15Qiu W. Andersen T.E. Bollerslev J. Mandrup S. Abdallah B.M. Kassem M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; 22: 1720-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These experiments suggested that canonical Wnt signaling mediated through LRP5 targets MSC and determines their differentiation fate into osteoblasts or adipocytes. This notion has been supported by other studies employing Wnt10b as a canonical Wnt ligand (20Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A.

To further identify downstream molecules and/or signaling pathways responsible for cell fate determination of hMSC in this model, we compared global gene expression patterns of hMSC-LRP5T253 and hMSC-LRP5T244 cells treated with Wnt3a. We found that tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 19 (TNFRSF19) is regulated by both canonical Wnt signaling and C/EBP. Modulation of TNFRSF19 expression resulted in significant changes in hMSC differentiation ability to the osteoblastic and adipocytic lineage suggesting an important role as a mediator in regulation of differentiation fate of hMSC. hMSC cells (hMSC-LRP5T253 and hMSC-LRP5T244) were cultured in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA Laboratories) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The phoenix A amphotropic packaging cells and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Control condition medium (CM) and Wnt3a condition medium (Wnt3a-CM) were prepared from L control cells (CRL-2648, ATCC) and L-Wnt3a cells (CRL-2647, ATCC) as described (15Qiu W. Andersen T.E. Bollerslev J. Mandrup S. Abdallah B.M. Kassem M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; 22: 1720-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, Fluka) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −80 °C. To inhibit protein synthesis, 1 μg/ml of CHX was added into culture medium for 8 h. hMSC-LRP5T253 and hMSC-LRP5T244 cells were treated with 50% control CM or Wnt3a-CM in triplicates for 1 or 24 h and total RNA was prepared by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Synthesis of biotinylated cRNA was performed with 500 ng of total RNA of each sample using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quantification and quality analysis of total RNA and amplified cRNA were performed on a ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Size distribution of the extracted total RNA and the amplified cRNA were checked with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit and 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). HumanRef-8 v2 BeadChips from Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used to generate expression profiles of more than 22,000 well annotated RefSeq transcripts following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. The processing of the microarray expression profiles and identification of differentially expressed genes were performed by Beadstudio software provided by Illumina. We used DAVID (the Data base for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) to cluster differentially expressed genes into relevant signaling pathways. Promoter sequences of selected genes including all of transcripts were retrieved from the Transcriptional Regulatory Element data base (TRED) and DataBase of Transcriptional Start Sites (DBTSS). Promoter analysis was performed using online software TFsitescan and TFSEARCH. Besides, the consensus sequence of the TCF/LEF binding element (TBE, CTTTGWW) was also screened manually. To construct human TNFRSF19 promoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmids, the promoter regions containing 1328 bp for TNFRSF19 transcript 1 (TNFRSF19.1, NM_018647) and 1318 bp for transcript 2 (TNFRSF19.2, NM_148957) were amplified by PCR using PfuUltra II fusion HS DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The added MluI and NheI restriction site primers used for amplification were: 5′-ATTCACGCGTAACCTCTATCAAGGTGTGACATCG-3′ and 5′-ATTCGCTAGCAGTACTCCGCCCGTGA-3′ for the promoter of TNFRSF19.1 (19.1p), and 5′-ATTCACGCGTCGGAAGAAACAGCCCTAAAAG-3′ and 5′-ATTCGCTAGCTGCGAAAAATGCAGTGAAAGC-3′ for TNFRSF19.2 (19.2p). The obtained PCR products were digested with MluI/NheI (Promega), purified with the SV gel and PCR clean-up system (Promega) and cloned into MluI/NheI-digested promoterless firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). To construct TNFRSF19 expressing vector, the full-length open reading frame of TNFRSF19.2 was PCR amplified using forward, 5′-AGGAGAAACTAAGTTGCTGAACG-3′, and reverse primers containing the SalI restriction site, 5′-ATTCGTCGACTCAGTCCATAAGCCTAACAAAGG-3′, digested with SalI, purified as above, and cloned into SnaBI/SalI-digested retrovirus vector pBABEpuro. Site-directed mutagenesis of TBE by deleting CTTTG was performed by the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. 293T cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with 50 ng of TNFRSF19 promoter-firefly luciferase reporter vector and 5 ng of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector as internal control (Promega) by FuGENE 6 (Roche) when approximately 50–70% confluent. In addition, stabilized β-catenin (pCI-neo β-catenin S33Y), wild type TCF4 (pcDNA/Myc TCF4), dominant-negative TCF4 (pcDNA/Myc DeltaN TCF4, dnTCF4) (provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Addgene plasmids 16519, 16512, and 16513), C/EBPα expressing vector CMV-rC/EBP-42 (obtained from Dr. M. Daniel Lane), pcDNA3-C/EBPβ (obtained from Prof. Karsten Kristiansen), or pCMV TAG 3B-C/EBPδ (obtained from Dr. Ez-Zoubir Amri) were also cotransfected for promoter analysis. Topflash firefly reporter vector containing TCF/LEF-binding elements (Upstate) and pGL3-basic vector were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Luciferase assay was performed 24 h after transfection using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. To knockdown TNFRSF19, we used the MISSIONTM TRC shRNA target set (TRCN0000058884 or sh19-2, 0000058886 or sh19-4, and TRCN0000058887 or sh19-5) and non-target shRNA control (SHC002 or shCtrl) from Sigma to manufacture lentiviruses for infection. Briefly, 293T cells were seeded to 6-well plates and transfected by FuGENE 6 with 800 ng of lentiviral vector together with 1.6 μg of packaging plasmid psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid 12260) and 800 ng of envelope plasmid pMD2.G (Addgene plasmid 12259). The medium were changed after overnight incubation and collected 24 and 48 h later. For infection, hMSC cells were seeded 2 × 104/cm2 (for Wnt3a-induced osteogenesis) or 4 × 104/cm2 (for adipogenic differentiation) in 12- (for RNA isolation), 24- (for cytochemical staining), or 96-well (for ALP quantitation) plates and infected with lentivirus through a 0.45-μm filter. In addition, we designed siRNA targeting specifically to TNFRSF19.1 (target sequence 5′-AACACAGCACTGACTTACAGT-3′) and TNFRSF19.2 (target sequence 5′-AACCAAACTGACGGCATTTGA-3′) using siRNAtarget finder. siRNA were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. For transient overexpressing of TNFRSF19, 3 μg of retrovirus vector pBABEpuro or pBABE-TNFRSF19.2 were transfected into the Phoenix A packaging cell line and retrovirus containing medium were collected for infection as above. For osteogenic differentiation, cells were treated with 50% Wnt3a-CM or control CM for 7 days. For adipogenic differentiation, cells were incubated with adipocyte induction medium (AIM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 10 nm dexamethasone, 450 μm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (Sigma), 1 μm rosiglitazone (BRL49653, kindly provided by Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), and 3 μg/ml of human recombinant insulin (Sigma) for 7 days. The medium was renewed every 3 days. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and adipogenic markers including peroxisome proliferators-activator receptor γ (PPARγ2), adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), adiponectin (APM1), and lipoprotein lipase were performed using fast SYBR® Green master mix (Applied Biosystem) on a StepOnePlusTM system (Applied Biosystem) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, primers for ALP, adipogenic markers, and GAPDH and data analysis were as described previously (15Qiu W. Andersen T.E. Bollerslev J. Mandrup S. Abdallah B.M. Kassem M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; 22: 1720-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Special primers used in this study are: TNFRSF19.1, 5′-CCAGGTGGCTGGGAAGA-3′ and 5′-CACATTCCTTAGACAACTCCATGC-3′; endogenous TNFRSF19.2, 5′-CATTTCATCTCCCTGCTCG-3′ and 5′-GCCACATTCCTTAGACAACTCC-3′; C/EBPα, 5′-CACGAAGCACGATCAGTCC-3′ and 5′-CATTGCACAAGGCACTGC-3′; C/EBPβ, 5′-CAAACCAACCGCACATGC-3′ and 5′-AACCGATTGCATCAACTTCG-3′; C/EBPδ, 5′-GGAGAGACTCAGCAACGACC-3′ and 5′-CAGTTTAGTGGTGGTAAGTCCAGG-3′. For detecting expression of ectopic TNFRSF19.2, the forward primer for TNFRSF19.2 cloning and reverse primer for endogenous TNFRSF19.2 amplification were used. ALP activity was measured by using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fluka) as substrate and normalized against the cell number. Briefly, cell number was quantitated by adding CellTiter-Blue reagent (Promega) to culture medium, incubating at 37 °C for 1 h, and measuring fluorescent intensity (560EX/590EM). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and Tris-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, 90% ethanol for 30 s at room temperature, incubated with substrate (1 mg/ml of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, and 1 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C for 20 min, and the absorbance measured at 405 nm (22Rodríguez J.P. González M. Ríos S. Cambiazo V. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 93: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Oil-red O staining were performed 7 days after differentiation as described (15Qiu W. Andersen T.E. Bollerslev J. Mandrup S. Abdallah B.M. Kassem M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2007; 22: 1720-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Statistical testing was determined by Student's t test and p < 0.05 was considered significant. To explore the mechanisms underlying cellular phenotypes of hMSC-LRP5T253 and hMSC-LRP5T244 cells, we treated the cells with control CM or Wnt3a-CM for 1 or 24 h and compared their global gene expression profiles by Illumina® microarray system. Upon Wnt3a stimulation for 1 h, the gene expression profiles of hMSC-LRP5T253 and hMSC-LRP5T244 cells did not exhibit significant changes (data not shown). However, upon Wnt3a stimulation of hMSC-LRP5T244 cells for 24 h, 131 Illumina target IDs representing 124 non-redundant genes were changed at least 2-fold, 73 of were up-regulated and 51 were down-regulated (supplemental Table S1). In hMSC-LRP5T253, 176 Illumina target IDs representing 167 non-redundant genes were changed 2-fold including 94 up-regulated and 73 down-regulated non-redundant genes (supplemental Table S2). By clustering significantly regulated genes into KEGG signaling pathways using the online DAVID program, we found similar signaling pathways affected upon Wnt3a stimulation in both cell lines including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, transforming growth factor-β signaling, and the Wnt signaling pathway (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The microarray data reported here was deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE16186. To detect Wnt target genes, we identified genes differentially changed upon Wnt3a treatment in hMSC-LRP5T253 and hMSC-LRP5T244. As shown in Fig. 1A, the x and y axis represent fold-induction (log2 ratio) of each Illumina target ID by Wnt3a in hMSC-LRP5T244 and hMSC-LRP5T253, respectively. Most of genes were changed in a similar direction, except there were 15 genes including BMP2, DKK2, NKD1, and TNFRSF19 (here it is TNFRSF19.1) at least 2-fold differentially up- or down-regulated between the two cell lines (Fig. 1A, inset). To further identify novel canonical Wnt target genes, we retrieved the promoter sequences from all of transcript variants of these 15 genes as well as from 21 genes up-regulated at least 3-fold by Wnt3a in hMSC-LRP5T253 (supplemental Table S2) and searched for TBE (CTTTGWW) within 1 kb upstream and 200 bp downstream of transcription start site defined by the reference mRNA sequence in GenBankTM. One of the genes identified was TNFRSF19 that has two different transcripts: TNFRSF19.1 and TNFRSF19.2. We found that the promoter of TNFRSF19.2 (19.2p) but not the promoter of TNFRSF19.1 (19.1p) has six canonical TBE within the defined promoter region (Fig. 2). The microarray data demonstrated that the TNFRSF19.2 expression level was higher in hMSC-LRP5T253 cells than in hMSC-LRP5T244 under basal conditions (signal density 2141 versus 960) and after Wnt3a stimulation (signal density 4985 versus 2891) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, TNFRSF19.1 was differentially up-regulated by Wnt3a in hMSC-LRP5T253 (2.27-fold) and exhibited no change in hMSC-LRP5T244 cells (Fig. 1, A and B) but its promoter (19.1p) does not contain any TBE (Fig. 2). The expression patterns of TNFRSF19.1 and TNFRSF19.2 were examined by real-time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1C). TNFRSF19.2 was up-regulated by Wnt3a in both hMSC-LRP5T244 and hMSC-LRP5T253 cells (2.5- versus 2.3-fold, respectively). However, the expression level in hMSC-LRP5T253 cells was higher than hMSC-LRP5T244 as observed in microarray data. The up-regulation of TNFRSF19.1 by Wnt3a was also confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 2Schematic representation of TNFRSF19 promoters for both transcripts. Promoter sequences were retrieved from the Transcriptional Regulatory Element Data base and analyzed by TFsitescan and TFSEARCH. FP and RP represent forward primer and reverse primer employed for promoter cloning. TSS represents the transcription start site defined by RefSeq and the first exon was indicated as box. The promoter of TNFRSF19 transcript 1 (19.1p) contains six GC box and three C/EBP binding sites within the −1149 to +178 bp region (upper). The promoter of TNFRSF19 transcript 2 (19.2p) contains a TATA box in the first exon, six canonical TCF/LEF binding sites (CTTTGWW, T1 to T6), and four C/EBP binding sites within the −975 to 342 bp region (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In depth bioinformatic analysis of 19.1p and 19.2p promoters revealed that both promoters have different cis-regulatory elements. As shown in Fig. 2, 19.1p does not contain any TBE but have three C/EBP binding sites (−1048 to −1035 bp, −1010 to −998 bp, and −408 to −395 bp), which bind key adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPs. Besides, 19.1p is a TATA-less promoter with higher G + C content (64%, but 42% in 19.2p) and six GC boxes (−731 to −725 bp, −254 to −248 bp, −237 to −231 bp, −207 to −201 bp, −164 to −158 bp, and +153 to +159 bp), which are typical features of a housekeeping gene promoter (23Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The 19.2p contains six TBE (−916 to −910 bp, −656 to −650 bp, −612 to −606 bp, +33 to +39 bp, +70 to 76 bp, and +134 to 140 bp) including three TBE located in the first exon, four C/EBP binding sites (−840 to −827 bp, −687 to −675 bp, −68 to −55 bp, and +202 to 215 bp), and one TATA box located in the first exon (+51 to +57 bp) (Fig. 2). Existence of TBE and C/EBP binding sites in 19.1p and 19.2p suggested TNFRSF19 may be involved in transmitting different signals to cell differentiation to osteoblasts or adipocytes. Based on these observations, we further examined the role of TNFRSF19 in hMSC differentiation. To further confirm that TNFRSF19 is regulated directly by Wnt signaling, we cloned 19.1p (1328 bp, −1149 to +178 bp) and 19.2p (1318 bp, −975 to +342 bp) into the promoterless firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic and the activities of the promoters were determined by dual luciferase assay. Without Wnt activation, 19.1p has a much higher basal activity than 19.2p (Fig. 3A) suggesting that TNFRSF19.1 is constitutively expressed by hMSC. We examined responsiveness of promoters to Wnt activation by co-transfection of 293T cells with a stabilized form of β-catenin (S33Y) (24Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). S33Y increased promoter activities of 19.2p to a maximal of 12–44-fold in a dose-dependent manner but the 19.1p promoter was not responsive (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, β-catenin-mediated transactivation of 19.2p could be further enhanced by co-transfection with wild type TCF4 and blocked by co-transfection with dnTCF4, which lacks of β-catenin binding domain (25Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C). The 19.1p did not respond to either wild type TCF4 or dnTCF4 (Fig. 3C). To determine whether TBE sites are essential for Wnt activation, we"

However, A9, A9-SSG and A8/A9 promoted neutrophil adhesion to fibronectin but, in the presence of A8, A9-mediated adhesion was abrogated by glutathionylation. S-Glutathionylation of A9 may protect its oxidation to higher oligomers and reduce neutrophil binding to the extracellular matrix. This may regulate the magnitude of neutrophil migration in the extravasculature, and together with the functional changes we reported for S-nitrosylated A8, particular oxidative modifications of these proteins may limit tissue damage in acute inflammation.

However, excessive ROS can lead to oxidative stress, inflicting damage to cells and tissues, thereby amplifying inflammation (3Ryter S.W. Kim H.P. Hoetzel A. Park J.W. Nakahira K. Wang X. Choi A.M.

Reversible modifications may protect proteins against permanent oxidative damage and/or modulate their functions, but excessive ROS can lead to permanent loss of function and/or cell apoptosis and necrosis that may promote pathogenesis (5Niwa T.

A9 mediates neutrophil adhesion to fibronectin, fibrinogen, and endothelial cells via activation of β2 integrins, suggesting a role in leukocyte transmigration (32Ryckman C. Vandal K. Rouleau P.

A9 may also modulate the resolution of inflammation by suppressing macrophage activity after phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils (38De Lorenzo B.H. Godoy L.C. Novaes e Brite R.R. Pagano R.L.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A9 enhances A8 binding to tubulin and A8-mediated microtubule polymerization in resting phagocytes. Phosphorylation of A9, mediated by p38 MAPK after phagocyte activation, may regulate cytoskeletal rearrangements that promote migration, a property supported by the impaired transendothelial migration of A9−/− neutrophils (42Vogl T. Ludwig S. Goebeler M. Strey A. Thorey I.S. Reichelt R. Foell D. Gerke V. Manitz M.P. Nacken W. Werner S. Sorg C. Roth J.

Oxidation of murine A8 to disulfide-linked dimers (43Harrison C.A. Raftery M.J. Walsh J. Alewood P. Iismaa S.E. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. J. Biol.

Res. 2006; 85: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A8 and A9 are more susceptible to oxidation by HOCl than low density lipoprotein (47McCormick M.M. Rahimi F. Bobryshev Y.V. Gaus K.

Chem. 2005; 280: 41521-41529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and their exquisite capacity to scavenge ROS makes them primary candidates for protecting cells against oxidative stress in a localized environment. Recently, we showed that A8 and A9 are S-nitrosylated by the physiological NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) in vitro; A8 is more susceptible, and A8-SNO suppressed mast cell-mediated inflammation by reducing leukocyte adhesion and extravasation in the rat mesenteric microcirculation (48Lim S.Y. Raftery M. Cai H. Hsu K. Yan W.X. Hseih H.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D. Thomas S. Perry M. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 5627-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, both proteins are up-regulated in microvascular endothelial cells by proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1β or tumor necrosis factor-α (49Yen T. Harrison C.A. Devery J.M. Leong S. Iismaa S.E. Yoshimura T. Geczy C.L. Blood. 1997; 90: 4812-4821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and oxidative changes in the microcirculation during inflammation may alter functions of these proteins in endothelial cells.Here we show that A9 in neutrophils is S-glutathionylated after activation. S-Glutathionylated A8 (A8-SSG) and A9 (A9-SSG) were generated with GSNO and GSSG in vitro, whereas only A9-SSG was detected in neutrophils activated with PMA. The single Cys3 residue of A9, the site of GSH addition, is present only in the full-length form, which accounted for ∼72% of total A9 in neutrophils. Structural changes in A9-SSG apparently altered its affinity for complex formation with A8 but did not affect the capacity of A8/A9 to bind AA. A9 binding to endothelial cells is implicated in their activation (50Viemann D. Strey A. Janning A. Jurk K. Klimmek K. Vogl T. Hirono K. Ichida F. Foell D. Kehrel B. Gerke V. Sorg C. Roth J. Blood. 2005; 105: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar); significantly less A9-SSG and A8/A9-SSG bound HMEC-1 endothelial cells compared with the unmodified forms, likely due to differences in protein conformation. Moreover, unlike A8/A9, A8/A9-SSG did not induce neutrophil adhesion to fibronectin. We propose that glutathionylation may protect A9 from oxidative damage in activated neutrophils and may limit leukocyte exudation in inflammatory lesions.DISCUSSIONResponses of cells to oxidative stress typically involve changes in thiol content, and S-thiolation is an important protective mechanism that can regulate functions of susceptible proteins (9Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Milzani A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 72Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). A8 and A9, abundant in neutrophil cytosol, are extremely sensitive to oxidation by reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (43Harrison C.A. Raftery M.J. Walsh J. Alewood P. Iismaa S.E. Thliveris S.

Microbiol. 2009; 55: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); we proposed that they may act as an oxidant sink. Human A8 and A9 are induced in neovessels at inflammatory sites (47McCormick M.M. Rahimi F. Bobryshev Y.V. Gaus K. Zreiqat H. Cai H. Lord R.S. Geczy C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41521-41529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and are readily S-nitrosylated, and A8-SNO may modulate blood vessel homeostasis (48Lim S.Y. Raftery M. Cai H. Hsu K. Yan W.X. Hseih H.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D. Thomas S. Perry M. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 5627-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hence, changes in intracellular/extracellular redox are likely to regulate their functional properties. Moreover, their dependence on IL-10 for induction in activated human monocytes/macrophages by TLR-3 and -4 ligands (26Endoh Y. Chung Y.M. Clark I.A. Geczy C.L. Hsu K. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 2258-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and their enhanced expression in various cells by anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids (25Hsu K. Passey R.J. Endoh Y. Rahimi F. Youssef P. Yen T. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2318-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) implicates A8 and A9 in resolution of inflammation.S-Glutathionylation is a reversible modification that can regulate functions of numerous proteins (9Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Milzani A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 72Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) including signaling and adhesion molecules, cytokines, and enzymes associated with inflammation (for review, see Ref. 14Shelton M.D. Mieyal J.J. Mol. Cells. 2008; 25: 332-346PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, glutathionylation of A8 and/or A9, particularly after phagocyte activation, may have important regulatory implications. However, A9 is expressed in two forms in neutrophils due to an alternate translation start site encoding Met5 (56Teigelkamp S. Bhardwaj R.S. Roth J. Meinardus-Hager G. Karas M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13462-13467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and truncated A9* (A95–114) lacks the single Cys present in full-length A9 (Fig. 2A). Relative expression levels of these isoforms may be important because they are likely to have some functional distinctions, particularly as A9* would not be S-glutathionylated or S-nitrosylated. We first determined the relative levels of these isoforms in neutrophil cytosol and established that full-length A9 composed ∼70% and A9* composed ∼30% of total A9.S-Glutathionylated adducts of recombinant A8 and A9 were generated by GSNO or GSSG in vitro and confirmed by ESI-MS; Ca2+ or Zn2+ did not alter reactivity. Formation was reversed by GSH (not shown). Glutathionylation with GSSG likely occurred via thiol-disulfide exchange as proposed (74Gallogly M.M. Mieyal J.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2007; 7: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). GSNO generated S-nitrosylated and S-glutathionylated A8 (48Lim S.Y. Raftery M. Cai H. Hsu K. Yan W.X. Hseih H.L. Watts R.N. Richardson D. Thomas S. Perry M. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 5627-5636Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and because GSNO can promote S-glutathionylation via S-nitrosothiol intermediates (75Giustarini D. Milzani A. Aldini G. Carini M. Rossi R. Dalle-Donne I. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we tested this possibility and confirmed generation of A9-SSG (Fig. 1B).Neutrophil activation generates superoxides via the NADPH oxidase complex, subsequently producing other ROS (76El-Benna J. Dang P.M. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Elbim C. Arch. Immunol. Ther. Exp. (Warsz). 2005; 53: 199-206PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies of S-thiolated proteins in PMA-activated neutrophils using Tran35S-labeling demonstrated an ∼3–5% S-thiolation, predominantly glutathionylation, of a 14-kDa protein that increased over 30 min activation and was reduced by dithiothreitol. This is likely to be A9 because the protein was described as “the most abundant band in neutrophil extracts” (21Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston Jr., R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To analyze modifications of A8 and A9 after neutrophil activation, cytosolic proteins were separated by HPLC and analyzed by ESI-MS. Products likely corresponding to A9-SSG were generated by PMA or PMA plus ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 3, B and C), whereas none was separated from unstimulated cell lysates. Little co-localization of A9 with GSH was obvious in unstimulated neutrophils (Fig. 4A) but increased after PMA plus ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 4B), suggesting A9-SSG complexes. A9-SSG was not detected in the cytosol of neutrophils activated with opsonized zymosan or fMLP (Table 2), although in opsonized zymosan-activated cells, A9 and GSH co-localized around the plasma membrane and possibly the phagosomal membrane (Fig. 4D). Similarly, A9 associates with neutrophil phagosomes after phagocytosis of antibody- and complement-coated latex beads (77Burlak C. Whitney A.R. Mead D.J. Hackstadt T. Deleo F.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 620-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, A9 may associate with GSH in particular cell compartments. Little co-localization of A9 with GSH was obvious in neutrophils activated with fMLP (Fig. 4C), consistent with the apparent absence of A9-SSG in cytosol extracts from this population. Apart from actin (21Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston Jr., R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the subcellular localization of glutathione-protein adducts in activated neutrophils is virtually unexplored, although studies in other cells indicate their presence in various compartments (for review, see Ref. 78Martínez-Ruiz A. Lamas S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 75: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that A9-SSG may be generated in particular compartments depending on the stimulus and may have functional differences that warrant further investigation.Because of its relative abundance and stability, we focused on structural characterization and functional consequences of A9 glutathionylation. This modification did not alter its Ca2+ or Zn2+ binding affinities, although conformational changes indicated increased surface hydrophobicity upon Zn2+ binding (Fig. 5). Thus, in certain microenvironments, particularly after neutrophil activation that promotes A9 translocation from the cytosol to the membrane, glutathionylation of A9 may facilitate interactions with lipid environments within membranes (64van den Bos C. Roth J. Koch H.G. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1247-1254PubMed Google Scholar) or with other hydrophobic components such as fatty acids (79Siegenthaler G. Roulin K. Chatellard-Gruaz D. Hotz R. Saurat J.H. Hellman U. Hagens G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9371-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In a preliminary attempt to assess the ability of A8 and A9 to form complexes using cross-linking, we found that A9-SSG may have reduced capacity to form the heterocomplex but may preferentially form more higher order A9 homocomplexes (not shown). Several intracellular functions are dependent on A8/A9 heterocomplex formation (53Kerkhoff C. Klempt M. Kaever V. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32672-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 80Leukert N. Vogl T. Strupat K. Reichelt R. Sorg C. Roth J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and differences in the Zn2+-bound conformation of A9-SSG and its propensity to form homocomplexes are likely to alter function. To test this, we examined AA binding (53Kerkhoff C. Klempt M. Kaever V. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32672-32679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) but found that binding capacities of A8/A9 and A8/A9-SSG were similar.Formation of thiol disulfides may protect key proteins including A9 from forming irreversible Cys adducts such as sulfenic and sulfonic acid derivatives during oxidative stress (81Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Claiborne A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 325-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This may be particularly relevant given that A9 is secreted (30Rammes A.

https://openalex.org/W2162375791,"In vivo fluorescence microscopy studies of bacterial cells have shown that the bacterial shape-determining protein and actin homolog, MreB, forms cable-like structures that spiral around the periphery of the cell. The molecular structure of these cables has yet to be established. Here we show by electron microscopy that Thermatoga maritime MreB forms complex, several μm long multilayered sheets consisting of diagonally interwoven filaments in the presence of either ATP or GTP. This architecture, in agreement with recent rheological measurements on MreB cables, may have superior mechanical properties and could be an important feature for maintaining bacterial cell shape. MreB polymers within the sheets appear to be single-stranded helical filaments rather than the linear protofilaments found in the MreB crystal structure. Sheet assembly occurs over a wide range of pH, ionic strength, and temperature. Polymerization kinetics are consistent with a cooperative assembly mechanism requiring only two steps: monomer activation followed by elongation. Steady-state TIRF microscopy studies of MreB suggest filament treadmilling while high pressure small angle x-ray scattering measurements indicate that the stability of MreB polymers is similar to that of F-actin filaments. In the presence of ADP or GDP, long, thin cables formed in which MreB was arranged in parallel as linear protofilaments.

Steady-state TIRF microscopy studies of MreB suggest filament treadmilling while high pressure small angle x-ray scattering measurements indicate that the stability of MreB polymers is similar to that of F-actin filaments. In the presence of ADP or GDP, long, thin cables formed in which MreB was arranged in parallel as linear protofilaments. This suggests that the bacterial cell may exploit various nucleotides to generate different filament structures within cables for specific MreB-based functions. IntroductionDespite usually being constrained by a cell wall, bacterial shapes are highly diverse, reflecting the large phylogenetic range. For example Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Thermatoga maritime are straight rods, Vibrio cholera is a curved rod, Borrelia burgdorferi forms flat waves, whereas Spiroplasma species are helical. One of the main cytoskeletal proteins involved in determining the shapes of bacteria is thought to be MreB an actin homolog whose atomic structure is very similar to G-actin, despite the low sequence homology (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). It can assemble into polymers both in vitro (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and in vivo (2Jones L.J. Carballido-López R. Errington J. Cell. 2001; 104: 913-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that MreB plays roles in chromosome segregation (3Kruse T. Møller-Jensen J. Løbner-Olesen A. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5283-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), polar localization of proteins (4Gitai Z. Dye N. Shapiro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8643-8648Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and maintenance of cell shape and resistance to external mechanical stresses (2Jones L.J. Carballido-López R. Errington J. Cell. 2001; 104: 913-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis has been linked to the role of the MreB homolog MbI in B. subtilis (5Daniel R.A. Errington J. Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar); however, mechanisms by which MreB may provide mechanical support either directly to the cell or indirectly by affecting peptidoglycan wall integrity remain unclear.In vivo studies of MreB have mainly been limited to visualization under the fluorescence microscope (2Jones L.J. Carballido-López R. Errington J. Cell. 2001; 104: 913-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 5Daniel R.A. Errington J. Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). At the low resolution of this technique (∼0.2 μm), MreB was seen to form cable-like structures, which spiral around the periphery of the cell in B. subtilis, presumably just underneath the cytoplasmic membrane.

MreB has been observed in vitro to form straight or curved sheets and bundles (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 6Esue O. Cordero D. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2628-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Using cryoelectron tomography of helical-shaped bacteria Spiroplasma melliferum at an intermediate resolution of ∼40 Å, three parallel sheet-like structures underneath the cell membrane were identified. At this low resolution, the molecular structures and organization remained elusive, and it was unclear which of the ribbons may be associated with MreB filaments (7Kürner J. Frangakis A.S. Baumeister W. Science. 2005; 307: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).Because of these shortcomings, we found it necessary to clarify the molecular structure of MreB in vitro by high resolution electron microscopy. We show that MreB from T. maritime forms novel sheets consisting of interwoven helical-like filaments, which may be related to the cables observed by light microscopy and the ribbons observed by cryoelectron tomography in vivo. This design has appeal as it will be mechanically stronger than a simple sheet constructed of linear filaments and may be of importance for maintaining bacterial cell shape. We have characterized various MreB supramolecular structures under a wide variety of conditions by electron microscopy and studied their polymerization properties, steady state dynamics, and stability of MreB filaments by light scattering, TIRF microscopy, and high pressure small angle x-ray scattering (HP-SAXS).DISCUSSIONMutations in MreB resulted in a shape conversion from rod to sphere morphology (25Wachi M. Doi M. Tamaki S. Park W. Nakajima-Iijima S. Matsuhashi M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4935-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), implying a role for MreB in cell shape determination. Disruption of pole-to-pole MreB helically arranged cables by mutational inactivation resulted in failure of lateral murein synthesis and formation of spherical cells (26Dye N.A. Pincus Z. Theriot J.A. Shapiro L. Gitai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18608-18613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Disruption in the two genes immediately downstream of MreB, MreC, and MreD also yielded spherical phenotypes in E. coli and B.subtilis (27Kruse T. Bork-Jensen J. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 28Leaver M. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1196-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis the synthesis of lateral murein is governed by MreB homologue MbI (5Daniel R.A. Errington J. Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and the localizations of GFP-MreC and GFP-MreD were observed to be similar to that of MbI (28Leaver M. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1196-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Under the light microscope, all of these proteins followed helical patterns underneath the cell membrane.In a bacterial two-hybrid system, E. coli MreC directly interacted with MreB and MreD (27Kruse T. Bork-Jensen J. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In addition, the bitopic membrane protein MreC interacts with several members of the PBP family of bifunctional transglycosylase-transpeptidases (29Divakaruni A.V. Loo R.R. Xie Y. Loo J.A. Gober J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18602-18607Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which are thought to participate in both lateral and septal murein synthesis. These results suggest that murein synthesis in E. coli is carried out by a helical array of interacting proteins that includes MreB, MreC, MreD, and members of the PBP family. The model predicts that new peptidoglycan is inserted into the lateral cell wall in a helical pattern that reflects the helical pattern of the biosynthesis complex.Despite this knowledge, the actual role of the MreB cytoskeleton remains unclear, as helical distributions of MreC and MreD in E. coli observed by light microscopy were found to be independent of MreB (26Dye N.A. Pincus Z. Theriot J.A. Shapiro L. Gitai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18608-18613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and in Caulobacter, GFP-PBP2 adopted a helical distribution, which partially overlapped with MreC but not with MreB. In the absence of electron tomography data of T. maritime, the in vivo molecular structure of MreB within the cable-like spirals observed by light microscopy remains elusive. Only one electron tomography study of the helical bacteria Spiroplasma showed ribbon-like structures underneath the cell membrane (7Kürner J. Frangakis A.S. Baumeister W. Science. 2005; 307: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), but the molecular structure and organization within the ribbons could not be unambiguously determined.Here we have shown that in the presence of NTP Thermatoga MreB formed multilayered sheets of apparently interwoven filaments. The mechanical rigidity of these architectures can be expected to be substantially higher than that of a simple set of parallel linear protofilaments. Indeed, the HP-SAX experiments indicate that MreB filaments have a mechanical resilience similar to F-actin, which is the highest of any cytoskeletal protein known.Recent rheology experiments have characterized MreB from T. maritime to have an elastic module that is more than 3-fold higher than F-actin (30Esue O. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the elasticity of a polymer network is predicted to depend weakly on the intrinsic rigidity of the filaments, this high elastic modulus can be mostly accounted for by strong interfilament interactions. The elasticity and concentration of MreB are related by a power law relationship between network elasticity (G′) and protein concentration (C): G′ ∼ C0.44 and G' ∼ C0.29 for MreB-ATP and MreB-GTP, respectively (30Esue O. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is consistent with that predicted for cross-linked filaments. In contrast, non-cross-linked and entangled semiflexible polymers, such as F-actin, have a predicted power-law relationship G′ ∼ C1.4 (31Palmer A. Xu J. Kuo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys J. 1999; 76: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The lower concentration dependence index of GTP-MreB indicates that GTP-MreB filaments are more strongly cross-linked than ATP-MreB filaments (30Esue O. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our electron microscopy observations that Thermatoga NTP-MreB forms sheets consisting of interwoven filaments and that GTP-MreB sheets show a higher degree of order than ATP-MreB sheets. The strong interaction of MreB filaments within the sheets observed here should be able to resist large bending and compression forces and help in imposing a rigid cylindrical architecture to rod-shaped bacterial cells.Individual MreB filaments within the sheets formed in the presence of GTP or ATP were not linear protofilaments as described earlier (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), which may have to do with the fact that the previous study used a C-terminally His-tagged MreB. Rather untagged MreB assembled into single-stranded sinusoidally varying or helical 3/1 filaments with a repeat of about 200 Å (Fig. 3), whereas in the presence of GDP or ADP linear protofilaments were observed (Fig. 1, B and C). This may indicate that the binding of GTP or ATP to MreB monomers stabilizes a different conformation than ADP or GDP, which in turn leads to the preferential formation of either helical filaments or linear protofilaments. It is unknown whether bacterial cells utilize ATP, GTP, or both nucleotides to assemble MreB in vivo and whether the cell exploits different nucleotides for specific MreB-based functions. In nitrogen-fixing bacteria like T. maritime the rate of ATP regeneration is considered to be growth rate-limiting because of the high ATP requirement for N2 fixation (32Upchurch R.G. Mortenson L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 274-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the ATP/ADP ratio was estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.0. In E. coli, during exponential growth, the ATP and GTP concentrations are reported to be relatively constant at about 3 mm and 900 μm, respectively (33Jewett M.C. Miller M.L. Chen Y. Swartz J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Assuming similar concentrations in T. maritime, the nucleotide concentrations can be estimated to be about 2 mm ATP, 1 mm ADP, and 1 mm GTP. Should such concentrations lead to interwoven or linear sheet structures at the molecular level or coexistence of both forms in T. maritime is an open question.It should be noted that opposed to most rod-shaped bacteria described above where MreB is thought to shape the cell wall via MreC, MreC is not present in T. maritime (34Margolin W. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R812-R822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It may be that different bacteria which evolved during evolution and adopted to specific environments have found different ways to elongate their cell wall while maintaining a constant cell width between each division. Other protein factors like Rod Z regulate MreB assembly in rod-shaped bacteria like E. coli, while cell division protein FtsZ is required for the collapse of MreB cables from extended helices into rings near the future division site (34Margolin W. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R812-R822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Whether any of the MreB-associated proteins preferentially binds to MreB-NTP or MreB-NDP cables is unknown.MreB has been shown to be a determinant of polar protein localization and the translocation of chromosomal origins toward cell poles in both Caulabacter and E. coli (3Kruse T. Møller-Jensen J. Løbner-Olesen A. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5283-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 35Gitai Z. Dye N.A. Reisenauer A. Wachi M. Shapiro L. Cell. 2005; 120: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) leading to the hypothesis that MreB structures possess a uniform polarity that can be interpreted by trafficking factors. The organization of sheets indicates the possibility that both Thermatoga MreB-NTP and MreB-NDP may form polar suprastructures.The kinetic dynamics of Thermatoga MreB-NTP filament formation was faster than F-actin but significantly slower than ParM (8Popp D. Narita A. Oda T. Fujisawa T. Matsuo H. Nitanai Y. Iwasa M. Maeda K. Onishi H. Maéda Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Iwasa M. Maeda K. Narita A. Maeda Y. Oda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21045-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The critical concentration of MreB-NTP filament formation was similar to ParM, yet assembly under conditions closer to physiological occurred without a nucleation step, making Thermatoga MreB a very efficient polymerizing machine. Polymerization kinetics and critical concentration differed substantially from a previous study (6Esue O. Cordero D. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2628-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) which had used C-terminal His-tagged Thermatoga MreB, but was more similar to the work of Bean and Amann (18Bean G.J. Amann K.J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which also employed native MreB, although prepared differently than in our study. The variations in the biochemistry may reflect the differences in molecular structure and organization of Thermatoga MreB suprastructures we have observed here compared with the only previous structural study which used a His-tagged construct (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).Time-lapse TIRF microscopy of Thermatoga MreB-NTP sheets at steady state support a treadmilling process consistent with in vivo observations of MreB in Caulobacter (23Kim S.Y. Gitai Z. Kinkhabwala A. Shapiro L. Moerner W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10929-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Yet interpreting of treadmilling in terms of monomer motions is complicated by the fact that we are dealing with complex interwoven sheets rather than single filaments. Second, the site of GTP hydrolysis and what triggers hydrolysis is one of the major unknowns. Nevertheless, our findings define clear predictions on the structures, dynamics, and functions of T. maritime MreB, which can be tested by future in vivo light microscopy and electron tomography studies. IntroductionDespite usually being constrained by a cell wall, bacterial shapes are highly diverse, reflecting the large phylogenetic range.

Only one electron tomography study of the helical bacteria Spiroplasma showed ribbon-like structures underneath the cell membrane (7Kürner J. Frangakis A.S. Baumeister W. Science. 2005; 307: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), but the molecular structure and organization within the ribbons could not be unambiguously determined.Here we have shown that in the presence of NTP Thermatoga MreB formed multilayered sheets of apparently interwoven filaments. The mechanical rigidity of these architectures can be expected to be substantially higher than that of a simple set of parallel linear protofilaments. Indeed, the HP-SAX experiments indicate that MreB filaments have a mechanical resilience similar to F-actin, which is the highest of any cytoskeletal protein known.Recent rheology experiments have characterized MreB from T. maritime to have an elastic module that is more than 3-fold higher than F-actin (30Esue O. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the elasticity of a polymer network is predicted to depend weakly on the intrinsic rigidity of the filaments, this high elastic modulus can be mostly accounted for by strong interfilament interactions. The elasticity and concentration of MreB are related by a power law relationship between network elasticity (G′) and protein concentration (C): G′ ∼ C0.44 and G' ∼ C0.29 for MreB-ATP and MreB-GTP, respectively (30Esue O. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which is consistent with that predicted for cross-linked filaments. In contrast, non-cross-linked and entangled semiflexible polymers, such as F-actin, have a predicted power-law relationship G′ ∼ C1.4 (31Palmer A. Xu J. Kuo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys J. 1999; 76: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The lower concentration dependence index of GTP-MreB indicates that GTP-MreB filaments are more strongly cross-linked than ATP-MreB filaments (30Esue O. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our electron microscopy observations that Thermatoga NTP-MreB forms sheets consisting of interwoven filaments and that GTP-MreB sheets show a higher degree of order than ATP-MreB sheets. The strong interaction of MreB filaments within the sheets observed here should be able to resist large bending and compression forces and help in imposing a rigid cylindrical architecture to rod-shaped bacterial cells.Individual MreB filaments within the sheets formed in the presence of GTP or ATP were not linear protofilaments as described earlier (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar), which may have to do with the fact that the previous study used a C-terminally His-tagged MreB. Rather untagged MreB assembled into single-stranded sinusoidally varying or helical 3/1 filaments with a repeat of about 200 Å (Fig. 3), whereas in the presence of GDP or ADP linear protofilaments were observed (Fig. 1, B and C). This may indicate that the binding of GTP or ATP to MreB monomers stabilizes a different conformation than ADP or GDP, which in turn leads to the preferential formation of either helical filaments or linear protofilaments. It is unknown whether bacterial cells utilize ATP, GTP, or both nucleotides to assemble MreB in vivo and whether the cell exploits different nucleotides for specific MreB-based functions. In nitrogen-fixing bacteria like T. maritime the rate of ATP regeneration is considered to be growth rate-limiting because of the high ATP requirement for N2 fixation (32Upchurch R.G. Mortenson L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 274-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the ATP/ADP ratio was estimated to be between 1.4 and 2.0. In E. coli, during exponential growth, the ATP and GTP concentrations are reported to be relatively constant at about 3 mm and 900 μm, respectively (33Jewett M.C. Miller M.L. Chen Y. Swartz J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Assuming similar concentrations in T. maritime, the nucleotide concentrations can be estimated to be about 2 mm ATP, 1 mm ADP, and 1 mm GTP. Should such concentrations lead to interwoven or linear sheet structures at the molecular level or coexistence of both forms in T. maritime is an open question.It should be noted that opposed to most rod-shaped bacteria described above where MreB is thought to shape the cell wall via MreC, MreC is not present in T. maritime (34Margolin W. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R812-R822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It may be that different bacteria which evolved during evolution and adopted to specific environments have found different ways to elongate their cell wall while maintaining a constant cell width between each division. Other protein factors like Rod Z regulate MreB assembly in rod-shaped bacteria like E. coli, while cell division protein FtsZ is required for the collapse of MreB cables from extended helices into rings near the future division site (34Margolin W. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R812-R822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Whether any of the MreB-associated proteins preferentially binds to MreB-NTP or MreB-NDP cables is unknown.MreB has been shown to be a determinant of polar protein localization and the translocation of chromosomal origins toward cell poles in both Caulabacter and E. coli (3Kruse T. Møller-Jensen J. Løbner-Olesen A. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5283-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 35Gitai Z. Dye N.A. Reisenauer A. Wachi M. Shapiro L. Cell. 2005; 120: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) leading to the hypothesis that MreB structures possess a uniform polarity that can be interpreted by trafficking factors. The organization of sheets indicates the possibility that both Thermatoga MreB-NTP and MreB-NDP may form polar suprastructures.The kinetic dynamics of Thermatoga MreB-NTP filament formation was faster than F-actin but significantly slower than ParM (8Popp D. Narita A. Oda T. Fujisawa T. Matsuo H. Nitanai Y. Iwasa M. Maeda K. Onishi H. Maéda Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Iwasa M. Maeda K. Narita A. Maeda Y. Oda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21045-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The critical concentration of MreB-NTP filament formation was similar to ParM, yet assembly under conditions closer to physiological occurred without a nucleation step, making Thermatoga MreB a very efficient polymerizing machine. Polymerization kinetics and critical concentration differed substantially from a previous study (6Esue O. Cordero D. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2628-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) which had used C-terminal His-tagged Thermatoga MreB, but was more similar to the work of Bean and Amann (18Bean G.J. Amann K.J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which also employed native MreB, although prepared differently than in our study. The variations in the biochemistry may reflect the differences in molecular structure and organization of Thermatoga MreB suprastructures we have observed here compared with the only previous structural study which used a His-tagged construct (1van den Ent F. Amos L.A. Löwe J. Nature. 2001; 413: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).Time-lapse TIRF microscopy of Thermatoga MreB-NTP sheets at steady state support a treadmilling process consistent with in vivo observations of MreB in Caulobacter (23Kim S.Y. Gitai Z. Kinkhabwala A. Shapiro L. Moerner W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10929-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Yet interpreting of treadmilling in terms of monomer motions is complicated by the fact that we are dealing with complex interwoven sheets rather than single filaments. Second, the site of GTP hydrolysis and what triggers hydrolysis is one of the major unknowns. Nevertheless, our findings define clear predictions on the structures, dynamics, and functions of T. maritime MreB, which can be tested by future in vivo light microscopy and electron tomography studies. Mutations in MreB resulted in a shape conversion from rod to sphere morphology (25Wachi M. Doi M. Tamaki S. Park W. Nakajima-Iijima S. Matsuhashi M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4935-4940Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), implying a role for MreB in cell shape determination. Disruption of pole-to-pole MreB helically arranged cables by mutational inactivation resulted in failure of lateral murein synthesis and formation of spherical cells (26Dye N.A. Pincus Z. Theriot J.A. Shapiro L. Gitai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18608-18613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Disruption in the two genes immediately downstream of MreB, MreC, and MreD also yielded spherical phenotypes in E. coli and B.subtilis (27Kruse T. Bork-Jensen J. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 28Leaver M. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1196-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis the synthesis of lateral murein is governed by MreB homologue MbI (5Daniel R.A. Errington J. Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) and the localizations of GFP-MreC and GFP-MreD were observed to be similar to that of MbI (28Leaver M. Errington J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1196-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Under the light microscope, all of these proteins followed helical patterns underneath the cell membrane. In a bacterial two-hybrid system, E. coli MreC directly interacted with MreB and MreD (27Kruse T. Bork-Jensen J. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In addition, the bitopic membrane protein MreC interacts with several members of the PBP family of bifunctional transglycosylase-transpeptidases (29Divakaruni A.V. Loo R.R. Xie Y. Loo J.A. Gober J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18602-18607Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which are thought to participate in both lateral and septal murein synthesis. These results suggest that murein synthesis in E. coli is carried out by a helical array of interacting proteins that includes MreB, MreC, MreD, and members of the PBP family. The model predicts that new peptidoglycan is inserted into the lateral cell wall in a helical pattern that reflects the helical pattern of the biosynthesis complex. Despite this knowledge, the actual role of the MreB cytoskeleton remains unclear, as helical distributions of MreC and MreD in E. coli observed by light microscopy were found to be independent of MreB (26Dye N.A. Pincus Z. Theriot J.A. Shapiro L. Gitai Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18608-18613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and in Caulobacter, GFP-PBP2 adopted a helical distribution, which partially overlapped with MreC but not with MreB.

https://openalex.org/W2012607383,"Background Developing methods for protecting organisms in metal-polluted environments is contingent upon our understanding of cellular detoxification mechanisms. In this regard, half-molecule ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters of the HMT-1 subfamily are required for cadmium (Cd) detoxification. HMTs have conserved structural architecture that distinguishes them from other ABC transporters and allows the identification of homologs in genomes of different species including humans. We recently discovered that HMT-1 from the simple, unicellular organism, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, SpHMT1, acts independently of phytochelatin synthase (PCS) and detoxifies Cd, but not other heavy metals. Whether HMTs from multicellular organisms confer tolerance only to Cd or also to other heavy metals is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings Using molecular genetics approaches and functional in vivo assays we showed that HMT-1 from a multicellular organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, functions distinctly from its S. pombe counterpart in that in addition to Cd it confers tolerance to arsenic (As) and copper (Cu) while acting independently of pcs-1. Further investigation of hmt-1 and pcs-1 revealed that these genes are expressed in different cell types, supporting the notion that hmt-1 and pcs-1 operate in distinct detoxification pathways. Interestingly, pcs-1 and hmt-1 are co-expressed in highly endocytic C. elegans cells with unknown function, the coelomocytes. By analyzing heavy metal and oxidative stress sensitivities of the coelomocyte-deficient C. elegans strain we discovered that coelomocytes are essential mainly for detoxification of heavy metals, but not of oxidative stress, a by-product of heavy metal toxicity. Conclusions/Significance We established that HMT-1 from the multicellular organism confers tolerance to multiple heavy metals and is expressed in liver-like cells, the coelomocytes, as well as head neurons and intestinal cells, which are cell types that are affected by heavy metal poisoning in humans. We also showed that coelomocytes are involved in detoxification of heavy metals. Therefore, the HMT-1-dependent detoxification pathway and coelomocytes of C. elegans emerge as novel models for studies of heavy metal-promoted diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2089358636,"Background Inflammation is associated with most diseases, which makes understanding the mechanisms of inflammation vitally important. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we demonstrate a critical function of interleukin-32β (IL-32β) in vascular inflammation. IL-32β is present in tissues from humans, but is absent in rodents. We found that the gene is highly expressed in endothelial cells. Three isoforms of IL-32, named IL-32α, β, and ε, were cloned from human endothelial cells, with IL-32β being the major isoform. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL-1β) induced IL-32β expression through NF-κB. Conversely, IL-32β propagated vascular inflammation via induction of vascular cell adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, IL-32β increased adhesion of inflammatory cells to activated endothelial cells, a paramount process in inflammation. These results illustrate a positive feedback regulation that intensifies and prolongs inflammation. Importantly, endothelial/hematopoietic expression of IL-32β in transgenic mice elevated inflammation and worsened sepsis. This was demonstrated by significant elevation of leukocyte infiltration and serum levels of TNFα and IL-1β, increased vascular permeability and lung damage, and accelerated animal death. Together, our results reveal an important function of IL-32 in vascular inflammation and sepsis development. Conclusions/Significance Our results reveal an important function of IL-32 in vascular inflammation and sepsis development."
https://openalex.org/W2058626786,"The formation and loss of synapses is involved in learning and memory. Distinct subpopulations of permanent and plastic synapses coexist in the adult brain, but the principles and mechanisms underlying the establishment of these distinctions remain unclear. Here we show that in the hippocampus, terminal arborizations (TAs) with high plasticity properties are specified at juvenile stages, and account for most synapse turnover of adult mossy fibers. Out of 9-12 giant terminals along CA3, distinct subpopulations of granule neurons revealed by mouse reporter lines exhibit 0, 1, or >2 TAs. TA specification involves a topographic rule based on cell body position and EphA4 signaling. Upon disruption of EphA4 signaling or PSA-NCAM in juvenile circuits, single-TA mossy fibers establish >2 TAs, suggesting that intra-axonal competition influences plasticity site selection. Therefore, plastic synapse specification in juveniles defines sites of synaptic remodeling in the adult, and hippocampal circuit plasticity follows unexpected topographic principles."

There are six known ARF isoforms divided into three classes. Class I ARFs (ARF1–3) regulate the assembly of vesicle coat complexes in the secretary pathways and at endosomes. Class II ARFs (ARF4 and -5) are still poorly understood. The only member of class III, ARF6, is localized at the cell periphery and regulates trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosomal system (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). ARF6 also regulates assembly of the cytoskeleton and cell motility (2Boshans R.L. Szanto S. van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C.

These proteins are internalized via clathrin-independent endocytosis. They then join with clathrin dependent cargo in the early endosome where they are sorted either for degradation in the lysosome or for recycling to the plasma membrane (6Grant B.D. Donaldson J.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 10: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar).GTPases are molecular on/off switches that cycle between active GTP- and inactive GDP-bound forms. GTPases require accessory proteins to facilitate activation or inactivation. Activation of GTPases is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and inactivation requires GTPase-activating proteins (7Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 579-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).

The family has four isoforms, cytohesin 1, cytohesin 2/ARNO, cytohesin 3/GRP1, and cytohesin 4. The cytohesins are similarly sized (45–50 kDa) and extensively conserved (68% identity).

Cell surface levels of integrins are determined by a balance between endocytosis and recycling. Integrin trafficking may promote cell migration by internalizing integrins at the trailing edge of the cell and recycling them out to the leading edge (19Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R.

Integrin β1 is a component of the major receptors of fibronectin. ARF6 has been shown to regulate both the internalization and recycling of integrin β1 (17Powelka A.M. Sun J. Li J. Gao M. Shaw L.M.

Recent studies demonstrated that Brag2 activates ARF6 to regulate integrin β1 endocytosis, whereas an unknown GEF activates ARF6 to regulate integrin β1 recycling (22Dunphy J.L. Moravec R. Ly K. Lasell T.K. Melancon P. Casanova J.E. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 315-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The established roles for cytohesins and ARF6 in motility suggest that cytohesins could activate ARF6 to regulate integrin β1 recycling during cell migration.In this study we test this hypothesis and demonstrate that cytohesin function is required for integrin β1 recycling. Furthermore, we found that cytohesin 2/ARNO, but not cytohesin 3/GRP1, is required in integrin β1 recycling. We also show that ARNO and GRP1 have opposing effects on cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. ARNO knockdown inhibits cell migration, whereas GRP1 knockdown increases cell migration. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that these two similar proteins, ARNO and GRP1, have unique functions. These findings outline not only the endocytic recycling pathway of integrin β1 but also demonstrate that ARF6 activation is under extensive regulatory control by multiple GEFs during cell migration.DISCUSSIONCellular migration is a well coordinated process that requires altered cell shape and polarity (20Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R875-R877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that small GTPases of the ARF family are involved in these processes (28D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that ARF6 regulates endocytosis and recycling of adhesion proteins, which is one mechanism that can facilitate cell migration (17Powelka A.M. Sun J. Li J. Gao M. Shaw L.M. Sonnenberg A. Hsu V.W. Traffic. 2004; 5: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 21Li J. Ballif B.A. Powelka A.M. Dai J. Gygi S.P. Hsu V.W. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated that integrin β1 recycling is regulated by cytohesin 2/ARNO. We also found that two similar ARF6 GEFs, cytohesin 2/ARNO and cytohesin 3/GRP1, have different functions in cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. ARNO knockdown reduces adhesion, spreading, and migration, whereas GRP1 knockdown enhances adhesion, spreading, and migration. Additionally we found that ARNO but not GRP1 is required for β1 integrin recycling.Integrin β1 Recycling PathwayIntegrins are continuously cycling by endocytosis and reinsertion into the plasma membrane (29Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6765) Google Scholar, 30van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). This trafficking mechanism regulates cell migration. Integrin is redistributed from the trailing edge to the leading edge of migrating cells (31Bretscher M.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). ARF6 is known to regulate both integrin β1 endocytosis and recycling (17Powelka A.M. Sun J. Li J. Gao M. Shaw L.M. Sonnenberg A. Hsu V.W. Traffic. 2004; 5: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 21Li J. Ballif B.A. Powelka A.M. Dai J. Gygi S.P. Hsu V.W. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).The itinerary taken by ARF6-dependent cargo has been elucidated. These cargo proteins, such as β1 integrin, are internalized by clathrin-independent endocytosis. They then enter the early endosome where they meet up with cargo that was internalized in a clathrin-dependent manner. Recycling cargo then travel to the Rab11 positive endosomal recycling compartment. ARF6-dependent cargo is then returned to the plasma membrane via tubular recycling endosomes that align along microtubules. Both the internalization and recycling steps of this pathway require ARF6 activity (6Grant B.D. Donaldson J.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 10: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar).Despite the existence of 15 ARF GEFs, there are only 6 ARFs expressed in mammalian cells (10Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 32Cox R. Mason-Gamer R.J. Jackson C.L. Segev N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1487-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This suggests that ARF activation is regulated by different GEFs in different signaling pathways. The 15 Sec7 family members are divided into 5 classes: GBF/BIG, cytohesins, EFA6, BRAGs, and Fbox (9Casanova J.E. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).Previous research showed that Brag2 is localized to the plasma membrane and activates ARF6 to regulate integrin β1 endocytosis (22Dunphy J.L. Moravec R. Ly K. Lasell T.K. Melancon P. Casanova J.E. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 315-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It also has been demonstrated that ACAP1, a GTPase-activating protein for ARF6, is involved in recycling of this protein (21Li J. Ballif B.A. Powelka A.M. Dai J. Gygi S.P. Hsu V.W. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the ARF6 GEF involved in integrin β1 recycling remained unknown. Cytohesin 2/ARNO has been shown to stimulate epithelial cell migration, and cytohesin 3/GRP1 induces actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (5Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 33Clodi M. Vollenweider P. Klarlund J. Nakashima N. Martin S. Czech M.P. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4984-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, recycling of adhesion proteins is one of the mechanisms to regulate cell migration. Therefore, we tested cytohesins as promising candidates and identified ARNO as the ARF GEF required for integrin β1 recycling.Different Functions of ARNO and GRP1 in Cell Adhesion, Spreading, and MigrationThe cytohesin family has four isoforms: cytohesin 1, cytohesin 2/ARNO, cytohesin 3/GRP1, and cytohesin 4. They share similar sizes, extensively conserved sequences, and a common domain structure: coiled coil, sec7, PH, and basic domain (9Casanova J.E. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Among the members, ARNO and GRP1 are ubiquitously expressed, and they are very closely related (80% identity) (25Ogasawara M. Kim S.C. Adamik R. Togawa A. Ferrans V.J. Takeda K. Kirby M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3221-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous research demonstrated that knockdown of either ARNO or GRP1 has similar effects on insulin signaling (24Hafner M. Schmitz A. Grune I. Srivatsan S.G. Paul B. Kolanus W. Quast T. Kremmer E. Bauer I. Famulok M. Nature. 2006; 444: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated different functions of ARNO and GRP1 in cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. ARNO knockdown reduced cell adhesion, spreading, and migration, whereas GRP1 knockdown had opposing effects on these processes. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of differential actions of ARNO and GRP1.In addition to the different actions of ARNO and GRP1 in integrin β1 recycling, we find that these proteins are uniquely localized in spreading cells. Cytohesin 3/GRP1 is exclusively located in the most peripheral and basal regions of spreading MCF-7 cells. This localization suggests that GRP1 may regulate the protrusive actin rearrangements that occur in these locations as the cells spread. Cytohesin 2/ARNO is co-localized with cytohesin 3/GRP1 in these protrusive regions. In addition, cytohesin 2/ARNO is located throughout the interior of the cell. It is likely that some of this more centrally located ARNO promotes the recycling of integrin β1 from endosomal structures to the cell surface.Although ARNO and GRP1 are 80% identical overall, their coiled-coil domains are only 50% identical. Therefore, one explanation of the different subcellular locations of ARNO and GRP1 is that they may interact with different partners via their coiled-coil domains. Several scaffolding proteins have been identified that bind to the coiled-coil domain of ARNO and/or GRP1. GRASP/Tamalin and CYBR/CASP/CyTip can bind both ARNO and GRP1 (34Boehm T. Hofer S. Winklehner P. Kellersch B. Geiger C. Trockenbacher A. Neyer S. Fiegl H. Ebner S. Ivarsson L. Schneider R. Kremmer E. Heufler C. Kolanus W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32302-32309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). IPCEF interacts with both ARNO and GRP1 by two-hybrid assay, although only the interaction with ARNO was confirmed with recombinant proteins (37Venkateswarlu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43460-43469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GRSP1 interacts with GRP1, and it is not known whether this protein can also bind to ARNO (38Klarlund J.K. Holik J. Chawla A. Park J.G. Buxton J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40065-40070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has been shown that these proteins co-localize with cytohesins and modify their ARF6-activating activity (37Venkateswarlu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43460-43469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, endogenous ARNO and GRP1 may be bound via their coiled-coil domains to different scaffolding proteins and thereby are recruited to different places.A possible additional explanation for the different actions of ARNO and GRP1 is the presence of a protein kinase C site in the polybasic domain of ARNO that is absent in GRP1 (3Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cytohesin polybasic domain is an intramolecular autoinhibitory domain (39DiNitto J.P. Delprato A. Gabe Lee M.T. Cronin T.C. Huang S. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 569-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The polybasic domain and the linker region between the Sec7 and PH domains act as a pseudosubstrate to occlude the active site. This autoinhibition is relieved either by binding of active ARF6 to the PH domain or by phosphorylation of polybasic domain. These alterations disrupt the pseudosubstrate interactions and allow the catalytic Sec7 domain to interact with and activate ARFs (39DiNitto J.P. Delprato A. Gabe Lee M.T. Cronin T.C. Huang S. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 569-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C activation in ARNO-expressing HeLa cells produces extensive ruffling and actin rearrangement (3Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3133-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Integrin β1 recycling may depend upon an activation of protein kinase C that GRP1 cannot respond to. Thus, future investigations into the mechanisms underlying the differing actions of ARNO and GRP1 during integrin β1 recycling will likely provide a better understanding of how migration is regulated by ARF. Such studies will also help to illuminate why ARF6 is subject to regulation by a large number of GEF proteins.

There are six known ARF isoforms divided into three classes. Class I ARFs (ARF1–3) regulate the assembly of vesicle coat complexes in the secretary pathways and at endosomes. Class II ARFs (ARF4 and -5) are still poorly understood. The only member of class III, ARF6, is localized at the cell periphery and regulates trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosomal system (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). ARF6 also regulates assembly of the cytoskeleton and cell motility (2Boshans R.L. Szanto S. van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Frank S.R. Hatfield J.C. Casanova J.E. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).ARF6 regulates the endocytosis of β1 integrin and a number of other membrane proteins. These proteins are internalized via clathrin-independent endocytosis. They then join with clathrin dependent cargo in the early endosome where they are sorted either for degradation in the lysosome or for recycling to the plasma membrane (6Grant B.D. Donaldson J.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 10: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar).GTPases are molecular on/off switches that cycle between active GTP- and inactive GDP-bound forms. GTPases require accessory proteins to facilitate activation or inactivation. Activation of GTPases is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and inactivation requires GTPase-activating proteins (7Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 579-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).

We screened the entire Bcl-2 network for its involvement in DNA damage-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. Although the anti-apoptotic member Bcl-xL served as a major suppressor, apoptosis initiated only when both Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL were eliminated. The pro-apoptotic members Bak, Bad, Bim, and Noxa were required for apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents camptothecin and UV. We, therefore, used a His-tagged Bcl-xL expression system to capture the relevant BH3-only proteins that bind to Bcl-xL in response to DNA damage. Surprisingly, unlike Bad and Bim, which bound Bcl-xL constitutively, Noxa became “Mcl-1-free” and interacted with Bcl-xL after DNA damage but not after death receptor engagement. Similar observations were also made in A431 cells. Importantly, this induced interaction caused cytochrome c release and apoptosis and was directly inhibited by Mcl-1, a protein eliminated or inactivated after DNA damage. These results suggest that the loss/inactivation of Mcl-1 in conjunction with an induced Noxa/Bcl-xL interaction may serve as a trigger for mitochondrial dysfunction during DNA damage-induced apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2076426544,"The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) participates in epithelial transport and in cell volume maintenance by mediating the movement of ions and water across plasma membranes. Functional studies have previously demonstrated that NKCC1 activity is stimulated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibitors. In this study, we utilized both in vivo (heterologous cRNA expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes) and in vitro (32P-phosphorylation assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins) experiments to determine whether PP1 exerts its inhibitory effect directly on the cotransporter, or indirectly by affecting the activating kinase. We found that PP1 reduced NKCC1 activity in oocytes under both isotonic and hypertonic conditions to the same level as in water-injected controls. Interestingly, mutation of key residues in the PP1 binding motif located in the N-terminal tail of NKCC1 significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of PP1. In vitro experiments performed with recombinant PP1, SPAK (Ste20-related proline/alanine-rich kinase, which activates NKCC1), and the N terminus of NKCC1 fused to glutathione S-transferase demonstrated that PP1 dephosphorylated both the kinase and the cotransporter in a time-dependent manner. More importantly, PP1 dephosphorylation of SPAK was significantly greater when protein-protein interaction between the kinase and the N-terminal tail of NKCC1 was present in the reaction, indicating the necessity of scaffolding the phosphatase and kinase in proximity to one another. Taken together, our data are consistent with PP1 inhibiting NKCC1 activity directly by dephosphorylating the cotransporter and indirectly by dephosphorylating SPAK.

The activation/inhibition of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter is directly associated to the phosphorylation state of the protein (3Lytle C. Forbush 3rd, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lytle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15069-15077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we demonstrated that two Ste20-like serine/threonine kinases, SPAK and OSR1 (oxidative stress response 1), physically associate with the N-terminal tail of the cotransporter at a putative RFX(V/I) binding motif (5Piechotta K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52848-52856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation experiments with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and in vivo ion flux experiments with heterologously expressed cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes have also shown that SPAK/OSR1 phosphorylates and activates the cotransporter (7Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C134-C142Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In 2007, we reported that overexpression of an apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase (AATYK) inhibited NKCC1 activity. This effect was not mediated by the catalytic activity of the kinase, but was due to the scaffolding of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in proximity to SPAK (9Gagnon K.B. England R. Diehl L. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C1809-C1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These data suggested an intriguing possibility that PP1 inhibited NKCC1 activity by also dephosphorylating the activating kinase. Many protein phosphatases have a conserved hydrophobic groove that exhibits low affinity binding for small degenerate sequence motifs. Protein phosphatase 1, for instance, has been shown to dock at three possible motifs: the RVXF, MyPhoNE, and SILK motifs (10Roy J. Cyert M.S. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: re9Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition to the two putative SPAK binding motifs, the N-terminal tail of NKCC1 also contains a RVXF docking motif for PP1 (11Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although Darman and Forbush (11Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutations of this motif affected NKCC1 activity, the overlap between the PP1 motif and the second SPAK binding motif made it unclear whether the effect of the phosphatase on cotransporter function was solely due to NKCC1 dephosphorylation.In this study, we used in vitro phosphorylation assays and in vivo ion flux experiments to demonstrate that both NKCC1 and SPAK are dephosphorylated by PP1. We also show that dephosphorylation of SPAK is significantly greater when the kinase physically interacts with the N-terminal tail of NKCC1 to scaffold the phosphatase and kinase in proximity to one another. In summary, our results are consistent with the N-terminal tail of NKCC1 scaffolding a regulatory phosphatase (PP1) in proximity to an activating kinase (SPAK), and thus directly and indirectly participating in its own inactivation.RESULTSThe catalytic subunit of PP1 binds to a RVXF motif present in the N terminus of NKCC1 and is functionally important in regulating the phosphorylation state and activity of the cotransporter in mammalian cells (16Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This putative motif overlaps with one of two binding motifs (RFX(V/I)) for SPAK, the kinase which phosphorylates and activates the cotransporter (5Piechotta K. Lu J. Delpire E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50812-50819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 7Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27347-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of PP1 in modulating NKCC1 function in X. laevis oocytes, we co-injected mouse PP1 with a cotransporter tagged with EGFP. Fig. 1A shows a significant reduction in NKCC1 function under both isosmotic and hyperosmotic conditions. Note that the levels of uptake obtained with the tagged NKCC1 at both osmolarities is identical to the levels of uptake observed with wild-type NKCC1 (see Fig. 2), indicating that the N-terminal addition of EGFP does not affect cotransporter function. As the phosphatase was injected 2 days prior to the flux, we needed to confirm that PP1 did not prevent trafficking of the cotransporter to the plasma membrane. Confocal microscopy analysis of EGFP fluorescence revealed similar membrane expression of NKCC1 in the absence or presence of the phosphatase (Fig. 1B). Densitometry analysis of surface biotinylation/streptavidin pulldown demonstrates that co-expression of PP1 does not affect membrane expression of the cotransporter (Fig. 1, C and D).FIGURE 2Catalytic activity and binding of PP1 are necessary for NKCC1 inhibition.

Asterisk denotes statistical significance (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that the catalytic activity of the phosphatase was responsible for the inactivation of the cotransporter, we mutated a histidine residue into a lysine (H248K), an alteration known to catalytically inactivate the phosphatase (12Zhang J. Zhang Z. Brew K. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6276-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Traweger A. Wiggin G. Taylor L. Tate S.A. Metalnikov P. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10402-10407Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the catalytically inactive PP1 resulted in less inhibition of wild-type NKCC1 under both isosmotic and hyperosmotic conditions (Fig. 2). This data suggests both a catalytic-dependent and an -independent effect of PP1. Next, to determine whether PP1 exerts its inhibitory effect on NKCC1 activity by binding to the cotransporter, we utilized a “binding-deficient” mutant of NKCC1 where we removed amino acids 117–162, which contain the second SPAK binding motif (RFRV) and the putative PP1 binding motif (RVNF) (8Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there was no significant difference in NKCC1 activity when either wild-type or catalytically inactive PP1 were co-expressed with the PP1 binding-deficient form of the cotransporter under isosmotic or hyperosmotic conditions (Fig. 2). Therefore, our results indicate that PP1 reduces NKCC1 function in a catalytic- and binding-dependent manner, but also, somehow, reduces cotransporter function in a catalytic- and binding-independent manner.The simplest explanation for the catalytic- and binding-dependent effect of PP1 is that the phosphatase dephosphorylates and inactivates the cotransporter. However, there is also the possibility that PP1 dephosphorylates and inactivates the kinase, whereas some other phosphatase inactivates NKCC1. Therefore, we wanted to demonstrate that PP1 inactivates the cotransporter independently of the kinase. To do so, we utilized a constitutively active form of SPAK (T243E, S383A (18Gagnon K.B. Delpire E. FASEB J. 2010; 24 (609.3 (abstr.))Google Scholar)) and a cotransporter mutant in which the first SPAK binding motif (F79A) is inactivated (8Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The residues that render SPAK constitutively active are those targeted by WNK4 and WNK1 phosphorylation (19Vitari A.C. Thastrup J. Rafiqi F.H. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Karlsson H.K. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20Moriguchi T. Urushiyama S. Hisamoto N. Iemura S. Uchida S. Natsume T. Matsumoto K. Shibuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42685-42693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The use of the first SPAK binding-deficient NKCC1 mutant was to avoid the possibility that the constitutively active kinase might overwhelm the reaction and prevent us from observing any effect of PP1 on the cotransporter. Thus, active SPAK and PP1 must compete at the second overlapping motif and if PP1 dephosphorylates NKCC1, we should observe inactivation of the cotransporter. As shown in Fig. 3, mutant NKCC1 activity is similar in the presence of wild-type SPAK and WNK4 kinases or the constitutively active SPAK. In addition, expression of PP1 inhibits cotransporter activity regardless of the kinases used. To confirm that PP1 is not simply outcompeting SPAK at the overlapping binding site and thus effectively inhibit cotransporter activity, we repeated the PP1 effect with constitutively active SPAK and wild-type NKCC1. We obtained similar results indicating the prevalence of PP1.FIGURE 3PP1 mediates direct inhibition of NKCC1. K+ uptake of X. laevis oocytes expressing 15 ng of mutant NKCC1 (F79A, white bars) or wild-type NKCC1 (gray bar) in the presence or absence of 10 ng of wild-type SPAK (SPAK (wt)), wild-type WNK4 (WNK4 (wt)), wild-type PP1 (PP1 (wt)), and constitutively active SPAK (SPAK (ca)) under isosmotic (195 mosmol) conditions. All conditions were repeated twice with similar results. Bars represent mean ± S.E. (n = 20 oocytes). Asterisk denotes statistical significance (p < 0.001). Inset, amino acid sequence of mouse NKCC1 (residues 132–141) with overlapping binding sites for SPAK and PP1 highlighted by horizontal bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The possibility that PP1 also inhibits NKCC1 activity by dephosphorylating and inactivating SPAK is based on an observation from an earlier study where we found that apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase (AATYK1) significantly inhibited cotransporter activity when co-expressed with NKCC1 (9Gagnon K.B. England R. Diehl L. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C1809-C1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We determined that the inhibitory effect of AATYK1 was a result of scaffolding of endogenous PP1 in proximity to SPAK, thus allowing for phosphatase dephosphorylation of the kinase. However, because NKCC1 is a direct target of PP1 dephosphorylation, we cannot use the cotransporter as both the scaffold and the “reporter” of the functional assay. Therefore, we utilized AATYK1 as an alternative scaffolding molecule to determine whether the observed PP1 inhibition of cotransporter activity also involves SPAK dephosphorylation. As seen in Fig. 4, addition of AATYK1 reduces the level of uptake promoted by wild-type SPAK and wild-type WNK4 expression (a), but not when promoted by constitutively active SPAK (b). Therefore, the difference between the level of K+ uptake with SPAK + WNK4 versus constitutively active SPAK (c), in the presence of AATYK1, represents the inactivating effect of PP1 on SPAK.FIGURE 4AATYK inhibition of NKCC1 activity is prevented by a constitutively active SPAK.

Biol. 2006; 26: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) are established experimental methods for investigating the regulation of NKCC1 activity, they are still indirect assays. Using GST fusion proteins of wild-type and mutant SPAK and NKCC1 in in vitro 32P assays, we have demonstrated autophosphorylation of SPAK and SPAK phosphorylation of specific threonine residues in the N-terminal domain of NKCC1 (15Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To confirm that PP1 dephosphorylates both SPAK and NKCC1, we initially performed 32P experiments with SPAK and NKCC1 fusion proteins, followed by addition of recombinant PP1 for increasing amounts of time. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, although PP1 dephosphorylates SPAK in a time-dependent manner (open triangles), addition of the N-terminal domain of NKCC1 as a scaffold significantly increases the rate of kinase dephosphorylation (open squares). Note that PP1 completely dephosphorylates NKCC1 within 5 min (closed circles).FIGURE 5Scaffolding of SPAK and PP1 increases the rate of kinase dephosphorylation.

Assays were repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given the speed of dephosphorylation observed in this experiment, we next titrated the amount of recombinant phosphatase from 0 to 12.8 × 10−2 units, using a single time point of 10 min. As a negative control for the scaffolding effect of the N terminus of NKCC1 on SPAK dephosphorylation, we utilized a mutant form of the N terminus that cannot bind SPAK. As previously shown (8Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), alanine substitution of key phenylalanine residues (F79A and F135A) in the two SPAK binding motifs of NKCC1 prevents both in vitro phosphorylation and in vivo activation of the cotransporter. Fig. 5, C and D, shows that PP1 concentrations capable of dephosphorylating SPAK (open squares) when the phosphatase is scaffolded with the kinase do not affect the level of SPAK phosphorylation when the SPAK binding-deficient form of the cotransporter is added (open diamonds). Note that the SPAK binding-deficient form of the cotransporter was also not phosphorylated by the kinase (data not shown). To verify that the lack of phosphatase activity on SPAK in the presence of the binding-deficient form of NKCC1 was not a result of protein levels in the in vitro reaction, we performed a Western blot analysis of equivalent amounts of wild-type and binding-deficient NKCC1 fusion proteins used in our reactions with an anti-GST antibody. The inset of Fig. 5D clearly demonstrates that both wild-type and binding-deficient forms of the cotransporter were present in sufficient amounts in their respective experiments. Interestingly, the level of SPAK autophosphorylation observed in the absence of the cotransporter or in the presence of a mutant cotransporter that cannot scaffold SPAK is significantly greater than the level of SPAK autophosphorylation observed in the presence of a cotransporter that can bind and be phosphorylated by the kinase. This difference is not due to a limiting amount of ATP (or 32P), as it is also observed in kinase reactions of shorter durations (data not shown).DISCUSSIONMany proteins are functionally regulated by signaling cascades that involve both kinase and phosphatase activity. Pharmacological studies over the past 20 years have demonstrated that the functional activity of NKCC1 is determined by its state of phosphorylation (3Lytle C. Forbush 3rd, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lytle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15069-15077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Application of staurosporine or K252a, serine/threonine kinase inhibitors, has been shown to shift the “regulatory balance” of NKCC1 toward dephosphorylation and inactivation (21Palfrey H.C. Pewitt E.B. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22O'Donnell M.E. Martinez A. Sun D. Am. J. Physiol.

Conversely, addition of calyculin A, which inhibits both PP1 and PP2A (24Fagerholm A.E. Habrant D. Koskinen A.M. Mar. Drugs. 2010; 8: 122-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) has been shown to result in an increase in NKCC1 function (4Lytle C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52848-52856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and for the phosphatase PP1 (11Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this study, we wanted to precisely determine how PP1 exerts its inhibitory effect on NKCC1 function, through dephosphorylation of the cotransporter, dephosphorylation of upstream signaling molecules, or through some combination of both.As anticipated, overexpression of PP1 in X. laevis oocytes results in a significant reduction in NKCC1 function. Similar to the activating effect of SPAK phosphorylation (7Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C134-C142Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), PP1 dephosphorylation does not involve trafficking of the cotransporter to or from the plasma membrane. Indeed, confocal microscopy of individual oocytes co-expressing PP1 and EGFP-tagged NKCC1 exhibited similar levels of fluorescence at or near the plasma membrane as that of oocytes expressing EGFP-tagged NKCC1 alone, and biotinylation experiments confirmed that co-expression of PP1 did not alter membrane insertion of NKCC1.When a catalytically inactive mutant of PP1 (H248K) was co-expressed with wild-type NKCC1, we observed significantly less inhibition of both isosmotic and hyperosmotic cotransporter activity, indicating that the phosphatase activity of PP1 is important to the functional regulation of the cotransporter. However, we did not observe a complete recovery under isosmotic or hyperosmotic conditions. Because the H248K mutation is known to completely abrogate PP1 function (12Zhang J. Zhang Z. Brew K. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6276-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Traweger A. Wiggin G. Taylor L. Tate S.A. Metalnikov P. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10402-10407Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), our data suggest a catalytically independent effect of PP1 on NKCC1 activity. Alternatively, the catalytic activity of the phosphatase might have opposing mechanistic effects on NKCC1 function, one that inhibits the cotransporter, and another that promotes cotransporter function. Overexpression of catalytically active and inactive PP1 might therefore have differential effects on the balance between cotransporter inhibition and activation.To further sort out these effects, we utilized a deletion mutant of NKCC1 that lacks the putative PP1 binding motif. This mutant form of the cotransporter also lacks the second binding site for SPAK, but we knew from previous studies that one site was enough for activation of the cotransporter (8Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In fact, SPAK binding and activation were confirmed in our experiments by the characteristic activation of the mutant NKCC1 under hyperosmotic conditions, a property affected when overexpressing catalytically inactive SPAK (7Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C134-C142Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) or when the two SPAK binding domains are removed or mutated (8Gagnon K.B. England R. Delpire E. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2007; 20: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As wild-type PP1 was unable to bind to NKCC1, the phosphatase was unable to fully inhibit cotransporter function, as with wild-type cotransporter. However, we still observed a decrease in cotransporter activity under both isosmotic and hyperosmotic conditions to the same level observed with catalytically inactive phosphatase, confirming the existence of another pathway of PP1 regulation. At this point, we do not have an explanation for this “undefined” effect of PP1.Separating the effects of PP1 on the cotransporter and on the kinase was not a trivial task. To demonstrate dephosphorylation of NKCC1, we needed to make sure that the phosphatase could not deactivate the kinase, nor the phosphatase reaction be overwhelmed by the kinase reaction. Through the use of a constitutively active SPAK (T243E, S383A), which cannot be de-activated by the phosphatase and a mutant form of NKCC1 (F79A), which forces SPAK and PP1 to compete at an overlapping docking motif (134RFRVNFVD141), we observed a significant decrease in NKCC1 activity, demonstrating that it is the cotransporter that is being dephosphorylated and inactivated. On the other hand, to demonstrate that PP1 dephosphorylates SPAK in addition to dephosphorylating the cotransporter, we needed to use a protein that scaffolded both PP1 and SPAK, which is different from the protein that reports the functional effects of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. To this end, we co-expressed AATYK1 with wild-type SPAK or constitutively active SPAK. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that ex"
https://openalex.org/W2051620804,"Lipoxygenases are enzymes that are found ubiquitously in higher animals and plants, but have only recently been identified in a number of bacteria. The genome of the diazotrophic unicellular cyanobacterium Cyanothece sp. harbors two genes with homology to lipoxygenases. Here we describe the isolation of one gene, formerly named csplox2. It was cloned, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The purified enzyme belongs to the group of prokaryotic mini lipoxygenases, because it had a molecular mass of 65 kDa. Interestingly, it catalyzed the conversion of linoleic acid, the only endogenously found polyunsaturated fatty acid, primarily to the bisallylic hydroperoxide 11R-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid. This product had previously only been described for the manganese lipoxygenase from the take all fungus, Gaeumannomyces graminis. By contrast, CspLOX2 was shown to be an iron lipoxygenase. In addition, CspLOX2 formed a mixture of typical conjugated lipoxygenase products, e.g. 9R- and 13S-hydroperoxide. The conversion of linoleic acid took place with a maximum reaction rate of 31 s−1. Incubation of the enzyme with [(11S)-2H]linoleic acid led to the formation of hydroperoxides that had lost the deuterium label, thus suggesting that CspLOX2 catalyzes antarafacial oxygenation as opposed to the mechanism of manganese lipoxygenase. CspLOX2 could also oxidize diarachidonylglycerophosphatidylcholine with similar specificity as the free fatty acid, indicating that binding of the substrate takes place with a “tail-first” orientation. We conclude that CspLOX2 is a novel iron mini-lipoxygenase that catalyzes the formation of bisallylic hydroperoxide as the major product."
https://openalex.org/W2059006070,"Drug medications inevitably affect not only their intended protein targets but also other proteins as well. In this study we examined the hypothesis that drugs that share the same therapeutic effect also share a common therapeutic mechanism by targeting not only known drug targets, but also by interacting unexpectedly on the same cryptic targets. By constructing and mining an Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug-oriented chemical-protein interactome (CPI) using a matrix of 10 drug molecules known to treat AD towards 401 human protein pockets, we found that such cryptic targets exist. We recovered from CPI the only validated therapeutic target of AD, acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), and highlighted several other putative targets. For example, we discovered that estrogen receptor (ER) and histone deacetylase (HDAC), which have recently been identified as two new therapeutic targets of AD, might already have been targeted by the marketed AD drugs. We further established that the CPI profile of a drug can reflect its interacting character towards multi-protein sets, and that drugs with the same therapeutic attribute will share a similar interacting profile. These findings indicate that the CPI could represent the landscape of chemical-protein interactions and uncover “behind-the-scenes” aspects of the therapeutic mechanisms of existing drugs, providing testable hypotheses of the key nodes for network pharmacology or brand new drug targets for one-target pharmacology paradigm."
https://openalex.org/W2131273556,"The serum response factor (SRF) is a key regulator of neural development and cellular plasticity, which enables it to act as a regulator of long-term adaptations in neurons. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SRF function in the murine dopamine system. We found that loss of SRF in dopaminoceptive, but not dopaminergic, neurons is responsible for the development of a hyperactivity syndrome, characterized by reduced body weight into adulthood, enhanced motor activity, and deficits in habituation processes. Most important, the hyperactivity also develops when the ablation of SRF is induced in adult animals. On the molecular level, the loss of SRF in dopaminoceptive cells is associated with altered expression of neuronal plasticity-related genes, in particular transcripts involved in calcium ion binding, formation of the cytoskeleton, and transcripts encoding neuropeptide precursors. Furthermore, abrogation of SRF causes specific deficits in activity-dependent transcription, especially a complete lack of psychostimulant-induced expression of the Egr genes. We inferred that alterations in SRF-dependent gene expression underlie the observed hyperactive behavior. Thus, SRF depletion in dopaminoceptive neurons might trigger molecular mechanisms responsible for development of psychopathological conditions involving hyperactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1989193623,"Background The demand for inpatient medical services increases during influenza season. A scoring system capable of identifying influenza patients at low risk death or ICU admission could help clinicians make hospital admission decisions. Methods Hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed influenza were identified over 3 influenza seasons at 25 Ontario hospitals. Each patient was assigned a score for 6 pneumonia severity and 2 sepsis scores using the first data available following their registration in the emergency room. In-hospital mortality and ICU admission were the outcomes. Score performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the sensitivity and specificity for identifying low risk patients (risk of outcome <5%). Results The cohort consisted of 607 adult patients. Mean age was 76 years, 12% of patients died (71/607) and 9% required ICU care (55/607). None of the scores examined demonstrated good discriminatory ability (AUC≥0.80). The Pneumonia Severity Index (AUC 0.78, 95% CI 0.72–0.83) and the Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis score (AUC 0.77, 95% 0.71–0.83) demonstrated fair predictive ability (AUC≥0.70) for in-hospital mortality. The best predictor of ICU admission was SMART-COP (AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.67–0.79). All other scores were poor predictors (AUC <0.70) of either outcome. If patients classified as low risk for in-hospital mortality using the PSI were discharged, 35% of admissions would have been avoided. Conclusions None of the scores studied were good predictors of in-hospital mortality or ICU admission. The PSI and MEDS score were fair predictors of death and if these results are validated, their use could reduce influenza admission rates significantly."

Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs), such as Daam1 and mDia1, play central roles in actin dynamics through assembling linear actin filaments. It has been reported that the GTP-bound active Rho binds directly to DRFs and partially unleashes the intramolecular autoinhibition of DRFs. However, whether proteins other than Rho involve the regulation of the actin assembly activity of DRFs has been unclear. Here, we show that Flightless-I (Fli-I), a gelsolin family protein essential for early development, binds directly to Daam1 and mDia1. Fli-I enhances the intrinsic actin assembly activity of Daam1 and mDia1 in vitro and is required for Daam1-induced actin assembly in living cells. Furthermore, Fli-I promotes the GTP-bound active Rho-mediated relief of the autoinhibition of Daam1 and mDia1.

The actin assembly activity of a group of formins is under control of Rho family GTPases, and they are classified as diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) (10Alberts A.S. Curr.

Daam1 (Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 1) and mDia1 (mammalian Diaphanous homolog 1, which is also known as DIA1, DIAP1, DFNA1, and DRF1) are members of the DRFs (10Alberts A.S.

The cDNA encoding human Flightless-I (Fli-I) was obtained by PCR using Marathon-Ready human bone marrow cDNA (Clontech) as a template. The cDNAs encoding Fli-I fragments (LRR, aa 1–460; G1–3, aa 461–869; G4–6, aa 869–1269; and G1–6, aa 461–1269) (Fig. 2C) were obtained by PCR using full-length Fli-I as a template. For knockdown studies, two different siRNAs against mouse Fli-I (#159473 and #76439, designated as #1 and #2, respectively) and control siRNA were provided by Ambion. Full-length Fli-I, which is insensitive to siRNA against mouse Fli-I, was produced by PCR using human Fli-I as a template. Nucleotide substitutions that do not change the amino acid sequence were introduced at the #1 and #2 siRNA target sites, respectively. The cDNAs encoding human cytosolic gelsolin (Gsn) fragments (G1–3, aa 1–357; G4–6, aa 358–730) were obtained by PCR using Marathon-Ready human bone marrow cDNA (Clontech) as a template. All the sequences of the PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression in mammalian cells, Daam1 CT fragments were subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). For generation of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused proteins, gene fragments were subcloned into pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare). For generation of His6-tagged proteins, Daam1 NT, Daam1 CT, mDia1 NT, and mDia1 CT were subcloned into pDEST17 (Invitrogen), and Fli-I and Gsn fragments were subcloned into pRSET1A (Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins of Daam1 CT and mDia1 CT were expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen), and the other proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen). The proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for GST-fused proteins or with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for His6-tagged proteins according to the manufacturers' instructions. His6-Fli-I was further purified by Mono S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) chromatography equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The preparation of GppNHp (a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog)- or GDP-bound form of RhoA was described previously (16Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer A, stored at 4 °C, and used within 14 days after dialysis. The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) or from the intensity of protein bands of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Reagents used in this study were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Anti-Fli-I rabbit polyclonal antibody used for immunodepletion was obtained by immunizing a rabbit with Fli-I G1–6. Anti-Fli-I (116.40) mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) used for immunoblotting was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-actin (Ab-5), anti-His6 (HIS-1), anti-GFP (7.1 and 13.1), and anti-tubulin (DM-14) mouse mAbs used for immunoblotting were from BD Transduction Laboratories, Sigma, Roche Applied Science, and Seikagaku Corp., respectively. Anti-hemagglutinin (3F10) rat mAb used for immunoblotting was from Roche Applied Science. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG donkey polyclonal antibody (GE Healthcare) and anti-mouse IgG sheep polyclonal antibody (GE Healthcare) were used as secondary antibodies in the immunoblot analysis visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence method (GE Healthcare). Alexa-546-conjugated phalloidin used for fluorescence microscopy was from Invitrogen. A platelet pellet (10 g) was sonicated in buffer A containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After extensive dialysis against buffer A, the solution was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was filtrated twice with a 0.45-μm disc filter (Millipore) and used as platelet cytosol. Glutathione-Sepharose coated with 200 μg of GST-Daam1 CT WT or L1040A was incubated with 20 ml of platelet cytosol (4 mg of proteins/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed five times with buffer A. Bead-associated proteins were eluted with Laemmli SDS sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar) and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were excised from the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described previously (11Higashi T. Ikeda T. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Kawato M.

The pyrene-actin assembly assay was performed as described previously (7Yamashita M. Higashi T. Suetsugu S. Sato Y. Ikeda T. Shirakawa R. Kita T. Takenawa T. Horiuchi H. Fukai S. Nureki O. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, purified and gel-filtrated actin (5% pyrene-labeled, 2 μm) was assembled in the presence of the indicated proteins, and the fluorescence intensity was monitored. The cytoplasmic actin assembly assay was also described previously (11Higashi T. Ikeda T. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Kawato M. Horiguchi M. Okuda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J.

Briefly, glutathione-Sepharose coated with GST fusion protein was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with platelet cytosol and ATP in the absence or presence of purified Fli-I. The beads were washed and fixed with 4% formaldehyde at 4 °C for 5 min, and the assembled actin on the beads was stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Invitrogen). The fluorescence intensity of the beads was measured using an Arvo SX 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Glutathione beads coated with GST fusion protein were incubated with His6-tagged protein(s) in buffer A containing 4% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with buffer A, and bead-associated proteins were analyzed by immunoblot using anti-His6 antibody. Protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science) beads were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with anti-Fli-I rabbit antiserum or preimmune serum and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were then incubated with 500 μl of platelet cytosol at 4 °C for 2 h and removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated twice with antibody-bound beads. The resultant Fli-I-depleted cytosol and preimmune IgG-treated cytosol were examined by immunoblot analysis using anti-Fli-I mouse mAb and used for the cytoplasmic actin assembly assay. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For observation of Daam1 CT-induced stress fibers, cells were seeded at the density of 3.0 × 104 cells/ml on the coverslips. After 2 days, cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1 Daam1 CT WT, pEGFP-C1 Daam1 CT L1040A, or pEGFP vectors using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen) with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were cultured for 20 h in the low serum medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. The cells were then fixed with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and stained with Alexa-568-conjugated phalloidin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Alternatively, cells were lysed with Laemmli SDS sample buffer (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. For knockdown studies, cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the forward transfection method of the manufacturer's instructions for 28 h, and then cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1 Daam1 CT. Cells were cultured in 0.5% fetal calf serum medium for 20 h and were processed for the fluorescence microscopy analysis and the immunoblotting analysis. We previously established an in vitro cytoplasmic actin assembly assay to evaluate the actin assembly activity of FH1-FH2 domains of DRF in a cytoplasmic environment (11Higashi T. Ikeda T. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Kawato M. Horiguchi M. Okuda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8746-8755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, beads coated with recombinant carboxyl-terminal protein fragments of Daam1 (Daam1 CT) (Fig. 1B), which harbors FH1-FH2 domains and the DAD segment, are incubated with crude cytosol as a source of monomeric actin, and the assembled actin filaments on beads are quantified by rhodamine-phalloidin staining. Using this assay, we attempted to characterize the contribution of DAD segment to the actin assembly activity of FH1-FH2 domains. The DAD segment contains several residues conserved among DRFs (Fig. 1A). We introduced a single amino acid substitution to Leu-1040 or Phe-1046 of Daam1 CT and examined the actin assembly activity of these mutants in the cytoplasmic actin assembly assay (Fig. 1C). The L1040A mutation diminished the actin assembly activity, whereas another mutant F1046A exhibited an actin assembly activity comparable with wild type. Because the actin assembly in the cytoplasmic actin assembly assay requires the nucleation activity of formin CT protein (11Higashi T. Ikeda T. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Kawato M. Horiguchi M. Okuda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8746-8755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we tested the actin nucleation activity of Daam1 CT L1040A protein in the pyrene-actin assembly assay. Interestingly, the actin nucleation activity of Daam1 CT L1040A is indistinguishable from that of Daam1 CT WT or F1046A (Fig. 1D). Therefore, Daam1 L1040A mutant cannot assemble the actin filaments efficiently in the cytoplasmic environment, although it has the actin nucleation activity similar to that of the WT protein in the purified actin. These results suggest that some kind of cytosolic factor(s) may bind to Daam1 through the conserved leucine residue in the DAD segments and may assist Daam1 to assemble the actin filaments in the cytoplasmic environment. To identify this factor, we performed affinity chromatography with platelet cytosol using Daam1 CT WT and Daam1 CT L1040A as baits. GST-Daam1 CT WT- and GST-Daam1 CT L1040A-coated beads were incubated with platelet cytosol, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. By comparison of Daam1 CT WT-bound and Daam1 CT L1040A-bound proteins, a 145-kDa protein was specifically identified as a Daam1 CT WT-binding protein (Fig. 2A). MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed that this protein was human Flightless-I homolog (Fli-I). This identification was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-Fli-I mAb. Fli-I was detected clearly in the eluate of Daam1 CT WT but faintly in the eluate of Daam1 CT L1040A (Fig. 2B). Fli-I is a conserved member of the gelsolin family. Fli-I was originally identified in Drosophila as a gene located in the locus that causes the degeneration of indirect flight muscle, which results in the “flightless” phenotype (19Campbell H.D. Schimansky T. Claudianos C. Ozsarac N. Kasprzak A.B. Cotsell J.N. Young I.G. de Couet H.G. Miklos G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Fli-I-deficient nematode, fruit fly, and mouse exhibit the lethal phenotype in the very early embryonic development (21Deng H. Xia D. Fang B. Zhang H. Genetics. 2007; 177: 847-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Campbell H.D. Fountain S. McLennan I.S. Berven L.A. Crouch M.F. Davy D.A. Hooper J.A. Waterford K. Chen K.S. Lupski J.R.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 263-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that Fli-I plays an essential role in the early developmental processes of metazoans. Next, we attempted to determine the Daam1-binding region of Fli-I. Fli-I has 16 leucine-rich repeats at the amino terminus and 6 gelsolin motifs at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2C). We generated and purified several recombinant proteins corresponding to Fli-I fragments (Fig. 2C) and determined whether these fragments can bind to Daam1 CT in vitro. Fli-I G4–6 specifically interacted with Daam1 CT, whereas Fli-I LRR or Fli-I G1–3 did not bind to Daam1 CT (Fig. 2D). Because Fli-I belongs to the gelsolin family and the G4–6 region of Fli-I has 41% homology (18% identity) with the corresponding G4–6 region of Gsn (Fig. 2C), we evaluated whether Gsn can interact with Daam1. Neither Gsn G1–3 nor Gsn G4–6 bound to Daam1 CT (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, Daam1 CT L1040A mutant exhibited lower affinity for Fli-I G4–6 compared with the wild type proteins (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that Fli-I directly binds to the DAD segment of Daam1 through its G4–6 region. To evaluate whether Fli-I regulates the actin assembly activity of DRF, we first prepared cytosol from which Fli-I was completely immunodepleted (Fig. 3A). Then we examined the Daam1 CT-induced actin assembly in the Fli-I-depleted cytosol. Daam1 CT lost half of the actin assembly activity in the Fli-I-depleted cytosol compared with that of the control IgG-treated cytosol (Fig. 3C). The addition of recombinant Fli-I (Fig. 3B) restored the Daam1 CT-induced actin assembly in Fli-I-depleted cytosol (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that Fli-I enhances the Daam1 CT-induced actin assembly. Next, we evaluated whether Fli-I is involved in the formin-induced actin assembly in living cells. It has been reported that the exogenous expression of Daam1 CT induces a stress fiber formation in HeLa cells (24Habas R. Kato Y. He X. Cell. 2001; 107: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The overexpression of GFP-tagged Daam1 CT WT induced the formation of stress fiber-like filaments in serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells, whereas GFP alone did not (Fig. 4, A and B). In GFP-Daam1 CT L1040A-expressing cells, such stress fiber formation was scarcely induced compared with Daam1 CT WT (Fig. 4, A and B), which suggests that the Fli-I binding is required for Daam1 CT to exert its actin assembly activity in cells. We further examined the significance of Fli-I using a gene knock-down technique. Transfection of two different siRNAs against Fli-I (#1 and #2) almost completely reduced the Fli-I expression level in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 5A). Daam1 CT-induced stress fiber formation was significantly reduced in the Fli-I siRNA #1- and #2-treated cells but not in the control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5B). Co-expression of siRNA-insensitive human Fli-I with Daam1 CT restored the stress fiber formation in the Fli-I knocked down cells (Fig. 5, A and B). The co-expression of Fli-I and GFP alone did not induce the actin stress fiber formation in the NIH 3T3 cells (supplemental Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that Fli-I is essential for Daam1 FH1-FH2 domains to assemble actin filaments in living cells. Although the activation of DRF is mediated by the binding of GTP-bound active Rho to the GBD domain, GTP-RhoA binding alone is insufficient for the full recovery of the actin assembly activity of DRF CT in the presence of DRF NT in vitro (12Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 15Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, some additional factor(s) other than GTP-Rho is (are) supposed to be required for full DRF activation (1Faix J. Grosse R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 342-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr.

It has been proposed that the activation of DRF is specifically mediated by the dissociation of the DID domain from the DAD segment. Because Fli-I binds to DRF through the DAD segment, it is conceivable that Fli-I is involved in the relief of DID-DAD autoinhibitory interaction by Rho GTPase. To evaluate this possibility, we first examined whether Fli-I competes with the DID domain in the DAD segment binding. Daam1 NT containing the DID domain inhibited the binding of Fli-I to Daam1 DAD in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that Fli-I and the DID domain cannot bind to the DAD segment simultaneously. Although RhoA G14V, a GTP-bound state-locked mutant, alone could dissociate Daam1 NT from Daam1 DAD, the full disruption of the DID-DAD interaction required high concentrations (2.5 μm) of RhoA G14V in vitro (Fig. 6B). In the presence of RhoA G14V at low concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 μm), we detected only slight disruption of DID-DAD interaction (Fig. 6B). However, the addition of Fli-I concentration-dependently promoted the dissociation of Daam1 NT from Daam1 DAD in the presence of 0.1 μm RhoA G14V (Fig. 6C). Because Fli-I alone hardly displaced Daam1 NT from Daam1 DAD segment (Fig. 6C), the stimulatory effect of Fli-I on the DID-DAD dissociation is dependent on the presence of GTP-Rho. Next, we evaluated whether Fli-I actually facilitates GTP-Rho-mediated actin assembly by DRFs. In the pyrene-actin assembly assay, Daam1 CT nucleated actin assembly (Fig. 6D). This activity was almost totally inhibited by the addition of Daam1 NT, and the inhibition was partially relieved by the addition of GTP-RhoA, as shown previously (12Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 15Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6986-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The addition of Fli-I G4–6 together with RhoA G14V resulted in increased liberation of the actin assembly activity of Daam1 CT suppressed by Daam1 NT (Fig. 6D), whereas Fli-I G4–6 alone had no actin assembly activity. Thus, Fli-I serves as a stimulatory factor of Rho-mediated activation of DRFs. Finally, we evaluated whether the regulatory mechanism of Daam1 by Fli-I is conserved in other DRFs. mDia1 is closely related to Daam1 and has a domain structure similar to that of Daam1 (Fig. 1B). We generated a carboxyl-terminal fragment protein of mDia1 (mDia1 CT) harboring L1197A mutation, which corresponds to L1040A mutation in Daam1, and we evaluated its actin assembly activity in the cytoplasmic actin assembly assay. mDia1 L1197A exhibited reduced actin assembly activity compared with mDia1 CT WT or F1203A, which corresponds to F1046A in Daam1 (Fig. 7A). The actin nucleation activity of mDia1 CT L1197A was comparable with mDia1 CT WT or F1203A in the pyrene-actin assembly assay (supplemental Fig. 1A). mDia1 CT interacted directly with Fli-I G4–6 region (Fig. 7B) dependent on the Leu-1197 residue (supplemental Fig. 1B). The immunodepletion of Fli-I from the cytosol reduced the actin assembly activity of mDia1 CT in the cytoplasmic actin assembly assay, and the activity was rescued by the addition of recombinant Fli-I (Fig. 7C). As observed for Daam1, mDia1 NT competes with Fli-I on the binding to mDia1 DAD (supplemental Fig. 1C). Although a relatively higher concentration of RhoA G14V (0.5 μm) was required for the disruption of the DID-DAD interaction of mDia1 in the absence of Fli-I (Fig. 7D), a lower concentration of RhoA G14V (0.1 μm) induced the DID-DAD dissociation in the presence of Fli-I (Fig. 7E). Finally, the addition of Fli-I G4–6 enhanced the Rho-mediated activation of the actin nucleation activity of mDia1 CT in the presence of mDia1 NT in the pyrene-actin assembly assay (Fig. 7F). These results suggest that Fli-I binds to mDia1 through the G4–6 region and that Fli-I assists GTP-Rho to release the actin assembly activity of mDia1 by disrupting the autoinhibitory interaction of mDia1. Thus, Fli-I is a common regulator of two DRF members, Daam1 and mDia1. Here, we identified Fli-I as a DRF (Daam1 or mDia1)-binding protein. We then demonstrated that Fli-I has dual functions on the DRF-mediated actin assembly as follows: 1) to assist GTP-Rho to activate DRFs by disrupting the inhibitory interaction between DID and DAD, and 2) to elevate the actin assembly activity of DRF FH1-FH2 domains regardless of DRF regulation by GTP-Rho. Based on the results presented here, we propose a model for the regulatory mechanism of DRF-mediated actin assembly as follows (Fig. 8). 1) Without GTP-Rho, DRF is kept inactive by the intramolecular DID-DAD interaction. 2) Upon binding of GTP-Rho to the GBD domain, the DID-DAD interaction becomes partially perturbed. 3) Subsequent Fli-I binding to the DAD segment competitively accelerates the dissociation of the DID domain from the DAD segment. 4) The disruption of DID-DAD interaction results in the exposure of the FH1-FH2 domains. 5) The FH1-FH2 domains assemble the actin filaments in cooperation with Fli-I bound to the DAD segment. 6) When Rho is inactivated by GTP hydrolysis, GDP-Rho dissociates from the GBD domain, and Fli-I is released from the DAD segment, which leads to inactivation of DRF by reassociation of the DID domain and the DAD segment. For simplicity, the DRF is shown as a monomer in Fig. 8, although DRF is thought to form dimer or multimer. It was believed that a putative factor is required for the GTP-Rho-mediated full activation of DRF (1Faix J. Grosse R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem.

In our previous study, we showed that GTP-RhoA, -B, and -C can fully relieve the autoinhibition of Daam1 and mDia1 in the cytoplasmic environment using the cytoplasmic actin assembly assay (11Higashi T. Ikeda T. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Kawato M. Horiguchi M. Okuda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8746-8755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which suggested that the cytosol contains the putative factor required for the full activation of DRF. In this study, we demonstrated that the cytosolic factor Fli-I displaces the DID domain from the DAD segment in the presence of GTP-Rho. Displacement of the DID domain from the DAD segment leads to the assembly of actin by FH1-FH2 domains. Taken together, Fli-I is likely to be the putative missing factor for the Rho-mediated activation of DRFs. Fli-I not only enhances the DID-DAD dissociation, but also reinforces the actin assembly activity of the FH1-FH2 domain (Fig. 1C, Fig. 3C, Fig. 4, and Fig. 7, A and C). Because Fli-I can bind both globular actin and F-actin (26Goshima M. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Okada T. Shibatohge M. Shima F. Fujimoto E. Kataoka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Fli-I would support the actin assembly activity of DRF by holding the preformed F-actin or by recruiting globular actin. In the budding yeast, a formin protein Bni1p assembles the actin cables and promotes cytokinesis (5Sagot I. Rodal A.A. Moseley J. Goode B.L. Pellman D. Nat.

Chem. 2005; 280: 28023-28033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because the metazoan genomes do not contain a Bud6p homolog, Fli-I could be functionally equivalent to Bud6p in metazoans, although they share no homology in their primary structures (8Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 25Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 593-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Because the Fli-I-binding sequence is conserved in human Daam1, Daam2, mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3, Drosophila Daam and Diaphanous, and Caenorhabditis elegans Daam (F56E10.2) (Fig. 1A), the regulatory mechanism of these DRFs by Fli-I is probably conserved throughout the metazoan evolution. Indeed, the loss of either Fli-I or Diaphanous in Drosophila caused similar defects in actin distribution during the cellularization process (23Straub K.L. Stella M.C. Leptin M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 263-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Afshar K. Stuart B. Wasserman S.A. Development. 2000; 127: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that Diaphanous and Fli-I function cooperatively in the early developmental stage of Drosophila. Despite the importance of Daam proteins in development, the molecular mechanisms involved in Daam proteins have not been well understood (32Liu R. Linardopoulou E.V. Osborn G.E. Parkhurst S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Daam1 was originally identified as a binding protein of Dishevelled, a Frizzled (Wnt receptor)-binding protein (24Habas R. Kato Y. He X. Cell. 2001; 107: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and Daam1 binding to Dishevelled activates Rho through its putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which results in the signal transduction of planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in Xenopus (24Habas R. Kato Y. He X. Cell. 2001; 107: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 33Liu W. Sato A. Khadka D. Bharti R. Diaz H. Runnels L.W. Habas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in Drosophila, DAAM interacts genetically with Rho1 (34Matusek T. Djiane A. Jankovics F. Brunner D. Mlodzik M. Mihály J. Development. 2006; 133: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and loss-of-function analysis of DAAM in the wing and compound eye, which are conventional PCP organization model tissues, revealed that DAAM is not involved in the PCP signaling (34Matusek T. Djiane A. Jankovics F. Brunner D. Mlodzik M. Mihály J. Development. 2006; 133: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our previous study (11Higashi T. Ikeda T. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Kawato M. Horiguchi M. Okuda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 8746-8755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and present results show that Daam1 as well as mDia1 are the direct Rho effector molecules, which mediate the actin assembly using Fli-I as a common cofactor. Taken together, vertebrate Daam1 might be a dual functional protein that is a PCP regulator and a Rho effector, whereas the Drosophila DAAM is principally a Rho effector. Further analysis of the relationship of Rho and Daam in the vertebrate PCP signaling would be necessary. In summary, we have demonstrated that Fli-I helps GTP-Rho to activate the FH1-FH2-mediated actin assembly by competitively promoting the disruption of the inhibitory interaction between the DID domain and DAD segment of DRFs. Furthermore, Fli-I enhances the actin assembly activity of DRF in vitro and in living cells through direct binding to the DAD segment of DRF. Therefore, Fli-I is an important co-factor for the mammalian formin proteins, Daam1 and mDia1. We are grateful to the Kyoto Red Cross Blood Center for providing platelet pellets.

https://openalex.org/W2062251007,"In children born prematurely and those surviving cerebral ischemia there are white matter abnormalities that correlate with neurological dysfunction. Since this injury occurs in the immature brain, when the majority of subventricular zone (SVZ) cells generate white matter oligodendrocytes, we sought to study the effect this injury has on gliogenesis from the SVZ. We hypothesized that there is aberrant glial cell generation from the SVZ after neonatal hypoxia ischemia (H/I) that contributes to an increased astrogliogenesis with concomitant oligodendroglial insufficiency. Mechanistically we hypothesized that an increase in specific locally produced cytokines during recovery from injury were modifying the differentiation of glial progenitors towards astrocytes at the expense of the more developmentally-appropriate oligodendrocytes.For these studies we used the Vannucci H/I rat model where P6 rats are subjected to unilateral common carotid ligation followed by 75 min of systemic hypoxia. Retroviral lineage tracing studies combined with morphological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed the preferential generation of SVZ-derived white matter astrocytes instead of oligodendrocytes post hypoxia/ischemia. Microarray and QRT-PCR analyses of the damaged SVZ showed increased expression of several cytokines and receptors that are known to promote astrocyte differentiation, such as EGF, LIF and TGFbeta1 signaling components. Using gliospheres to model the neonatal SVZ, we evaluated the effects of these cytokines on signal transduction pathways regulating astrocyte generation, proliferation and differentiation. These studies demonstrated that combinations of EGF, LIF and TGFbeta1 reconstituted the increased astrogliogenesis. TGFbeta1-induced Smad 2/3 phosphorylation and the combination of EGF, LIF and TGFbeta1 synergistically increased STAT3 phosphorylation over single or double cytokine combinations. Pharmacologically inhibiting ALK5 signaling in vitro antagonized the TGFbeta1-induced increase in astrocyte generation and antagonizing ALK5 signaling in vivo similarly inhibited astrogliogenesis within the SVZ during recovery from H/I.Altogether, these data indicate that there is aberrant specification of glial precursors within the neonatal SVZ during recovery from neonatal H/I that is a consequence of altered cytokine signaling. Our studies further suggest that antagonizing the ALK5 receptor will restore the normal pattern of cell differentiation after injury to the immature brain."

We investigated whether the lipid composition of the membrane affects the function and structure of HorA, a bacterial ABC multidrug transporter. When the transporter was reconstituted in a bilayer where phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the main lipid of the bacterial membrane, was replaced with phosphatidylcholine (PC), ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport became uncoupled. Although ATPase activity was maintained, HorA lost its ability to extrude the prototypical substrate Hoechst33342. Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) revealed that, although the secondary structure of the protein was unaffected, the orientation of the transmembrane helices (TM) was modified by the change in lipid composition.

This was supported by hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies showing increased protection of the backbone from the solvent in PC-containing liposomes. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance was used to further probe the structural change. In the PC-containing liposomes we observed increased mobility of the spin label in TM4, along with increased exposure to molecular oxygen, used as a hydrophobic quencher.

https://openalex.org/W2087636959,"Background Molecular epidemiological definitions that are based on staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and phylogenetic analysis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates are considered a reliable way to distinguish between healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). However, there is little information regarding the clinical features and outcomes of bacteremia patients with MRSA carrying different SCCmec types. Methods From January 1 through December 31, 2006, we recorded the demographic data and outcomes of 159 consecutive adult MRSA bacteremia patients from whom isolates for SCCmec analysis were collected. All participants were patients at a tertiary care center in Taiwan. Principal Findings The following SCCmec types were identified in MRSA isolates: 30 SCCmec II (18.9%), 87 SCCmec III (54.7%), 22 SCCmec IV (13.8%), and 20 SCCmec V (12.6%). The time from admission to the first MRSA-positive blood culture for patients infected with isolates with the SCCmec III element (mean/median, 50.7/26 days) was significantly longer than for patients infected with isolates carrying SCCmec IV or V (mean/median, 6.7/3 days for SCCmec IV; 11.1/10.5 days for SCCmec V) (P<0.05). In univariate analysis, community onset, soft tissue infection, and deep-seated infection were predictors for SCCmec IV/V. In multivariate analysis, length of stay before index culture, diabetes mellitus, and being bedridden were independent risk factors associated with SCCmec II/III. Conclusions These findings are in agreement with previous studies of the genetic characteristics of CA-MRSA. MRSA bacteremia with SCCmec II/III isolates occurred more among patients with serious comorbidities and prolonged hospitalization. Community onset, skin and soft tissue infection, and deep-seated infection best predicted SCCmec IV/V MRSA bacteremia."
https://openalex.org/W2064048288,"The envelope of HSV-1 contains a number of glycoproteins, four of which are essential for virus entry. Virus particles lacking gB, gD, gH or gL are entry-defective, although these viruses retain the ability to bind to the plasma membrane via the remaining glycoproteins. Soluble forms of gD have been shown to trigger the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcriptional complex in addition to stimulating the production of Type I interferon. By taking advantage of the entry-defective phenotype of glycoprotein-deficient HSV-1 virus particles, the results presented here show that binding of virions to cellular receptors on the plasma membrane is sufficient to stimulate a change in cellular gene expression. Preliminary microarray studies, validated by quantitative real-time PCR, identified the differential expression of cellular genes associated with the NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat and related Jak/Src pathways by virions lacking gB or gH but not gD. Gene induction occurred at a few particles per cell, corresponding to physiological conditions during primary infection. Reporter assay studies determined that NF-κB transcriptional activity is stimulated within an hour of HSV-1 binding, peaks between two and three hours post-binding and declines to background levels by five hours after induction. The immediate, transient nature of these signalling events suggests that HSV-1 glycoproteins, particularly gD, may alter the cellular environment pre-entry so as to condition the cell for viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W2147506641,"Impairment in blood-to-brain transport of leptin is a major cause as well as consequence of obesity. Leptin crosses the blood-brain barrier by transcytosis rather than undergoing intracellular degradation. Results from previous studies have indicated that the membrane juxtapositional cytoplasmic sequence of the leptin receptor ObR is responsible for leptin transport. To identify the specific structural domains, we generated a series of ObR truncates with different lengths of the intracellular sequence, overexpressed them in 3 types of mammalian cells including cerebral endothelia, and quantified leptin binding and endocytosis. All mutant ObRs were able to bind and mediate the internalization of leptin. Surprisingly, ObR860, a construct with no cytoplasmic sequence, could act like the classical ObRa transporter in internalizing leptin. There were some cell type-dependent variations in the intracellular trafficking of Alexa-labeled leptin when mediated by ObR860 or ObRa because of differential involvement of membrane microdomains, as shown by use of the clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine and the dynamin inhibitor Dynasore. The clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis of leptin contrasts with the lack of effect of the caveolae inhibitors nystatin and filipin. Thus, leptin-induced internalization of the ligand-receptor complex can occur without specific sorting signals in the cytoplasmic region of ObR. This novel finding may have significant implications for leptin transport."

Recent vaccine trials utilizing Adenovirus based vaccines expressing HIV antigens confirmed induction of cellular immune responses, but these responses failed to prevent HIV infections in vaccinees. This illustrates the need to develop vaccine formulations capable of generating more potent T-cell responses to HIV antigens, such as HIV-Gag, since robust immune responses to this antigen correlate with improved outcomes in long-term non-progressor HIV infected individuals.In this study we designed a novel vaccine strategy utilizing an Ad-based vector expressing a potent TLR agonist derived from Eimeria tenella as an adjuvant to improve immune responses from a [E1-]Ad-based HIV-Gag vaccine. Our results confirm that expression of rEA elicits significantly increased TLR mediated innate immune responses as measured by the influx of plasma cytokines and chemokines, and activation of innate immune responding cells. Furthermore, our data show that the quantity and quality of HIV-Gag specific CD8(+) and CD8(-) T-cell responses were significantly improved when coupled with rEA expression. These responses also correlated with a significantly increased number of HIV-Gag derived epitopes being recognized by host T cells. Finally, functional assays confirmed that rEA expression significantly improved antigen specific CTL responses, in vivo. Moreover, we show that these improved responses were dependent upon improved TLR pathway interactions.The data presented in this study illustrate the potential utility of Ad-based vectors expressing TLR agonists to improve clinical outcomes dependent upon induction of robust, antigen specific immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2004929098,"Background Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Recently, selection of fully reprogrammed cells was achieved based on colony morphology reminiscent of embryonic stem (ES) cells. The maintenance of pluripotency was analysed. Methodology/Principal Findings Clonal murine iPS cell line TiB7-4, which was derived from adult fibroblasts, was analysed for maintenance of pluripotency. Colony morphology, expression of pluripotency factors and stage specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA1) were analysed by real time PCR and flow cytometry. We found the iPS cell line TiB7-4 and its subclones to be rather diverse and exhibiting a tendency towards spontaneous differentiation and loss of pluripotency independent of their initial colony morphology. In contrast an undifferentiated transcription factor 1 (UTF1) promoter-driven G418 (Neo) resistance significantly improved the quality of these iPS cells. After selection with UTF-Neo for two weeks iPS subclones could be stably maintained for at least 40 passages in culture and differentiate into all three germ layers. As control, a construct expressing G418 resistance under the control of the ubiquitously active SV40 early promoter formed subclones with different colony morphology. Some of these subclones could be cultured for at least 12 passages without loosing their pluripotency, but loss of pluripotency eventually occured in an unpredictable manner and was independent of the subclones' initial morphology and SSEA1 expression. A UTF-Neo-based selection of a whole population of TiB7-4 without further subcloning resulted in the generation of cultures with up to 99% SSEA1 positive cells under stringent selection conditions. Conclusions Our data indicate that temporary selection using a genetic UTF1-based system can generate homogenous pluripotent iPS cells that can be maintained without permanent selection pressure."

Although it is well recognized that Wnt signaling leads to β-catenin accumulation, the role of PAR1 in the process is unknown. We provide here evidence that PAR1 induces β-catenin stabilization independent of Wnt, Fz (Frizzled), and the co-receptor LRP5/6 (low density lipoprotein-related protein 5/6) and identify selective mediators of the PAR1-β-catenin axis. Immunohistological analyses of hPar1-transgenic (TG) mouse mammary tissues show the expression of both Gα12 and Gα13 compared with age-matched control counterparts. However, only Gα13 was found to be actively involved in PAR1-induced β-catenin stabilization. Indeed, a dominant negative form of Gα13 inhibited both PAR1-induced Matrigel invasion and Lef/Tcf (lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor) transcription activity. PAR1-Gα13 association is followed by the recruitment of DVL (Dishevelled), an upstream Wnt signaling protein via the DIX domain. Small interfering RNA-Dvl silencing leads to a reduction in PAR1-induced Matrigel invasion, inhibition of Lef/Tcf transcription activity, and decreased β-catenin accumulation. It is of note that PAR1 also promotes the binding of β-arrestin-2 to DVL, suggesting a role for β-arrestin-2 in PAR1-induced DVL phosphorylation dynamics. Although infection of small interfering RNA-LRP5/6 or the use of the Wnt antagonists, SFRP2 (soluble Frizzled-related protein 2) or SFRP5 potently reduced Wnt3A-mediated β-catenin accumulation, no effect was observed on PAR1-induced β-catenin stabilization.

IntroductionPAR1 (protease-activated receptor-1) is the first identified and prototype member of an established protease-activated receptor family. In addition to the traditional role of PAR1 in thrombosis, hemostasis, and vascular biology, its role in tumor biology is currently emerging (1Nierodzik M.L. Karpatkin S.

Gα12 and its sister family member, Gα13, are the only heterotrimeric G proteins that are capable of transforming fibroblasts when overexpressed in their wild-type (WT) form (8Chan A.M. Fleming T.P.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Gα12 is markedly up-regulated in adenocarcinoma of the breast and have identified Gα12 protein as an important regulator of breast and prostate cancer invasion (11Kelly P.

The Gα12 protein subunit also plays a role in disrupting cadherin-β-catenin interaction and in the down-regulation of the extracellular cell-cell adhesive function of cadherins (13Kaplan D.D.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5224-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the path connecting PAR1 to β-catenin is unknown. Here we set out to elucidate the molecular mechanism and identify selective partners that mediate this association. β-Catenin accumulation is a well established core process of the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt proteins are secreted glycoprotein ligands that bind to members of the Fz (Frizzled) class of heptahelical GPCR and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP5/6) (14Cong F. Schweizer L. Varmus H. Development. 2004; 131: 5103-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Liu G. Bafico A. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), known to regulate cell fate and play a central role in both embryonic development (16Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev.

The canonical Wnt signaling path has been shown to require Gαo and Gαq, which centrally regulate the stability of intracellular β-catenin (19Feigin M.E. Malbon C.C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Liu X. Rubin J.S. Kimmel A.R. Curr.

In the absence of Wnt signaling, a complex of proteins comprising the scaffold protein axin, the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor protein, GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β), and CKI (casein kinase I) assemble to comprise the destruction machinery of β-catenin. Once the complex is assembled, GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin that is now being tagged for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomal system (22Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 23Kikuchi A. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2006; 38: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Upon Wnt activation, the tagging is eliminated, and hence, β-catenin is no longer detected for degradation. Accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm further leads to its translocation to the nucleus, where it acts as a co-transcription factor with Lef/Tcf (lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor family) and activates wnt target genes downstream (22Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 23Kikuchi A. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2006; 38: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). DVL (Dishevelled) is an upstream Wnt signaling protein that mediates all known Wnt pathways, including the canonical, non-canonical, and planar cell polarity pathways (24Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2006; 72: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Wharton Jr., K.A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 26Wallingford J.B. Habas R.

High DVL1 protein expression is detected in breast and cervical squamous cell carcinoma as well as in prostate cancer (30Okino K. Nagai H. Hatta M. Nagahata T. Yoneyama K. Ohta Y. Jin E. Kawanami O.

Tumori. 2005; 91: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similarly, elicited levels of DVL3 have been demonstrated in malignant mesotheliomas and lung cancer (32Uematsu K. He B. You L.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4547-4551PubMed Google Scholar). DVL is composed of several structural domains: a DIX binding domain located at the N terminus, a PDZ domain in the midregion, and a DEP domain located about midway between the PDZ domain and the C terminus of DVL (34Boutros M. Mlodzik M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 35Strovel E.T. Sussman D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the DIX domain enables the dimerization of DVL with other members of the family as well as with axin (36Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the PDZ domain provides a docking site for the C terminus of Fz receptors (37Wong H.C. Bourdelas A. Krauss A. Lee H.J. Shao Y. Wu D. Mlodzik M. Shi D.L. Zheng J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1251-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The linker between DIX and PDZ provides an essential phosphorylation site for CKI (38Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The DEP domain regulates Rho GTPases in the planar polarity pathway (39Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and is also involved in Fz-induced translocation of DVL1 to the plasma membrane in the canonical pathway (40Pan W.J. Pang S.Z. Huang T. Guo H.Y. Wu D. Li L. Cell Res. 2004; 14: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Upon Wnt signaling, Fz, together with its co-receptor LRP5/6, recruits DVL via the PDZ domain, leaving the DIX domain free to bind axin-GSK3β proteins (41Zeng X. Huang H. Tamai K. Zhang X. Harada Y. Yokota C. Almeida K. Wang J. Doble B. Woodgett J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hsieh J.C. He X. Development. 2008; 135: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar).In the present study, we identified the selective involvement of Gα13 and DIX-DVL as mediators of PAR1-induced β-catenin stabilization. Our data point to a novel Gα13-DVL axis in cancer, independent (at least upstream of DVL) of Wnt-elicited β-catenin stabilization.DISCUSSIONIn the present paper, we identified a novel pathway of PAR1-induced β-catenin stabilization. Although both Gα12/13 G-protein family members are abundantly overexpressed in hPar1-TG mouse mammary glands as compared with age-matched WT counterparts, dissection between the family members demonstrates the selective functional involvement of activated Gα13. DVL, an upstream junction protein of Wnt signaling, is recruited to Gα13. Once associated with activated Gα13, DVL is dislocated from the cytoplasmic pools and becomes connected with the cell membrane compartment. DVL association with activated Gα13 is shown to be mediated specifically via the DIX domain. The fact that DVL binds to the activated form of Gα13 but not to the inactive form suggests a high affinity interaction of DIX-DVL with the GTP-bound form of Gα13 but not with Gα13-GDP. The critical contribution of the Gα13-DVL axis in PAR1-induced β-catenin stabilization and oncogenicity is highlighted by the potent inhibition of PAR1-induced Lef/Tcf transcription activity, abrogation of Matrigel invasion, and lack of PAR1-elicited β-catenin levels obtained in the presence of either a dominant negative form of Gα13 or siRNA-silenced DVL. PAR1-induced β-catenin stabilization takes place regardless of whether LRP5/6 co-receptors are knocked down or in the presence of the Wnt antagonists SFRP2 and -5. This specifies PAR1-stimulated β-catenin stabilization via the axis of Gα13-DVL. However, it still remains to be determined whether PAR1, a member of GPCR family, acts in an unknown manner to communicate with the Fz receptor via DVL as a mobile scaffold protein for β-catenin stabilization.Other GPCRs have been reported to stimulate β-catenin stabilization and proliferation of colon cancer cells. Most notable of these are the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors (e.g. LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3) (51Yang M. Zhong W.W. Srivastava N. Slavin A. Yang J. Hoey T. An S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and EP2 receptor activated by the cyclooxygenase (COX-2) proinflammatory metabolite prostaglandin E2 (52Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 53Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The LPA2 receptor couples to Gα12/13, and LPA3 couples to Gαq; both receptors function to trigger massive β-catenin stabilization and cell proliferation via protein kinase C. The signaling route of COX-2 and EP2 is suggested to involve PI3K and the protein kinase Akt, initiated by the direct association of Gαs with the “regulator of G-protein signaling” (RGS) domain of axin. Altogether, these pathways were shown to converge on the Wnt signaling route to induce cytoplasmic β-catenin accumulation, nuclear localization, and enhanced Lef/Tcf transcriptional activities.Each of the Gα12/13 subunits exhibits a different path. Knock-out of the Gα13 gene causes lethality in mouse embryos at midgestation, a phenotype that largely resembles that of the PAR1 knock-out mice (54Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gα12−/− mice appear viable and grow normally. In addition, during vascular development, a selective and critical role for Gα13 in endothelial cells has been demonstrated (55Ruppel K.M. Willison D. Kataoka H. Wang A. Zheng Y.W. Cornelissen I. Yin L. Xu S.M. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8281-8286Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that Gα13 plays a significant role in PAR1-induced developmental processes. It remains to be determined whether a similar role is played by Gα13 in PAR1-induced tumor biology. Here, we assign a prime function for Gα13 in PAR1-mediated β-catenin stabilization. Recent studies have underscored the role of Gα12 family signaling in both breast and prostate cancer progression (11Kelly P. Moeller B.J. Juneja J. Booden M.A. Der C.J. Daaka Y. Dewhirst M.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8173-8178Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12Kelly P. Stemmle L.N. Madden J.F. Fields T.A. Daaka Y. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26483-26490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found direct binding of DVL with activated Gα13. The distinct role of DVL is even more complex because DVL was recently found localized in the nucleus, acting along with the β-catenin Lef/Tcf transcription complex to trigger Wnt target gene expression (56Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Xi Y. Wu Z.L. Li Y.P. Li L. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 1087-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). DVL protein binds to the intracellular portion of the Fz transmembrane receptors as well as to axin. Although we found that PAR1 interacts via Gα13 and induces DVL1 membrane translocation, leading to β-catenin stabilization, recent studies in Drosophila revealed that Wnt signaling transduces its signals via Gαo. It was shown that the βγ subunits of Gαo bind and relocalize DVL to the plasma membrane, whereas the α-subunit of Gαo interacts with and recruits axin to the plasma membrane, leading to β-catenin stabilization (57Egger-Adam D. Katanaev V.L. Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 168-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Angers S. Thorpe C.J. Biechele T.L. Goldenberg S.J. Zheng N. MacCoss M.J. Moon R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although binding of DVL to the C-terminal portion of Fz is mediated via the PDZ domain (37Wong H.C. Bourdelas A. Krauss A. Lee H.J. Shao Y. Wu D. Mlodzik M. Shi D.L. Zheng J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1251-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), many other DVL functions are mediated via the DIX domain. The highly conserved DIX domain is located within the N-terminal region of DVL and is essential for its signaling activity (59Axelrod J.D. Miller J.R. Shulman J.M. Moon R.T. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2610-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only two other proteins contain a close relative of the DIX domain: axin, in its C-terminal domain, as well as a less well known protein, Ccd1, which is found exclusively in vertebrates (60Shiomi K. Uchida H. Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 61Luo W. Zou H. Jin L. Lin S. Li Q. Ye Z. Rui H. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5054-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). DVL has been shown to have a strong tendency to form self-associating protein assemblies in the cytoplasm that are visible as puncta and are mediated via the DIX domain. Overall, the DIX domain is well known to mediate oligomerization and binding to axin (36Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 62Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1162-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of DVL is another critical step in the regulation of DVL-mediated downstream signal transduction. The best studied serine/threonine kinases are casein kinase I ϵ and δ (CKI ϵ/δ). CKI ϵ/δ are positive regulators of the Wnt signaling pathway, phosphorylating DVL in response to Wnt signaling at the SXXS motif, located at sites 139 and 142 of DVL, respectively. In fact, this site is present beyond the DIX domain, residing within the linker region between the DIX and PDZ (e.g. the DIX domain resides between 10–94) (64Schwarz-Romond T. Fiedler M. Shibata N. Butler P.J. Kikuchi A. Higuchi Y. Bienz M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 65Schwarz-Romond T. Metcalfe C. Bienz M. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2402-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Whether activation of PAR1 leads to stimulation of the traditional Wnt-elicited kinases and/or others remains to be determined. We demonstrate that PAR1 activation causes DVL phosphorylation (Fig. 6c). It is therefore postulated that the activation of PAR1 stimulates DVL binding (to Gα13) and activation (e.g. serine phosphorylation). It was recently demonstrated that β-arrestin binds DVL in the vicinity of the CKI ϵ/δ phosphorylation sites following Wnt signaling. Indeed, inhibition of Wnt signaling by CKI inhibitors reduced the binding of β-arrestin to DVL and β-catenin stabilization (50Bryja V. Gradl D. Schambony A. Arenas E. Schulte G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6690-6695Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). β-Arrestins are known to regulate GPCR desensitization as well as signaling (49Reiter E. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 159-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of PAR1 is critical for its rapid termination, mediated most likely via GRK4 and GRK5 (GPCR kinases) (66Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 67Tiruppathi C. Yan W. Sandoval R. Naqvi T. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that PAR1 activation also promotes the association of β-arrestin-2 with DVL. We suggest that activation of PAR1 leads to receptor desensitization and internalization mediated via β-arrestin-1 (68Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas β-arrestin-2 is free to act as a signaling protein that associates with DVL to elicit β-catenin stabilization. It is postulated that β-arrestin identifies phosphorylated (primed) DVL and subsequently recruits other kinases for the completion of DVL activation and dynamics. In this regard, activation of PAR1 resembles DVL activation by Wnt3A stimulation. Furthermore, although we demonstrate that Wnt antagonist SFRPs do not impair PAR1-induced β-catenin stabilization, this does not exclude the possibility that there is cross-talk between GPCRs (e.g. Fz and PAR1) mediated by a junction-labile cytoplasmic protein. It is possible that PAR1-induced β-catenin levels converge with the traditional canonical Wnt pathway downstream of DVL.One should keep in mind that Wnts act through both Fz and LRP receptors to bring them into proximity (14Cong F. Schweizer L. Varmus H. Development. 2004; 131: 5103-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It is further believed that Wnt stimulates the β-catenin pathway by relocating axin to the plasma membrane, thereby inactivating its function as a tumor suppressor protein. It is still not clear whether Wnt-induced axin membrane translocation is a prerequisite for its dissociation from the β-catenin degradation complex. In addition, although we still have gaps in our understanding of the β-catenin stabilization pathway, it appears that two separate axes exist: the LRP-axin axis and the Fz-DVL phosphorylation axis. These two branches ultimately converge at a later stage, eventually resulting in β-catenin stabilization and nuclear translocation (69Cadigan K.M. Liu Y.I. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In the Wnt-induced Fz-LRP6 receptor complex, Fz recruits DVL through the PDZ domain, leaving the DVL-DIX domain accessible for further interactions. DVL-DIX then recruits the axin-GSK3β complex via oligomerization and puncta formation (64Schwarz-Romond T. Fiedler M. Shibata N. Butler P.J. Kikuchi A. Higuchi Y. Bienz M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), thus promoting GSK3β-induced LRP phosphorylation. Axin is therefore required for LRP6 phosphorylation and activation. Supporting evidence for the distinct routes of axin-LRP and Fz-DVL is provided by several studies showing that truncated LRP5/6 activates β-catenin independently of DVL (14Cong F. Schweizer L. Varmus H. Development. 2004; 131: 5103-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Liu G. Bafico A. Aaronson S.A. Mol.

This suggests that it can recruit axin to the plasma membrane independently of DVL. The relative role of the PAR1 Gα13-DVL axis in leading to β-catenin stabilization remains to be evaluated. Whether it can be bypassed via the axin-LRP path, shown to provide a route distinct from the Fz-DVL phosphorylation axis, is yet unknown.We demonstrated here a new pathway for DVL that associates via the DIX domain with Gα13, which is recruited to the C-terminal tail of PAR1. Overall, we propose an original Wnt-independent pathway for the PAR1-induced Gα13-DVL axis. This pathway provides new cellular targets central in cancer progression. IntroductionPAR1 (protease-activated receptor-1) is the first identified and prototype member of an established protease-activated receptor family. In addition to the traditional role of PAR1 in thrombosis, hemostasis, and vascular biology, its role in tumor biology is currently emerging (1Nierodzik M.L. Karpatkin S.

Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). Of the 16 Gα genes found in the mammalian genome, the Gα12 subfamily is of particular interest to cancer biologists. Gα12 and its sister family member, Gα13, are the only heterotrimeric G proteins that are capable of transforming fibroblasts when overexpressed in their wild-type (WT) form (8Chan A.M. Fleming T.P.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Gα12 is markedly up-regulated in adenocarcinoma of the breast and have identified Gα12 protein as an important regulator of breast and prostate cancer invasion (11Kelly P. Moeller B.J. Juneja J. Booden M.A. Der C.J. Daaka Y. Dewhirst M.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8173-8178Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12Kelly P.

The Gα12 protein subunit also plays a role in disrupting cadherin-β-catenin interaction and in the down-regulation of the extracellular cell-cell adhesive function of cadherins (13Kaplan D.D. Meigs T.E. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44037-44043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Although an association between PAR1 and β-catenin stabilization has been demonstrated (4Yin Y.J. Katz V. Salah Z. Maoz M. Cohen I. Uziely B. Turm H. Grisaru-Granovsky S. Suzuki H. Bar-Shavit R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5224-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the path connecting PAR1 to β-catenin is unknown. Here we set out to elucidate the molecular mechanism and identify selective partners that mediate this association. β-Catenin accumulation is a well established core process of the Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt proteins are secreted glycoprotein ligands that bind to members of the Fz (Frizzled) class of heptahelical GPCR and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP5/6) (14Cong F. Schweizer L. Varmus H. Development. 2004; 131: 5103-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 15Liu G. Bafico A. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), known to regulate cell fate and play a central role in both embryonic development (16Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4180) Google Scholar) and oncogenicity (17Bienz M. Clevers H.

The canonical Wnt signaling path has been shown to require Gαo and Gαq, which centrally regulate the stability of intracellular β-catenin (19Feigin M.E. Malbon C.C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Liu X. Rubin J.S. Kimmel A.R. Curr.

In the absence of Wnt signaling, a complex of proteins comprising the scaffold protein axin, the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor protein, GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β), and CKI (casein kinase I) assemble to comprise the destruction machinery of β-catenin. Once the complex is assembled, GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin that is now being tagged for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomal system (22Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 23Kikuchi A. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2006; 38: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Upon Wnt activation, the tagging is eliminated, and hence, β-catenin is no longer detected for degradation. Accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm further leads to its translocation to the nucleus, where it acts as a co-transcription factor with Lef/Tcf (lymphoid enhancer factor/T-cell factor family) and activates wnt target genes downstream (22Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 23Kikuchi A. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Exp. Mol. Med. 2006; 38: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). DVL (Dishevelled) is an upstream Wnt signaling protein that mediates all known Wnt pathways, including the canonical, non-canonical, and planar cell polarity pathways (24Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2006; 72: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Wharton Jr., K.A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 26Wallingford J.B. Habas R.

High DVL1 protein expression is detected in breast and cervical squamous cell carcinoma as well as in prostate cancer (30Okino K. Nagai H. Hatta M. Nagahata T. Yoneyama K. Ohta Y. Jin E. Kawanami O. Araki T. Emi M. Oncol. Rep. 2003; 10: 1219-1223PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mizutani K. Miyamoto S. Nagahata T. Konishi N. Emi M. Onda M. Tumori. 2005; 91: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similarly, elicited levels of DVL3 have been demonstrated in malignant mesotheliomas and lung cancer (32Uematsu K. He B. You L. Xu Z. McCormick F. Jablons D.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7218-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 33Uematsu K. Kanazawa S. You L. He B. Xu Z. Li K. Peterlin B.M. McCormick F. Jablons D.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4547-4551PubMed Google Scholar). DVL is composed of several structural domains: a DIX binding domain located at the N terminus, a PDZ domain in the midregion, and a DEP domain located about midway between the PDZ domain and the C terminus of DVL (34Boutros M. Mlodzik M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 83: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 35Strovel E.T. Sussman D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the DIX domain enables the dimerization of DVL with other members of the family as well as with axin (36Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the PDZ domain provides a docking site for the C terminus of Fz receptors (37Wong H.C. Bourdelas A. Krauss A. Lee H.J. Shao Y. Wu D. Mlodzik M. Shi D.L. Zheng J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1251-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The linker between DIX and PDZ provides an essential phosphorylation site for CKI (38Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The DEP domain regulates Rho GTPases in the planar polarity pathway (39Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and is also involved in Fz-induced translocation of DVL1 to the plasma membrane in the canonical pathway (40Pan W.J. Pang S.Z. Huang T. Guo H.Y. Wu D. Li L. Cell Res. 2004; 14: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Upon Wnt signaling, Fz, together with its co-receptor LRP5/6, recruits DVL via the PDZ domain, leaving the DIX domain free to bind axin-GSK3β proteins (41Zeng X. Huang H. Tamai K. Zhang X. Harada Y.

Our data point to a novel Gα13-DVL axis in cancer, independent (at least upstream of DVL) of Wnt-elicited β-catenin stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W1984754112,"Background Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by loss of function mutations in the FMR1 gene. Trinucleotide CGG-repeat expansions, resulting in FMR1 gene silencing, are the most common mutations observed at this locus. Even though the repeat expansion mutation is a functional null mutation, few conventional mutations have been identified at this locus, largely due to the clinical laboratory focus on the repeat tract. Methodology/Principal Findings To more thoroughly evaluate the frequency of conventional mutations in FXS-like patients, we used an array-based method to sequence FMR1 in 51 unrelated males exhibiting several features characteristic of FXS but with normal CGG-repeat tracts of FMR1. One patient was identified with a deletion in FMR1, but none of the patients were found to have other conventional mutations. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that missense mutations in FMR1 are not a common cause of the FXS phenotype in patients who have normal-length CGG-repeat tracts. However, screening for small deletions of FMR1 may be of clinically utility."
https://openalex.org/W2020306813,"Schizophrenia is a major disorder with complex genetic mechanisms. Earlier, population genetic studies revealed the occurrence of strong positive selection in the GABRB2 gene encoding the beta(2) subunit of GABA(A) receptors, within a segment of 3,551 bp harboring twenty-nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and containing schizophrenia-associated SNPs and haplotypes.In the present study, the possible occurrence of recombination in this 'S1-S29' segment was assessed. The occurrence of hotspot recombination was indicated by high resolution recombination rate estimation, haplotype diversity, abundance of rare haplotypes, recurrent mutations and torsos in haplotype networks, and experimental haplotyping of somatic and sperm DNA. The sub-segment distribution of relative recombination strength, measured by the ratio of haplotype diversity (H(d)) over mutation rate (theta), was indicative of a human specific Alu-Yi6 insertion serving as a central recombining sequence facilitating homologous recombination. Local anomalous DNA conformation attributable to the Alu-Yi6 element, as suggested by enhanced DNase I sensitivity and obstruction to DNA sequencing, could be a contributing factor of the increased sequence diversity. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis yielded prominent low LD points that supported ongoing recombination. LD contrast revealed significant dissimilarity between control and schizophrenic cohorts. Among the large array of inferred haplotypes, H26 and H73 were identified to be protective, and H19 and H81 risk-conferring, toward the development of schizophrenia.The co-occurrence of hotspot recombination and positive selection in the S1-S29 segment of GABRB2 has provided a plausible contribution to the molecular genetics mechanisms for schizophrenia. The present findings therefore suggest that genome regions characterized by the co-occurrence of positive selection and hotspot recombination, two interacting factors both affecting genetic diversity, merit close scrutiny with respect to the etiology of common complex disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1973862472,"The individual contribution of genes in the HLA region to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes (T1D) is confounded by the high linkage disequilibrium (LD) in this region. Using a novel approach we have combined genetic association data with information on functional protein-protein interactions to elucidate risk independent of LD and to place the genetic association into a functional context.Genetic association data from 2300 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA region was analysed in 2200 T1D family trios divided into six risk groups based on HLA-DRB1 genotypes. The best SNP signal in each gene was mapped to proteins in a human protein interaction network and their significance of clustering in functional network modules was evaluated. The significant network modules identified through this approach differed between the six HLA risk groups, which could be divided into two groups based on carrying the DRB1*0301 or the DRB1*0401 allele. Proteins identified in networks specific for DRB1*0301 carriers were involved in stress response and inflammation whereas in DRB1*0401 carriers the proteins were involved in antigen processing and presentation.In this study we were able to hypothesise functional differences between individuals with T1D carrying specific DRB1 alleles. The results point at candidate proteins involved in distinct cellular processes that could not only help the understanding of the pathogenesis of T1D, but also the distinction between individuals at different genetic risk for developing T1D."

Furthermore, it is known that activated Akt can suppress FoxO3a function. However, it is not known whether integrin interaction with the ECM regulates FoxO3a function. We examined whether the β1-integrin-mediated signaling pathway promotes fibroblast proliferation via FoxO3a suppression. We found that when fibroblasts are attached to collagen, PTEN protein expression and activity are inhibited due to promotion of PTEN degradation. This decrease in PTEN function permits FoxO3a suppression via the PI3K/Akt pathway. In contrast, the inhibition of PI3K/Akt or reconstitution of PTEN restores FoxO3a expression on collagen. Furthermore, we found that the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A also regulates FoxO3a. PP2A expression/activity is low when fibroblasts are attached to collagen, and PP2A overexpression augments FoxO3a levels. Thus the mechanism involves a coordinated decrease in PTEN and PP2A phosphatase activity and increase in PI3K/Akt activity.

Because precise control of cell growth is required for proper tissue development and repair, a mechanism for activation of major growth pathways must exist.

However, the role of integrin-matrix interaction in regulating FoxO3a function has not been previously examined. We therefore sought to determine whether integrin interaction with the ECM involved phosphorylation and inactivation of FoxO3a by Akt. Here we show that β1-integrin-extracellular matrix interaction suppresses FoxO3a function by promoting PTEN degradation, facilitating fibroblast proliferation by high Akt activity. We have discovered that during fibroblast adhesion to collagen, FoxO3a protein expression decreases whereas the level of phosphorylated or inactive FoxO3a remains steady. This indicates that FoxO3a activity decreases during fibroblast attachment to collagen.We demonstrate that the mechanism of suppression of FoxO3a function in response to integrin-collagen interaction is complex and involves net phosphorylation of FoxO3a as a consequence of down-regulation of PP2A and PTEN phosphatase activity plus activation of Akt. Although the FoxO3a regulatory mechanism is not fully understood, experimental evidence suggests that FoxO3a may be degraded by Ser/Thr phosphorylation (17Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2479-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 18Choe G. Horvath S. Cloughesy T.F. Crosby K. Seligson D. Palotie A. Inge L. Smith B.L. Sawyers C.L. Mischel P.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2742-2746PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have found that FoxO3a contains 2 PEST sequences in its N-terminal domain and that 3 potential caspase-3 cleavage sites are located in the second PEST sequence. We show that caspase-3 activity increases in response to fibroblast attachment to collagen. Furthermore, FoxO3a protein levels are preserved in fibroblasts attaching to type I collagen in the presence of caspase-3 inhibitor. Together these data suggest that integrin-collagen interaction inactivates FoxO3a by a complex mechanism involving net phosphorylation of the molecule and cleavage by caspase-3. Our data show that inhibition of FoxO3a is conducted in a coordinated PTEN/PI3K/Akt and PP2A-dependent fashion via β1-integrin, thereby promoting fibroblast proliferation.DISCUSSIONIntegrin-ECM interaction promotes fibroblast proliferation via activation of the PI3K/pathway (19Nho R.S. Xia H. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Diebold D. Henke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26630-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Nho R.S. Xia H. Diebold D. Kahm J.

The FoxO3a transcriptional activator inhibits cell proliferation by up-regulating the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Moreover, activated Akt can phosphorylate and inactivate FoxO3a. However, it is not known whether integrin-ECM interaction can modulate FoxO3a function. Here we demonstrate that integrin-ECM interaction suppresses FoxO3a function via high Akt and the inhibition of PTEN and PP2A. The mechanism is complex and involves the coordinated activation of PI3K/Akt with suppression of PTEN and PP2A phosphatase. We found that fibroblast attachment to collagen results in the promotion of PTEN degradation. This results in the preferential phosphorylation and inactivation of FoxO3a via high Akt activity. We also demonstrate that integrin-ECM interaction promotes a decrease in FoxO3a protein expression. We have found that 2 PEST sequences are located in the FoxO3a N terminus. 3 putative caspsase-3 cleavage sites are located in the second PEST sequence. We show that inhibition of caspase 3 attenuates the decrease in FoxO3a protein expression in response to the fibroblast-matrix interaction. Thus we have identified a novel basic mechanism by which the integrin-matrix interaction is capable of down-regulation of the FoxO3a activity, permitting fibroblast proliferation via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt and PP2A-dependent pathways.Our studies demonstrate that cell attachment to specific extracellular matrices promotes different degrees of FoxO3a suppression. For example, we have found that when fibroblasts attach to type I collagen or fibronectin, FoxO3a levels rapidly decrease. To a lesser extent, FoxO3a protein expression was rather slightly decreased as a function of time on vitronectin-coated plates. These data suggest that FoxO3a activity is dependent upon cell attachment to specific ECM. Cells preferentially use certain integrins to attach to specific matrices. Cells bearing the α2β1-integrin attach and spread on type I collagen. We found that blockage of β1-integrin function by β1-integrin blocking antibody preferentially inhibits FoxO3a suppression in response to fibroblast attachment to type I collagen, showing that β1-integrin-type I collagen interaction is required for FoxO3a inhibition. FoxO3a inhibitory mechanisms have previously been examined and suggested that Akt suppresses FoxO3a by phosphorylating several Ser/Thr residues (29Zheng W.H. Kar S. Quirion R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39152-39158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Among them Ser-253 is known to be a surrogate marker of FoxO3a activity and studies showed that the Ser-253 residue is preferentially phosphorylated by Akt (21Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and its phosphorylation promotes FoxO3a translocation to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, thereby inhibiting its function. We have found that the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, and Akt inhibitor stabilize FoxO3a expression levels in response to fibroblast attachment to type I collagen, suggesting that FoxO3a is regulated by PI3K/Akt in our model. Utilizing adenovirus expressing hyperactive and dominant Akt in fibroblasts demonstrated that Akt suppresses FoxO3a function on collagen. Our data also showed that the modulation of FoxO3a is not due to the transcriptional change but rather protein stability is the mechanism of FoxO3a suppression.Our results suggest a model where integrin-ECM interaction promotes the rapid inhibition of FoxO3a by Akt via PTEN. We have previously found that low PTEN activity increases Akt phosphorylation, promoting cell proliferation. In this experiment, we showed that integrin-collagen interaction in lung fibroblasts suppresses PTEN function, thereby inhibiting FoxO3a via high Akt activity. PTEN−/− fibroblasts further demonstrated that the absence of PTEN suppressed FoxO3a expression and activity via Akt. Because fibroblast attachment to collagen activates Akt via low PTEN, we also examined FoxO3a phosphorylation levels in response to lung fibroblast attachment to collagen. We have found that Ser-253 levels remained unaltered, whereas total FoxO3a expression levels decreased when fibroblasts were attached to collagen-coated plates. These data demonstrated that FoxO3a activity decreases when fibroblasts are attached to collagen. Utilizing β1-integrin activating or β1-integrin blocking antibody along with a PI3K or Akt inhibitor also showed that β1-integrin plays a crucial role in modulating FoxO3a activity via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Because p27 is a direct transcriptional target of FoxO3a, β1-integrin-ECM interaction facilitates fibroblast proliferation at least in part via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a/p27 regulatory pathway.Prior studies suggest that PP2A dephosphorylates FoxO3a, activating its function by translocating FoxO3a into the nucleus. Because FoxO3a protein expression was rapidly decreased on collagen, we predicted that PP2A function may be abolished in response to fibroblast attachment to collagen. We found that PP2A expression and activity were also suppressed as a function of time via β1-integrin. Likewise, the cell cycle inhibitor protein p27 decreased when fibroblasts were attached to collagen matrices. In contrast, PP2A overexpression or in the presence of β1-integrin blocking antibody on collagen restored FoxO3a and p27 expression, suggesting that PP2A modulates p27 via FoxO3a. Thus, our data indicate that the precise orchestration of PP2A inhibition and Akt activation via low PTEN can confer the maximum inhibition of FoxO3a activity.We found that FoxO3a contains 2 PEST sequences in the N-terminal domain of FoxO3a. Interestingly, there are 3 caspase-3 recognition sites within the PEST sequences. Dose and time-dependent assays in the presence or absence of FoxO3a inhibitor suggests that FoxO3a function is inhibited by caspase-3. Furthermore, caspase-3 activity increased when fibroblasts were attached to collagen, whereas β1-integrin blocking antibody abolished caspase-3 activity. These data showed that the integrin-ECM interaction may increase caspase-3 activity, promoting the FoxO3a cleavage process. A prior study showed that FoxO3a is inhibited via MDM2 (murine double minute 2)-mediated degradation (28Yang J.Y. Zong C.S. Xia W. Yamaguchi H. Ding Q. Xie X. Lang J.Y. Lai C.C. Chang C.J. Huang W.C.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) also previously reported that MDM2 acts as an ubiquitin E3 ligase to regulate the degradation of FoxO3a. Thus, a plausible scenario is that Ser-253 phosphorylation of FoxO3a promotes its translocation to the cytoplasm from the nucleus and facilitates its cleavage by caspase-3 and/or polyubiquitination by E3 ligase, which promotes its degradation. In summary, we have found a novel FoxO3a inhibitory mechanism utilized by the fibroblast-ECM interaction via β1-integrin/PTEN/PI3K/Akt and a PP2A-dependent pathway. We showed that fibroblast attachment to ECM inhibits FoxO3a function via coordination of PTEN/PI3K/Akt and PP2A, promoting fibroblast proliferation.

Because precise control of cell growth is required for proper tissue development and repair, a mechanism for activation of major growth pathways must exist. Integrin-ECM interaction promotes activation of the Ser/Thr protein kinase Akt through the upstream lipid kinase, PI3K (7Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2479-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 18Choe G. Horvath S. Cloughesy T.F. Crosby K. Seligson D. Palotie A. Inge L. Smith B.L. Sawyers C.L. Mischel P.S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2742-2746PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have found that FoxO3a contains 2 PEST sequences in its N-terminal domain and that 3 potential caspase-3 cleavage sites are located in the second PEST sequence. We show that caspase-3 activity increases in response to fibroblast attachment to collagen. Furthermore, FoxO3a protein levels are preserved in fibroblasts attaching to type I collagen in the presence of caspase-3 inhibitor. Together these data suggest that integrin-collagen interaction inactivates FoxO3a by a complex mechanism involving net phosphorylation of the molecule and cleavage by caspase-3. Our data show that inhibition of FoxO3a is conducted in a coordinated PTEN/PI3K/Akt and PP2A-dependent fashion via β1-integrin, thereby promoting fibroblast proliferation. DISCUSSIONIntegrin-ECM interaction promotes fibroblast proliferation via activation of the PI3K/pathway (19Nho R.S. Xia H. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Diebold D. Henke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26630-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Nho R.S. Xia H. Diebold D. Kahm J. Kleidon J. White E. Henke C.A. J. Biol.

The FoxO3a transcriptional activator inhibits cell proliferation by up-regulating the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. Moreover, activated Akt can phosphorylate and inactivate FoxO3a. However, it is not known whether integrin-ECM interaction can modulate FoxO3a function. Here we demonstrate that integrin-ECM interaction suppresses FoxO3a function via high Akt and the inhibition of PTEN and PP2A. The mechanism is complex and involves the coordinated activation of PI3K/Akt with suppression of PTEN and PP2A phosphatase. We found that fibroblast attachment to collagen results in the promotion of PTEN degradation. This results in the preferential phosphorylation and inactivation of FoxO3a via high Akt activity. We also demonstrate that integrin-ECM interaction promotes a decrease in FoxO3a protein expression. We have found that 2 PEST sequences are located in the FoxO3a N terminus. 3 putative caspsase-3 cleavage sites are located in the second PEST sequence. We show that inhibition of caspase 3 attenuates the decrease in FoxO3a protein expression in response to the fibroblast-matrix interaction. Thus we have identified a novel basic mechanism by which the integrin-matrix interaction is capable of down-regulation of the FoxO3a activity, permitting fibroblast proliferation via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt and PP2A-dependent pathways.Our studies demonstrate that cell attachment to specific extracellular matrices promotes different degrees of FoxO3a suppression. For example, we have found that when fibroblasts attach to type I collagen or fibronectin, FoxO3a levels rapidly decrease. To a lesser extent, FoxO3a protein expression was rather slightly decreased as a function of time on vitronectin-coated plates. These data suggest that FoxO3a activity is dependent upon cell attachment to specific ECM. Cells preferentially use certain integrins to attach to specific matrices. Cells bearing the α2β1-integrin attach and spread on type I collagen. We found that blockage of β1-integrin function by β1-integrin blocking antibody preferentially inhibits FoxO3a suppression in response to fibroblast attachment to type I collagen, showing that β1-integrin-type I collagen interaction is required for FoxO3a inhibition. FoxO3a inhibitory mechanisms have previously been examined and suggested that Akt suppresses FoxO3a by phosphorylating several Ser/Thr residues (29Zheng W.H. Kar S. Quirion R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39152-39158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Among them Ser-253 is known to be a surrogate marker of FoxO3a activity and studies showed that the Ser-253 residue is preferentially phosphorylated by Akt (21Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) and its phosphorylation promotes FoxO3a translocation to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, thereby inhibiting its function. We have found that the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, and Akt inhibitor stabilize FoxO3a expression levels in response to fibroblast attachment to type I collagen, suggesting that FoxO3a is regulated by PI3K/Akt in our model. Utilizing adenovirus expressing hyperactive and dominant Akt in fibroblasts demonstrated that Akt suppresses FoxO3a function on collagen. Our data also showed that the modulation of FoxO3a is not due to the transcriptional change but rather protein stability is the mechanism of FoxO3a suppression.Our results suggest a model where integrin-ECM interaction promotes the rapid inhibition of FoxO3a by Akt via PTEN. We have previously found that low PTEN activity increases Akt phosphorylation, promoting cell proliferation. In this experiment, we showed that integrin-collagen interaction in lung fibroblasts suppresses PTEN function, thereby inhibiting FoxO3a via high Akt activity. PTEN−/− fibroblasts further demonstrated that the absence of PTEN suppressed FoxO3a expression and activity via Akt. Because fibroblast attachment to collagen activates Akt via low PTEN, we also examined FoxO3a phosphorylation levels in response to lung fibroblast attachment to collagen. We have found that Ser-253 levels remained unaltered, whereas total FoxO3a expression levels decreased when fibroblasts were attached to collagen-coated plates. These data demonstrated that FoxO3a activity decreases when fibroblasts are attached to collagen. Utilizing β1-integrin activating or β1-integrin blocking antibody along with a PI3K or Akt inhibitor also showed that β1-integrin plays a crucial role in modulating FoxO3a activity via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Because p27 is a direct transcriptional target of FoxO3a, β1-integrin-ECM interaction facilitates fibroblast proliferation at least in part via the PTEN/PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a/p27 regulatory pathway.Prior studies suggest that PP2A dephosphorylates FoxO3a, activating its function by translocating FoxO3a into the nucleus. Because FoxO3a protein expression was rapidly decreased on collagen, we predicted that PP2A function may be abolished in response to fibroblast attachment to collagen. We found that PP2A expression and activity were also suppressed as a function of time via β1-integrin. Likewise, the cell cycle inhibitor protein p27 decreased when fibroblasts were attached to collagen matrices. In contrast, PP2A overexpression or in the presence of β1-integrin blocking antibody on collagen restored FoxO3a and p27 expression, suggesting that PP2A modulates p27 via FoxO3a. Thus, our data indicate that the precise orchestration of PP2A inhibition and Akt activation via low PTEN can confer the maximum inhibition of FoxO3a activity.We found that FoxO3a contains 2 PEST sequences in the N-terminal domain of FoxO3a. Interestingly, there are 3 caspase-3 recognition sites within the PEST sequences. Dose and time-dependent assays in the presence or absence of FoxO3a inhibitor suggests that FoxO3a function is inhibited by caspase-3. Furthermore, caspase-3 activity increased when fibroblasts were attached to collagen, whereas β1-integrin blocking antibody abolished caspase-3 activity. These data showed that the integrin-ECM interaction may increase caspase-3 activity, promoting the FoxO3a cleavage process. A prior study showed that FoxO3a is inhibited via MDM2 (murine double minute 2)-mediated degradation (28Yang J.Y. Zong C.S. Xia W. Yamaguchi H. Ding Q. Xie X. Lang J.Y. Lai C.C. Chang C.J. Huang W.C.

Thus, a plausible scenario is that Ser-253 phosphorylation of FoxO3a promotes its translocation to the cytoplasm from the nucleus and facilitates its cleavage by caspase-3 and/or polyubiquitination by E3 ligase, which promotes its degradation. In summary, we have found a novel FoxO3a inhibitory mechanism utilized by the fibroblast-ECM interaction via β1-integrin/PTEN/PI3K/Akt and a PP2A-dependent pathway. We showed that fibroblast attachment to ECM inhibits FoxO3a function via coordination of PTEN/PI3K/Akt and PP2A, promoting fibroblast proliferation.

Based on the previously determined NMR structure of the native protein, showing a ferredoxin-like fold and the peculiar presence of an unstructured N-terminal segment, we show here, at a molecular level using NMR spectroscopy, that indeed S. solfataricus acylphosphatase remains in a native-like conformation when placed in aggregating conditions and that such a native-like structure persists when the protein forms the initial aggregates, at least within the low molecular weight species. The analysis carried out under different solution conditions, based on the measurement of the combined 1H and 15N chemical shifts and hydrogen/deuterium exchange rates, enabled the most significant conformational changes to be monitored upon transfer of the monomeric state into aggregating conditions and upon formation of the initial native-like aggregates. Important increases of the hydrogen/deuterium exchange rates throughout the native protein, accompanied by small and localized structural changes, in the monomeric protein were observed. The results also allow the identification of the intermolecular interaction regions within the native-like aggregates, that involve, in particular, the N-terminal unstructured segment, the apical region including strands S4 and S5 with the connecting loop, and the opposite active site.

https://openalex.org/W2035997016,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt-PTEN signal transduction pathway orchestrates a variety of fundamental cell processes and its deregulation is implicated in many human diseases. Although the importance of this pathway to many cellular functions is well established, the mechanisms by which it achieves context-specific physiological outcomes in response to a variety of stimuli, using a relatively limited pool of effectors, remain largely unknown. Spatial restriction of signaling events is one means by which cells coordinate specific responses using common molecules. To investigate the subcellular location-specific roles of the major PI3K effector PKB/Akt in various cell processes, we have developed a novel experimental system employing cellular compartment-directed PKB/Akt pseudosubstrate inhibitors. Subcellular location-restricted PKB/Akt inhibition in the 3T3L1 adipocyte differentiation model revealed that nuclear and plasma membrane, but not cytoplasmic, PKB/Akt activity is required for terminal adipocyte differentiation. Nuclear and plasma membrane pools of PKB/Akt were found to contribute to distinct stages of adipocyte differentiation, revealing that PKB/Akt activity impacts multiple points of this program. Our work establishes the use of localized pseudosubstrate PKB/Akt inhibitors as an effective method for the dissection of PKB/Akt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2094089396,"We propose a feature vector approach to characterize the variation in large data sets of biological sequences. Each candidate sequence produces a single feature vector constructed with the number and location of amino acids or nucleic acids in the sequence. The feature vector characterizes the distance between the actual sequence and a model of a theoretical sequence based on the binomial and uniform distributions. This method is distinctive in that it does not rely on sequence alignment for determining protein relatedness, allowing the user to visualize the relationships within a set of proteins without making a priori assumptions about those proteins. We apply our method to two large families of proteins: protein kinase C, and globins, including hemoglobins and myoglobins. We interpret the high-dimensional feature vectors using principal components analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We find that the feature vector retains much of the information about the original sequence. By using principal component analysis to extract information from collections of feature vectors, we are able to quickly identify the nature of variation in a collection of proteins. Where collections are phylogenetically or functionally related, this is easily detected. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering provides a means of constructing cladograms from the feature vector output."
https://openalex.org/W1995591985,"In the human visual system, different attributes of an object, such as shape, color, and motion, are processed separately in different areas of the brain. This raises a fundamental question of how are these attributes integrated to produce a unified perception and a specific response. This ""binding problem"" is computationally difficult because all attributes are assumed to be bound together to form a single object representation. However, there is no firm evidence to confirm that such representations exist for general objects.Here we propose a paired-attribute model in which cognitive processes are based on multiple representations of paired attributes. In line with the model's prediction, we found that multiattribute stimuli can produce an illusory perception of a multiattribute object arising from erroneous integration of attribute pairs, implying that object recognition is based on parallel perception of paired attributes. Moreover, in a change-detection task, a feature change in a single attribute frequently caused an illusory perception of change in another attribute, suggesting that multiple pairs of attributes are stored in memory.The paired-attribute model can account for some novel illusions and controversial findings on binocular rivalry and short-term memory. Our results suggest that many cognitive processes are performed at the level of paired attributes rather than integrated objects, which greatly facilitates the binding problem and provides simpler solutions for it."
