https://openalex.org/W2085074082,"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major cause of hospital admissions, but recent data on the incidence and clinical characteristics of ADRs which occur following hospital admission, are lacking. Patients admitted to twelve wards over a six-month period in 2005 were assessed for ADRs throughout their admission. Suspected ADRs were recorded and analysed for causality, severity and avoidability and whether they increased the length of stay. Multivariable analysis was undertaken to identify the risk factors for ADRs. The 5% significance level was used when assessing factors for inclusion in multivariable models. Out of the 3695 patient episodes assessed for ADRs, 545 (14.7%, 95% CI 13.6-15.9%) experienced one or more ADRs. Half of ADRs were definitely or possibly avoidable. The patients experiencing ADRs were more likely to be older, female, taking a larger number of medicines, and had a longer length of stay than those without ADRs. However, the only significant predictor of ADRs, from the multivariable analysis of a representative sample of patients, was the number of medicines taken by the patient with each additional medication multiplying the hazard of an ADR episode by 1.14 (95% CI 1.09, 1.20). ADRs directly increased length of stay in 147 (26.8%) patients. The drugs most frequently associated with ADRs were diuretics, opioid analgesics, and anticoagulants. In conclusion, approximately one in seven hospital in-patients experience an ADR, which is a significant cause of morbidity, increasing the length of stay of patients by an average of 0.25 days/patient admission episode. The overall burden of ADRs on hospitals is high, and effective intervention strategies are urgently needed to reduce this burden."
https://openalex.org/W2051011991,"Osteoclasts are the only somatic cells with bone-resorbing capacity and, as such, they have a critical role not only in normal bone homeostasis (called 'bone remodelling') but also in the pathogenesis of bone destructive disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. A major focus of research in the field has been on gene regulation by osteoclastogenic cytokines such as receptor activator of NF-kappaB-ligand (RANKL, also known as TNFSF11) and TNF-alpha, both of which have been well documented to contribute to osteoclast terminal differentiation. A crucial process that has been less well studied is the trafficking of osteoclast precursors to and from the bone surface, where they undergo cell fusion to form the fully differentiated multinucleated cells that mediate bone resorption. Here we report that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid mediator enriched in blood, induces chemotaxis and regulates the migration of osteoclast precursors not only in culture but also in vivo, contributing to the dynamic control of bone mineral homeostasis. Cells with the properties of osteoclast precursors express functional S1P(1) receptors and exhibit positive chemotaxis along an S1P gradient in vitro. Intravital two-photon imaging of bone tissues showed that a potent S1P(1) agonist, SEW2871, stimulated motility of osteoclast precursor-containing monocytoid populations in vivo. Osteoclast/monocyte (CD11b, also known as ITGAM) lineage-specific conditional S1P(1) knockout mice showed osteoporotic changes due to increased osteoclast attachment to the bone surface. Furthermore, treatment with the S1P(1) agonist FTY720 relieved ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in mice by reducing the number of mature osteoclasts attached to the bone surface. Together, these data provide evidence that S1P controls the migratory behaviour of osteoclast precursors, dynamically regulating bone mineral homeostasis, and identifies a critical control point in osteoclastogenesis that may have potential as a therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2045233939,"Neurons in the mammalian neocortex are organized into functional columns. Within a column, highly specific synaptic connections are formed to ensure that similar physiological properties are shared by neuron ensembles spanning from the pia to the white matter. Recent studies indicate that synaptic connectivity in the neocortex is sparse and highly specific to allow even adjacent neurons to convey information independently. How this fine-scale microcircuit is constructed to create a functional columnar architecture at the level of individual neurons largely remains a mystery. Here we investigate whether radial clones of excitatory neurons arising from the same mother cell in the developing neocortex serve as a substrate for the formation of this highly specific microcircuit. We labelled ontogenetic radial clones of excitatory neurons in the mouse neocortex by in utero intraventricular injection of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing retroviruses around the onset of the peak phase of neocortical neurogenesis. Multiple-electrode whole-cell recordings were performed to probe synapse formation among these EGFP-labelled sister excitatory neurons in radial clones and the adjacent non-siblings during postnatal stages. We found that radially aligned sister excitatory neurons have a propensity for developing unidirectional chemical synapses with each other rather than with neighbouring non-siblings. Moreover, these synaptic connections display the same interlaminar directional preference as those observed in the mature neocortex. These results indicate that specific microcircuits develop preferentially within ontogenetic radial clones of excitatory neurons in the developing neocortex and contribute to the emergence of functional columnar microarchitectures in the mature neocortex."

Here we show that variants of two genes that regulate dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission and have been previously linked to emotional behavior, anxiety and addiction (5-HTTLPR and DRD4) are significant determinants of risk taking in investment decisions. We find that the 5-HTTLPR s/s allele carriers take 28% less risk than those carrying the s/l or l/l alleles of the gene. DRD4 7-repeat allele carriers take 25% more risk than individuals without the 7-repeat allele. These findings contribute to the emerging literature on the genetic determinants of economic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1989129419,"Multicellular organisms evolved sophisticated defence systems to confer protection against pathogens. An important characteristic of these immune systems is their ability to act both locally at the site of infection and at distal uninfected locations1,2,3,4. In insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster, RNA interference (RNAi) mediates antiviral immunity5,6,7. However, the antiviral RNAi defence in flies seems to be a local, cell-autonomous process, as flies are thought to be unable to generate a systemic RNAi response8. Here we show that a recently defined double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) uptake pathway9 is essential for effective antiviral RNAi immunity in adult flies. Mutant flies defective in this dsRNA uptake pathway were hypersensitive to infection with Drosophila C virus and Sindbis virus. Mortality in dsRNA-uptake-defective flies was accompanied by 100-to 105-fold increases in viral titres and higher levels of viral RNA. Furthermore, inoculating naked dsRNA into flies elicited a sequence-specific antiviral immune response that required an intact dsRNA uptake pathway. These findings suggest that spread of dsRNA to uninfected sites is essential for effective antiviral immunity. Notably, infection with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Sindbis virus suppressed expression of host-encoded GFP at a distal site. Thus, similar to protein-based immunity in vertebrates, the antiviral RNAi response in flies also relies on the systemic spread of a virus-specific immunity signal."
https://openalex.org/W2008314623,"The secreted glycoprotein sclerostin has recently emerged as a key negative regulator of Wnt signaling in bone and has stimulated considerable interest as a potential target for therapeutics designed to treat conditions associated with low bone mass, such as osteoporosis. We have determined the structure of sclerostin, which resulted in the identification of a previously unknown binding site for heparin, suggestive of a functional role in localizing sclerostin to the surface of target cells. We have also mapped the interaction site for an antibody that blocks the inhibition of Wnt signaling by sclerostin. This shows minimal overlap with the heparin binding site and highlights a key role for this region of sclerostin in protein interactions associated with the inhibition of Wnt signaling. The conserved N- and C-terminal arms of sclerostin were found to be unstructured, highly flexible, and unaffected by heparin binding, which suggests a role in stabilizing interactions with target proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2066425214,"Empathy, as originally defined, refers to an emotional experience that is shared among individuals. When discomfort or alarm is detected in another, a variety of behavioral responses can follow, including greater levels of nurturing, consolation or increased vigilance towards a threat. Moreover, changes in systemic physiology often accompany the recognition of distressed states in others. Employing a mouse model of cue-conditioned fear, we asked whether exposure to conspecific distress influences how a mouse subsequently responds to environmental cues that predict this distress. We found that mice are responsive to environmental cues that predict social distress, that their heart rate changes when distress vocalizations are emitted from conspecifics, and that genetic background substantially influences the magnitude of these responses. Specifically, during a series of pre-exposure sessions, repeated experiences of object mice that were exposed to a tone-shock (CS-UCS) contingency resulted in heart rate deceleration in subjects from the gregarious C57BL/6J (B6) strain, but not in subjects from the less social BALB/cJ (BALB) strain. Following the pre-exposure sessions, subjects were individually presented with the CS-only for 5 consecutive trials followed by 5 consecutive pairings of the CS with the UCS. Pre-exposure to object distress increased the freezing responses of B6 mice, but not BALB mice, on both the CS-only and the CS-UCS trials. These physiological and behavioral responses of B6 mice to social distress parallel features of human empathy. Our paradigm thus has construct and face validity with contemporary views of empathy, and provides unequivocal evidence for a genetic contribution to the expression of empathic behavior."

Different methods have been developed to predict protein disorder often focusing on different types of disordered regions. Here, we present MD, a novel META-Disorder prediction method that molds various sources of information predominantly obtained from orthogonal prediction methods, to significantly improve in performance over its constituents. In sustained cross-validation, MD not only outperforms its origins, but it also compares favorably to other state-of-the-art prediction methods in a variety of tests that we applied.http://www.rostlab.org/services/md/"
https://openalex.org/W2084366928,"The model eukaryote, Tetrahymena thermophila, is the first ciliated protozoan whose genome has been sequenced, enabling genome-wide analysis of gene expression.A genome-wide microarray platform containing the predicted coding sequences (putative genes) for T. thermophila is described, validated and used to study gene expression during the three major stages of the organism's life cycle: growth, starvation and conjugation.Of the approximately 27,000 predicted open reading frames, transcripts homologous to only approximately 5900 are not detectable in any of these life cycle stages, indicating that this single-celled organism does indeed contain a large number of functional genes. Transcripts from over 5000 predicted genes are expressed at levels >5x corrected background and 95 genes are expressed at >250x corrected background in all stages. Transcripts homologous to 91 predicted genes are specifically expressed and 155 more are highly up-regulated in growing cells, while 90 are specifically expressed and 616 are up-regulated during starvation. Strikingly, transcripts homologous to 1068 predicted genes are specifically expressed and 1753 are significantly up-regulated during conjugation. The patterns of gene expression during conjugation correlate well with the developmental stages of meiosis, nuclear differentiation and DNA elimination. The relationship between gene expression and chromosome fragmentation is analyzed. Genes encoding proteins known to interact or to function in complexes show similar expression patterns, indicating that co-ordinate expression with putative genes of known function can identify genes with related functions. New candidate genes associated with the RNAi-like process of DNA elimination and with meiosis are identified and the late stages of conjugation are shown to be characterized by specific expression of an unexpectedly large and diverse number of genes not involved in nuclear functions."
https://openalex.org/W1997080155,"This paper provides evidence for a role of caspase 8 in skin homeostasis. Loss of epidermal caspase 8, an important mediator of apoptosis, promotes several phases of the wound healing response in mice, including epidermal cell proliferation and inflammation. The findings illustrate how the loss of caspase 8 can have an impact beyond programmed cell death to affect the local microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many neoplastic skin disorders. This paper provides evidence for a role of caspase 8 in skin homeostasis. Loss of epidermal caspase 8 promotes epidermal cell proliferation and inflammation, and authors propose that caspase 8 expression by keratinocytes in the granular layer limits the release of preformed IL1α. Tissue homeostasis and regeneration are regulated by an intricate balance of seemingly competing processes—proliferation versus differentiation, and cell death versus survival1. Here we demonstrate that the loss of epidermal caspase 8, an important mediator of apoptosis2, recapitulates several phases of a wound healing response in the mouse. The epidermal hyperplasia in the caspase 8 null skin is the culmination of signals exchanged between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts and leukocytic cells. This reciprocal interaction is initiated by the paracrine signalling of interleukin 1α (IL1α), which activates both skin stem cell proliferation and cutaneous inflammation. The non-canonical secretion of IL1α is induced by a p38-MAPK-mediated upregulation of NALP3 (also known as NLRP3), leading to inflammasome assembly and caspase 1 activation. Notably, the increased proliferation of basal keratinocytes is counterbalanced by the growth arrest of suprabasal keratinocytes in the stratified epidermis by IL1α-dependent NFκB signalling. Altogether, our findings illustrate how the loss of caspase 8 can affect more than programmed cell death to alter the local microenvironment and elicit processes common to wound repair and many neoplastic skin disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2135676049,"Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a DNA damage tolerance mechanism that allows continued DNA synthesis, even in the presence of damaged DNA templates. Mammals have multiple DNA polymerases specialized for TLS, including Polη, Polι, and Polκ. These enzymes show preferential bypass for different lesions. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which functions as a sliding clamp for the replicative polymerase Polδ, also interacts with the three TLS polymerases. Although many PCNA-binding proteins have a highly conserved sequence termed the PCNA-interacting protein box (PIP-box), Polη, Polι, and Polκ have a noncanonical PIP-box sequence.

However, it is unclear how these TLS polymerases interact with PCNA. To address the structural basis for interactions between different TLS polymerases and PCNA, we determined crystal structures of PCNA bound to peptides containing the noncanonical PIP-box of these polymerases. We show that the three PIP-box peptides interact with PCNA in different ways, both from one another and from canonical PIP-box peptides. Especially, the PIP-box of Polι adopts a novel structure.

Genomic DNA carrying genetic information is constantly damaged by various internal and external agents. Most types of DNA damage are removed by multiple DNA repair mechanisms, but some of them, especially those generating relatively small distortion of the DNA double helix structure, may escape DNA repair and persist in S-phase. When a replicative DNA polymerase encounters such a persisting lesion, it often stalls there. One way to continue replication past the lesion site is to replace the stalled replicative polymerase with a DNA polymerase specialized for translesion synthesis (TLS) 4The abbreviations used are: TLS, translesion synthesis; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; IDCL, interdomain connecting loop; PIP-box, PCNA-interacting protein box; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; UBD, ubiquitin-binding domain; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase. that is able to incorporate nucleotides opposite DNA lesions. Because TLS polymerases have low fidelity and processivity, they are subsequently replaced by replicative polymerases after the lesion bypass is completed. To date, several TLS polymerases have been found in mammals, including Polη, Polι, Polκ, and REV1, which are all classified as Y-family DNA polymerases on the basis of similarity in their primary sequences (1Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z. Nohmi T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol. Cell.. 2001; 8: 7-8Google Scholar). Human Polη, Polι, and Polκ have been purified and extensively studied by in vitro experiments with DNA containing one of various types of lesion on the template strand (reviewed by Vaisman et al. (2Vaisman A. Lehmann A.R. Woodgate R. Adv. Protein Chem... 2004; 69: 205-228Google Scholar) and Ohmori et al. (3Ohmori H. Ohashi E. Ogi T. Adv. Protein Chem... 2004; 69: 265-278Google Scholar)). Polη can efficiently incorporate two adenines opposite a thymine-thymine (T-T) cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (4Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 3100-3109Google Scholar), one of the major photoproducts induced by UV irradiation. This function is consistent with the fact that defects in Polη result in a sunlight-sensitive and cancer-prone syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum variant (5Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature.. 1999; 399: 700-704Google Scholar, 6Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science.. 1999; 285: 263-265Google Scholar). Polι efficiently incorporates an adenine opposite the 3′-T of the T-T (6-4)-photoproduct (7Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R.

Although Polκ is unable to bypass a T-T cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer or (6-4)-photoproduct, it bypasses benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-adducted guanines by inserting the correct cytosine opposite the bulky lesion (9Suzuki N. Ohashi E. Kolbanovskiy A. Geacintov N.E. Grollman A.P. Ohmori H. Shibutani S. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 6100-6106Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Yuan F. Wu X. Wang M. Rechkoblit O. Taylor J.S.

Mouse cells lacking Polκ show high sensitivity to treatment with benzo[a]pyrene (12Ogi T. Shinkai Y. Tanaka K. Ohmori H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2002; 99: 15548-15553Google Scholar, 13Bi X. Slater D.M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 22343-22355Google Scholar). Thus, TLS polymerases have different lesion specificity. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a ring-shaped homotrimeric protein that encircles DNA and tethers DNA polymerases to the primer terminus, thereby functioning as the sliding processivity factor of DNA replication. Each PCNA monomer is composed of two similar domains (N- and C-terminal domains) linked by a long loop termed the interdomain connecting loop (IDCL). PCNA interacts with a large number of proteins involved in replication, repair, cell cycle, chromatin assembly, and sister-chromatid cohesion (14Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. Cell.. 2007; 129: 665-679Google Scholar). Most of these proteins have a conserved sequence, the so-called ""PCNA-interacting protein box"" (PIP-box) (15Warbrick E. BioEssays.. 1998; 20: 195-199Google Scholar). The canonical PIP-box is composed of eight amino acid residues, QXXhXXaa, where the residue at position 1 (p1) is a conserved Gln, ""h"" at p4 is a hydrophobic residue, such as Met, Leu, or Ile, ""a"" at p7 and p8 is an aromatic residue, such as Phe or Tyr, and X is any residue. So far, the structures of human PCNA bound to a peptide derived from some proteins, such as the human p21 protein (16Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell.. 1996; 87: 297-306Google Scholar), or bound to the full-length protein of human FEN1 (flap endonuclease I) (17Sakurai S. Kitano K. Yamaguchi H. Hamada K. Okada K. Fukuda K. Uchida M. Ohtsuka E. Morioka H. Hakoshima T. EMBO J... 2005; 24: 683-693Google Scholar) have been determined, both of which include a canonical PIP-box. Those structures revealed that the interactions of canonical PIP-boxes with PCNA are very similar. In fact, the side chain of the conserved Gln at p1 in the canonical PIP-box intrudes into a pocket in PCNA (termed the ""Q-pocket"" in this work). Residues from p4 to p8 in the canonical PIP-box form a 310-helix, in which the hydrophobic residue at p4 and the two aromatic residues at p7 and p8 form a three-forked hydrophobic plug and fit into a hydrophobic pocket in PCNA (termed the ""socket"" in this work). In addition to these interactions of the PIP-box with PCNA, the C-terminal residues following the PIP-box in p21 (16Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell.. 1996; 87: 297-306Google Scholar) and FEN1 (17Sakurai S. Kitano K. Yamaguchi H. Hamada K. Okada K. Fukuda K. Uchida M. Ohtsuka E. Morioka H. Hakoshima T. EMBO J... 2005; 24: 683-693Google Scholar) form an extensive antiparallel β-sheet with the IDCL, whereas those of the p66 subunit of Polδ (18Bruning J.B. Shamoo Y. Structure.. 2004; 12: 2209-2219Google Scholar) and PL peptide (19Kontopidis G. Wu S.-Y. Zheleva D.I. Taylor P. McInnes C. Lane D.P. Fischer P.M. Walkinshaw M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 1871-1876Google Scholar), which also possess a canonical PIP-box, are not long enough to interact extensively with the IDCL. Previous studies have assigned a PCNA-binding sequence in human Polη (20Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Unk I. Phillips B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2001; 21: 7199-7206Google Scholar), Polι (21Haracska L. Kondratick C.M. Unk I. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell.. 2001; 8: 407-415Google Scholar, 22Vidal A.E. Kannouche P. Podust V.N. Yang W. Lehmann A.R. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 48360-48368Google Scholar), and Polκ (23Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Unk I. Phillips B.B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2001; 98: 14256-14261Google Scholar, 24Ogi T. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. J. Cell Sci... 2005; 118: 129-136Google Scholar), none of which has a canonical PIP-box sequence; for instance, the conserved Gln at p1 is replaced with Met in Polη and Lys in Polι and Polκ. Unlike these three TLS polymerases, REV1 does not seem to have any sequence similar to the PIP-box; rather, the BRCT domain located near the N terminus was reported to interact with nonmodified PCNA (25Guo C. Sonoda E. Tang T.S. Parker J.L. Bielen A.B. Takeda S. Ulrich H.D. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 23: 265-271Google Scholar). The fact that Y-family DNA polymerases do not have a canonical PIP-box may be consistent with the notion that TLS polymerases, which are intrinsically error-prone, have lower affinity for PCNA than replicative polymerases, and hence TLS polymerases are recruited to the replication fork only when required. Polη physically and functionally interacts with PCNA, and it has a sequence similar to the PIP-box at its extreme C terminus, 702QTLESFFKPLTH713 (His-713 is the last residue in the entire protein (Fig. 1A), in which F707A/F708A substitution has been shown to notably reduce the interaction with PCNA in vitro (20Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Unk I. Phillips B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2001; 21: 7199-7206Google Scholar). In vitro the DNA synthetic activity of Polκ is also stimulated by the addition of PCNA, RFC (replication factor C) and RPA (replication protein A), and, from its similarity to the Polη C-terminal sequence, the Polκ sequence 862KHTLDIFFK870 (Lys-870 is the last residue in the entire protein) located at the extreme C terminus has been postulated to be a PCNA-binding site (26Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Phillips B.B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2002; 22: 784-791Google Scholar). Although enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged Polκ was found to form nuclear foci that mostly co-localized with PCNA in cells after UV irradiation or hydroxyurea treatment, the same construct with an alteration in the above putative PIP-box sequence (either deletion of the nine amino acid residues spanning positions 862–870 or the F868A/F869A substitution) did not form such foci (24Ogi T. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. J. Cell Sci... 2005; 118: 129-136Google Scholar). Thus, PCNA binding is considered to be one of the requirements for the formation of nuclear foci of Polκ and Polη in DNA-damaged cells (24Ogi T. Kannouche P. Lehmann A.R. J. Cell Sci... 2005; 118: 129-136Google Scholar, 27Kannouche P. Fernandez de Henestrosa A.R. Coull B. Vidal A.E. Gray C. Zicha D. Woodgate R. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J... 2002; 21: 6246-6256Google Scholar). Unlike Polη and Polκ, which contain a PIP-box at the extreme C terminus, the PCNA-binding site of Polι (the total length is 715 amino acids) is located in a central region of the protein; two research groups assigned the PIP-box to residues 420KKGLIDYY427 by showing that the Y426A/Y427A substitution greatly reduced Polι interaction with PCNA (22Vidal A.E. Kannouche P. Podust V.N. Yang W. Lehmann A.R. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 48360-48368Google Scholar, 28Haracska L. Acharya N. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2005; 25: 1183-1190Google Scholar). Furthermore, green fluorescent protein-tagged Polι formed nuclear foci in cells after UV irradiation, but a derivative with Y426A/Y427A substitution did not (22Vidal A.E. Kannouche P. Podust V.N. Yang W. Lehmann A.R. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 48360-48368Google Scholar). Recently, PCNA was shown to undergo ubiquitination at Lys-164 by the RAD6-RAD18 complex, which is E2-E3 ubiquitin ligase, in DNA-damaged cells (29Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature.. 2002; 419: 135-141Google Scholar); this ubiquitination is now considered to be an important signal for DNA synthesis by TLS polymerase at a site of DNA damage in both yeast and human cells (30Stelter P.

Here we present the first crystal structures of PCNA bound to the noncanonical PIP-box peptides of Polη, Polι, and Polκ and reveal that those noncanonical PIP-boxes interact with PCNA in different ways, both from one another and from canonical PIP-box peptides. Our results demonstrate that the PIP-box of Polκ has much lower affinity for PCNA than those of Polη and Polι. Furthermore, mutational and structural analyses reveal that the PIP-box sequence of Polι differs from that previously assigned by one residue and that it has a novel structure with multiple intramolecular interactions. We discuss how the different interactions between PCNA and the noncanonical PIP-boxes of the three TLS polymerases correlate with interactions between monoubiquitinated PCNA and the UBDs of these polymerases. Recombinant human PCNA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) harboring a pT7-PCNA expression vector (35Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol.

All peptides used in this work were commercially synthesized (GenScript Co.). The SPR assay was performed with BIACORE 2000. Synthetic peptides were immobilized on the carboxylated dextran matrix of CM5 sensor chips through the sulfhydryl group of the N-terminal cysteine by thiol activation chemistry, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Varying concentrations of PCNA protein in running buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) were injected over the sensor chip surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. The contact and dissociation times were 60 and 120 s, respectively. Binding constants were determined from the titration curves using BIAevaluation 3.0 software. The peptide-protein interaction signal minus the control cell signal was analyzed. The Kd value was calculated according to equilibrium value analysis by averages of measurement signals at respective concentrations.

E. coli strains JM109(DE3) harboring a plasmid encoding tRNAs corresponding to rare codons, and BL21-Codon-Plus(DE3)-RIPL (Stratagene) were transformed by pGEX6P1-Polη and pCold-GST-Polι, respectively. Both GST-Polη and GST-Polι were expressed and purified by the following procedure. Transformants were grown at 37 °C, protein expression was induced by 0.5 mm IPTG at OD600 = 0.50, and the cells were allowed to grow for 22 h at 18 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g, and the pellets were suspended in buffer I (40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm Zn(OAc)2 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 500 mm NaCl. Cells were lysed by sonication, and cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 40,800 × g for 45 min. The supernatants were loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer I containing 500 mm NaCl. The beads were washed with buffer I containing 2 m NaCl and equilibrated in buffer I containing 500 mm NaCl. GST-fused Polη and Polι were eluted with buffer I containing 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm reduced glutathione. The samples were concentrated with Amicon Ultra 50,000 molecular weight cut-off (Millipore) and dialyzed by buffer II (40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm Zn(OAc)2, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 0.05% Tween 20. To constitute complexes, 200 μg of GST-Polη or GST-Polι was mixed with 200 μg of wild type (WT) PCNA or the H44A mutant PCNA in 400 μl of buffer II containing 0.05% Tween 20. The solutions were incubated for 10 h at 4 °C and then immobilized on 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Next, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer II containing 0.1% Tween 20, and the bound proteins were eluted with 35 μl of buffer II containing 40 mm reduced glutathione, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20. The eluted proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot with anti-GST (GE Healthcare) or anti-PCNA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Densitometry analyses were performed using ImageJ software. Characterization of PIP-boxes of Human Polη, Polκ, and Polι—To investigate direct interactions of a peptide carrying the PIP-box of Polη, Polκ, or Polι with PCNA in vitro, we employed an SPR assay (Table 1). We examined a 21-mer peptide designated Polη-(694–713), which carries the 694–713 region of Polη plus an N-terminal cysteine added for coupling to the sensor chip, for binding to PCNA. As a control, we used a 23-mer peptide carrying the PIP-box of the human p21 protein that is known to have a very strong affinity for PCNA. The SPR measurement for the p21 peptide allowed us to estimate the dissociation constant (Kd) as 65 nm, which is in good agreement with the value of 87.7 nm obtained previously by isothermal titration calorimetry (45Zheleva D.I. Zhelev N.Z. Fischer P.M. Duff S.V. Warbrick E. Blake D.G. Lane D.P. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 7388-7397Google Scholar). The Polη-(694–713) peptide showed a weaker affinity for PCNA with an estimated Kd of 0.40 μm. Another Polη peptide with F707A/F708A substitution showed no SPR signal for PCNA binding, indicating that the interaction between PCNA and the Polη-(694–713) peptide was sequence-specific. In contrast to the Polη peptide, we could not detect any signal for PCNA binding with either a 16-mer Polκ-(856–870) or a 21-mer Polκ-(851–870) peptide carrying the C-terminal PIP-box of Polκ. Even a 16-mer peptide in which Lys-862 was changed to Gln, the residue conserved at p1 in PIP-box sequences, did not show an SPR signal for PCNA binding. However, we found that the addition of the four residues PLTH, corresponding to the C-terminal four residues of Polη, to the C terminus of Polκ-(856–870) peptide markedly increased the affinity for PCNA, up to the estimated Kd value of 4.9 μm. Conversely, deletion of the C-terminal four residues PLTH from the Polη-(694–713) peptide strongly decreased binding to PCNA. These results indicate that the presence of several residue"
https://openalex.org/W2022904359,"The earliest dinosaurs are from the early Late Triassic (Carnian) of South America. By the Carnian the main clades Saurischia and Ornithischia were already established, and the presence of the most primitive known sauropodomorph Saturnalia suggests also that Saurischia had already diverged into Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha. Knowledge of Carnian sauropodomorphs has been restricted to this single species.We describe a new small sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Ischigualsto Formation (Carnian) in northwest Argentina, Panphagia protos gen. et sp. nov., on the basis of a partial skeleton. The genus and species are characterized by an anteroposteriorly elongated fossa on the base of the anteroventral process of the nasal; wide lateral flange on the quadrate with a large foramen; deep groove on the lateral surface of the lower jaw surrounded by prominent dorsal and ventral ridges; bifurcated posteroventral process of the dentary; long retroarticular process transversally wider than the articular area for the quadrate; oval scars on the lateral surface of the posterior border of the centra of cervical vertebrae; distinct prominences on the neural arc of the anterior cervical vertebra; distal end of the scapular blade nearly three times wider than the neck; scapular blade with an expanded posterodistal corner; and medial lamina of brevis fossa twice as wide as the iliac spine.We regard Panphagia as the most basal sauropodomorph, which shares the following apomorphies with Saturnalia and more derived sauropodomorphs: basally constricted crowns; lanceolate crowns; teeth of the anterior quarter of the dentary higher than the others; and short posterolateral flange of distal tibia. The presence of Panphagia at the base of the early Carnian Ischigualasto Formation suggests an earlier origin of Sauropodomorpha during the Middle Triassic."
https://openalex.org/W2015721893,"The lambda-like double-stranded (ds) DNA bacteriophage HK97 is a favourable system for studying viral capsid maturation since it can be assembled in Escherichia coli from the expression of just two viral gene products and maturation is easily triggered and analysed in vitro. Various mature viral capsid structures have been determined but until now no procapsids have been available for a dsDNA virus or bacteriophage. Gertsman et al. now report the high-resolution structure of the HK97 procapsid providing insight into the capsid assembly process leading to infectious virions. The knowledge gained from this structure is relevant for related viruses such as the human herpesvirus. This paper reports the high-resolution structure of the double-stranded DNA bacteriophage HK97 procapsid, providing insight into the capsid assembly process leading to infectious virions. The knowledge gained from this structure is relevant for related viruses such as human herpesviruses. Lambda-like double-stranded (ds) DNA bacteriophage undergo massive conformational changes in their capsid shell during the packaging of their viral genomes. Capsid shells are complex organizations of hundreds of protein subunits that assemble into intricate quaternary complexes that ultimately are able to withstand over 50 atm of pressure during genome packaging1. The extensive integration between subunits in capsids requires the formation of an intermediate complex, termed a procapsid, from which individual subunits can undergo the necessary refolding and structural rearrangements needed to transition to the more stable capsid. Although various mature capsids have been characterized at atomic resolution, no such procapsid structure is available for a dsDNA virus or bacteriophage. Here we present a procapsid X-ray structure at 3.65 Å resolution, termed prohead II, of the lambda-like bacteriophage HK97, the mature capsid structure of which was previously solved to 3.44 Å (ref. 2). A comparison of the two largely different capsid forms has unveiled an unprecedented expansion mechanism that describes the transition. Crystallographic and hydrogen/deuterium exchange data presented here demonstrate that the subunit tertiary structures are significantly different between the two states, with twisting and bending motions occurring in both helical and β-sheet regions. We also identified subunit interactions at each three-fold axis of the capsid that are maintained throughout maturation. The interactions sustain capsid integrity during subunit refolding and provide a fixed hinge from which subunits undergo rotational and translational motions during maturation. Previously published calorimetric data of a closely related bacteriophage, P22, showed that capsid maturation was an exothermic process that resulted in a release of 90 kJ mol-1 of energy3. We propose that the major tertiary changes presented in this study reveal a structural basis for an exothermic maturation process probably present in many dsDNA bacteriophage and possibly viruses such as herpesvirus, which share the HK97 subunit fold4."
https://openalex.org/W1985577384,"Nogo-A has been extensively studied as a myelin-associated neurite outgrowth inhibitor in the lesioned adult central nervous system. However, its role in the intact central nervous system has not yet been clarified. Analysis of the intact adult nervous system of C57BL/6 Nogo-A knock-out (KO) versus wild-type (WT) mice by a combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and isotope-coded affinity tagging approach revealed regulation of cytoskeleton-, transport-, and signaling growth-related proteins, pointing to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, the neuronal growth machinery, and in particular the Rho-GTPase/LIMK1/cofilin pathway. Nogo-A KO adult neurons showed enlarged, more motile growth cones compared with WT neurons. The phenotype was reproduced by acute in vitro neutralization of neuronal Nogo-A. LIMK1 phosphorylation was increased in Nogo-A KO growth cones, and its reduction caused the decrease of KO growth cone motility to WT levels. Our study suggests that in the unlesioned adult nervous system, neuronal Nogo-A can restrict neuronal growth through negative modulation of growth cone motility."

TNP had no effect on the activity of a large number of protein kinases, suggesting that it is selective for IP6Ks. TNP reversibly reduced InsP7/InsP8 levels. TNP in combination with genetic studies was used to implicate the involvement of two pathways for synthesis of InsP8 in yeast. TNP induced a fragmented vacuole phenotype in yeast, consistent with inhibition of Kcs1, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae IP6K.

In higher eukaryotes, it regulates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores via binding to Ins(1,4,5)P3-specific receptors located in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and all other eukaryotes that have been studied, Ins(1,4,5)P3 also undergoes complex metabolism to generate a series of inositol polyphosphates with diverse functions (1Irvine R.F.

This kinase is distinct from IP6K/Kcs1 in that it phosphorylates the 1/3-position of InsP6 and 5-[PP]-InsP5 (10Lin H. Fridy P.C. Ribeiro A.A. Choi J.H. Barma D.K. Vogel G. Falck J.R. Shears S.B.

Insights into the biological functions of inositol pyrophosphates have come from genetic studies in yeast and by manipulating expression of inositol polyphosphate kinases in mammalian cells. More recently, yeast mutants failing to synthesize inositol pyro phosphate molecules have been found to be impaired in several cellular functions, such as DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and telomere length maintenance (11Huang K.N.

As a means to further study the roles of inositol pyrophosphate messengers, we set out to develop pharmacological tools that permit acute inhibition of specific inositol polyphosphate kinases. Here we report the characterization of an IP6K inhibitor, which appears to be selective in vitro and in vivo and its use in furthering our understanding of the role of InsP7 synthesis in yeast and in insulin secretion in mammalian cells. Ip3-3 kinase inhibitor (TNP; see ""Results”) and thapsigargin (TG) were from Calbiochem. [2-3H]Inositol and [γ-32P]ATP were from GE Healthcare. HeLa cells were from ATCC. PEI-cellulose TLC sheets were from Merck. Reduced glutathione was from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were from the University of Dundee in-house DNA synthesis center. Cloning—The human IP6K1 and the catalytic fragment of IP3-3KA were cloned from IMAGE clones using the following primers: IP6K1, 5′-GCATGAATTCATGTGTGTTTGTCAAAC-3′ and 5′-GCATGTCGACctactggttctcgtcccgcatc-3′; IP3-3KA, 5′-CatgGAATTCggcaacgtgcagctggaagcg-3′ and 5′-CATGGTCGACTCATCTCTCAGCCAGGCTGGCC-3′. The primers include the recognition sequences for EcoRI and SalI, respectively. The genes were amplified using PCR using the Hifidelity PCR enzyme (Roche Applied Science). IP6K1 was cloned into the mammalian expression vector enhanced green fluorescence protein (Clontech), whereas the catalytic fragment of IP3-3KA was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (for bacterial expression) as EcoRI-SalI fragments. Clones were sequenced in the in-house sequencing center. Cell Culture—HeLa (human cervical cancer) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%, v/v) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air environment. HeLa stable cell lines were generated by transfecting cells grown on 3.5-cm dishes with appropriate amounts of vector DNA of enhanced green fluorescence protein or enhanced green fluorescence protein-IP6K1 using the transfection reagent polyethyleneimine (10 μg/well) at ∼70% confluence. We routinely achieved about 90% transfection efficiency by this method. After 48 h, the medium was replaced by similar medium as above but containing 0.8 mg/ml G418 sulfate. Stably expressing clones were selected after 3 weeks of growth in selection medium. Clones were identified by observing GFP fluorescence microscopically and by monitoring protein expression by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibody (Abcam). Min6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) containing heat-inactivated serum (15%, v/v) and 72 μm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air environment. 40,000 cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate. They were subsequently cultured for 48 h in 200 μl of the above medium. Cells were transfected 16 h postseeding with 0.2 μg of HA-IP6K1 plasmid DNA and 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000/well. Expression and Assay of IP6K1 Activity—HA-tagged IP6K1 plasmid (10 μg) was transfected into 0.75 × 106 HeLa cells plated on 10-cm2 dishes. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. 5 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody was incubated with 0.5 mg of the above lysate with 50 μl of protein G beads on a shaking nutator for 3 h at 4 °C. The lysate was aspirated off, and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice with 1 ml of assay buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2OVO4, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) before electrophoresis for Western blot or activity assays. For activity assays, the beads were finally suspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 5 μl of [2-3H]InsP6 (specific activity = 21.4Ci/mmol, 5 μCi/0.5 ml) and appropriate concentrations of TNP or DMSO. Final concentration of DMSO was 1% (v/v). The reaction was started by the addition of ATP at a final concentration of 1 mm. Control reactions contained no ATP. Tubes were incubated at 37 °C on a shaking nutator for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 300 μl of 1 mm EDTA. Reactions were centrifuged briefly, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. [2-3H]InsP7 produced was separated from the [2-3H]InsP6, using HPLC (see below). [2-3H]InsP7 produced was estimated using the ratio of the DPM in the corresponding peak to the total DPM in both peaks. [2-3H]InsP7 was plotted against the corresponding TNP concentration for curve fitting (Sigma Plot software) and calculation of IC50 values. Expression and Purification of the Catalytic Fragment of IP3-3KA—The catalytic fragment of IP3-3KA was expressed as a GST fusion protein in the BL21 Escherichia coli strain. 1 liter of E. coli was grown to an OD of 1.0 at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and reduction of the bacterial growth temperature to 26 °C. The bacteria were harvested 18 h after induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and complete protease inhibitor tablet from Roche Applied Science). Cells were ruptured by sonication (six 15-s bursts with 45 s of cooling between two bursts) on an Ultrasonic processor (VCX-750W) sonicator at 65% power. Subsequently, the sonicate was centrifuged at 18,590 × g for 40 min at 4 °C on an Avanti J-25 centrifuge. The supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of washed (with lysis buffer) glutathione-Sepharose 6B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Following incubation, the supernatant was aspirated off, and beads were washed with 50 ml of wash buffer (lysis buffer with no Triton X-100). Finally, the protein was eluted from beads with elution buffer (wash buffer plus 2 mm reduced glutathione). Protein was electrophoresed on a Novex 4–12% BisTris gel in 1× MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen), and the gel was Coomassie-stained for verifying the purity of the protein. The protein was concentrated and stored at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml in wash buffer plus 50% glycerol (v/v) at -20 °C. IP3-3K Assays—30 nm IP3-3KA was incubated with 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3 in assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2). 1 μl of the assay was spotted onto PEI-cellulose TLC sheets. Samples were chromatographed in 2.5 m ammonium formate plus 1.0 m formic acid to separate out [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, [γ-32P]ATP, and any inorganic phosphate ([32P]Pi). The sheets were dried and then scanned using a PhosphorImager. The [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 formed was measured by calculating density corresponding to [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as a percentage of the total density of [γ-32P]ATP plus [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Percentage of [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 produced was plotted against TNP concentration. Curve fitting to the data was done using the Sigma Plot software. Km/IC50 values were calculated from the equation provided by the software. Calculation of Ki Values—Ki values were determined using the equation, Ki=IC50/(1+([substrate]/Km))(Eq.1) where IC50 represents the value determined from curve fit analysis, Km is the value for ATP, and [substrate] is the concentration of ATP used in the IP3-3K or IP6K1 assay, respectively. Vip/PPIP5K Assays—100 ng of purified Homo sapiens Vip2 fragment (amino acids 1–365) or S. cerevisiae Vip1 was preincubated with vehicle (DMSO) or 10 μm TNP for 30 min on ice. Following the pretreatment, [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm InsP6 was added to the enzyme, and the assay was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min as per the protocol reported earlier by Fridy et al. (28Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J... 2003; 371: 199-204Google Scholar). [32P]Pi, [32P]ATP, [32P]InsP7, and [32P]InsP8 formed during the assay were visualized after separation by PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography in a tank containing 1.09 m KH2PO4, 0.72 m K2HPO4, and 2.13 m HCl and subsequent phosphorimaging. [2-3H]Inositol Labeling of Cells—HeLa cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells on 60-mm plates in 3 ml of inositol-free medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal calf serum (10% (v/v), molecular weight cut-off = 10,000; Invitrogen) and 50 μCi of [2-3H]-inositol for 4 days. At the time of TNP treatment or sorbitol stimulation, the plates were 90–95% confluent. TNP treatment of cells was carried out as follows: 3 μl from a 1000× stock of TNP (in DMSO) was added to cells labeled with [2-3H]inositol as mentioned above and gently swirled. For controls, 3 μl of DMSO was added to cells. The DMSO concentration was 0.1% of the total volume of medium in all cases. Cell treatment with TG was also carried out using a similar procedure. For stimulation with sorbitol, appropriate aliquots from a 2 m stock solution of sorbitol was added to cells with or without TNP at various concentrations for 2 h at 37 °C. To check for reversibility of TNP inhibition, after the labeled cells were treated with TNP, medium was aspirated off, and cells were washed three times with 2 ml of inositol-free medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were then allowed to recover for 2 h before the inositol phosphates were extracted. Extraction and Analysis of Inositol Polyphosphates by HPLC—Stimulated or transfected cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid. Subsequently, cells were scraped, and the supernatant was separated from the debris by centrifugation in a cold microcentrifuge for 10 min at full speed. The supernatant was neutralized by the addition of 1 m K2CO3. The neutralized solution was once again centrifuged, as mentioned above. Finally, the supernatant was loaded onto a Whatman Partisphere SAX column. The inositol phosphates were eluted from the column using 1 mm EDTA (buffer A) and 1 mm EDTA plus 1.3 m (NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.85 (buffer B). The gradient was as follows: initial loading at 0% buffer B for 10 min, 0–35% buffer B in the next 15 min, followed by 35–100% buffer B in the next 65 min, followed by a high salt wash of 100% buffer B for the next 5 min and a wash with 100% buffer A for the final 10 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min throughout the gradient, and 1-ml fractions were collected. This gradient was standardized for optimal separation of InsP6, which typically elutes at fraction 61, InsP7 ([PP]-InsP5) at fraction 71, and InsP8 ([PP]2-InsP4) at fraction 81. Radioactive Labeling of Yeast and Inositol Phosphate Extraction—2 × 103 cells/ml WT, kcs1Δ, vip1Δ, kcs1vip1ΔΔ, ddp1Δ, and ddp1kcs1ΔΔ were grown in synthetic minimal medium supplemented with 50 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. Inositol phosphates were extracted, as explained above. TNP at a final concentration of 10 μm was added to growth medium, and cells were allowed to grow overnight at 30 °C. For controls, equal amounts of DMSO were added to the culture, and the final concentration of DMSO was 0.001% (v/v). The cells went through ∼8–9 divisions in labeling medium. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. They were washed with YPD once and lysed by incubation with 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min. The debris was pelleted by centrifugation at full speed in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. The supernatant was neutralized by the addition of 1 m K2CO3, and then the inositol phosphates were separated by strong anion exchange chromatography, as explained above. Yeast Culture and Fluorescence Labeling of Vacuoles—Wild type yeast, Ipk2Δ, and Kcs1Δ (all isogenic to BY4741) were grown in YPD (YP + 2% glucose (w/v)) medium at 30 °C. TNP at a final concentration of 10 μm was added to growth medium, and cells were allowed to grow for 2 h. For controls, equal amounts of DMSO were added to the culture, and the final concentration of DMSO was 0.001% (v/v). For labeling vacuoles, the yeast vacuole marker sampler kit from Molecular Probes was used. Briefly, 5 ml of yeast in exponential growth phase (A600 = 0.4–0.6) were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5% glucose (w/v). Vacuoles were stained with Cell Tracker Blue CMAC and yeast vacuole membrane marker MDY64 according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μl was mounted onto slides, and cells were visualized using a Delta Vision microscope with appropriate filter sets. Insulin Release Assay from Min6 Cells—Medium was removed, and cells were washed 10 times with glucose-free KREBS (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 119 mm NaCl, 4.74 mm KCl, 2.54 mm CaCl2, 1.19 mm MgCl2, 1.19 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 1 mm EGTA) to remove traces of culture medium and serum. Cells were treated with various concentrations of TNP for 2 h in 200 μl of glucose-free KREBS under the same conditions of temperature and CO2 as under culturing conditions. Following treatment with TNP, the glucose-free KREBS was replaced with KREBS containing 2.5 mm glucose and TNP at the same concentrations. 5 min later, aliquots of cell supernatants were taken out and used for measurement of insulin release. Insulin released was measured using the rat/mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Linco Laboratories), as per the manufacturer's instructions. For each assay, a standard curve was generated using purified insulin provided in the kit. Aliquots of cell supernatants withdrawn during the assay were diluted 1:10 with glucose-free KREBS to give a final absorbance value within the linear range of the standard curve. The amount of insulin released was calculated from the standard curve generated. Blanks were stimulated with glucose-free KREBS. IP6Ks belong to the IPK superfamily of inositol polyphosphate kinases, also comprising IP3-3Ks and IPMKs by virtue of significant homology in their sequences. A common structural fold has been reported for IP3-3KA from mammals and Ipk2p from S. cerevisiae, where the N and C termini of the proteins coordinate ATP binding, and the middle of the protein forms the inositol phosphate binding domain (18Gonzalez B. Schell M.J. Letcher A.J. Veprintsev D.B. Irvine R.F. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 689-701Google Scholar, 19Miller G.J. Hurley J.H. Mol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 703-711Google Scholar). Since IP6Ks share sequence homology in the ATP and inositol phosphate binding regions with the other members of the IPK family, it is possible that they share a similar structural fold. Alignment of the ATP and inositol phosphate (IP) binding regions from human IP3-3KA, IP6K1-3, Kcs1p, and Ipk2p are shown in Fig. 1. Although both IP3-3KA and Kcs1p contain N-terminal sequences (not shown) that do not exist in the IP6Ks or Ipk2p, all of the members of the IPK family show high levels of conservation in their ATP binding regions and IP binding regions but little sequence conservation elsewhere (18Gonzalez B. Schell M.J. Letcher A.J. Veprintsev D.B. Irvine R.F. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 689-701Google Scholar, 20Holmes W. Jogl G. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 38109-38116Google Scholar). For example, each contains the conserved ""GH"" (residues 34 and 35 in IP6K1) and the ""SLL"" motifs (residues 334–336) important for ATP binding and the fully conserved ""PXXXDXK"" motif (residues 221–226) required for IP binding. A family of molecules having a purine base with either a nitrobenzyl (TNP; Fig. S1A), aminobenzyl (TAP; Fig. S1B), or benzyl (TBP; Fig. S1C) side chain attached at the N-6 position and an (m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl) attached at the N-2 group were characterized as inhibitors for IP3-3K from a panel of purine-based molecules. Of these, TNP was found to have the lowest Ki value (4.3 μm) for IP3-3K (21Chang Y.T. Choi G. Bae Y.S. Burdett M. Moon H.S. Lee J.W. Gray N.S. Schultz P.G. Meijer L. Chung S.K. Choi K.Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. ChemBioChem.. 2002; 3: 897-901Google Scholar). We have now characterized this compound as a potential inhibitor for IP6Ks. TNP Is a Selective Inhibitor of the IP6Ks in Vitro and in Vivo—To determine if IP6Ks and IP3-3Ks are inhibited by TNP, we performed in vitro activity assays with both enzymes in the presence of increasing concentrations of TNP. For this purpose, HA-tagged IP6K1 was expressed and immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells. The Western blot of the immunoprecipitated enzyme is shown in Fig. 2A. The immunoprecipitated enzyme was incubated with 1 mm ATP and [3H]InsP6, and production of [3H]InsP7 was monitored using HPLC separation (Fig. 2B). The formation of InsP7 was inhibited by the presence of TNP with an IC50 value of 0.47 μm determined from curve fitting (Fig. 2, B and C). Taking account of the Km for ATP and the ATP concentration in the assay, this translates to a Ki of 0.24 μm (Table 1).Table 1Inhibition of different IPK family members by TNP Name of enzyme IP3-3KA IPMK IP6K1 Substrate (μm) 0.01 1000 Km of ATP (μm)aValues for IP3-3KA were determined in our laboratory and in other laboratories (22), and values for IPMK and IP6K1 have been reported elsewhere (5, 6, 23, 24) 10.8 17 1000 IC50 (μm)bValues determined in this work 18.0 NDcNot determined 0.47 Ki (μm)dKi values were determined using the equation, Ki = IC50/(1 + ([substrate]/Km)) 17.9 0.24a Values for IP3-3KA were determined in our laboratory and in other laboratories (22Poinas A.

Hurley J.H. Mol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 703-711Google Scholar). The Coomassie Blue-stained gel shows that the major band consists of the recombinant fragment of IP3-3KA (Fig. 2D). The purified fragment was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and Ins(1,4,5)P3, and production of [32P]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was monitored in the presence of increasing doses of TNP by PEI-TLC separation of ATP and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and subsequent radioimaging (Fig. 2E). The formation of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 decreased with increasing TNP, and the IC50 value calculated from curve fitting was around 18 μm from two different batches of protein purified (Fig. 2, E and F). In this case, the IC50 and Ki value are equivalent due to the low ATP concentrations in the assay. The Ki of 18 μm (Table 1) is somewhat higher than the values reported by other authors (21Chang Y.T. Choi G. Bae Y.S. Burdett M. Moon H.S. Lee J.W. Gray N.S. Schultz P.G. Meijer L. Chung S.K. Choi K.Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. ChemBioChem.. 2002; 3: 897-901Google Scholar, 22Poinas A. Backers K. Riley A.M. Mills S.J. Moreau C. Potter B.V. Erneux C. ChemBioChem.. 2005; 6: 1449-1457Google Scholar). The in vitro data translate to an ∼30-fold difference in the Ki values for TNP between IP6K1 and IP3-3KA (Table 1), whereas the Km values for ATP were ∼100-fold apart. From these data, the following conclusions were drawn. 1) When the ATP concentration is in the millimolar range (such as that within cells), the Km values indicate that the IP3-3KA would be fully saturated at the ATP binding site, whereas the IP6K1 would only be partially saturated at the same site. 2) Since TNP is a purine analog (Fig. S1A) and is an ATP competitor, these observations lead to the prediction that the in vivo selectivity of TNP should be ∼1000-fold in favor of the IP6K1 over IP3-3KA. The above prediction was tested by treating [3H]inositol-labeled HeLa cells with increasing doses of TNP and quantifying changes in inositol phosphate levels. Fig. 3A shows the HPLC separation of the various inositol phosphates from equilibrium-radiolabeled cells. Since InsP6 levels remained fairly constant over the range of TNP concentrations used in this experiment, we used the radioactivity in the InsP6 peak to normalize the levels of the other inositol phosphates. The levels of InsP3 and InsP4 (containing a mixture of isomers) were fairly constant over the tested range of TNP concentrations (Fig. 3B). InsP5 levels were also constant, whereas InsP7 levels decreased in response to the same range of TNP concentrations. Curve fitting yielded an IC50 value of 0.55 μm for the InsP7 response (Fig. 3C). Hence, the predictions from the in vitro biochemical data appear to be ratified by the in vivo data. The unchanging InsP5 levels provide further support for in vivo selectivity of TNP for IP6Ks, because InsP5 is the product of the multikinase, another member of the IPK family that has a relatively low Km (micromolar order) for ATP (23Saiardi A.

https://openalex.org/W1976383834,"Background The clinical relevance of MR scanning in children with autism is still an open question and must be considered in light of the evolution of this technology. MRI was judged to be of insufficient value to be included in the standard clinical evaluation of autism according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society in 2000 [1]. However, this statement was based on results obtained from small samples of patients and, more importantly, included mostly insufficient MRI sequences. Our main objective was to evaluate the prevalence of brain abnormalities in a large group of children with a non-syndromic autistic disorder (AD) using T1, T2 and FLAIR MRI sequences. Methodology MRI inspection of 77 children and adolescents with non-syndromic AD (mean age 7.4±3.6) was performed. All met the DSM-IV and ADI –R criteria for autism. Based on recommended clinical and biological screenings, we excluded patients with infectious, metabolic or genetic diseases, seizures or any other neurological symptoms. Identical MRI inspections of 77 children (mean age 7.0±4.2) without AD, developmental or neurological disorders were also performed. All MRIs were acquired with a 1.5-T Signa GE (3-D T1-FSPGR, T2, FLAIR coronal and axial sequences). Two neuroradiologists independently inspected cortical and sub-cortical regions. MRIs were reported to be normal, abnormal or uninterpretable. Principal Findings MRIs were judged as uninterpretable in 10% (8/77) of the cases. In 48% of the children (33/69 patients), abnormalities were reported. Three predominant abnormalities were observed, including white matter signal abnormalities (19/69), major dilated Virchow–Robin spaces (12/69) and temporal lobe abnormalities (20/69). In all, 52% of the MRIs were interpreted as normal (36/69 patients). Conclusions An unexpectedly high rate of MRI abnormalities was found in the first large series of clinical MRI investigations in non-syndromic autism. These results could contribute to further etiopathogenetic research into autism."
https://openalex.org/W2085277615,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) and its family proteins are crucial regulators of blood vessel formation and vascular permeability. Snake venom has recently been shown to be an exogenous source of unique VEGF (known as VEGF-F), and now, two types of VEGF-F with distinct biochemical properties have been reported. Here, we show that VEGF-Fs (venom-type VEGFs) are highly variable in structure and function among species, in contrast to endogenous tissue-type VEGFs (VEGF-As) of snakes. Although the structures of tissue-type VEGFs are highly conserved among venomous snake species and even among all vertebrates, including humans, those of venom-type VEGFs are extensively variegated, especially in the regions around receptor-binding loops and C-terminal putative coreceptor-binding regions, indicating that highly frequent variations are located around functionally key regions of the proteins. Genetic analyses suggest that venom-type VEGF gene may have developed from a tissue-type gene and that the unique sequence of its C-terminal region was generated by an alteration in the translation frame in the corresponding exons. We further verified that a novel venom-type VEGF from Bitis arietans displays unique properties distinct from already known VEGFs. Our results may provide evidence of a novel mechanism causing the generation of multiple snake toxins and also of a new model of molecular evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2021530440,"Pex5p, the peroxisomal protein cycling receptor, binds newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins in the cytosol and promotes their translocation across the organelle membrane. During its transient passage through the membrane, Pex5p is monoubiquitinated at a conserved cysteine residue, a requisite for its subsequent ATP-dependent export back into the cytosol. Here we describe the properties of the soluble and membrane-bound monoubiquitinated Pex5p species (Ub-Pex5p). Our data suggest that 1) Ub-Pex5p is deubiquitinated by a combination of context-dependent enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms; 2) soluble Ub-Pex5p retains the capacity to interact with the peroxisomal import machinery in a cargo-dependent manner; and 3) substitution of the conserved cysteine residue of Pex5p by a lysine results in a quite functional protein both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we show that MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, blocks the import of a peroxisomal reporter protein in vivo.

Additionally, we show that MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, blocks the import of a peroxisomal reporter protein in vivo. Since the discovery of the ubiquitin-conjugating cascade nearly 30 years ago, thousands of proteins have been shown to be modified by ubiquitin (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar). In many cases ubiquitination of a protein is linked to its proteasomal degradation (3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet... 1996; 30: 405-439Google Scholar), whereas in a growing number of examples, ubiquitination of a protein is used as a transient modification to modulate its biological properties (for a review see Ref. 4Mukhopadhyay D. Riezman H. Science.. 2007; 315: 201-205Google Scholar). Regardless of the final outcome, it is generally assumed and in many cases demonstrated that ubiquitin is covalently attached through an amide bond involving the carboxyl group of the last glycine of ubiquitin on one hand, and an amino group of the targeted protein on the other (5Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J... 1997; 11: 1257-1268Google Scholar). Recent findings from several laboratories, however, suggest that this rule is not always valid, and proteins ubiquitinated at serines and threonines (yielding oxyesters) or even cysteines (forming thiol esters) have been identified (6Cadwell K. Coscoy L. Science.. 2005; 309: 127-130Google Scholar, 7Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol.

Protein ubiquitination at cysteine residues is a particularly puzzling phenomenon for two reasons. First, on a thermodynamic basis it is the least favorable event (the approximate free energy changes for acyl shifts from a thiol ester to a thiol, alcohol, and amine are 0, –2.4, and –11 kcal/mol, respectively (11Chong S. Shao Y. Paulus H. Benner J. Perler F.B. Xu M.Q. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 22159-22168Google Scholar, 12Strajbl M. Florián J. Warshel J. Int. J. Quantum Chem... 2000; 77: 44-53Google Scholar)). Second, although data on the half-lives of ubiquitin-protein thiol ester conjugates under physiologically relevant conditions are scarce, it is known that ubiquitin thiol esters are easily disrupted by nucleophiles such as GSH (13Rose I.A. Warms J.V. Biochemistry.. 1983; 22: 4234-4237Google Scholar), raising the possibility that, to some degree, proteins subjected to this kind of conjugation may undergo futile ubiquitination/deubiquitination cycles. Thus, a thiol ester bond appears not to be the most efficient way to link ubiquitin to a protein, unless, of course, the aim is to create an activated (easily transferable) form of ubiquitin, as is in fact the case with ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s), 4The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; DTM, docking/translocation machinery; Ub-Pex5p, monoubiquitinated Pex5p species; MG132, carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal; PTS1, peroxisomal targeting signal type 1; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PNS, postnuclear supernatant; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; Ubal, ubiquitin aldehyde; DUB, deubiquitinating enzyme; ATPγS, adenosine 5-O-(thiotriphosphate); GST-Ub, glutathione S-transferase-ubiquitin; GST-SKL, glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing a PTS1 signal at the C terminus; DTT, dithiothreitol; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and some ubiquitin ligases (E3s) (2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar). In the last years we have been characterizing Pex5p, one of the three presently known proteins claimed to be ubiquitinated at a cysteine residue (6Cadwell K. Coscoy L. Science.. 2005; 309: 127-130Google Scholar, 7Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol.

Pex5p is a central component of the peroxisomal protein import machinery functioning as a shuttle receptor in the transport of newly synthesized peroxisomal matrix proteins from the cytosol into the peroxisome (14Brocard C. Hartig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2006; 1763: 1565-1573Google Scholar, 15Brown L.A. Baker A. Mol. Membr. Biol... 2008; 25: 363-375Google Scholar, 16Dodt G. Gould S.J. J.

According to current models, the Pex5p-mediated protein import pathway can be divided into five major stages (numbered 0–4; see Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Grou C.P. Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Alencastre I.S. Rodrigues T.A. Freitas M.O. Francisco T. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci... 2009; 66: 254-262Google Scholar for a recent review). First, free/soluble Pex5p (stage 0) binds peroxisomal matrix proteins in the cytosol. The Pex5p-cargo protein complex (stage 1) then docks at the peroxisomal docking/translocation machinery (DTM), a membrane-embedded protein assembly comprising the core subunits Pex13p, Pex14p and the three RING (really interesting new gene) finger peroxins Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p (19Agne B.

Chem... 2001; 276: 29935-29942Google Scholar). The interaction of the Pex5p-cargo protein complex with the DTM ultimately results in the insertion of Pex5p into this machinery (stage 2) with the concomitant translocation of the cargo protein across the peroxisomal membrane. Next, Pex5p is monoubiquitinated at a conserved cysteine residue present near the N terminus of the peroxin (7Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 31267-31272Google Scholar, 10Williams C. van den Berg M. Sprenger R.R. Distel B. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 22534-22543Google Scholar). This monoubiquitinated Pex5p (Ub-Pex5p; stage 3) is then dislocated in an ATP-dependent process by Pex1p and Pex6p, two members of the AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) family, yielding a soluble Ub-Pex5p species (stage 4) (7Carvalho A.F.

Finally, it is assumed, although not yet demonstrated, that the ubiquitin moiety is removed from stage 4 Pex5p, thus regenerating stage 0 Pex5p. In this work we used an established in vitro system (7Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol.

Chem... 2003; 278: 39483-39488Google Scholar) to characterize the properties of monoubiquitinated Pex5p. We provide evidence suggesting that the stage 4-to-stage 0 transition can occur by two independent mechanisms, one of enzymatic nature and the other involving a simple nucleophilic attack of the thiol ester bond by GSH. Interestingly, the soluble Ub-Pex5p thiol ester conjugate (stage 4) is still a substrate for the DTM, suggesting that ubiquitination of Pex5p does not change its cargo protein binding properties. Notably, the conserved cysteine residue of Pex5p can be substituted by a lysine with no detectable loss of functionality both in in vitro and in vivo assays. Finally, our data suggest that treatment of cell cultures with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor (30Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell.. 1994; 78: 761-771Google Scholar), leads to a block of the peroxisomal import machinery. Plasmids—cDNAs encoding the large isoform of human Pex5p (31Braverman N. Dodt G. Gould S.J. Valle D.

Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 226-232Google Scholar) as the template. The primers used were: 5′-GGTGGAGGCCGAAGCCGGGGGTGCCAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTGGCACCCCCGGCTTCGGCCTCCACC-3′ for the Pex5(C11A)p-encoding plasmid; 5′-GGTGGAGGCCGAACGCGGGGGTGCCAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTGGCACCCCCGCGTTCGGCCTCCACC-3′ for the Pex5(C11R)p-encoding plasmid; and 5′-GGTGGAGGCCGAAAAGGGGGGTGCCAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTGGCACCCCCCTTTTCGGCCTCCACC-3′ for the Pex5(C11K)p-encoding plasmid. The pGEM4-Pex5(C11S)p has been previously described (24Carvalho A.F. Grou C.P. Pinto M.P. Alencastre I.S. Costa-Rodrigues J. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2007; 1773: 1141-1148Google Scholar). The monocistronic mammalian expression plasmid encoding a EGFP fusion protein containing at its C terminus a peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (EGFP-PTS1) has been described elsewhere (33Vastiau I.M.

The bicistronic mammalian expression vectors coding for EGFP-PTS1 and the nontagged long isoforms of Pex5p, Pex5(C11S)p, or Pex5(C11K)p were constructed by amplifying the corresponding cDNAs by PCR (primers, 5′-GGGAGATCTACCATGGCAATGCGGGAGCTG-3′ and 5′-GCCCGTCGACCTGTCACTGGGGCAGGCCAAAC-3′) and cloning the BglII/SalI-digested PCR products into the multiple cloning site of pIRES-EGFP-PTS1 (34Huybrechts S.J.

All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Agowa). Cell Culture, Transfections, and (Immuno)fluorescence microscopy—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and immortalized mouse Pex5p-deficient fibroblasts (35Baes M. Gressens P. Baumgart E. Carmeliet P.

Wylin T. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2001; 21: 4413-4424Google Scholar). The cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). In some experiments, the transfected cells were first enriched on G418 (300 μg/ml) for at least 3 weeks. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, diluted with α-minimal essential medium complete medium (Lonza), and added to the G418-enriched cells. Control cells received the same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide. The peroxisomal localization of EGFP-PTS1 was assessed by co-localization studies with Pex14p (37Fransen M. Terlecky S.R. Subramani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 8087-8092Google Scholar). Fluorescence was evaluated on a CellM imaging station (Olympus) equipped with U-MNUA2, U-MNIBA3, and U-MWIY2 fluorescence mirror units. Preparation of Postnuclear Supernatants (PNS) from Rat Liver—Rat liver PNS for in vitro assays were prepared in SEM buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH, pH 7.2) supplemented with 2 μg/ml N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide, as described before (26Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Reguenga C. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 226-232Google Scholar). For the steady-state analysis of rat liver Pex5p, an SEM buffer supplemented with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 1:300 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) was used. In Vitro Assays—In vitro import reactions (100 μl final volume) containing 400 μg of PNS protein and 1 μl of the relevant 35S-labeled protein (see below) in import buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 μm methionine, and 2 μg/ml N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine 4-guanidinobutylamide) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mm ATP and 10 μm bovine ubiquitin, unless otherwise indicated. Ubiquitin aldehyde (Ubal; Biomol), an inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), was used at a final concentration of 3 μm. Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and clastolactacystin β-lactone (Biomol) each at 10 μm final concentration were included in some of the initial experiments, but similar results were obtained in their absence. When specified, 20 units/ml apyrase (grade VII, Sigma) and 2 μg of recombinant Pex5p (38Costa-Rodrigues J. Carvalho A.F. Fransen M. Hambruch E. Schliebs W. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 24404-24411Google Scholar) were added to the reactions. NEM treatment of import reactions was done on ice for 5 min by adding 25 μl of a freshly made 0.1 m solution/100 μl in vitro reaction. To separate organelles from soluble proteins, the in vitro reactions were diluted with SEM buffer (typically 900 μl) and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C using a Biofuge pico centrifuge (Heraeus). To determine the lability of the soluble Ub-Pex5p thiol ester conjugate (stage 4) in the presence of GSH, a standard in vitro reaction containing bovine ubiquitin, Ubal, and proteasome inhibitors was performed. At the end of the 37 °C incubation, the reaction was diluted with 400 μl of SEM buffer supplemented with the Ubal and proteasome inhibitors (but lacking NEM) and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was then incubated for the indicated time periods at 37 °C, pH 7.2, with 5 mm GSH (added from a freshly prepared 0.1 m solution in 20 mm MOPS-KOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2 adjusted at 37 °C). After addition of NEM (final concentration, 20 mm) and incubation on ice for 5 min, the samples were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and processed for SDS-PAGE (7Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 31267-31272Google Scholar). To determine the half-life of the membrane-bound Ub-Pex5p conjugate (stage 3) in the presence of GSH, a total organelle pellet enriched in stage 3 Pex5p was prepared as follows. An in vitro reaction containing bovine ubiquitin, Ubal, and proteasome inhibitors was first incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP (to release the DTM from the endogenous Pex5p (29Oliveira M.E. Gouveia A.M. Pinto R.A. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 39483-39488Google Scholar)) followed by a second 25-min incubation in the presence of 7 mm ATPγS to accumulate stage 3 Pex5p. A total organelle pellet was obtained by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of SEM buffer supplemented with Ubal and proteasome inhibitors. Treatment with 5 mm GSH and processing of the samples for SDS-PAGE was done as above. Cargo protein-dependent import experiments using iodoacetamide-treated substrates were done as follows. Two reactions (tubes A and B, respectively) containing 1 mg of PNS protein each in 250 μl of import buffer supplemented with ATP, 1 μm bovine ubiquitin, and Ubal were assembled on ice. Twelve microliters of 35S-labeled Pex5p were then added to reaction A, and both tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation, the tubes were centrifuged (see above), the supernatants were recovered and placed on ice, and 12 μl of 35S-labeled Pex5p were then added to supernatant B. Both supernatants were treated with iodoacetamide (final concentration, 12 mm) on ice for 15 min. In parallel, a tube containing 4.8 mg of PNS protein in 720 μl of import buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP and Ubal was incubated at 37 °C for 3 min (to release the DTM from endogenous Pex5p). This suspension was put at 16 °C and supplemented with 12 μm GST-Ub, and 120-μl aliquots were pipetted into two sets of three tubes (tubes 1–3). Tubes 1 contained no addition; tubes 2 contained a recombinant protein comprising the PTS1-binding domain of Pex5p (referred to as TPR-Pex5p in Ref. 39Carvalho A.F. Costa-Rodrigues J. Correia I. Costa Pessoa J. Faria T.Q. Martins C.L. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Mol. Biol... 2006; 356: 864-875Google Scholar) plus a PTS1-containing peptide (CRYHLKPLQSKL) (27Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P. Oliveira M.E. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2003; 278: 4389-4392Google Scholar); and tubes 3 contained this recombinant protein plus a control peptide (CRYHLKPLQLKS). The final concentration of the recombinant protein and peptides were 1.7 and 33 μm, respectively. Each set of tubes was then programmed with 80 μl/tube of supernatant A or B, and incubation was continued at 16 °C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation one half of each reaction was treated with NEM, and the organelles were isolated by centrifugation. The other half was treated with proteinase K as described before (7Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 31267-31272Google Scholar) but using a lower protease concentration (250 μg/ml) to minimize degradation of the ubiquitin moiety in the stage 3 Pex5p species. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—Eighty microliters of a supernatant from an in vitro reaction performed in the presence of Ubal were treated with iodoacetamide as described above and incubated on ice for 5 min with 3 μg of recombinant Pex5p. The solution was brought to 400 μl with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA-NaOH) and halved. One half received GST-SKL, a GST containing a PTS1 signal at the C terminus; the other received GST-LKS, a GST ending with a nonfunctional PTS1-like sequence (27Gouveia A.M. Guimarães C.P.

After 10 min at room temperature, 30 μg each of bovine IgGs (6.9 s), bovine serum albumin (4.3 s), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (2.3 s) were added to the samples as internal standards (the numbers in parentheses represent the sedimentation coefficients). These mixtures were then applied onto the top of continuous 5–30% (w/v) sucrose gradient in buffer A supplemented with 0.25 μm of the corresponding GST fusion protein, GST-SKL or GST-LKS, respectively. After centrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 29 h at 4 °C in a SW41 rotor (Beckman), 13 fractions of 0.8 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube, immediately precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. All of the recombinant proteins and sedimentation standards were pretreated with iodoacetamide (10 mm) before use.

Substitution of Cys11 of Pex5p by a Lysine Results in a Peroxisomal Import/Export-competent Protein—To characterize the properties of the Ub-Pex5p thiol ester conjugate, we started our work by generating a mutant Pex5p protein, Pex5(C11K)p, in which the conserved cysteine residue at position 11 was replaced by a lysine. Our aim was to detect some ubiquitination in our in vitro system when using this mutated Pex5p species so that we could directly compare the properties of the Ub-Pex5p thiol ester conjugate with those of an almost identical molecule differing only in the covalent bond linking ubiquitin to the peroxin. Obviously, there was a risk that this mutant protein would no longer be recognized by the peroxisomal E3 ligase(s) catalyzing this ubiquitination event. However, and surpassing our expectations, this turned out not to be the case, as described below. In addition to Pex5(C11K)p, we included in some experiments three other mutant versions, Pex5(C11S)p, Pex5(C11A)p and Pex5(C11R)p, all lacking the conserved Cys11 residue and possessing at this position a serine, alanine, or arginine residue, respectively. The properties of Pex5(C11S)p have been described before (7Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 31267-31272Google Scholar, 24Carvalho A.F. Grou C.P. Pinto M.P. Alencastre I.S. Costa-Rodrigues J. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2007; 1773: 1141-1148Google Scholar). Because Pex5(C11S)p is a very poor substrate for peroxisome-dependent monoubiquitination, it accumulates at the peroxisomal membrane. The data in Fig. 2 (upper panel) show precisely this behavior. When Pex5(C11S)p is incubated with a PNS fraction in the presence of ATP, conditions under which wild-type Pex5p continuously enters and exits the peroxisomal DTM (25Costa-Rodrigues J. Carvalho A.F.

Chem... 2003; 278: 39483-39488Google Scholar), a significant fraction (45%) co-sediments with the organelles (lane 5). A much smaller fraction of the wild-type peroxin (15%) is found in the organelle pellet because as the protein gets inserted into the DTM, it is also pumped out back into the cytosol (lane 1). Large fractions of protein in the organelle pellets were also found for Pex5(C11A)p and Pex5(C11R)p (compare lane 1 with lanes 5 and 9 in lower panel), emphasizing the importance of Cys11 for the dislocation of Pex5p back into the cytosol. Remarkably, Pex5(C11K)p behaves as the wild-type peroxin (15% in the organelle pellet; compare lanes 1 and 9 in upper panel), suggesting that this variant enters the DTM and is actively dislocated into the cytosol by the peroxisomal export machinery. The presence of monoubiquitinated forms of both Pex5p and Pex5(C11K)p in the supernatant fractions (lanes 2 and 10) indicates that a fraction of both proteins present in the soluble phase of these reactions has indeed passed through the peroxisomal DTM, because only Pex5p proteins that have inserted into the DTM are monoubiquitinated in this in vitro system (28Grou C.P. Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Wiese S. Piechura H. Meyer H.E. Warscheid B. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 14190-14197Google Scholar). Thus, Pex5(C11K)p is as functional as Pex5p in this assay. The Stage 4-to-Stage 0 Pex5p Transition Can Occur by Both Enzymatic and Nonenzymatic Mechanisms—Interestingly, the amounts of Ub-Pex5p and Ub-Pex5(C11K)p that can be detected in these reactions increase when Ubal, an inhibitor of DUBs (43Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2004; 1695: 189-207Google Scholar, 44Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1987; 84: 1829-1833Google Scholar), is included in the import buffer (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 10 with 4 and 12, respectively). The fraction of ubiquitinated species undergoing this Ubal-sensitive deubiquitinating reaction in our standard conditions is, however, relatively modest (about 30%). A clearer result was obtained when the concentration of the PNS fraction in the assays (and so the concentration of DUBs) was increased by a factor of two and deubiquitination of Ub-Pex5p was allowed to proceed for 20 min in the absence of de novo ubiquitination. For this purpose, Pex5p was first incubated for 20 min with the PNS fraction in import buffer containing ATP to generate stage 3 and stage 4 Pex5p. Apyrase and a vast excess of recombinant Pex5p were then added to the reaction (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 3, when this procedure is performed in the presence of Ubal both stage 3 and stage 4 Pex5p can be easily detected in the assay (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). In contrast, in the absence of the DUB inhibitor only stage 3 Ub-Pex5p is detected (compare lanes 1 and 2). This observation suggests that stage 3, unlike stage 4 Pex5p, is inaccessible to DUBs. DUBs are not the only cellular components that are diluted in our assays. For the problem being addressed here, i.e. the lability of the Ub-Pex5p thiol ester conjugate, another potentially important variable is the GSH concentration. GSH is a major nucleophile in vivo (45Haddad J.J. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2013905005,"Globally, about 20% of cultivated land is now affected by salinity. Salt tolerance is a trait of importance to all crops in saline soils. Previous efforts to improve salt tolerance in crop plants have met with only limited success. Bacteria of the genus Deinococcus are known for their ability to survive highly stressful conditions, and therefore possess a unique pool of genes conferring extreme resistance. In Deinococcus radiodurans, the irrE gene encodes a global regulator responsible for extreme radioresistance.Using plate assays, we showed that IrrE protected E. coli cells against salt shock and other abiotic stresses such as oxidative, osmotic and thermal shocks. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed that IrrE functions as a switch to regulate different sets of proteins such as stress responsive proteins, protein kinases, glycerol-degrading enzymes, detoxification proteins, and growth-related proteins in E. coli. We also used quantitative RT-PCR to investigate expression of nine selected stress-responsive genes in transgenic and wild-type Brassica napus plants. Transgenic B. napus plants expressing the IrrE protein can tolerate 350 mM NaCl, a concentration that inhibits the growth of almost all crop plants.Expression of IrrE, a global regulator for extreme radiation resistance in D. radiodurans, confers significantly enhanced salt tolerance in both E. coli and B. napus. We thus propose that the irrE gene might be used as a potentially promising transgene to improve abiotic stress tolerances in crop plants."
https://openalex.org/W2014474433,"IRSp53 is an essential intermediate between the activation of Rac and Cdc42 GTPases and the formation of cellular protrusions; it affects cell shape by coupling membrane-deforming activity with the actin cytoskeleton. IRSp53 is highly expressed in neurons where it is also an abundant component of the postsynaptic density (PSD). Here we analyze the physiological function of this protein in the mouse brain by generating IRSp53-deficient mice. Neurons in the hippocampus of young and adult knock-out (KO) mice do not exhibit morphological abnormalities in vivo. Conversely, primary cultured neurons derived from IRSp53 KO mice display retarded dendritic development in vitro. On a molecular level, Eps8 cooperates with IRSp53 to enhance actin bundling and interacts with IRSp53 in developing neurons. However, postsynaptic Shank proteins which are expressed at high levels in mature neurons compete with Eps8 to block actin bundling. In electrophysiological experiments the removal of IRSp53 increases synaptic plasticity as measured by augmented long term potentiation and paired-pulse facilitation. A primarily postsynaptic role of IRSp53 is underscored by the decreased size of the PSDs, which display increased levels of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunits in IRSp53 KO animals. Our data suggest that the incorporation of IRSp53 into the PSD enables the protein to limit the number of postsynaptic glutamate receptors and thereby affect synaptic plasticity rather than dendritic morphology. Consistent with altered synaptic plasticity, IRSp53-deficient mice exhibit cognitive deficits in the contextual fear-conditioning paradigm."

Adhesion of F18-fimbriated bacteria to the small intestine of susceptible pigs is mediated by the minor fimbrial subunit FedF. However, the target cell receptor for FedF has remained unidentified. Here we report that F18-fimbriated E. coli selectively interact with glycosphingolipids having blood group ABH determinants on type 1 core, and blood group A type 4 heptaglycosylceramide. The minimal binding epitope was identified as the blood group H type 1 determinant (Fucα2Galβ3GlcNAc), while an optimal binding epitope was created by addition of the terminal α3-linked galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine of the blood group B type 1 determinant (Galα3(Fucα2)Galβ3GlcNAc) and the blood group A type 1 determinant (GalNAcα3(Fucα2)-Galβ3GlcNAc). To assess the role of glycosphingolipid recognition by F18-fimbriated E. coli in target tissue adherence, F18-binding glycosphingolipids were isolated from the small intestinal epithelium of blood group O and A pigs and characterized by mass spectrometry and proton NMR.

In newly weaned pigs, F18-fimbriated E. coli producing entero- and/or Shiga-like toxins induce diarrhea and/or edema disease, which accounts for substantial economical losses in the pig industry (3Bertschinger H. Gyles C.L. Gyles C.L. Escherichia coli in Domestic Animals and Humans. CAB, Wallingford, Oxon, UK1994: 193-219Google Scholar). Two virulence factors are of major importance, namely the F18 fimbriae, the adhesive polymeric protein surface appendages of F18-fimbriated E. coli, and the Shiga-like toxin (SLT-IIv), or enterotoxins (STa or STb), that are produced by the bacterium. F18 fimbriae are expressed by the fed (fimbriae associated with edema disease) gene cluster, with fedA encoding the major subunit, fedB the outer membrane usher, fedC the periplasmic chaperone, whereas fedE and fedF encode minor subunits (4Imberechts H. De Greve H. Schlicker C. Bouchet H. Pohl P. Charlier G. Bertschinger H. Wild P. Vandekerckhove J. Van Damme J. Van Montagu M. Lintermans P. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1963-1971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FedF is the adhesive subunit and is presumably located at the tip of the fimbrial structure (5Imberechts H. Wild P. Charlier G. De Greve H.

Typically, tip adhesins consist of two domains: an N-terminal carbohydrate-specific lectin domain and a C-terminal pilin domain (7Hultgren S.J. Lindberg F. Magnusson G. Kihlberg J. Tennent J.M. Normark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1999; 285: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the lectin domains of type 1 pili, P pili, and F17 fimbrial adhesins reveal that they all have the immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) fold in common, which is remarkable, because they show little to no sequence identity (10Buts L. Bouckaert J. De Genst E. Loris R. Oscarson S. Lahmann M. Messens J. Brosens E. Wyns L. De Greve H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). N-terminal truncation has enabled crystallization of the FedF adhesin, and elucidation of its crystal structure will shed light on the interaction with the natural receptor on the intestinal epithelium (11De Kerpel M. Van Molle I. Brys L. Wyns L. De Greve H. Bouckaert J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 1278-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A crucial step in the pathogenesis of the F18-fimbriated E. coli-induced diarrhea/edema is the initial attachment of the bacteria to a specific receptor (F18R) on the porcine intestinal epithelium. However, some pigs are resistant to colonization by F18-fimbriated E. coli, due to lack of F18R expression. The F18R status of pigs is genetically determined (12Bertschinger H.U. Stamm M. Vögeli P. Vet. Microbiol. 1993; 35: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), with the gene controlling expression of F18R mapped to the halothane linkage group on pig chromosome 6 (13Vögeli P. Bertschinger H.U. Stamm M. Stricker C. Hagger C. Fries R. Rapacz J. Stranzinger G. Anim. Genet. 1996; 27: 321-328PubMed Google Scholar, 14Meijerink E. Fries R. Vögeli P. Masabanda J. Wigger G. Stricker C. Neuenschwander S. Bertschinger H.U. Stranzinger G. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 736-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This locus contained two candidate genes, FUT1 and FUT2, both encoding α2-fucosyltransferases. Expression analysis of these two genes in the porcine small intestine revealed that the FUT2 gene is differentially expressed, whereas the FUT1 gene is expressed in all examined pigs (15Meijerink E. Neuenschwander S. Fries R. Dinter A. Bertschinger H.U. Stranzinger G. Vögeli P. Immunogenetics. 2000; 52: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the FUT1 gene of pigs being either susceptible or resistant to infection by F18-fimbriated E. coli showed a polymorphism (G or A) at nucleotide 307. Presence of the A nucleotide on both alleles (FUT1A/A genotype) led to significantly reduced enzyme activity, corresponding to the F18-fimbriated E. coli-resistant genotype, whereas susceptible pigs had either the heterozygous FUT1G/A or the homozygous FUT1G/G genotype. These findings have led to the development of a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism test to differentiate between F18R-positive and F18R-negative pigs. Although substantial information exists regarding the genetics of F18R, the identity and nature of the F18R molecule have remained unclear. In this report, F18R was found to be of glycosphingolipid nature. Consequently, a collection of glycosphingolipids from various sources was tested for binding with F18-fimbriated E. coli, demonstrating a specific interaction of recombinant F18-expressing bacteria with blood group ABH determinants on type 1 core chains. The role of the FedF adhesin in this binding process was defined by using a FedF-negative mutant strain (5Imberechts H. Wild P. Charlier G. De Greve H. Lintermans P. Pohl P. Microb. Pathog. 1996; 21: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the F18R structure could provide better insights into the interactions between F18-fimbriated E. coli and the porcine gut, and may, additionally, lead to the design of potent inhibitors of adherence for use in anti-adhesive therapy (16Wellens A.

Subsequently, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.3). The concentration of bacteria in the suspension was determined by measuring the optical density at 660 nm (A660).

For metabolic labeling, the culture plates were supplemented with 10 μl of [35S]methionine (400 μCi, Amersham Biosciences). Bacteria were harvested, washed three times in PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% (w/v) NaN3, and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 (BSA/PBS/Tween) to a bacterial density of 1 × 108 colony forming units/ml. The specific activity of bacterial suspensions was ∼1 cpm per 100 bacteria. The same conditions (with omission of ampicillin) were used for culture and labeling of the background E. coli strain HB101. The physio-chemical properties of F18R on porcine small intestinal villous enterocytes was investigated using an in vitro villous adhesion inhibition assay (18Cox E. Houvenaghel A. Vet.

Briefly, a 20-cm intestinal segment was collected from the mid jejunum of a euthanized pig, rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (160 mm, pH 7,4) containing 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the villi were gently scraped from the mucosae with a glass slide and stored in Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 4 °C. Treatment of villi with acetone, methanol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaIO4 in 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, or 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, without NaIO4, respectively, was performed at room temperature on a rotating wheel in a volume of 500 μl during 1 h. Next, the villi were washed six times with Krebs-Henseleit buffer followed by addition of 4 × 108 bacteria of the F18-positive reference E. coli strain (107/86), or the F4ac-expressing E. coli strain GIS 26, to an average of 50 villi in a total volume of 500 μl of PBS, supplemented with 1% (w/v) d-mannose to prevent adhesion mediated by type 1 pili. These mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h while being gently shaken. Villi were examined by phase-contrast microscopy at a magnification of 600, and the number of bacteria adhering along a 50-μm brush border was quantitatively evaluated by counting the number of adhering bacteria at 20 randomly selected places, after which the mean bacterial adhesion was calculated. Total acid and non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were prepared as described before (20Teneberg S. Willemsen P. de Graaf F.K. Stenhagen G. Pimlott W. Jovall P.-Å. Ångström J. Karlsson K.-A. J.

Willemsen P. de Graaf F.K. Stenhagen G. Pimlott W. Jovall P.-Å. Ångström J. Karlsson K.-A. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 560-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Aluminum- or glass-backed silica gel 60 high-performance TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for TLC and eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume) as the solvent system. The different glycosphingolipids were applied to the plates in quantities of 0.002–4 μg of pure glycosphingolipids, and 40 μg of glycosphingolipid mixtures. Chemical detection was done with anisaldehyde (21Waldi D. Stahl E. Dünnschicht-Chromatographie. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1962: 496-515Google Scholar). Binding of radiolabeled bacteria to glycosphingolipids on thin-layer chromatograms was done as described before (20Teneberg S. Willemsen P. de Graaf F.K. Stenhagen G. Pimlott W. Jovall P.-Å. Ångström J. Karlsson K.-A. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 560-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Dried chromatograms were dipped in diethylether/n-hexane (1:5 v/v) containing 0.5% (w/v) polyisobutylmethacrylate for 1 min, dried, and then blocked with BSA/PBS/Tween for 2 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the plates were incubated with 35S-labeled bacteria (1–5 × 106 cpm/ml) diluted in BSA/PBS/Tween for another 2 h at room temperature. After washing six times with PBS, and drying, the thin-layer plates were autoradiographed for 12 h using XAR-5 x-ray films (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Chromatogram binding assays with monoclonal antibodies directed against the blood group A determinant (DakoCytomation Norden A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) were done as described (22Hansson G.C. Karlsson K-A. Larson G. McKibbin J.M. Blaszczyk M. Herlyn M. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4091-4097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 125I-labeled anti-mouse antibodies for detection. Non-acid glycosphingolipids were isolated from mucosal scrapings from porcine small intestines as described (20Teneberg S. Willemsen P. de Graaf F.K. Stenhagen G. Pimlott W. Jovall P.-Å. Ångström J. Karlsson K.-A. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 560-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mucosal scrapings were lyophilized and then extracted in two steps in a Soxhlet apparatus with chloroform and methanol (2:1 and 1:9, by volume, respectively). The material obtained was subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis and dialysis, followed by separation on a silicic acid column. Acid and non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were obtained by chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column. To separate the non-acid glycolipids from alkali-stable phospholipids, this fraction was acetylated and separated on a second silicic acid column, followed by deacetylation and dialysis. Final purifications were done by chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose and silicic acid columns. The total non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions obtained were thereafter separated, as described below. Throughout the separation procedures aliquots of the fractions obtained were analyzed by TLC, and fractions that were colored green by anisaldehyde were tested for binding of F18-fimbriated E. coli using the chromatogram binding assay. Blood Group O Pig Intestinal Mucosa-A total non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction (148 mg) from blood group O pig intestinal mucosa was first separated on a silicic acid column eluted with increasing volumes of methanol in chloroform. Thereby, an F18-fimbriated E. coli binding fraction containing tetraglycosylceramides and more slow-migrating compounds (22 mg) was obtained. This fraction was further separated on an Iatrobeads (Iatrobeads 6RS-8060; Iatron Laboratories, Tokyo) column (10 g), first eluted with chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume), 10 × 5 ml, followed by chloroform/methanol/water (40:40:12, by volume), 2 × 10 ml. The F18-fimbriated E. coli binding compound eluted in fractions 3 and 4, and after pooling of these fractions 6.7 mg was obtained. This material was acetylated and further separated on an Iatrobeads column (2 g), eluted with increasing volumes of methanol in chloroform. After deacetylation and dialysis, 6.0 mg of pure F18-binding glycosphingolipid (designated fraction O-I) was obtained. Blood Group A Pig Intestinal Mucosa-A total non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction (183 mg) from blood group A pig intestinal mucosa was initially separated on a silicic acid column eluted with increasing volumes of methanol in chloroform. Pooling of fractions containing tetraglycosylceramides and more slowly migrating compounds yielded 51.2 mg. This material was further separated by high-performance liquid chromatography on a 1.0- × 25-cm silica column (Kromasil Silica, 10-μm particles, Skandinaviska Genetec, Kungsbacka, Sweden) eluted with a linear gradient of chloroform/methanol/water (70:25:4 to 40:40:12, by volume) during 180 min and with a flow of 2 ml/min. The fractions obtained were pooled according to mobility on thin-layer chromatograms and F18-fimbriated E. coli binding activity. Thereby, six F18-fimbriated E. coli binding fractions were obtained, designated fraction A-I (12.6 mg), A-II (3.6 mg), A-III (0.3 mg), A-IV (0.5 mg), A-V (0.2 mg), and A-VI (0.2 mg), respectively. Negative ion FAB mass spectra were recorded on a JEOL SX-102A mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The ions were produced by 6 keV xenon atom bombardment using triethanolamine (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) as matrix and an accelerating voltage of –10 kV. Endoglycoceramidase II from Rhodococcus spp. (23Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9510-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Takara Bio Europe S.A., Gennevilliers, France) was used for hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids. Briefly, 50 μg of F18-fimbriated E. coli binding fraction O-I from blood group O porcine intestinal mucosa, H type 1 pentaglycosylceramide from human meconium, and H type 2 pentaglycosylceramide from human erythrocytes were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 120 μg of sodium cholate, and sonicated briefly. Thereafter, 1 milliunit of endoglycoceramidase II was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol/water to the final proportions 8:4:3 (by volume). The oligosaccharide-containing upper phase thus obtained was separated from detergent on a Sep-Pak QMA cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). The eluant containing the oligosaccharides was dried under nitrogen and under vacuum. For LC/MS the glycosphingolipid-derived saccharides were separated on a column (200 × 0.180 mm) packed in-house with 5-μm porous graphite particles (Hypercarb, Thermo Scientific), and eluted with a linear gradient from 0%B to 45%B in 46 min (Solvent A: 8 mm NH4HCO3; Solvent B: 20% 8 mm NH4HCO3/80% acetonitrile (by volume)). Eluted saccharides were analyzed in the negative mode on an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA), using Xcalibur software. 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian 600-MHz spectrometer at 30 °C. Samples were dissolved in DMSO/D2O (98:2, by volume) after deuterium exchange. The ability of soluble oligosaccharides to interfere with the binding of F18-fimbriated E. coli to porcine small intestinal cells was evaluated in the in vitro villous adhesion assay. The F18-positive E. coli strain 107/86 (8 × 107 bacteria) was incubated with different concentrations (10 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml, 100 μg/ml) of blood group H type 1 pentasaccharide (Fucα2Galβ3GlcNAcβ3-Galβ4Glc) or lacto-N-tetraose saccharide (Galβ3GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glc) (Glycoseparations, Moscow, Russia) in a final volume of 100 μl of PBS, for 1 h at room temperature, while being gently shaken. The mixtures were then added to the villi, and again incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. Thereafter, the villi were examined by phase-contrast microscopy, and adhering bacteria were quantitated as described above. Villi of two different F18R-positive pigs were used, and the counts were performed in triplicate. The pigs used were found to be blood group H type 1 and 2 positive, and blood group A type 2 negative, by indirect immunofluorescence using blood group-specific monoclonal antibodies (clone 17-206, GeneTex, Inc., San Antonio, TX; clone 92FR-A2, Abcam, Cambridge, UK; clone 29.1 Sigma-Aldrich), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary anti-mouse antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). To examine the physiochemical characteristics of F18R, intestinal villi isolated from four pigs were treated with different agents that affect lipids or carbohydrates on the cell membrane. Treatment was followed by assessment of adhesion of F18-fimbriated E. coli to the villus epithelium. The adhesion of F18-fimbriated E. coli to porcine intestinal villi was completely abolished after treatment with acetone, methanol, 1% Triton X-100, and NaIO4 (Fig. 1), suggesting that F18R is a glycolipid. In contrast, the adhesion of the control F4ac-fimbriated E. coli strain, having a glycoprotein receptor (24Erickson A.K. Baker D.R. Bosworth B.T. Casey T.A. Benfield D.A. Francis D.H. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5404-5410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was only abolished by incubation with NaIO4, whereas treatment with acetone, methanol, and 1% Triton X-100 had no or only little effect. The suggested glycolipid binding of F18-fimbriated E. coli was next investigated by binding to glycosphingolipids separated on thin-layer plates. The initial screening for F18-fimbriated E. coli carbohydrate-binding activity was done by using mixtures of glycosphingolipids from various sources, to expose the bacteria to a large number of potentially binding-active carbohydrate structures. Thereby, a distinct binding of the F18-expressing E. coli strain HB101(pIH120) to slow migrating minor non-acid glycosphingolipids from black and white rat intestine was obtained (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Notably, these compounds were not recognized by the E. coli strain HB101(pIH126), having a deletion of the FedF adhesin (Fig. 2C). A weak binding of both the F18-expressing strain HB101(pIH120) and the FedF deletion strain HB101(pIH126) to the major compound (gangliotriaosylceramide) of the non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction of guinea pig erythrocytes (lane 3) was also observed. Binding to this gangliotriaosylceramide was also obtained with the HB101 background strain (not shown) and was most likely due to the relatively large amounts of this compound on the thin-layer chromatograms. A characteristic feature of black and white rat intestine is the presence of glycosphingolipids with blood group A determinants on type 1 (Galβ3GlcNAc) core chains, whereas in white rat intestine blood group A-terminated glycosphingolipids are absent (25Breimer M.E. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 257: 557-568Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). When binding of the F18-positive strain HB101-(pIH120) to non-acid glycosphingolipids from white rat intestine was examined (Fig. 3, lane 5), no binding of the bacteria to this fraction (lane 5) occurred, in contrast to the distinct binding of the bacteria to the non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction from black and white rat intestine (Fig. 3B, lane 4). A further observation was the absence of binding of the F18-fimbriated bacteria to the non-acid glycosphingolipids from human blood group A, B, or O erythrocytes (lanes 1–3), where the predominant glycosphingolipids with blood group A, B, and H determinants have type 2 (Galβ4GlcNAc) core chains (26Koscielak J. Plasek A. Górniak H. Gardas A. Gregor A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 37: 214-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Stellner K. Watanabe K. Hakomori S.-i.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7075-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Once again, no glycosphingolipid was recognized by the FedF deletion mutant HB101(pIH126) (Fig. 3C). In summary, the binding of the F18-fimbriated bacteria to slow migrating minor non-acid glycosphingolipids from black and white rat intestine suggested a specific recognition of blood group determinants on type 1 core chains. Furthermore, the absence of binding of the FedF deletion mutant to these compounds indicated an involvement of the FedF protein in the interaction. Binding assays using pure reference glycosphingolipids in defined amounts confirmed the suggested binding of F18-fimbriated E. coli to blood group determinants on type 1 core chains. The results are exemplified in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 1. Thus, the F18-expressing E. coli bound to all glycosphingolipids with blood group A, B, or H determinants on type 1 core chains, as the H type 1 pentaglycosylceramide (Fucα2Galβ3GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer, 5The glycosphingolipid nomenclature follows the recommendations by the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN for Lipids (65Chester M.A. Eur.

In contrast, no type 2 core counterparts of these compounds were recognized by the F18-fimbriated bacteria, as the H type 2 pentaglycosylceramide (Fucα2Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer, Fig. 4, lane 2), the B type 2 hexaglycosylceramide (Galα3(Fucα2)Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer, Fig. 4, lane 4), the A type 2 hexaglycosylceramide (GalNAcα3(Fucα2)Galβ4GlcNAcβ3 Galβ4Glcβ1Cer, Fig. 4, lane 6), or the A type 2 heptaglycosylceramide (GalNAcα3(Fucα2)Galβ4(Fucα4)GlcNAcβ3 Galβ4Glcβ1Cer, Fig. 4, lane 8).TABLE 1Binding of 35S-labeled recombinant F18 fimbriae-expressing E. coli (pIH120) and recombinant E. coli expressing F18 fimbriae with deletion of the tip subunit (pIH126), to glycosphingolipids on thin-layer chromatogramsNo. and trivial nameStructurepIH120pIH126Simple compounds1) GalactosylceramideGalβ1Cer-aBinding is defined as follows: +++ denotes a binding when <0.1 μg of the glycosphingolipid was applied on the thin-layer chromatogram, whereas ++ denotes a binding when <1 μg of the glycosphingolipid was applied, + denotes a binding at 1-2 μg, and - denotes no binding even at 4 μg.-2) GlucosylceramideGlcβ1Cer--3) SulfatideSO3-3Galβ1Cer--4) LacCer (d18:1-16:0-24:0)bIn the shorthand nomenclature for fatty acids and bases, the number before the colon refers to the carbon chain length, and the number after"
https://openalex.org/W2055584624,"Ca2+-Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an abundant synaptic protein that was recently shown to regulate the organization of actin filaments leading to structural modifications of synapses. CaMKII is a dodecameric complex with a special architecture that provides it with unique potential for organizing the actin cytoskeleton. We report using biochemical assays that the β isoform of CaMKII binds to and bundles actin filaments, and the disposition of βCaMKII within the actin bundles was revealed by cryoelectron tomography. In addition, βCaMKII was found to inhibit actin polymerization, suggesting that it either serves as a capping protein or binds monomeric actin, reducing the amount of freely available monomers to nucleate polymer assembly. By means of fluorescent cross-correlation spectroscopy, we determined that βCaMKII does indeed bind to monomeric actin, reaching saturation at a stoichiometry of 12:1 actin monomers per βCaMKII holoenzyme with a binding constant of 2.4 × 105 m–1. In cells, βCaMKII has a dual functional role; it can sequester monomeric actin to reduce actin polymerization and can also bundle actin filaments. Together, these effects would impact both the dynamics of actin filament assembly and enhance the rigidity of the filaments once formed, significantly impacting the structure of synapses.

Actin and more than 60 different classes of actin-binding proteins form an abundant and highly regulated cytoskeletal network, constituting more than 25% of protein in non-muscle cells and over 60% in muscle cells (1Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 3-14Google Scholar). Actin is estimated to be ∼4 mg/ml in cells, with half found in the polymerized F-actin state and the remainder in the soluble G-actin state (2Bean A. Protein Trafficking in Neurons. Elsevier/Academic Press, Amsterdam2007: 3-27Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Actin undergoes rounds of polymerization and depolymerization from a soluble (G-actin) pool to a filamentous (F-actin) pool, and it is the kinetics of these forward and backward rates that determines the stability of the actin cytoskeleton. The various actin-binding proteins are, in part, responsible for regulating the kinetics of actin polymerization and depolymerization. Actin is commonly known for its structural and dynamic function in cells, such as its role in muscle contraction and cell locomotion, and has been similarly implicated for its structural role at synapses in the nervous system (3Matus A. Science. 2000; 290: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 4Matus A. Brinkhaus H. Wagner U. Hippocampus. 2000; 10: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For example, actin is proposed to serve an important role in coordinating the delivery of synaptic vesicles to the pre-synaptic terminal that appear to underlie certain forms of plasticity mediated by alterations in the probability of stimulus evoked vesicle release (5Colicos M.A. Collins B.E. Sailor M.J. Goda Y. Cell. 2001; 107: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 6Chi P. Greengard P. Ryan T.A. Nat.

Additionally, several recent studies have demonstrated the importance of actin dynamics in structural reorganization of the post-synaptic spine compartment of excitatory synapses (8Fukazawa Y.

A. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Several pools of actin have been identified within spines with different turnover rates, and activation of glutamate receptors on the spines regulates the kinetics of actin turnover (9Honkura N. Matsuzaki M. Noguchi J. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Neuron. 2008; 57: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 10Okamoto K. Narayanan R. Lee S.H. Murata K.

Spine shape changes have been proposed to underlie forms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (8Fukazawa Y. Saitoh Y. Ozawa F. Ohta Y. Mizuno K. Inokuchi K.

Hayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CaMKII is an abundant synaptic protein concentrated in postsynaptic spines. The enzyme is a 12-subunit complex (11Kolodziej S.J. Hudmon A. Waxham M.N. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14354-14359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) that has been proposed as a scaffolding molecule engaged in molecular complex formation within synapses (12Kennedy M.B. Science. 2000; 290: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 13Swulius M.T. Waxham M.N. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2637-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). There are four genes (α, β, γ, and δ) in mammalian cells that encode different isoforms of CaMKII (14Gaertner T.R. Kolodziej S.J. Wang D. Kobayashi R. Koomen J.M. Stoops J.K. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12484-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, the most abundant in the brain are α and β. Altogether they constitute ∼2% of the total hippocampal protein in rat brain (15Erondu N.E. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a concentration that suggests the kinase plays more than an enzymatic role. The first study of a possible interaction between actin and CaMKII was performed by Ohta et al. (16Ohta Y. Nishida E. Sakai H. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) who showed that brain CaMKII interacts with filamentous actin (F-actin) and that Ca2+/CaM-binding to the enzyme antagonizes actin binding. Shen et al. (17Shen K. Teruel M.N. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Neuron. 1998; 21: 593-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) confirmed and extended these observations by identifying that it is the β isoform of CaMKII that is responsible for targeting the enzyme to F-actin in cell culture models and in neurons. Further, βCaMKII overexpression and/or knockdown using RNA interference induced an actin-dependent change in synaptic volume (10Okamoto K. Narayanan R. Lee S.H. Murata K. Hayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18Lin Y.C. Redmond L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schulman H. Meyer T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 283-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Studies have also identified that whereas oligomerization of βCaMKII is essential for actin binding, catalytic activity is not (10Okamoto K. Narayanan R. Lee S.H. Murata K. Hayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18Lin Y.C. Redmond L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 15791-15796Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Okamoto et al. (10Okamoto K. Narayanan R. Lee S.H. Murata K. Hayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) also show that βCaMKII can bundle actin filaments; however, they report that the enzyme does not affect actin polymerization. These observations are similar to those reported by O’Leary et al. (20O’Leary H. Lasda E. Bayer K.U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4656-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) who describe the bundling of actin filaments by βCaMKII and identify the domain responsible for this bundling to be in the N-terminal area of the variable domain of CaMKII, just C-terminal to the CaM-binding domain. A similar domain is also identified for actin binding in the studies of Okamoto et al. (10Okamoto K. Narayanan R. Lee S.H. Murata K. Hayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and Lin and Redmond (18Lin Y.C. Redmond L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 15791-15796Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Clearly, cellular actin dynamics are significantly impacted by CaMKII, and it appears that the βCaMKII isoform plays a critical role in these dynamics at synapses in the brain and possibly in other tissue in which they are also abundant. What is less clear is how βCaMKII can produce this plethora of effects on actin dynamics, as it’s only identified biochemical impact is to bundle actin filaments. In this report, we present results that extend the impact of the biochemical interactions of βCaMKII with the F-actin system and identify that βCaMKII binds monomeric actin and inhibit actin polymerization in addition to its role in F-actin bundling. We demonstrate using stain and cryoelectron tomographic reconstructions the disposition of βCaMKII within actin bundles. We also show, contrary to what has been described in previous work (10Okamoto K. Narayanan R. Lee S.H. Murata K. Hayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), that βCaMKII is capable of reducing the rate of actin polymerization, decreasing the assembly of F-actin. Furthermore, by means of fluorescent cross-correlation spectroscopy we have determined that βCaMKII binds to monomeric actin (G-actin), consistent with its ability to impact actin polymerization. Similar to binding to F-actin, βCaMKII binding to G-actin is diminished by Ca2+/CaM binding to the enzyme. In conclusion, βCaMKII has a dual functional role: it can sequester monomeric actin to reduce actin polymerization, impacting the cytoskeleton turn-over dynamics, and it can also bundle actin filaments presumably enhancing the structural rigidity of the filamentous actin system. These functions appear responsible, in part, for the reorganization and stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton at synapses and presumably other cells. Unlabeled actin was purified from frozen rabbit skeletal muscle (Ted Pella Inc.) following a modified version of the protocol described in Feuer et al. (22Feuer G. Molnar F. Pettko E. Straub F.B. Hung. Acta Physiol. 1948; 1: 150-163PubMed Google Scholar). This purification procedure depends on the differential salt solubility of actin and myosin, which comprise most of the protein of the contractile apparatus. Tropomyosin was removed by treating the F-actin with 0.8 m KCl, and pure actin was collected by two cycles of polymerization, ultracentrifugation, and depolymerization. The final preparation was dialyzed into Buffer A (5 mm Tris, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0) and kept at –80 °C for further use. The concentration of actin was determined using a micro-BCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co.) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The preparations were more than 90% pure actin when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 1). For the cross-correlation experiments described below, actin labeled with Alexa 647 was obtained from Invitrogen (Molecular Probes, catalog No. A-34051). The expression of all CaMKII constructs used in the present manuscript was accomplished using the baculovirus system as described previously (23Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purification of the kinase was also accomplished as described previously (23Putkey J.A. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29619-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with the last step entailing chromatography on a CaM-Sepharose affinity matrix and dialysis into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The description of the chimeric construct of the α isoform of CaMKII with an eGFP tag on the N terminus was described previously (24Kim S.A. Heinze K.G. Waxham M.N. Schwille P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A chimeric construct of eGFP on the N terminus of βCaMKII was obtained in an identical fashion by first inserting the full-length coding sequence of the βCaMKII cDNA into the eGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech). Then the eGFP-βCaMKII sequence was subcloned into the pFastBac-1 baculovirus expression plasmid (Invitrogen). All other procedures for the production of virus, the expression of protein in Sf21 insect cells, and purification of the enzyme were exactly as described for eGFP-αCaMKII (24Kim S.A. Heinze K.G. Waxham M.N. Schwille P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Kim S.A. Heinze K.G. Bacia K. Waxham M.N. Schwille P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 4319-4336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purified eGFP-βCaMKII exhibited a specific activity of 7 μmol/min/mg (not significantly different than βCaMKII) and migrated as an oligomeric complex on Sepharose 6 gel filtration chromatography. Before each use, samples were thawed and spun at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove aggregates. To produce F-actin, a stock of G-actin was first prepared by depolymerizing a freshly thawed aliquot of actin in G-buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP) for 2 h on ice. The sample was then centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 14,000 rpm in a Beckman Microphage, and the supernatant containing G-actin was removed. F-actin was prepared by polymerizing the G-actin by adding 110th volume of a 10× polymerization buffer that brought the final concentrations of reactants to 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. The reactions were done at room temperature for 2 h. Then, aliquots of F-actin were placed into polystyrene tubes for the TLA 120.1 rotor, and samples of CaMKII (clarified at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C) were added and further incubated for 60 min at room temperature. All samples were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g (max.) for 1 h at 22 °C in a TL1 tabletop Ultracentrifuge. The supernatant and pellet from each sample were collected and diluted with SDS-sample buffer. All fractions were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and the distribution of proteins between supernatant and pellet was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. We discovered under these reaction conditions, even at this relatively low g-force, that some CaMKII could be recovered in the pellet even without added F-actin. Further increasing the g-force exacerbated this nonspecific sedimentation of the kinase. Actin polymerization was assessed using fluorescence changes from pyrene-labeled actin using a kit purchased through Cytoskeleton Inc (catalog No. B003). Fluorescence was monitored at room temperature in a PTI fluorimeter with 350 nm excitation and 405 nm emission. Excitation and emission slit widths were 1 and 10 nm, respectively. To minimize photobleaching over the long time course of these experiments, the samples were moved in and out of the light pathway using a four-position automated sample turret. Measurements for each sample were for 1 s every 15 or 30 s for the duration of the experiments. In this assay, polymerization of pyrene-actin produces a time-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity. A stock of pyrene-labeled G-actin was prepared as described in the binding assay, except that depolymerization was permitted to occur overnight at 4 °C to induce complete depolymerization. If this was not done, the base-line fluorescence in the assay decreased throughout the day as more of the pyrene-labeled actin depolymerized. Pyrene-labeled G-actin (0.25 μm final concentration) was added to the cuvettes in G-buffer at room temperature, and a 5-min base line was collected. CaMKII (1.0 μm concentration of subunits; 0.08 μm holoenzyme) or an equivalent amount of control buffer was added to the appropriate cuvette and incubated for an additional 10 min. Then, an aliquot of 10× polymerization buffer was added, and the change in fluorescence intensity was monitored for up to 8000 s. The final concentrations of reagents, following the addition of the 10× polymerization buffer, were 12.5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 mm ATP. We discovered that the impact of βCaMKII on the polymerization of actin was dependent on these reaction conditions. If full-strength polymerization buffer was used (final concentration of reagents was 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP), the impact of βCaMKII on polymerization was only modest, as reported previously (10Okamoto K. Narayanan R. Lee S.H. Murata K. Hayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6418-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We borrowed the suggestion from the Cytoskeleton Inc. manual to vary the amount of 10× polymerization buffer used previously to show the impact of cofilin on actin polymerization. Actin bundles, prepared as described in the F-actin sedimentation assay, were diluted 1:10 in actin polymerization buffer, and 4 μl of the reaction mix was placed onto a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid (200 mesh). After 30 s, excess sample was wicked from the grid and then stained twice with 2% uranyl acetate. Excess stain was wicked away, and the sample was allowed to dry before imaging in a JEOL 1200 electron microscope (running at 120 kV). Images were collected on a 1000 × 1000 pixel Gatan CCD camera. To produce cryoelectron tomograms, a similar procedure was used to prepare actin/CaMKII bundles, only the ratio of βCaMKII to actin was doubled. A 5-μl sample was then applied to a freshly glow-discharged Quantifoil grid (EMS R2/2) and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane maintained at –170 °C. Frozen specimens were imaged at liquid nitrogen temperatures using a Polara electron microscope (FEI Co.) equipped with a 4000 × 4000 pixel CCD camera. The microscope was operated at 300 kV and a magnification of ×39,000, resulting in an effective pixel size of 4.6 Å after 2 × 2 binning. Low-dose single-axis tilt series were collected at a defocus of –6 μm, and the cumulative dose was ∼100 e-/Å2 from 131 images in the range of ±65°. Tilt series were initially aligned with fiducial markers using IMOD (26Kremer J.R. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (3413) Google Scholar) and then further refined by using projection matching as implemented in the package Protomo (27Winkler H. Taylor K.A. Ultramicroscopy. 2006; 106: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After refinement, three-dimensional cryoelectron tomograms were reconstructed using weighted-back projection. The data shown in Fig. 2B are representative of 30 tomographic reconstructions. FCCS was achieved by using a pulsed titanium sapphire (Mira 900) pumped by a 5-watt Verdi laser. The wavelength was set at 830 nm with a pulse of 130 fs. The beam was coupled to an inverted microscope (Olympus IX-71) with adaptive optics to overfill the back aperture of a water immersion objective (Olympus UPlanApo/IR 60×/1.20W). On top of the objective a mixed solution of the sample was loaded into 25-μl assay chips (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with flat-bottom glass No. 1. Details on the one-color setup can be found elsewhere (28Iyer V. Rossow M. Waxham M.N. J. Opt. Soc. Am. B. 2006; 23: 1420-1433Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Sanabria H. Kubota Y. Waxham M.N. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 313-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The two-color detection system contains a dichroic mirror (Chroma, Inc, 600 DCXXR) that allows transmission of the “red” light with a band pass filter (Chroma, HQ 675/50) and reflection of the “green” light with a band pass filter (Chroma, HQ 525/50). Behind the bandpass filters are two fiber optics, each coupled to an avalanche photon detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, SPCM CD 3101). Data from 10 consecutive takes of 60 s each were collected via an external correlator board and further analyzed using an in-house fitting graphical user interface developed in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) with either a one- or two-component model of the autocorrelation function as follows. G(τ)=∑I=1p≤2G1(0)M1(τ)=∑I=1p≤2G1(0)11+ττD1·11+τs2τD1Eq. 1 Gl(0) is the amplitude of correspondent diffusive fraction (l). Ml(τ) is the temporal decay of the correlation function describing the molecules diffusing through the same laser spot (30Schwille P. Meyer-Almes F.J. Rigler R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1878-1886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Schwille P. Heinze K.G. Chemphyschem. 2001; 2: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The characteristic time of diffusion (τD1) is related to the diffusion coefficient D, D1 = ωo2/8τD1, where ωo (ωo = 323 nm) is the waist of the detection volume. s, in this case s = 6 is the ratio of the axial axis over the radial axis of the detection volume assumed to be a three-dimensional Gaussian. These parameters were established with control dyes (green channel, Rhodamine 110; red channel, Alexa 647) for which the concentrations and diffusion coefficients were known. An additional calibration for cross-correlation was accomplished by taking a dye (Alexa 546) in which emission is collected in both channels simultaneously, searching for the best possible overlap between the correlation function of each channel with the cross-correlation. This procedure ensures that the detection volume (Veff = 0.4 fl) is the same for both channels. In the idealized case where there is a perfect spectral separation of the red and green signal, and assuming that the only molecular association is given by the union of the two different labeled molecules, the amplitudes of correlation functions, or the extrapolation of Gr,g,x when τ → 0, can be written as follows. Gg(0)=1Veff(〈Cg〉+〈Crg〉)Eq. 2 Gr(0)=1Veff(〈Cr〉+〈Crg〉)Eq. 3 Gx(0)=〈Crg〉Veff(〈Cg〉+〈Crg〉)·(〈Cr〉+〈Crg〉)Eq. 4 where Cr and Cg are the local concentrations of the unbound reactants and Crg of the bound complex (25Kim S.A. Heinze K.G. Bacia K. Waxham M.N. Schwille P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 4319-4336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For a known calibrated volume (Veff), the concentration of double-labeled molecules can be derived without any diffusion analysis. 〈Crg〉=Gx(0)[Veff·(Gr(0)Gg(0))]Eq. 5 In the simplest case of a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, the ratio of the amplitudes of the cross-correlation and autocorrelation of the ligand can be used to monitor ν, which represents the fraction of the green population bound to a red molecule. Mathematically this is expressed as ν=Gx(0)Gr(0)=〈Crg〉〈Cg〉+〈Crg〉 When there is no binding, Gx(0) reduces to zero (when the cross-talk signal has been minimized, as was the attempt in our experiment). A general case for a distribution of binding with n binding sites was also developed by Kim et al. (25Kim S.A. Heinze K.G. Bacia K. Waxham M.N. Schwille P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 4319-4336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and is summarized in the following equations using the amplitudes Gr,g,x(0). Gg(0)=∑i=0nCi·Qi2Veff∑i=0nCiQi2Eq. 7 Gr(0)=Cr+qR2∑i=0nCi·i2VeffCr+qR∑i=0nCi·i2Eq. 8 Gx(0)=qR∑i=0nCi·Qi·iVeff∑i=0nCi·QiCr+qR∑i=0nCi·iEq. 9 Cr is the concentration of free ligand and Ci the concentration of the different molecular complexes formed between green and red molecules. Ci can be expressed as Ci=Cg,tniK·Cri(1+K·Cr)nEq. 10 where Cg,t corresponds to the total concentration of green molecules (free and bound) and K is the binding constant in m–1. The parameter Qi is the “green” quenching factor varying with i red molecules bound and can be expressed in terms of the quenching of the molecular brightness of the green molecule, qg = n′/n0, where n′ is the molecular brightness when there is ligand bound and η0 is in the absence of ligand, so that Qi=1+in*(qg-1)Eq. 11 This equation holds as generalization for the case in which the number of effective binding sites, n*, is different from the maximum number of potential sites, n* ≠ n, because of steric hindrances; in this case we have assumed n* = n = 12. The parameter qR is the quenching factor on the molecular brightness of the red molecule upon binding and can be obtained by finding the limit at which the saturation is obtained as the concentration of ligand goes to infinity, limligand→∞Grg(0)Gr(0)=n'=qrnEq. 12 where n′ is the experimental number of sites that itself is a function of the true number of binding sites n. We used Mathematica 4.2 (Wolfram Research) to solve Equations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 numerically when the amplitudes (Gr,g,rg(0)), the quench factors, and the effective volume were known. Then we could calculate the distribution of binding per site as ν'=Ci/Cg,t* To solve Equations 8, 9, 10, 11 numerically, one needs to make an assumption of the possible number of binding sites on the enzyme. This value can be extracted experimentally if we consider that the following binding polynomial holds between the concentration of green enzyme [g] and the concentration of red actin [r], [g]O=[g]+[rg]=[g](1+K[r]) where the binding polynomial O for n′ independent sites, assuming the same K for each site, is the nth product or (1 + K[r])n′. Then we can find the Langmuir equation that defines the reaction as θ=νn'=K[r](1+K[r]) where ν represent the number of ligands bounds per enzyme. Equation 16 can be linearized as [r]ν=1n'K+1n'[r]Eq. 16 so that the number of binding sites corresponds to the inverse of the slope and the binding constant, K, is the inverse of the intersect divided by the number of binding sites. One thing to remember is that the experimental n′ and true n are related by the quench factor, as in Equation 12, in the limit where there is an excess of ligand. Assuming n = 12 and obtaining n′ experimentally, we can extract the quenching factor on the red channel, qr, to minimize bias on the analysis. F-actin binding can be assessed simply by forming actin filaments, adding the unknown protein, and sedimenting the actin filaments at moderate centrifugation speeds. Such a pulldown assay of F-actin was done in presence of the two main neuronal isoforms of CaMKII, α and β. If CaMKII is interacting, the protein is found in the pellet along with F-actin. After centrifugation, the pellet (p) and supernatant (s) fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). On the gel we can see that in the presence of actin, the great majority of βCaMKII was found in the pellet (Fig. 1; see arrowhead), whereas the majority of αCaMKII remained in the supernatant. Controls with actin alone and the α- and βCaMKII alone were analyzed at the same time. Our observation was that, under these reaction conditions, a small fraction of βCaMKII was consistently found in the pellet (Fig. 1, +βCaMKII) in the absence of actin, and the proportion βCaMKII found in the pellet increased with the force of centrifugation (data not shown). This suggests"
https://openalex.org/W2053977509,"The enumeration of the interaction partners of the cellular prion protein, PrP(C), may help clarifying its elusive molecular function. Here we added a carboxy proximal myc epitope tag to PrP(C). When expressed in transgenic mice, PrP(myc) carried a GPI anchor, was targeted to lipid rafts, and was glycosylated similarly to PrP(C). PrP(myc) antagonized the toxicity of truncated PrP, restored prion infectibility of PrP(C)-deficient mice, and was physically incorporated into PrP(Sc) aggregates, indicating that it possessed all functional characteristics of genuine PrP(C). We then immunopurified myc epitope-containing protein complexes from PrP(myc) transgenic mouse brains. Gentle differential elution with epitope-mimetic decapeptides, or a scrambled version thereof, yielded 96 specifically released proteins. Quantitative mass spectrometry with isotope-coded tags identified seven proteins which co-eluted equimolarly with PrP(C) and may represent component of a multiprotein complex. Selected PrP(C) interactors were validated using independent methods. Several of these proteins appear to exert functions in axomyelinic maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2033644275,"Aim The updated mean HbA1c has been used in risk estimates of diabetic complications, but it does not take into account the temporal relationship between HbA1c and diabetic complications. We studied whether the updated mean HbA1c underestimated the risk of diabetic complications. Method Continuous HbA1c curves for 10,000 hypothetical diabetes patients were simulated over an average of 7 years. Simulations were based on HbA1c values encountered in clinical practice. We assumed that each short time interval of the continuous HbA1c curves had a long-lasting effect on diabetic complications, as evidenced by earlier studies. We tested several different HbA1c variables including various profiles, e.g. different duration, of such a long-lasting effect. The predictive power of these variables was compared with that of the updated mean HbA1c. Results The predictive power of the constructed HbA1c variables differed considerably compared to that of the updated mean HbA1c. The risk increase per standard deviation could be almost 100% higher for a constructed predictor than the updated mean HbA1c. Conclusions The importance of good glycemic control in preventing diabetic complications could have been underestimated in earlier hallmark studies by not taking the time-dependent effect of HbA1c into account."
https://openalex.org/W2046601650,"Across cultures, social relationships are often thought of, described, and acted out in terms of physical space (e.g. “close friends” “high lord”). Does this cognitive mapping of social concepts arise from shared brain resources for processing social and physical relationships? Using fMRI, we found that the tasks of evaluating social compatibility and of evaluating physical distances engage a common brain substrate in the parietal cortex. The present study shows the possibility of an analytic brain mechanism to process and represent complex networks of social relationships. Given parietal cortex's known role in constructing egocentric maps of physical space, our present findings may help to explain the linguistic, psychological and behavioural links between social and physical space."
https://openalex.org/W2049252100,"Background Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) is a versatile pathogen with a broad host range. Its association with type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has been recently proposed. Rapid identification of infectious agents such as MAP in diabetic patients at the level of clinics might be helpful in deciphering the role of chronic bacterial infection in the development of autoimmune diseases such as T1DM. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe use of an ELISA method to identify live circulating MAP through the detection of a cell envelope protein, MptD by a specific M13 phage – fMptD. We also used another ELISA format to detect immune response to MptD peptide. Both the methods were tested with blood plasma obtained from T1DM, type-2 diabetes (T2DM) patients and non-diabetic controls. Our results demonstrate MptD and fMptD ELISA assays to be accurate and sensitive to detect MAP bacilli in a large fraction (47.3%) of T1DM patients as compared to non-diabetic controls (12.6%) and those with confirmed T2DM (7.7%). Comparative analysis of ELISA assays performed here with 3 other MAP antigen preparations, namely HbHA, Gsd and whole cell MAP lysates confirmed comparable sensitivity of the MptD peptide and the fMptD based ELISA assays. Moreover, we were successful in demonstrating positive bacterial culture in two of the clinical specimen derived from T1DM patients. Conclusions and Significance The MptD peptide/fMptD based ELISA or similar tests could be suggested as rapid and specific field level diagnostic tests for the identification of MAP in diabetic patients and for finding the explanations towards the occurrence of type-1 or type-2 diabetes in the light of an active infectious trigger."
https://openalex.org/W2020232110,"Synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) functions as a low affinity, fast exocytic Ca(2+) sensor in neurons, where it is activated by Ca(2+) influx through voltage-gated channels. Targeted insertion of lacZ into the mouse syt2 locus reveals expression in mucin-secreting goblet cells of the airways. In these cells, rapid Ca(2+) entry from the extracellular medium does not contribute significantly to stimulated secretion (Davis, C. W., and Dickey, B. F. (2008) Annu. Rev. Physiol. 70, 487-512). Nonetheless, Syt2(-/-) mice show a severe defect in acute agonist-stimulated airway mucin secretion, and Syt2(+/-) mice show a partial defect. In contrast to Munc13-2(-/-) mice (Zhu, Y., Ehre, C., Abdullah, L. H., Sheehan, J. K., Roy, M., Evans, C. M., Dickey, B. F., and Davis, C. W. (2008) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 586, 1977-1992), Syt2(-/-) mice show no spontaneous mucin accumulation, consistent with the inhibitory action of Syt2 at resting cytoplasmic Ca(2+) in neurons. In human airway goblet cells, inositol trisphosphate receptors are found in rough endoplasmic reticulum that closely invests apical mucin granules, consistent with the known dependence of exocytic Ca(2+) signaling on intracellular stores in these cells. Hence, Syt2 can serve as an exocytic sensor for diverse Ca(2+) signaling systems, and its levels are limiting for stimulated secretory function in airway goblet cells."
https://openalex.org/W2023382136,"A classic physiologic response to hypoxia in humans is the up-regulation of the ERYTHROPOIETIN (EPO) gene, which is the central regulator of red blood cell mass. The EPO gene, in turn, is activated by hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). HIF is a transcription factor consisting of an α subunit (HIF-α) and a β subunit (HIF-β). Under normoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylase domain protein (PHD, also known as HIF prolyl hydroxylase and egg laying-defective nine protein) site specifically hydroxylates HIF-α in a conserved LXXLAP motif (where underlining indicates the hydroxylacceptor proline). This provides a recognition motif for the von Hippel Lindau protein, a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets hydroxylated HIF-α for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, this inherently oxygen-dependent modification is arrested, thereby stabilizing HIF-α and allowing it to activate the EPO gene. We previously identified and characterized an erythrocytosis-associated HIF2A mutation, G537W. More recently, we reported two additional erythrocytosis-associated HIF2A mutations, G537R and M535V. Here, we describe the functional characterization of these two mutants as well as a third novel erythrocytosis-associated mutation, P534L. These mutations affect residues C-terminal to the LXXLAP motif. We find that all result in impaired degradation and thus aberrant stabilization of HIF-2α. However, each exhibits a distinct profile with respect to their effects on PHD2 binding and von Hippel Lindau interaction. These findings reinforce the importance of HIF-2α in human EPO regulation, demonstrate heterogeneity of functional defects arising from these mutations, and point to a critical role for residues C-terminal to the LXXLAP motif in HIF-α.

Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The role of these isoforms in oxygen sensing is an area of active investigation. HIF binds to the promoters and enhancers of a broad range of genes involved in cellular, local, and systemic responses to hypoxia. They include genes that facilitate glucose uptake, enhance glycolysis, inhibit the Krebs cycle, promote angiogenesis, and augment red blood cell production (4Gordan J.D. Simon M.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 5Chowdhury R. Hardy A. Schofield C.J. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2008; 37: 1308-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The latter is mediated by EPO, a glycoprotein that is the product of the EPO gene, which is considered a paradigm of oxygen-regulated gene expression because of its high dynamic range of inducibility and the central importance of this gene for oxygen delivery to tissues (7Stockmann C. Fandrey J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2006; 33: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Jelkmann W. Eur. J. Haematol. 2007; 78: 183-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Aside from addressing the fundamental biologic interest in oxygen-dependent regulation of EPO, this pathway has also provided a framework for understanding certain rare forms of erythrocytosis in which there is abnormally increased red blood cell production due to aberrant up-regulation of EPO (9Lee F.S. Percy M.J. McMullin M.F. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 10Percy M.J. Lee F.S.

Blood Rev. 2008; 22: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The first gene of the oxygen-sensing pathway in which erythrocytosis-associated mutations were identified was the VHL gene (13Ang S.O. Chen H. Hirota K. Gordeuk V.R. Jelinek J. Guan Y. Liu E. Sergueeva A.I. Miasnikova G.Y. Mole D. Maxwell P.H. Stockton D.W. Semenza G.L. Prchal J.T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), followed by mutations in the PHD2 gene (14Percy M.J. Zhao Q. Flores A. Harrison C. Lappin T.R. Maxwell P.H. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we described a mutation of the HIF2A gene in a family with hereditary erythrocytosis (15Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Lucas G.S. Li X. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This mutation, G537W, affects a residue in close proximity to the primary prolyl hydroxylation site in HIF-2α, Pro-531. Functional studies indicated that it impairs both the ability of PHD2 to bind to and hydroxylate HIF-2α, as well as the subsequent capacity of VHL to recognize it. We more recently reported two additional erythrocytosis-associated HIF2A mutations, G537R and M535V (16Percy M.J. Beer P.A. Campbell G. Dekker A.W. Green A.R. Oscier D. Rainey M.G. van Wijk R. Wood M. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. Blood. 2008; 111: 5400-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One of these mutations, G537R, has subsequently been independently identified in other patients with erythrocytosis (17Perrotta S. Della Ragione F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358 (author reply 1966–1967): 1966PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gale D.P. Harten S.K. Reid C.D. Tuddenham E.G. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 2008; 112: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The existence of these new mutations raises questions as to whether they lead to stabilization of HIF-2α, and if so, whether this is due to altered interactions with PHD2 and/or VHL. Such altered interactions might also raise the possibility of dominant negative mechanisms. Our analysis of these mutations as well as a third novel erythrocytosis-associated HIF2A mutation, P534L (19Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Beer P.A. Campbell G. Dekker A.W. Green A.R. Li X. Sutherland S. Oscier D. Rainey M.G. Rivera E. van Wijk R. Wood M. Lappin T.R.J. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. Blood. 2008; 112 (abstr.): 481Crossref Google Scholar), reveals that whereas all mutations result in the aberrant stabilization of HIF-2α, they do so in ways that are not entirely identical. Moreover, whereas initial attention on HIF prolyl hydroxylation focused on a highly conserved LXXLAP motif containing residues N-terminal to the hydroxylacceptor proline, these results actually highlight a critical role for residues that are in fact C-terminal to it. Patients and Mutational Analysis of the HIF2A Gene-Individuals with inappropriately normal or elevated serum Epo levels were selected from a registry of idiopathic erythrocytosis patients for analysis of HIF2A (14Percy M.J. Zhao Q. Flores A. Harrison C. Lappin T.R. Maxwell P.H. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20Percy M.J. McMullin M.F. Jowitt S.N. Potter M. Treacy M. Watson W.H. Lappin T.R. Blood. 2003; 102: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previous investigations revealed the absence of defects in the VHL and PHD2 genes. Exon 12 of HIF2A was amplified by PCR and sequenced as described previously (15Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Lucas G.S. Li X. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Plasmids-The pcDNA5/FRT/TO-3xFLAG-hHIF-2α wild type and P531A plasmids have been described previously (15Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Lucas G.S. Li X. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Corresponding constructs for the P534L, M535V, and G537R mutations were prepared as follows. First, a 1.6-kb PCR product was obtained using IMAGE Consortium clone 6305604 as a template and the following primers: 5′ GTA CGG ATC CAG ATG ACA GCT GAC AAG GAG-3′ and 5′-GTA CGC GGC CGC ATG CGC TAG CGT CTC CAA GTC CAG CTC-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and NotI and subcloned into the BamHI/NotI site of pcDNA5/FRT/TO-3xFLAG to yield pcDNA5/FRT/TO-3xFLAG-hHIF-2α-N. Then, 1.0-kb PCR products were obtained using the same IMAGE clone as a template, the primer 5′-GTC AGC GGC CGC TCA GGT GGC CTG GTC CAG-3′, and one of the following primers: P534L, 5′-GAG ACG CTA GCA CCC TAT ATC CTC ATG GAC GGG GAA GAC TTC CAG-3′; M535V, 5′-GAG ACG CTA GCA CCC TAT ATC CCG GTG GAC GGG GAA GAC TTC CAG C-3′; or G537R, 5′-GAG ACG CTA GCA CCC TAT ATC CCG ATG GAC AGG GAA GAC TTC CAG CTA AGC-3′. The PCR products were digested with NheI/NotI and subcloned into the NheI/NotI site of pcDNA3-HA. The 1.0-kb bands from NheI/NotI digests of the resulting plasmids were then subcloned into the NheI/NotI site of pcDNA5/FRT/TO-3xFLAG-hHIF-2α-N to yield pcDNA5/FRT/TO-3xFLAG-hHIF-2α P534L, M535V, and G537R, respectively. pcDNA3-GAL4-HIF-2α-(516–549) has been described previously (15Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Lucas G.S. Li X. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-GAL4-HIF-2α constructs with amino acid substitutions were prepared by subcloning into the EcoRI/XbaI site of pcDNA3-GAL4 oligonucleotide duplexes comprised of the following sequences: P531A, 5′-AAT TCA GTA CCC AGA CGG ATT TCA ATG AGC TGG ACT TGG AGA CAC TGG CAG CCT ATA TCC CCA TGG ACG GGG AAG ACT TCC AAT TGA GCC CCA TCT GCC CCG AGG AGT AG-3′ and 5′-CTA GCT ACT CCT CGG GGC AGA TGG GGC TCA ATT GGA AGT CTT CCC CGT CCA TGG GGA TAT AGG CTG CCA GTG TCT CCA AGT CCA GCT CAT TGA AAT CCG TCT GGG TAC TG-3′; P534L, 5′-AAT TCA GTA CCC AGA CGG ATT TCA ATG AGC TGG ACT TGG AGA CAC TGG CAC CCT ATA TCC TCA TGG ACG GGG AAG ACT TCC AAT TGA GCC CCA TCT GCC CCG AGG AGT AG-3′ and 5′-CTA GCT ACT CCT CGG GGC AGA TGG GGC TCA ATT GGA AGT CTT CCC CGT CCA TGA GGA TAT AGG GTG CCA GTG TCT CCA AGT CCA GCT CAT TGA AAT CCG TCT GGG TAC TG-3′; M535V, 5′-AAT TCA GTA CCC AGA CGG ATT TCA ATG AGC TGG ACT TGG AGA CAC TGG CAC CCT ATA TCC CCG TGG ACG GGG AAG ACT TCC AAT TGA GCC CCA TCT GCC CCG AGG AGT AG-3′ and 5′-CTA GCT ACT CCT CGG GGC AGA TGG GGC TCA ATT GGA AGT CTT CCC CGT CCA CGG GGA TAT AGG GTG CCA GTG TCT CCA AGT CCA GCT CAT TGA AAT CCG TCT GGG TAC TG-3′; G537R, 5′-AAT TCA GTA CCC AGA CGG ATT TCA ATG AGC TGG ACT TGG AGA CAC TGG CAC CCT ATA TCC CCA TGG ACA GGG AAG ACT TCC AAT TGA GCC CCA TCT GCC CCG AGG AGT AG-3′ and 5′-CTA GCT ACT CCT CGG GGC AGA TGG GGC TCA ATT GGA AGT CTT CCC TGT CCA TGG GGA TAT AGG GTG CCA GTG TCT CCA AGT CCA GCT CAT TGA AAT CCG TCT GGG TAC TG-3′. Additional pcDNA-GAL4-HIF constructs were prepared in an analogous manner using duplexes comprised of the following sequences: HIF-2α Sec (residues 390–423): 5′-AAT TCT TCA CCA AGC TAA AGG AGG AGC CCG AGG AGC TAG CCC AGC TGG CTC CCA CCC CCG GGG ACG CCA TCA TCT CTC TGG ATT TCG GGA ATC AGA ACT TCG AGG AGT AG-3′ and 5′-CTA GCT ACT CCT CGA AGT TCT GAT TCC CGA AAT CCA GAG AGA TGA TGG CGT CCC CGG GGG TGG GAG CCA GCT GGG CTA GCT CCT CGG GCT CCT CCT TTA GCT TGG TGA AG-3′; Prim/Sec, 5′-AAT TCA GTA CCC AGA CGG ATT TCA ATG AGC TCG ACT TGG AGA CAC TGG CAC CCA CCC CCG GGG ACG CCA TCA TCT CTC TGG ATT TCG GGA ATC AGA ACT TCG AGG AGT AG-3′ and 5′-CTA GCT ACT CCT CGA AGT TCT GAT TCC CGA AAT CCA GAG AGA TGA TGG CGT CCC CGG GGG TGG GTG CCA GTG TCT CCA AGT CGA GCT CAT TGA AAT CCG TCT GGG TAC TG-3′; Sec/Prim, 5′-AAT TCT TCA CCA AGC TAA AGG AGG AGC CCG AGG AGC TAG CCC AGC TGG CTC CCT ATA TCC CCA TGG ACG GGG AAG ACT TCC AAT TGA GCC CCA TCT GCC CCG AGG AGT AG-3′ and 5′-CTA GCT ACT CCT CGG GGC AGA TGG GGC TCA ATT GGA AGT CTT CCC CGT CCA TGG GGA TAT AGG GAG CCA GCT GGG CTA GCT CCT CGG GCT CCT CCT TTA GCT TGG TGA AG-3′. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Proteins and Peptides-For binding or hydroxylase assays, (His)6FlagPHD2 was either purified as previously described (21Huang J. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39792-39800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and stored at –20 °C, or freshly immunoprecipitated from 10-cm plates of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells using anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose and then divided into equal aliquots for the subsequent assays. 35S-Labeled, in vitro translated GAL4-HIF fusion proteins were prepared using the appropriate pcDNA3-GAL4 construct and wheat germ extract TnT kits (Promega). 35S-Labeled, in vitro translated FlagVHL was prepared using pcDNA3-FlagVHL and rabbit reticulocyte TnT Quik kits (Promega). GST-HIF-1α-(531–575) was purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (22Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Hydroxyproline 531 (Hyp-531)-substituted or unmodified wild type, P534L, M535V, or G536R HIF-2α-(527–542) peptides were obtained from Genscript. The following peptides were also synthesized by Genscript: Hyp-531 HIF-2α Prim (residues 527–542), Hyp-405 HIF-2α Sec (residues 401–416), Hyp HIF-2α Prim/Sec (ETLA{HYP}TPGDAIISLDF), Hyp HIF-2α Sec/Prim (AQLA{HYP}YIPMDGEDFQL), and N-terminal biotinylated Hyp-564 HIF-1α-(556–574). PHD2 Binding Assays-(His)6FlagPHD2 immobilized on 10 μl of M2-agarose was incubated with 35S-labeled, in vitro translated GAL4-HIF fusion proteins as described (21Huang J. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Lee F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39792-39800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The resins were then washed, eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer, and the eluates subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorimager analysis on an ABI Storm 860 PhosphorImager. 2-Oxoglutarate Decarboxylation Assays-(His)6FlagPHD2 immobilized on 10 μl of M2-agarose was washed and assayed for activity essentially by the method of Kivirikko and Myllyla (23Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) as modified by Linke et al. (24Linke S. Hampton-Smith R.J. Peet D.J. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 435: 61-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in a total volume of 45 μl of 6 mm Hepes, pH 7, 45 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm β-glycophosphate, 0.6 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 3% glycerol, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, with 2.4 mm ascorbate, 120 μm FeCl2, and 0.5 μl of [14C]2-oxoglutarate (50 mCi/mmol; 0.1 mCi/ml) in the absence or presence of 25 μm wild type or mutant HIF-2α-(527–542) peptides. Reactions were conducted for 1 h at 37 °C in 1.5-ml screw top tubes fitted with filter papers saturated with Ca(OH)2. The 14CO2 liberated and captured on the filter paper was quantitated by scintillation counting. Uncoupled decarboxylation measurements performed in the absence of HIF peptide were subtracted from that in its presence to obtain HIF hydroxylase activity. Mass Spectrometry Assays-(His)6FlagPHD2 immobilized on 10 μl of M2-agarose was washed with 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 37 °C in a volume of 40 μl of the same buffer supplemented with 1 mm ascorbate and 0.5 mm 2-oxoglutarate in the absence or presence of 10 μm HIF-2α-(527–542) peptides. At various times, aliquots of 5 μl were suspended in 50:50 MeOH:H2O with 0.1% formic acid and subjected to electrospray ionization with an Advion TriVersa NanoMate spray source. All mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer. Scans accumulated at high resolution (100,000) with 10 microscan accumulation. Typical total accumulations were 15 to 20 s. VHL Binding Assays-Prolyl-hydroxylated GST-HIF-1α-(531–575) was prepared by incubating GST-HIF-1α-(531–575) immobilized on GSH-agarose with (His)6FlagPHD2 in the presence of ascorbate and 2-oxoglutarate, and then washing the resin. Alternatively, 0.12 μgof biotinylated Hyp-564 HIF-1α-(556–574) peptide was incubated with 10 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma). The resin was then incubated with 35S-labeled, in vitro translated FlagVHL as described previously in the absence or presence of Hyp-containing peptide. The resins were washed, eluted with 2× SDS loading buffer, and the eluates subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorimager analysis. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Transfectants-Stably transfected HEK293 Flp-In TRex cell lines (Invitrogen), in which the pcDNA5/FRT/TO construct is integrated into a single defined locus, were generated using Flp recombinase according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Those expressing wild type and P531A 3xFLAG-HIF-2α have been previously described (15Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Lucas G.S. Li X. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HIF-2α expression was induced by treating cells with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline for 16 h. For protein stability assays, cycloheximide was employed at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. Hypoxic treatment was performed in an In Vivo 200 Hypoxia Work station (Ruskinn Technologies). Western Blotting-Cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and mammalian extract protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Extracts were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were quantified by DC Assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of protein were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween and 5% nonfat milk. For 3xFLAG-HIF-2α detection, membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-FLAG antibodies (M2, Sigma). For β-tubulin detection, membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-β-tubulin antibodies (H-235, Santa Cruz) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. CDP-Star (Roche) was employed as a substrate for detection. Real Time PCR-Total RNA was isolated from stably transfected HEK293 Flp-In T-REx cell lines induced with doxycycline for 16 h using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was prepared using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Real time PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green Master mix (ABI) and an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR System. Target gene levels were normalized to that of β-actin. SYBR Green primers, designed with the use of Primer Express software, version 3.0 (Applied Biosystems), were as follows: 3xFLAG, 5′-GCT TGG TAC CAT GGA CTA CAA AGA-3′ and 5′-CGT CAT CCT TGT AAT CGA TGT CA-3′; hVEGF, 5′-AGA CTC CGG CGG AAG CAT-3′ and 5′-AAT GGC GAA TCC AAT TCC AA-3′; hNDRG1, 5′-AGT GCG GCT GCC AGG TT-3′ and 5′-CAC GGT GAG CCA AAA TGA AA-3′; hADM, 5′-ACC GCC AGA GCA TGA ACA A-3′ and 5′-AAG CGG CAG CCA AAG CT-3′. Dissociation curve analysis for each set of probes revealed single peaks. The sequences of the β-actin primers have been previously described (25Huang J. Song D. Flores A. Zhao Q. Mooney S.M. Shaw L.M. Lee F.S. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Relative quantification was performed using the ΔΔCT method and β-actin as the endogenous control. Luciferase Assays-The HEK293 Flp-In TRex cell lines were cotransfected with (eHRE)3-luciferase (26Yu F. White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4136-4142PubMed Google Scholar) and the Renilla luciferase internal control pRL-TK using FuGENE 6 (Roche), and then treated with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline for 16 h. In some cases, cells were exposed to hypoxia (0.2% O2). Cells were harvested with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and then clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Luciferase activities were measured using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a Berthold Lumat LB9507 luminometer. Statistical Analysis-Student’s t test and analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Following our identification and functional characterization of the initial erythrocytosis-associated G537W mutation in the HIF2A gene (15Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Lucas G.S. Li X. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we subsequently reported on two additional HIF2A mutations, M535V and G537R (16Percy M.J. Beer P.A. Campbell G. Dekker A.W. Green A.R. Oscier D. Rainey M.G. van Wijk R. Wood M. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. Blood. 2008; 111: 5400-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the functional characterization of these latter two HIF-α mutants as well as a third novel heterozygous erthrocytosis-associated mutant, P534L (19Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Beer P.A. Campbell G. Dekker A.W. Green A.R. Li X. Sutherland S. Oscier D. Rainey M.G. Rivera E. van Wijk R. Wood M. Lappin T.R.J. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. Blood. 2008; 112 (abstr.): 481Crossref Google Scholar). We initially performed binding assays in which we incubated recombinant PHD2 with 35S-labeled, in vitro translated, wild type or mutant GAL4-HIF-2α-(516–549), and then we immunoprecipitated the PHD2 and assessed for 35S-GAL4-HIF-2α-(516–549) binding (Fig. 1A). Compared with wild type HIF-2α-(516–549), the mutants all bound more weakly (compare lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). The mean (±S.D.) relative recoveries of P534L, M535V, and G537R HIF-2α-(516–549) were 34 ± 6, 14 ± 4, and 9 ± 2%, respectively, of that of wild type (p < 0.001 in all cases). Impaired binding to PHD2 might be reflected in decreased PHD2-catalyzed hydroxylation. To assess this, we incubated recombinant PHD2 with wild type or mutant HIF-2α-(527–542) peptides in the presence of 14C-labeled 2-oxoglutarate, and then measured the liberated 14C-labeled CO2 as a measure of HIF prolyl hydroxylase activity (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the PHD2 binding assays, we find that the mutations result in decreased conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to CO2. Relative to PHD2 activity toward wild type HIF-2α-(527–542) (activity = 1), the mean (±S.D.) relative activity PHD2 toward P534L, M535V, and G537R HIF-2α (527–542) was 0.27 ± 0.14, 0.37 ± 0.35, and 0.03 ± 0.03, respectively (p < 0.05 in all cases). The [14C]2-oxoglutarate decarboxylation assay indirectly measures hydroxylation. As an independent means of assessing whether the mutations impair PHD2-induced hydroxylation, we incubated recombinant PHD2 with wild type, P534L, M535V, or G537R HIF-2α-(527–542) peptide, and then assessed the extent of hydroxylation by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Fig. 2). Under conditions in which the wild type peptide was very efficiently hydroxylated (Fig. 2A), all three mutant peptides were hydroxylated substantially less so (Fig. 2, B–D), evident at both the 30- and 60-min time points. In addition to effects on PHD2 binding and hydroxylation, these mutations may also affect subsequent recognition by VHL. Toward this end, we evaluated the capacity of wild type and mutant Hyp-HIF-2α-(527–542) peptides to compete with hydroxylated GST-HIF-1α-(531–575) for binding to 35S-labeled, in vitro translated VHL (15Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Lucas G.S. Li X. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In control experiments, hydroxylated GST-HIF-1α-(531–575) efficiently captures VHL, whereas the non-hydroxylated counterpart does not (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, wild type Hyp-HIF-2α-(527–542) very efficiently competes for VHL binding, as reflected by diminished binding to GST-HIF-1α-(531–575) (lanes 4–6). We find that the P534L and the G537R Hyp-HIF-2α-(527–542) peptides are substantially less potent in competing for VHL binding (compare lanes 7 and 13 with lane 4). The M535V peptide, in contrast, is equally effective as the wild type peptide. This is reflected by comparable titration results to wild type peptide at both high peptide concentrations (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 10–12) and low peptide concentrations (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 7–9). We next generated stably transfected, Flp-In TRex HEK293 cells that express doxycycline-inducible FLAG-tagged P534L, M535V, and G537 HIF-2α (Fig. 4A). The constructs encoding for the HIF-2α mutants integrate into a single FRT site in this cell line so as to generate isogenic cell lines. As a reflection of this, two independent clones for each of these three mutants revealed comparable levels of steady state, doxycycline-induced protein levels, as assessed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 4A). When compared with wild type FLAG-tagged HIF-2α expressed from the same system, we find that the protein levels for each mutant is higher. Another cell line expressing a hydroxylation-defective P531A HIF-2α also displays higher steady state levels of protein than wild type, as reported previously (15Percy M.J. Furlow P.W. Lucas G.S. Li X. Lappin T.R. McMullin M.F. Lee F.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For subsequent experiments, we selected a single clone from each pair of P534L, M535V, and G537R mutants. Real time PCR employing primers specific for the nucleotide sequence encoding the FLAG tag show that the wild type, P534L, M535V, and G537R mRNA levels are all comparable (Fig. 4B). To assess the stability of these proteins in more detail, we arrested protein synthesis by treatment of cells with cycloheximide, and then the monitored protein level by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 5). As a control, wild type HIF-2α is rapidly degraded (left-hand side of each panel). We find that P534L, M535V, and G537R mutants of HIF-2α mutants are each degraded more slowly than wild type HIF-2α (top three sets of panels), although perhaps not as slowly as the P531A hydroxylation defective control (bottom set of panels). We next examined, by real time PCR, the expression of the HIF target genes adrenomedullin (ADM), N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (27Hu C.J. Wang L.Y. Chodosh L.A. Keith B. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9361-9374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) in the wild type and mutant HIF-2α expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 6). The expression of M535V and G537R HIF-2α, as well as P531A HIF-2α, induced significantly increased mRNA transcript levels from the ADM gene (Fig. 6A) as compared with wild type HIF-2α. The expression of P534L and G537R HIF-2α, as well as P531A HIF-2α, induced significantly increased mRNA transcript levels from the NDRG1 and VEGF genes as compared with wild type (Fig. 6, B and C). The baseline levels of a given target gene showed slight variation among the different cell lines. We therefore also calculated the induction"

However, the mechanisms of microRNA biogenesis and expression remain largely unclear and the identification of the tissues in which a microRNA is expressed is limited. Here, we present a machine learning based approach to predict whether an intronic microRNA show high co-expression with its host gene, by doing so, we could infer the tissues in which a microRNA is high expressed through the expression profile of its host gene. Our approach is able to achieve an accuracy of 79% in the leave-one-out cross validation and 95% on an independent testing dataset. We further estimated our method through comparing the predicted tissue specific microRNAs and the tissue specific microRNAs identified by biological experiments. This study presented a valuable tool to predict the co-expression patterns between human intronic microRNAs and their host genes, which would also help to understand the microRNA expression and regulation mechanisms. Finally, this framework can be easily extended to other species."
https://openalex.org/W2080000401,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a cancer of the hematopoietic system and has been treated with the drug Imatinib relatively successfully. Drug resistance, acquired by mutations, is an obstacle to success. Two additional drugs are now considered and could be combined with Imatinib to prevent resistance, Dasatinib and Nilotinib. While most mutations conferring resistance to one drug do not confer resistance to the other drugs, there is one mutation (T315I) that induces resistance against all three drugs. Using computational methods, the combination of two drugs is found to increase the probability of treatment success despite this cross-resistance. Combining more than two drugs, however, does not provide further advantages. We also explore possible combination therapies using drugs currently under development. We conclude that among the targeted drugs currently available for the treatment of CML, only the two most effective ones should be used in combination for the prevention of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2073081229,"The reversible phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in proteins is a cornerstone of the signaling pathways that regulate numerous cellular responses. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled through the concerted actions of protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. The goal of the present study was to unveil the mechanisms by which protein tyrosine dephosphorylation modulates secretion. The acrosome reaction, a specialized type of regulated exocytosis undergone by sperm, is initiated by calcium and carried out by a number of players, including tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, and fusion-related proteins such as Rab3A, α-SNAP, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), SNAREs, complexin, and synaptotagmin VI. We report here that inducers were unable to elicit the acrosome reaction when permeabilized human sperm were loaded with anti-PTP1B antibodies or with the dominant-negative mutant PTP1B D181A; subsequent introduction of wild type PTP1B or NSF rescued exocytosis. Wild type PTP1B, but not PTP1B D181A, caused cis SNARE complex dissociation during the acrosome reaction through a mechanism involving NSF. Unlike its non-phosphorylated counterpart, recombinant phospho-NSF failed to dissociate SNARE complexes from rat brain membranes. These results strengthen our previous observation that NSF activity is regulated rather than constitutive during sperm exocytosis and indicate that NSF must be dephosphorylated by PTP1B to disassemble SNARE complexes. Interestingly, phospho-NSF served as a substrate for PTP1B in an in vitro assay. Our findings demonstrate that phosphorylation of NSF on tyrosine residues prevents its SNARE complex dissociation activity and establish for the first time a role for PTP1B in the modulation of the membrane fusion machinery.

Our findings demonstrate that phosphorylation of NSF on tyrosine residues prevents its SNARE complex dissociation activity and establish for the first time a role for PTP1B in the modulation of the membrane fusion machinery. Exocytosis is a highly regulated membrane fusion process consisting of multiple stages that culminate in the attachment of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane followed by the opening of fusion pores (1Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev... 2003; 83: 581-632Google Scholar). Many molecules belonging to, or associated with, the fusion machinery have been identified and characterized. These molecules include integral components of the vesicle (R-SNAREs) and of the plasma membrane (Q-SNAREs), in addition to soluble factors such as N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), 2The abbreviations used are: NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; AR, acrosome reaction; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester; BoNT/B, botulinum toxin B; FITC-PSA, fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled Pisum sativum agglutinin; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thio-galactoside; NP-EGTA-AM, O-nitrophenyl EGTA acetoxymethyl ester; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; SLO, streptolysin O; TeTx, tetanus toxin; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridymethyl)ethylenediamine; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). α-SNAP, Munc18, and complexin (2Sollner T.H.

Nature.. 1998; 395: 347-353Google Scholar). Assembly of Q- and R-SNAREs in trans (in opposite membranes) is thought to pull the fusing membranes closely together, which results in bilayer fusion. Disassembly of fusion-incompetent, cis (in the same membrane) SNARE complexes requires the concerted action of α-SNAP and NSF (6Zhao C. Slevin J.T. Whiteheart S.W.

It was believed that NSF is constitutively active to guarantee the constant regeneration of free SNAREs. In the last few years, however, we have learned that NSF activity is regulated by post-translational modifications (8Huynh H. Bottini N. Williams S. Cherepanov V. Musumeci L. Saito K. Bruckner S.

The acrosome is a large secretory vesicle that overlies the nucleus in the apical region of the mature sperm head (13Yanagimachi R. Mammalian Fertilization, The Physiology of Reproduction.(Knobil, E., and Neill, J. D., eds) pp. Raven Press, New York. 1994; : 189-317Google Scholar). In response to physiological or pharmacological stimuli, the acrosome undergoes a special type of calcium-dependent exocytosis (the acrosome reaction, AR), which is a prerequisite for fertilization. The AR proceeds through a sequential set of events initiated when Rab3A is activated by calcium to trigger NSF/α-SNAP-dependent disassembly of cis SNARE complexes. Interestingly, NSF appears to be dormant in resting cells, but its activity is de-repressed when sperm are challenged with AR inducers (14De Blas G.A. Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N. Mayorga L.S. PLoS Biol.. 2005; 3: e323Google Scholar). Later on, monomeric SNAREs re-associate in loose trans complexes until an efflux of calcium from the intra-acrosomal store promotes synaptotagmin- and SNARE-dependent membrane fusion (reviewed in Refs. 15Tomes C.N. Molecular Mechanisms of Exocytosis.(Regazzi, R., ed) pp. Landes Biosciences/Eurekah.com and Springer Science+Business Media, Austin, TX. 2006; : 117-147Google Scholar and 16Mayorga L. Tomes C.N. Belmonte S.A. IUBMB Life.. 2007; 59: 1-7Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by the coordinated actions of protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases (PTPs). The widely expressed PTP1B is the prototype of the superfamily of PTPs and belongs to the non-transmembrane subfamily 1 of intracellular PTPs (17Tonks N.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2006; 7: 833-846Google Scholar, 18Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol... 2001; 13: 182-195Google Scholar). PTP1B consists of a single N-terminal phosphatase domain (321 residues) and a regulatory C-terminal domain (114 residues). Using structural insights derived from biochemical and crystallographic data, scientists have identified several residues crucial for substrate recognition and catalysis. Two such residues are Cys215 and Asp181. The catalytic activity of PTP1B is lost or severely diminished, without detrimental effects on its affinity for substrates, when Cys215 is mutated to Ser/Ala or Asp181 to Ala (19Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 1680-1685Google Scholar). These mutant forms are known as substrate traps. The precise role of protein tyrosine dephosphorylation on membrane fusion remains unexplored. We and others have inferred the modulation of the AR by PTPs from results achieved with pharmacological inhibitors (see Ref. 20Tomes C.N. Roggero C.M. De Blas G. Saling P.M. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol... 2004; 265: 399-415Google Scholar and references therein). However, data on the identity of the PTPs and substrates involved are lacking. We have determined the role and site of action of PTPs, particularly PTP1B, in secretion by employing antibodies, photosensitive inhibitors, and a substrate-trapping mutant in a functional assay using permeabilized human sperm as the model for exocytosis. We identified a new role for PTP1B, that of indirectly catalyzing cis SNARE complex disassembly through the dephosphorylation of NSF. In defining this role, we also explained the regulation of NSF activity in sperm through its interaction with PTP1B. Reagents—Recombinant streptolysin O (SLO) was obtained from Dr. Bhakdi (University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany). Spermatozoa were cultured in Human Tubal Fluid media (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (HTF media). The mouse monoclonal anti-PTP1B (clone FG6–1G, purified IgG2a) (21Schievella A.R. Paige L.A. Johnson K.A. Hill D.E. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth & Differ... 1993; 4: 239-246Google Scholar) was initially a gift from Dr. N. Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY); we subsequently purchased the same antibody from Oncogene Science, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10, subclass IgG2b) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The rabbit polyclonal anti-NSF (whole serum) and the mouse monoclonal anti-synaptobrevin 2 (clone 69.1, purified IgG) were from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany). An anti-Rab3A antibody (rabbit polyclonal, purified IgG) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG was from Kierkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). The Escherichia coli strain TKB1, which harbors an inducible Elk tyrosine kinase domain under the control of the tryptophan operon, was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). O-Nitrophenyl-EGTA-acetoxymethyl ester (NP-EGTA-AM) and BAPTA-AM were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). α-Bromo-4-hydroxyacetophenone (PTP Inhibitor I) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Prestained molecular weight markers were from Boston BioProducts Inc. (Worcester, MA). Glutathione-Sepharose was from GE Healthcare and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany). All other chemicals were reagent or analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma or ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Recombinant Proteins—Two expression plasmids encoding amino acids 1–321 of PTP1B were kindly provided by Dr. N. Tonks: the substrate-trapping mutant PTP1B D181A fused to glutathione S-transferase was in pGEX-3X (GE Healthcare) and the wild type PTP1B fused to His6 was in pET21b (Stratagene). Two plasmids encoding NSF were used for protein expression: pQE9 (Qiagen) was generously provided by Dr. S. Whiteheart (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY) and pET28a (Stratagene) was a kind gift from Dr. D. Fasshauer (Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany). To obtain tyrosine-phosphorylated NSF in E. coli, NSF in pET28a was transformed into TKB1 cells; protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation were carried out following Stratagene's instructions. A pQE9 construct encoding α-SNAP was also from Dr. S. Whiteheart. Plasmid pGEX-2T containing the cDNA-encoding human Rab3A was provided by Dr. P. Stahl (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). The light chain of wild type TeTx and BoNT/B fused to His6 (pQE3, Qiagen) were generously provided by Dr. T. Binz (Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany). The light chain of catalytically dead TeTx fused to His6 (TeTx E234Q in pET28a) was a gift from Dr. F. Zilly (Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany). The plasmid constructs pQE9 encoding His6-NSF and pQE3 encoding His6-BoNT/B were transformed into E. coli M15pRep4 (Qiagen) and protein expression was induced 4 h at 30 °C with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG). DNAs encoding wild type His6-TeTx and α-SNAP were transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) and induced overnight at 20 °C with 0.2 mm IPTG. All proteins encoded by cDNAs contained in pET vectors were expressed in E. coli BLR(DE3) (Stratagene) by inducing with 0.25 mm IPTG (3 h at 25 °C for TeTx E234Q, 3 h at 30 °C for NSF), except PTP1B wild type that was induced with 0.1 mm IPTG overnight at 22 °C. Purification of His6-tagged recombinant proteins was carried out according to Qiagen's instructions, except that 0.5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol were added to all buffers involved in the purification of His6-NSF. The His6 tag was cleaved from NSF by incubation with thrombin during dialysis to remove imidazole. Thrombin activity was stopped with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. DNAs encoding Rab3A and PTP1B D181A were transformed into E. coli BL21 (Stratagene). We induced the expression of Rab3A with 0.5 mm IPTG overnight at 22 °C, and that of PTP1B D181A with 0.1 mm IPTG overnight at 22 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose following standard procedures. Purified Rab3A was prenylated and loaded with guanosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate as described (22Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod... 2000; 62: 1084-1089Google Scholar). Recombinant protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein assay in 96-well microplates. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard and the results were quantified on a Bio-Rad 3550 Microplate Reader. Human Sperm Sample Preparation for AR Assays and Western Blotting—Human semen samples were obtained from normal healthy donors. Semen was allowed to liquify for 30–60 min at 37 °C. We used a swim-up protocol to isolate highly motile sperm. Sperm concentrations were adjusted to 5–10 × 106/ml before incubating for at least 2 h under capacitating conditions (HTF, 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% air). Permeabilization was accomplished as described (22Yunes R. Michaut M. Tomes C. Mayorga L.S. Biol. Reprod... 2000; 62: 1084-1089Google Scholar). Briefly, washed spermatozoa were resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5 units/ml SLO for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in ice-cold sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes-K, pH 7) containing 2 mm DTT. For AR assays, we added inhibitors and stimulants sequentially as indicated in the figures legends, and incubated for 10–15 min at 37 °C after each addition. When indicated, we preloaded SLO-permeabilized sperm with photo-inhibitable reagents before incubating in the presence of inhibitors and/or calcium, carrying out all procedures in the dark. Photolysis was induced after the last incubation by exposing twice (1 min each time) to an UV transilluminator, mixing, and incubating for 5 min at 37 °C. Sperm were spotted on Teflon-printed slides, air dried, and fixed/permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 1 min. Acrosomal status was evaluated by staining with FITC-coupled Pisum sativum (FITC-PSA) according to Ref. 23Mendoza C. Carreras A. Moos J. Tesarik J. J. Reprod. Fertil... 1992; 95: 755-763Google Scholar. At least 200 cells were scored using an upright Nikon microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics. Basal (no stimulation, ""control”) and positive (0.5 mm CaCl2, corresponding to 10 μm free Ca2+, ""Ca2+”) controls were included in all experiments. Acrosomal exocytosis indexes were calculated by subtracting the number of spontaneously reacted spermatozoa from all values and expressing the results as a percentage of the AR observed in the positive control. Data were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance. The Tukey-Kramer post hoc test was used for pairwise comparisons. Differences were considered significant at the p < 0.05 level. For Western blotting, SLO-permeabilized sperm (5–10 × 106 cells) were treated or not with 300 nm PTP1B D181A, 27 nm wild type PTP1B or both, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, a protease inhibitor mixture (P2714, Sigma), 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS. We sonicated sperm (2 × 15 s) and let proteins diffuse into the lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. These whole cell detergent extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min and electrophoresed immediately or stored at –20 °C. Disassembly of the SNARE Complex—Brain cortices from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized in 5 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.32 m sucrose and 1 mm EDTA using a glass Teflon homogenizer (8 strokes at 800 rpm). The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min and the pellets re-extracted in 1 volume of buffer. Following a second centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatants were pooled and spun at 17,500 × g for 15 min. The crude synaptosomal pellets were washed once by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C until use (24Valdez S.R. Patterson S.I. Ezquer M.E. Torrecilla M. Lama M.C. Seltzer A.M. Synapse.. 2007; 61: 124-137Google Scholar). For a typical disassembly reaction, synaptosomal protein (2–4 μg) was incubated in a 20-μl volume containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 2 μm TeTx or BoNT/B, 8 μm α-SNAP, 600 nm NSF or phospho-NSF, 2.5 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2. In control reactions, 10 mm EDTA was added to chelate the MgCl2 and thus prevent ATP hydrolysis by NSF. Reactions were carried out for 15 min at 37 °C and terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% (w/v) SDS, 12% (w/v) glycerol, 100 mm DTT, and 0.01% (w/v) Serva Blue G and incubated for an additional 5 min at 95 °C before separation by SDS-PAGE (25Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem... 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar) and immunoblotting with the anti-synaptobrevin antibody. SDS-PAGE and Western Blots—Prior to electrophoresis, sperm proteins were dissolved in SDS sample buffer containing 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue by incubating for 5 min at 95 °C, separated on polyacrylamide slab gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and transferred to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond, GE Healthcare). Nonspecific reactivity was blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 3% gelatin dissolved in washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (0.1 μg/ml in blocking solution) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Anti-NSF blots were processed similarly to the anti-phosphotyrosine, except that the blocking solution contained 3% skim milk and 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (40,000 average Mr, ICN) instead of gelatin, and that the primary antibody was diluted 1:6,000 in 3% skim milk. For brain samples, blots were blocked in 5% skim milk and the anti-synaptobrevin 2 antibody was used at 0.05 μg/ml in blocking solution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were used as secondary antibodies (0.25 μg/ml) with 1-h incubations. Excess first and second antibodies were removed by washing 5 × 7 min in washing buffer. Detection was accomplished with a chemiluminescence system (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and subsequent exposure to HyperFilm™ ECL High performance (GE Healthcare) or CL-XPosure (Pierce, Tecnolab, Buenos Aires, Argentina) chemiluminescence film for 1–10 min. Phospho-NSF Dephosphorylation by PTP1B—NSF was tyrosine phosphorylated in E. coli TKB1 following a two-step protocol. First, IPTG induced the expression of NSF; second, indoleacrylic acid elicited the synthesis of the Elk tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylated NSF in vivo. His6-phospho-NSF was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose; tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed by Western blot. Phospho-NSF (310 nm) was incubated with 1 μg/ml wild type or D181A PTP1B in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors in a final reaction volume of 30 μl. Incubations were carried out at 30 °C in a water bath. At the times indicated reactions were stopped with SDS-sample buffer and the products analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-NSF Western blotting. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Recombinant phospho-NSF (10–20 μg) and frozen sperm pellets (150 × 106 cells) were suspended in a rehydration solution containing 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Each sample was sonicated at 4 °C using 2 × 15-s bursts; insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots (150 μl) containing ∼150 μg of solubilized sperm protein were mixed with 1 μl of carrier ampholytes (Pharmalyte pH 3–10) and loaded onto immobilized pH-gradient (IPG, Immobiline DryStrip gels, Amersham Biosciences) strips (7 cm, linear pH 3–10). The IPG strips were then covered in mineral oil and left to rehydrate for 15 h at 20 °C; 100 mm DTT was added just prior to the run. Isoelectric focusing was performed at 20 °C using an Ettan IPGphor isoelectric focusing system (Amersham Biosciences), with a program of stepped voltages (30 min at 500 V, 30 min at 1000 V, and 100 min at 5000 V). Following focusing, the IPG strips were immediately incubated in 10 ml of equilibration buffer (30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8.8, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) supplemented with 100 mg of DTT for 15 min at room temperature, followed by fresh equilibration buffer (10 ml) containing 250 mg of iodoacetamide for a further 15 min at room temperature. The strips were then placed on top of 8% polyacrylamide slab gels (1 mm thick, 10 × 10 cm) and held in place using 0.5% agarose prepared in SDS-running buffer. Proteins were then resolved at constant current (10–15 mA), electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted sequentially using anti-NSF and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Blots were stripped prior to reprobing in a solution containing 0.1 n HCl (30 min at room temperature with vigorous shaking), followed by two 10-min washes in washing buffer, and a final 10-min wash in double-distilled water. PTP Activity Is Required after Rab3 and before NSF during the AR—We resorted to the photosensitive PTP Inhibitor I to determine the steps governed by protein tyrosine dephosphorylation during the AR. This compound binds covalently to the catalytic domain of SHP-1 and PTP1B, blocking their enzymatic activity. The inhibition is reversed by irradiation with UV light (27Arabaci G. Guo X.C. Beebe K.D. Coggeshall K.M. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc... 1999; 121: 5085-5086Google Scholar). We reasoned that the AR can be modeled to fit in a linear signaling pathway operating through the sequence below (14De Blas G.A. Roggero C.M. Tomes C.N. Mayorga L.S. PLoS Biol.. 2005; 3: e323Google Scholar), where single arrows mean there is one step between the proteins connected, and double arrows mean that the number of steps taking place between the connected proteins is unknown: calcium →→ Rab3 →→ α-SNAP/NSF → SNAREs (cis complex disassembly → monomeric proteins →→ reassembly in trans) →→ intra-acrosomal calcium efflux →→ SNAREs (full zippering in trans) →→ exocytosis. If PTPs catalyzed any of those unknown steps, PTP Inhibitor I would halt the AR at the point when the activity of the first PTP was required, because the sequence is linear, for as long as the system was kept in the dark. Photoreversion of the inhibition caused by PTP Inhibitor I should resume exocytosis. Indeed, when permeabilized sperm were pre-loaded with PTP Inhibitor I, calcium failed to elicit exocytosis when the system was protected from light. Exocytosis was restored upon illumination (Fig. 1B). These data confirm that PTPs are required for sperm exocytosis and also demonstrate the applicability of PTP Inhibitor I to our study. PTP Inhibitor I serves to place the requirement for fusion-related factors to steps occurring before or after the first PTP Inhibitor I-sensitive step. Briefly, PTP Inhibitor I allows calcium to prepare the fusion machinery up to the point when the first PTP is required. An inhibitor of step X (see schematic in Fig. 1A) is then added and the tubes illuminated. Resistance to the X-blocker, reflected in unaffected exocytosis, implies that its target is required upstream of PTP activity (Fig. 1A, top). Sensitivity to the X-blocker, revealed by no exocytosis, means its target is located after the PTP Inhibitor I-sensitive step (Fig. 1A, bottom). In the control condition, the AR should be prevented when the X-blocker is added prior to the inducer (calcium in this case) and maintained throughout the experiment (not shown in schematic). We asked whether the PTP-dependent step takes place before or after Rab3A by blocking the function of this small G protein with a specific antibody. The anti-Rab3A antibody inhibited exocytosis when added before, but not after, challenging with calcium. In contrast, antibodies against NSF and synaptobrevin 2 were able to abrogate exocytosis even when added after calcium. The acrosome is a calcium store and intra-acrosomal calcium release is mandatory for exocytosis. The calcium chelator BAPTA conjugated to an AM group accumulates inside the acrosome in permeabilized sperm, preventing the AR. When combined with PTP Inhibitor I, BAPTA-AM displayed the same behavior than the anti-NSF and anti-synaptobrevin antibodies (Fig. 1B, black bars). These results suggest that PTP activity is required after Rab3A, but before NSF, SNAREs, and intra-acrosomal calcium, during the signaling cascade leading to the AR, allowing us to update the original sequence as follows: calcium →→ Rab3 →→ PTP → substrate-P → substrate →→ α-SNAP/NSF → SNAREs (cis complex disassembly → monomeric proteins →→ reassembly in trans) →→ intra-acrosomal calcium efflux →→ SNAREs (full zippering in trans) →→ exocytosis. PTP1B Is Required for Exocytosis in a Human Sperm AR Model—We have shown that PTP activity is necessary for the AR (Fig. 1 and Ref. 20Tomes C.N. Roggero C.M. De Blas G. Saling P.M. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol... 2004; 265: 399-415Google Scholar). Because one of the PTPs targeted by the photosensitive PTP Inhibitor I is PTP1B, and the enzyme has been detected in ejaculated human and epididymal mouse (20Tomes C.N. Roggero C.M. De Blas G. Saling P.M. Mayorga L.S. Dev. Biol... 2004; 265: 399-415Google Scholar) and rat (28Seligman J. Zipser Y. Kosower N.S. Biol. Reprod... 2004; 71: 1009-1015Google Scholar) sperm, we asked whether this phosphatase might modulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in human sperm. Full-length PTP1B contains 435 amino acids, although a shorter variant containing the entire catalytic domain is typically used for biochemical studies. To test the effect of this domain, and that of the substrate-trapping mutant D181A, on the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, we expressed these constructs in E. coli, introduced them into SLO-permeabilized sperm, and immunoblotted cell lysates with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2A). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation in cells treated with wild type PTP1B was comparable with that in untreated controls, as was the case when PTP1B was overexpressed in COS7 cells (19Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 1680-1685Google Scholar). Overall protein tyrosine phosphorylation increased in response to PTP1B D181A; the increase dissapeared with the wild type enzyme. These data suggest that PTP1B D181A binds to and protects sperm proteins from dephosphorylation by endogenous PTP1B. They also suggest that recombinant, wild type PTP1B competes with the D181A mutant for sperm substrates. When added to permeabilized human sperm, PTP1B D181A prevented exocytosis in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2B). The mutant PTP inhibits the AR because, although it binds to the substrates of PTP1B, it is unable to dephosphorylate them efficiently. Thus, mutant and substrate become locked in a stable, ""dead-end"" complex. Wild type PTP1B overcame the D181A mutant (Fig. 2C) and PTP Inhibitor I (see Fig. 1) protected from light (Fig. 2D) blocks on the AR, possibly by compet"

In the Adrar of Mauritania all available data on the presence and distribution of fish come from pre-1960 surveys where five fish species were reported: Barbus pobeguini, Barbus macrops, Barbus mirei, Sarotherodon galilaeus, and Clarias anguillaris. Since 1970, drought has had a severe impact in the Adrar where rainfall decreased by 35%. To investigate whether the relict populations of fish have survived the continuing drought, a study was carried out from 2004 to 2008.An inventory of perennial bodies of water was drawn up using a literature review and analysis of topographical and hydrological maps. Field surveys were carried out in order to locate the bodies of water described in the literature, identify the presence of fish, determine which species were present and estimate their abundance. The thirteen sites where the presence of fish was observed in the 1950s -Ksar Torchane, Ilij, Molomhar, Agueni, Tachot, Hamdoun, Terjit, Toungad, El Berbera, Timagazine, Dâyet el Mbârek, Dâyet et-Tefla, Nkedeï- were located and surveyed. The Ksar Torchane spring -type locality and the only known locality of B. mirei- has dried up at the height of the drought in 1984, and any fish populations have since become extinct there. The Timagazine, Dâyet el Mbârek and Dâyet et-Tefla pools have become ephemeral. The Hamdoun guelta appears to be highly endangered. The fish populations at the other sites remain unchanged. Four perennial pools which are home to populations of B. pobeguini are newly recorded.The tropical relict fish populations of the Adrar mountains of Mauritania appear to be highly endangered. Of thirteen previously recorded populations, four have become extinct since the beginning of the drought period. New fish population extinctions may occur should low levels of annual rainfall be repeated."
https://openalex.org/W2011994582,"Background Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria widely distributed among arthropods and nematodes. In many insect species these bacteria induce a cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) between sperm of infected males and eggs of uninfected females. From an evolutionary point of view, CI is puzzling: In order to induce this modification-rescue system, Wolbachia affect sperm of infected males even though Wolbachia are only transmitted maternally. Phylogenetic studies of Wolbachia and hosts show that the bacteria rarely cospeciate with their hosts, indicating that infections are lost in host species. However, the mechanisms leading to Wolbachia loss are not well understood. Results Using a population genetic model, we investigate the spread of host mutants that enhance or repress Wolbachia action by affecting either bacterial transmission or the level of CI. We show that host mutants that decrease CI-levels in males (e.g. by reducing Wolbachia-density during spermatogenesis) spread, even at cost to mutant males. Increase of these mutants can lead to loss of Wolbachia infections, either as a direct consequence of their increase or in a step-wise manner, and we derive analytically a threshold penetrance above which a mutation's spread leads to extinction of Wolbachia. Selection on host modifiers is sexually antagonistic in that, conversely, host mutants that enhance Wolbachia in females are favoured whereas suppressors are not. Conclusions Our results indicate that Wolbachia is likely to be lost from host populations on long evolutionary time scales due to reduction of CI levels in males. This can occur either by evolution of single host modifiers with large effects or through accumulation of several modifier alleles with small effects on Wolbachia action, even at cost to mutant males and even if infected hosts do not incur fecundity costs. This possibility is consistent with recent findings and may help to explain the apparent short evolutionary persistence times of Wolbachia in many host systems."
https://openalex.org/W2031613727,"Human T-cell leukemia virus-associated adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) has a very poor prognosis, despite trials of a variety of different treatment regimens. Virus expression has been reported to be limited or absent when ATLL is diagnosed, and this has suggested that secondary genetic or epigenetic changes are important in disease pathogenesis.We prospectively investigated combination chemotherapy followed by antiretroviral therapy for this disorder. Nineteen patients were prospectively enrolled between 2002 and 2006 at five medical centers in a phase II clinical trial of infusional chemotherapy with etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine, daily prednisone, and bolus cyclophosphamide (EPOCH) given for two to six cycles until maximal clinical response, and followed by antiviral therapy with daily zidovudine, lamivudine, and alpha interferon-2a for up to one year. Seven patients were on study for less than one month due to progressive disease or chemotherapy toxicity. Eleven patients achieved an objective response with median duration of response of thirteen months, and two complete remissions. During chemotherapy induction, viral RNA expression increased (median 190-fold), and virus replication occurred, coincident with development of disease progression.EPOCH chemotherapy followed by antiretroviral therapy is an active therapeutic regimen for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, but viral reactivation during induction chemotherapy may contribute to treatment failure. Alternative therapies are sorely needed in this disease that simultaneously prevent virus expression, and are cytocidal for malignant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071936975,"Leptin activates multiple signaling pathways in cells, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, indicating a degree of cross-talk with insulin signaling. The exact mechanisms by which leptin alters this signaling pathway and how it relates to functional outputs are unclear at present. A previous study has established that leptin inhibits the activity of the phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), an important tumor suppressor and modifier of phosphoinositide signaling. In this study we demonstrate that leptin phosphorylates multiple sites on the C-terminal tail of PTEN in hypothalamic and pancreatic β-cells, an action not replicated by insulin. Inhibitors of the protein kinases CK2 and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) block leptin-mediated PTEN phosphorylation. PTEN phosphorylation mutants reveal the critical role these sites play in transmission of the leptin signal to F-actin depolymerization. CK2 and GSK3 inhibitors also prevent leptin-mediated F-actin depolymerization and consequent ATP-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel opening. GSK3 kinase activity is inhibited by insulin but not leptin in hypothalamic cells. Both hormones increase N-terminal GSK3 serine phosphorylation, but in hypothalamic cells this action of leptin is transient. Leptin, not insulin, increases GSK3 tyrosine phosphorylation in both cell types. These results demonstrate a significant role for PTEN in leptin signal transmission and identify GSK3 as a potential important signaling node contributing to divergent outputs for these hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2017771362,"Helicases play critical roles in all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism by catalyzing the remodeling of DNA and RNA structures. UvrD is an abundant helicase in Escherichia coli with well characterized functions in mismatch and nucleotide excision repair and a possible role in displacement of proteins such as RecA from single-stranded DNA. The mismatch repair protein MutL is known to stimulate UvrD. Here we show that the nucleotide excision repair proteins UvrA and UvrB can together stimulate UvrD-catalyzed unwinding of a range of DNA substrates containing strand discontinuities, including forked DNA substrates. The stimulation is specific for UvrD, as UvrAB failed to stimulate Rep helicase, a UvrD homologue. Moreover, although UvrAB can promote limited strand displacement, stimulation of UvrD did not require the strand displacement function of UvrAB. We conclude that UvrAB, like MutL, modulate UvrD helicase activity. This stimulation likely plays a role in DNA strand and protein displacement by UvrD in nucleotide excision repair. Promotion of UvrD-catalyzed unwinding of nicked duplexes by UvrAB may also explain the need for UvrAB and UvrD in Okazaki fragment processing in cells lacking DNA polymerase I.

More generally, these data support the idea that helicase activity is regulated in vivo, with helicases acting as part of multisubunit complexes rather than in isolation. Helicases and translocases use the energy derived from NTP hydrolysis to translocate along single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acids to remodel nucleic acid structures. Many of these enzymes have RecA-like motor domains, reflecting close similarities in translocation mechanisms (1Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B.

It is also becoming apparent that helicases and translocases often function as part of larger multisubunit complexes rather than in isolation and that such interactions impact on motor function and specificity.

Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There is also a second helicase in E. coli, Rep, that shares 40% identity with UvrD but has no known role in mismatch or nucleotide excision repair or in protein displacement in vivo. Employment of UvrD, but not Rep, in a diversity of roles in vivo might, therefore, demand specific physical or functional interactions between UvrD and other proteins in each system. However, specific interaction of UvrD has only been documented with a component of the mismatch repair system, MutL (23Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3205-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) RecA-catalyzed strand exchange in vitro, depending on reaction conditions. UvrD might, therefore, promote turnover of RecA-ssDNA complexes at blocked forks and gaps in duplex DNA. Inhibition of RecA function at blocked forks might facilitate other pathways of fork repair that do not rely on strand exchange, possibly minimizing the risks to genome stability that blocked forks present (28Mahdi A.A. Buckman C. Harris L. Lloyd R.G. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2135-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, whether abortion of strand exchange by UvrD in vivo requires other proteins is unknown. In contrast, the role of UvrD in nucleotide excision repair is well characterized. Nucleotide excision repair is needed to remove and replace bulky lesions within the genome with a complex of UvrA and -B, executing the initial damage recognition (for review, see Refs. 29Goosen N.

The end result of this two-step damage recognition mechanism is the dissociation of UvrA and recruitment of the endonuclease UvrC via a UvrB-UvrC interaction (38Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cells. 2000; 10: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nucleotide excision repair proteins also have a function in DNA replication. Strains with mutations in the DNA polymerase I gene, polA, have major defects in joining of Okazaki fragments (44Okazaki R. Arisawa M. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, under restricted growth conditions ΔpolA strains can survive (46Joyce C.M. Grindley N.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 636-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative means therefore exist for joining of Okazaki fragments as long as the rate of DNA replication and, therefore, the rate of Okazaki fragment production is reduced. This alternative pathway(s) of Okazaki fragment processing is poorly defined. However, viability of ΔpolA strains is dependent on the presence of UvrA, -B, and -D (47Horiuchi T. Nagata T. Mol. Gen.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5706-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that these three nucleotide excision repair proteins play key roles in this alternative pathway. Moreover, deletion of uvrC enhances the viability of ΔpolA cells implying that UvrC activity inhibits this alternative pathway (51Moolenaar G.F. Moorman C. Goosen N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5706-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These in vivo data were explained by a model in which UvrAB binds to nicks in newly synthesized lagging strand DNA even in the absence of DNA damage (51Moolenaar G.F. Moorman C. Goosen N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5706-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Promotion of Okazaki fragment processing was proposed to involve conferral of a specific direction on UvrD-catalyzed unwinding by binding of UvrAB, promoting removal of the RNA primers by a presumed nuclease, and subsequent sealing of the gap by a DNA polymerase and ligase. To probe the possible function of UvrAB in modulation of UvrD helicase activity, we have analyzed their activities on a range of DNA substrates in vitro. UvrAB stimulated UvrD helicase activity on nicked duplexes. However, UvrAB had little effect on UvrD polarity; UvrD with or without UvrAB translocated preferentially on the continuous DNA strand on nicked substrates. Stimulation was also apparent on other DNA substrates containing strand discontinuities, including forked DNA substrates. UvrAB binding of any DNA structures containing strand discontinuities might, therefore, promote UvrD-catalyzed unwinding of such structures. The strand displacement function of UvrAB was not essential for stimulation of UvrD, suggesting that stimulation did not simply reflect a reduction in the UvrD processivity barrier by limited unwinding of the substrate by UvrAB. Our findings imply that stimulation of UvrD helicase activity is required in both nucleotide excision and mismatch repair. These data also explain the need for UvrA, -B, and -D to maintain viability in the absence of DNA polymerase I, but they also raise questions regarding the consequences of such an activity in normal wild type cells. DNA Substrates-DNA substrates were constructed by annealing complementary oligonucleotides, one of which in each structure was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP at the 5′ end and purified by gel electrophoresis (52Parsons C.A.

UvrD was overexpressed from a pETDuet vector (Merck) kindly supplied by Dr. Nigel Savery (University of Bristol). pETDuetuvrD was transformed into BL21-AI (Merck) and a 100-ml culture in LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin grown at 37 °C until the A650 reached 0.6, at which point the culture was stored at +4 °C overnight. The next morning the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of fresh LB. This resuspension was used to inoculate 8 liters of LB plus ampicillin in a stirred vessel fermenter. The cells were grown to an A650 of 0.6 at 37 °C, then isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and arabinose were added to final concentrations of 1 mm and 0.2%, respectively. Growth was continued at 37 °C for a further 3 h before harvesting the cells by centrifugation. The cells were then resuspended (at 50% (w/w)) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, and 10% sucrose before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. The cell paste was thawed and Tris, pH 8.3, EDTA, EGTA, DTT, NaCl, and lysozyme were added to final concentrations of 50, 5, 0.5, 1, and 200 mm and 0.2 mg/ml, respectively. The mixture was left on ice for 30 min before the addition of sodium deoxycholate and deoxyribonuclease I to final concentrations of 0.05% and 5 μg/ml, respectively. Incubation was continued on ice for 30 min. NaCl was then added to a final concentration of 500 mm, and the mixture was sonicated on ice and then centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The supernatant was collected and then diluted by the addition of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) to a conductivity equivalent to buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl. This diluted supernatant was then applied to a 22-ml heparin-agarose column (Sigma Aldrich) equilibrated in buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl. This and subsequent chromatography was performed at 4 °C. The column was washed with six column volumes of buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl before eluting proteins with a 32-column-volume gradient of buffer A plus 100-650 mm NaCl. UvrD eluted at ∼500 mm NaCl. Buffer A was added to the pooled fractions until the conductivity was reduced to the equivalent of buffer A plus 200 mm NaCl. This diluted sample was then loaded on to a 5-ml Hi-Trap Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with six column volumes of buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl and then a 55-column-volume gradient of buffer A plus 100-600 mm NaCl.

Cells were pelleted, resuspended in fresh F-medium, and inoculated into 8l of F-medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in a stirred vessel fermenter. The culture was incubated at 37 °C until an A650 of 0.6 was reached, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for a further 3 h at 37 °C.

Nucleic acids were precipitated by the addition of Polymin P to a final concentration of 0.075% and centrifuged in a Sorvall SS34 at 4 °C for 20 min at 16,000 rpm. Proteins were precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to 50%. The ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in a sufficient volume of buffer B (50 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) such that the conductivity was equivalent to buffer B plus 50 mm NaCl. Proteins were then loaded onto a 50-ml SP-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), washed with 3 column volumes of buffer B plus 50 mm NaCl, and then eluted using a 10-column-volume gradient of buffer B from 50 to 800 mm NaCl. Fractions containing Rep (centered on 370 mm) were pooled, and protein was precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate followed by resuspension in buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) plus 50 mm NaCl. The resuspension was loaded onto a Hi-load Superdex 200 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) run in buffer C plus 50 mm NaCl. Fractions containing Rep were pooled and loaded directly onto a 3.5-ml heparin-agarose column equilibrated in buffer C plus 50 mm NaCl.

Fractions containing Rep were pooled and dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, and 40% glycerol (v/v) before freezing as above. DNA Unwinding Assays-Assays were performed in 10-μl volumes using 1 nm DNA substrate in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, and 0.04 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. All reaction components except proteins were assembled and incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. When included, SSB was then added and incubation continued for 2 min. UvrA and/or UvrB were then added, and incubation was continued for 2 min. UvrD or Rep was then added, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2.5 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% SDS, 200 mm EDTA, and 10 mg/ml proteinase K. Termination was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min. 2.5 μl of 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 30% glycerol was then added. Samples were loaded onto 16 × 10-cm 10% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris-buffered EDTA and electrophoresed at 190 V for 90-150 min depending on substrate structure. Gels were dried and analyzed using phosphorimaging and autoradiography. Time courses were performed in a similar manner except that reaction volumes were increased, with 10-μl aliquots removed at the indicated times. Time 0 was the point at which UvrD was added to the reaction. UvrA and -B Promote Unwinding of Nicked Duplex Substrates by UvrD-In the absence of DNA polymerase I, UvrAB and UvrD may be needed to unwind DNA at Okazaki fragment junctions (51Moolenaar G.F. Moorman C. Goosen N. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5706-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These junctions can be viewed as nicked duplexes. We tested the effects of UvrAB on UvrD-catalyzed unwinding of a model nicked duplex having two 60-bp duplex arms (Fig. 1). SSB was also included, given that the product of any unwinding, ssDNA, would be bound by SSB in vivo. The addition of UvrD generated two products, one of which migrated above the substrate, whereas the other migrated below (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The upper product proved to be a partial duplex product generated by unwinding of the downstream 60-mer oligonucleotide (Fig. 1A, lane 16). The slower migration of this product as compared with the initial substrate was likely due to secondary structure formation within the exposed 60 bases of ssDNA upon deproteinization of the reactions before loading on the gel. The faster-migrating product was the labeled upstream 60-mer oligonucleotide. UvrD could therefore unwind both 60-mer strands, although whether displacement of the labeled oligonucleotide was a secondary product of unwinding the partial duplex product cannot be ascertained from this experiment. A range of concentrations of UvrA and UvrB were tested for effects on UvrD-catalyzed unwinding of substrate 1. Stimulation of the total levels of unwinding was observed at all concentrations of UvrA and UvrB (Fig. 1). Maximal stimulation was achieved with 10 nm UvrA or above and 100 nm UvrB or above (Fig. 1B). In the absence of UvrD, UvrAB failed to promote significant displacement of any of the DNA strands within the substrate (Fig. 1A, lanes 7, 11, and 15). Although UvrAB does have limited strand displacement activity, displacement is restricted to duplexes of less than 30 bp (32Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which correlates with the lack of strand displacement of the 60-bp duplexes present in substrate 1. The presence of UvrAB enhanced production of both the partial duplex and the single-stranded oligonucleotide products (Fig. 1A). Thus, UvrAB had no major effect on the polarity of UvrD-catalyzed unwinding of substrate 1. The contribution of SSB to stimulation of UvrD by UvrAB was also analyzed using substrate 1. In the absence of SSB, stimulation of UvrD-catalyzed unwinding of substrate 1 by UvrAB was again observed (Fig. 2). Therefore, SSB plays no essential role in stimulation of UvrD by UvrAB. Production of both the partial duplex and the single-stranded oligonucleotide was enhanced (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lanes 9 and 13). Thus, as seen in the presence of SSB, UvrAB had no major effect on the polarity of unwinding by UvrD. UvrD was then titrated into reactions containing 10 nm UvrA and 100 nm UvrB, concentrations which gave near-maximal stimulation of UvrD, and SSB (Fig. 1). Alternately labeled versions of the same nicked duplex employed in Fig. 1 were also used to investigate the directionality of unwinding. On substrate 1, stimulation by UvrAB was observed at all concentrations of UvrD tested (Fig. 3, A and C). The presence of UvrAB resulted in a dramatic reduction in the concentration of UvrD required for strand displac"
https://openalex.org/W2040735157,"In casual speech, phonemic segments often assimilate such that they adopt features from adjacent segments, a typical feature being their place of articulation within the vocal tract (e.g., labial, coronal, velar). Place assimilation (e.g., from coronal /n/ to labial /m/: rainbow→*raimbow) alters the surface form of words. Listeners' ability to perceptually compensate for such changes seems to depend on the phonemic context, on whether the adjacent segment (e.g., the /b/ in “rainbow”) invites the particular change. Also, some assimilations occur frequently (e.g., /n/→/m/), others are rare (e.g., /m/→/n/). We investigated the effects of place assimilation, its contextual dependency, and its frequency on the strength of auditory evoked mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, using pseudowords. Results from magnetoencephalography (MEG) revealed that the MMN was modulated both by the frequency and contextual appropriateness of assimilations."

A (1)H-(15)N HSQC NMR titration study with three different tropocollagen analogues ((POG)(10))(3), ((GPOG)(7)PRG)(3), and (GPRG(POG)(7)C-carbamidomethyl)(3), mapped a saddle-like binding cleft on CBD. NMR titrations with three nitroxide spin-labeled analogues of collagenous peptide, (PROXYL-G(POG)(7)PRG)(3), (PROXYL-G(POG)(7))(3), and (GPRG(POG)(7)C-PROXYL)(3) (where PROXYL represents 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-l-pyrrolidinyloxy), unambiguously demonstrated unidirectional binding of CBD to the tropocollagen analogues. Small angle x-ray scattering data revealed that CBD binds closer to a terminus for each of the five different tropocollagen analogues, which in conjunction with NMR titration studies, implies a binding mode where CBD binds to the C terminus of the triple helix."

However, the preexisting influenza heterosubtypic immunity on live attenuated H5N1 vaccine induced immune response has not been evaluated.Primary and recall B cell responses to live attenuated H5N1 vaccine viruses were examined using a sensitive antigen-specific B cell ELISpot assay to investigate the effect of preexisting heterosubtypic influenza immunity on the development of H5N1-specific B cell immune responses in ferrets. Live attenuated H5N1 A/Hong Kong/213/03 and A/Vietnam/1203/04 vaccine viruses induced measurable H5-specific IgM and IgG secreting B cells after intranasal vaccination. However, H5-specific IgG secreting cells were detected significantly earlier and at a greater frequency after H5N1 inoculation in ferrets previously primed with trivalent live attenuated influenza (H1N1, H3N2 and B) vaccine. Priming studies further revealed that the more rapid B cell responses to H5 resulted from cross-reactive B cell immunity to the hemagglutinin H1 protein. Moreover, vaccination with the H1N1 vaccine virus was able to induce protective responses capable of limiting replication of the H5N1 vaccine virus to a level comparable with prior vaccination with the H5N1 vaccine virus without affecting H5N1 vaccine virus induced antibody response.The findings indicate that previous vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine may accelerate onset of immunity by an H5N1 ca vaccine and the heterosubtypic immunity may be beneficial for pandemic preparedness."
https://openalex.org/W2046242072,"Background The subcellular localization of membrane and secreted proteins is finely and dynamically regulated through intracellular vesicular trafficking for permitting various biological processes. Drosophila Amyloid precursor protein like (APPL) and Hikaru genki (HIG) are examples of proteins that show differential subcellular localization among several developmental stages. Methodology/Principal Findings During the study of the localization mechanisms of APPL and HIG, we isolated a novel mutant of the gene, CG1973, which we named yata. This molecule interacted genetically with Appl and is structurally similar to mouse NTKL/SCYL1, whose mutation was reported to cause neurodegeneration. yata null mutants showed phenotypes that included developmental abnormalities, progressive eye vacuolization, brain volume reduction, and lifespan shortening. Exogenous expression of Appl or hig in neurons partially rescued the mutant phenotypes of yata. Conversely, the phenotypes were exacerbated in double null mutants for yata and Appl. We also examined the subcellular localization of endogenous APPL and exogenously pulse-induced APPL tagged with FLAG by immunostaining the pupal brain and larval motor neurons in yata mutants. Our data revealed that yata mutants showed impaired subcellular localization of APPL. Finally, yata mutant pupal brains occasionally showed aberrant accumulation of Sec23p, a component of the COPII coat of secretory vesicles traveling from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. Conclusion/Significance We identified a novel gene, yata, which is essential for the normal development and survival of tissues. Loss of yata resulted in the progressive deterioration of the nervous system and premature lethality. Our genetic data showed a functional relationship between yata and Appl. As a candidate mechanism of the abnormalities, we found that yata regulates the subcellular localization of APPL and possibly other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1977610488,"TR2 is an orphan nuclear receptor specifically expressed in early embryos (Wei and Hsu, 1994), and a transcription factor for transcriptional regulation of important genes in stem cells including the gate keeper Oct4 (Park et al. 2007). TR2 is known to function as an activator (Wei et al. 2000), or a repressor (Chinpaisal et al., 1998, Gupta et al. 2007). Due to the lack of specific ligands, mechanisms triggering its activator or repressor function have remained puzzling for decades. Recently, we found that all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) triggers the activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), which phosphorylates TR2 and stimulates its partitioning to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, thereby converting the activator function of TR2 into repression (Gupta et al. 2008; Park et al. 2007). Recruitment of TR2 to PML is a crucial step in the conversion of TR2 from an activator to a repressor. However, it is unclear how phosphorylated TR2 is recruited to PML, an essential step in converting TR2 from an activator to a repressor. In the present study, we use both in vitro and in vivo systems to address the problem of recruiting TR2 to PML nuclear bodies. First, we identify histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) as an effector molecule. HDAC3 is known to interact with TR2 (Franco et al. 2001) and this interaction is enhanced by the atRA-stimulated phosphorylation of TR2 at Thr-210 (Gupta et al. 2008). Secondly, in this study, we also find that the carrier function of HDAC3 is independent of its deacetylase activity. Thirdly, we find another novel activity of atRA that stimulates nuclear enrichment of HDAC3 to form nuclear complex with PML, which is ERK2 independent. This is the first report identifying a deacetylase-independent function for HDAC3, which serves as a specific carrier molecule that targets a specifically phosphorylated protein to PML NBs. This is also the first study delineating how protein recruitment to PML nuclear bodies occurs, which can be stimulated by atRA in an ERK2-independent manner. These findings could provide new insights into the development of potential therapeutics and in understanding how orphan nuclear receptor activities can be regulated without ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1979102799,"Tumor cell death is modulated by an intrinsic cell death pathway controlled by the pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members has been shown to suppress cell death in pre-clinical models of human cancer and is implicated in human tumor progression. Previous gain-of-function studies in the RIP1-Tag2 model of pancreatic islet carcinogenesis, involving uniform or focal/temporal over-expression of Bcl-xL, demonstrated accelerated tumor formation and growth. To specifically assess the role of endogenous Bcl-x in regulating apoptosis and tumor progression in this model, we engineered a pancreatic β-cell-specific knockout of both alleles of Bcl-x using the Cre-LoxP system of homologous recombination. Surprisingly, there was no appreciable effect on tumor cell apoptosis rates or on tumor growth in the Bcl-x knockout mice. Other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members were expressed but not substantively altered at the mRNA level in the Bcl-x-null tumors, suggestive of redundancy without compensatory transcriptional up-regulation. Interestingly, the incidence of invasive carcinomas was reduced, and tumor cells lacking Bcl-x were impaired in invasion in a two-chamber trans-well assay under conditions mimicking hypoxia. Thus, while the function of Bcl-x in suppressing apoptosis and thereby promoting tumor growth is evidently redundant, genetic ablation implicates Bcl-x in selectively facilitating invasion, consistent with a recent report documenting a pro-invasive capability of Bcl-xL upon exogenous over-expression."
https://openalex.org/W2048557802,"Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is the enzyme responsible for specifically removing the flap structure produced during DNA replication, repair, and recombination.

Kinetic analyses indicate that the mechanism by which RFC stimulates FEN1 is distinct from that by proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

Via systematic deletion analyses, we have defined three specific regions of RFC4 capable of stimulating FEN1. The region of RFC4 with the highest activity spans amino acids 170–194 and contains RFC box VII. Four amino acid residues (i.e. Tyr-182, Glu-188, Pro-189, and Ser-192) are especially important for FEN1 stimulatory activity.

Inactivation of the RAD27 gene, which encodes Rad27 (yeast FEN1), led to many anomalies in DNA metabolism. For example, deletion of RAD27 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae produces a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype with a variety of chromosomal instabilities (6Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S.

Although homozygous FEN1 knock-out is embryonic lethal (13Larsen E. Gran C. Saether B.E. Seeberg E. Klungland A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2003; 23: 5346-5353Google Scholar), heterozygotes are prone to develop tumors because of chromosomal instability caused by haplo-insufficiency of FEN1 (14Kucherlapati M. Yang K. Kuraguchi M.

Genetic and biochemical studies from yeasts and mammals together confirmed that FEN1 has roles in virtually every aspect of major DNA transactions. For example, FEN1 participates in the maturation of Okazaki fragments by cleaving the flap structure generated by polymerase (pol) δ-catalyzed displacement of DNA synthesis (15Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature.. 2001; 412: 456-461Google Scholar, 16Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev... 2004; 18: 2764-2773Google Scholar). FEN1 is also required for long-patch base excision and nucleotide excision repair because transient short flaps are generated during gap filling (17Reagan M.S. Pittenger C. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. J. Bacteriol... 1995; 177: 364-371Google Scholar, 18Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 8842-8848Google Scholar-19Prasad R. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 4460-4466Google Scholar). In nonhomologous end-joining, two single strand DNA ends from resected double strand breaks, upon annealing to each other using micro-homology, can generate 5′ flaps that can be removed by FEN1 (20Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 1303-1308Google Scholar). The preferred substrate for FEN1 is a double-flap structure containing a 1-nucleotide (nt) 3′ flap in addition to the 5′ flap that is cleaved (21Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 4503-4508Google Scholar). This double-flap substrate is believed to be a physiological substrate (22Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 14379-14389Google Scholar). Based upon its enzymatic properties in vitro, the primary role of FEN1 in vivo is likely the creation of ligatable nicks by removing flap structures generated in vivo. The failure to do so is likely to lead to chromosomal instability. Recently, it was reported that FEN1 had gap endonuclease (GEN) activity, which is implicated in restarting stalled replication forks and in apoptotic DNA fragmentation (11Zheng L. Zhou M. Chai Q. Parrish J. Xue D. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Yannone S.M. Chen D. Shen B. EMBO Rep... 2005; 6: 83-89Google Scholar, 23Parrish J.Z. Yang C. Shen B. Xue D. EMBO J... 2003; 22: 3451-3460Google Scholar). FEN1 interacts with other proteins to achieve its function more effectively (24Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2004; 73: 589-615Google Scholar, 25Shen B. Singh P. Liu R. Qiu J. Zheng L. Finger L.D. Alas S. BioEssays.. 2005; 27: 717-729Google Scholar). For example, FEN1 is stimulated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) through protein-protein interaction (26Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 22109-22112Google Scholar, 27Wu X. Li J. Li X. Hsieh C.L. Burgers P.M. Lieber M.R.

A mutation in the PCNA interaction domain of Rad27 decreases stimulation by PCNA, resulting in replication and repair defects in vivo (28Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. EMBO J... 2000; 19: 3811-3821Google Scholar). There are two Rad27-binding sites in PCNA that are differentially accessible to Rad27 for stimulation, depending upon the binding status of PCNA to substrate DNA. Both Werner syndrome protein (WRN) and Bloom syndrome protein (BLM), members of RecQ helicase family, stimulate FEN1 through physical interaction. The stimulation was independent of ATPase/helicase activity (12Liu R. Qiu J. Finger L.D. Zheng L. Shen B. Nucleic Acids Res... 2006; 34: 1772-1784Google Scholar, 31Brosh R.M. Jr., von Kobbe C.

A fragment WRN-(949–1092) (144 amino acids) was necessary and sufficient to interact and stimulate human FEN1 (31Brosh R.M. Jr., von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J... 2001; 20: 5791-5801Google Scholar). Thus, WRN and BLM are likely to prevent genome instability by collaborating with FEN1. Recently, it was reported that the human Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) checkpoint complex, which resembles PCNA in structure, interacted and stimulated FEN1 (37Wang W. Brandt P. Rossi M.L. Lindsey-Boltz L. Podust V. Fanning E. Sancar A. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2004; 101: 16762-16767Google Scholar). They proposed that the 9-1-1 complex serves as a binding platform for FEN1 in DNA repair. Our findings and the findings of others that several genetic suppressors, which rescued defects of dna2, stimulated FEN1 (34Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Brosh Jr. R.M. Hum. Mol. Genet... 2004; 13: 2247-2261Google Scholar, 38Imamura O. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2003; 100: 8193-8198Google Scholar, 39Kim J.H. Kang Y.H. Kang H.J. Kim D.H. Ryu G.H. Kang M.J. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res... 2005; 33: 6137-6150Google Scholar) prompted us to examine enzymes or proteins involved in lagging strand synthesis for their ability to stimulate FEN1 activity. For this purpose, we tested the influence of the human RFC complex on catalytic activity of human FEN1, and we found that it stimulated markedly FEN1 activity via multiple stimulatory motifs per molecule. RFC acts as a loading factor of PCNA and consists of five subunits as follows: RFC1 (140 kDa), RFC2 (40 kDa), RFC3 (38 kDa), RFC4 (37 kDa), and RFC5 (36 kDa). All its subunits share significant homology in seven regions referred to as RFC boxes (box II–VIII) (40Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1995; 15: 4661-4671Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis by RFC is required to load PCNA onto a primer-template junction (41Cai J. Yao N. Gibbs E. Finkelstein J. Phillips B. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J.

Chem... 2001; 276: 34792-34800Google Scholar). PCNA, once loaded, encircles the duplex DNA region in a primed template and tethers a DNA polymerase at the growing end of DNA so that the DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA in a processive manner (46Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature.. 2004; 429: 724-730Google Scholar, 47Miyata T. Oyama T. Mayanagi K. Ishino S. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Our findings that RFC has several stimulatory motifs and strongly activates FEN1 indicate that RFC is a critical partner for FEN1 to remove flap structures arising from DNA metabolism, including processing of eukaryotic Okazaki fragments. Enzymes and Nucleotides—The oligonucleotides used in this study were commercially synthesized from Genotech (Daejeon, Korea), and their sequences are listed in Table 1. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences and Izotop (Budapest, Hungary). Restriction enzymes and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Enzynomics™ (Daejeon, Korea). Adenosine triphosphate and ATPγS were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Rad27, yeast FEN1, was purified as described previously (15Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature.. 2001; 412: 456-461Google Scholar). Human replication protein A and PCNA were purified from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL (Stratagene) as described (49Henricksen L.A.

Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature.. 2001; 412: 456-461Google Scholar) using the synthetic oligonucleotides listed in Table 1. Oligonucleotides used as substrates, the position of radioisotopic label in the substrates, and substrate structures are indicated in each figure. Briefly, an oligonucleotide was first labeled at its 5′-end by incorporating [γ-32P]ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase and was followed by annealing with upstream and template oligonucleotides in a molar ratio of 1:4:2 (5′-labeled downstream/upstream/template oligonucleotides, respectively). The annealing reaction was performed by using PCR machine (95 °C, 5 min; 65 °C, 30 min; –1 °C/min). An equilibrating flap substrate was prepared as described previously (22Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 14379-14389Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A downstream oligonucleotide was first labeled at its 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the labeled oligonucleotide was then annealed to a template oligonucleotide along with an upstream oligonucleotide in a molar ratio of 1:3:10, respectively, as described above. The resulting equilibrating flap substrate was gel-purified prior to use. Purification of FEN1 and RFC—The pET-23d(+)-FEN1 plasmid was constructed as described previously (10Storici F. Henneke G. Ferrari E. Gordenin D.A. Hubscher U. Resnick M.A. EMBO J... 2002; 21: 5930-5942Google Scholar, 51Stucki M. Jonsson Z.O. Hubscher U. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 7843-7849Google Scholar). FEN1 expressed from this vector contained a C-terminally tagged hexahistidine. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL (Stratagene), and expression of proteins was induced at A600 = 0.4 with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.4 mm) at 30 °C for 3 h. FEN1 was purified using the same procedure as described (10Storici F. Henneke G. Ferrari E. Gordenin D.A. Hubscher U. Resnick M.A. EMBO J... 2002; 21: 5930-5942Google Scholar). Peak fractions from Mono S column chromatography were subjected to glycerol gradient sedimentation as described (52Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 38022-38031Google Scholar). Active peak fractions from the glycerol gradient were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C until use. The plasmid expressing FEN1-(ΔC337–380), a C-terminal 44 amino acid deletion mutant of FEN1, was constructed with pET-23d(+)-FEN1 as template according to the manufacturer's instruction using EZchange® mutagenesis kit (Enzynomics™, Korea). The FEN1-(ΔC337–380) mutant enzyme was expressed and purified essentially as the same procedure used for wild type FEN1 described above. Recombinant human RFC complex containing a truncated version of p140 lacking the N-terminal 555 amino acid residues was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells as described previously (53Cai J. Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.G. Phillips B. Finkelstein J. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 12896-12901Google Scholar, 54Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 10058-10064Google Scholar) and is referred to as RFC in this study. Preparation of RFC4 and Its Derivatives—DNA sequences encoding full-length RFC4 and its truncated derivatives (see Fig. 7A) were amplified by PCR and inserted into BamHI/NotI sites of pET28a(+) (Novagen), resulting in pET28a(+)-RFC4x-y (x and y indicate the position of amino acid at its beginning and end, respectively). All polypeptides expressed from this construct contained a His6 tag and 24-amino acid linker fused to RFC4 and its derivatives to facilitate purification. The expression vectors constructed were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus-RIL (Stratagene), and expression of proteins was induced at A600 = 0.5 with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) at 30 °C for 3 h. Cells from a 0.2-liter culture were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 15 ml of buffer N300 (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin A), and sonicated (three cycles of 60 s with a 3-min cooling interval). The subscript in buffer N300 denotes NaCl in mm. Extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the cleared lysate was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (300 μl, Qiagen), pre-equilibrated with buffer N300. The column was successively washed with 10-column volumes of buffer N300 and with buffer N300 plus 25 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted stepwise with buffer N300 plus 50, 100, 200, and 300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing most pure proteins were collected and used to test whether it possessed FEN1 stimulation activity. Protein concentrations were measured using Bradford solution with BSA standard. To measure concentrations of small proteins (with <100 amino acid residues), purified aliquots of the fractions were subjected to 16% Tricine/SDS-PAGE (55Schagger H. Nat. Protoc... 2006; 1: 16-22Google Scholar), and the gel was run until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. The concentrations of small proteins were measured by comparing intensities of Coomassie-stained bands with those of BSA control. For single amino acid substitution in RFC4-(170–194), pET-28a(+)-RFC4-(170–194) prepared as described above was used as template, and alanine substitution was performed using the EZchange® mutagenesis kit (Enzynomics™, Korea). All oligonucleotides used for construction of expression plasmids or site-directed mutagenesis are available upon request. Standard Endonuclease Assays—Standard endonuclease assays were performed in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, and 15 fmol of the standard double-flap substrate (see Fig. 1B). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 4 μl of 6× stop solution (40% sucrose, 60 mm EDTA, 1.2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). The cleavage products were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (plus 0.1% SDS) for 40 min at 140 Vin1× TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). The gels were dried on DEAE-cellulose paper (DE81, Whatman) and autoradiographed. Labeled DNA products were quantified with the use of a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Determination of Kinetic Parameters—To measure kinetic parameters, kinetic analyses were repeated in triplicate using increasing amounts (0, 20, 40, and 80 fmol) of a double-flap substrate; the substrate was prepared with oligonucleotides 1, 7, and 5 (upstream primer, template, and labeled downstream primer, respectively; refer to Fig. 5 for its structure) as described above. Reactions were carried out with 1 fmol of FEN1 and saturating levels (40 fmol) of RFC per reaction, and under these reaction conditions we were able to obtain reliable amounts of products at the early time point of incubation. Reaction mixtures (120 μl) were assembled on ice, followed by preincubation at 37 °C for 5 min, and initiated by the addition of 4 mm MgCl2. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at 1, 2, 4, and 8 min after incubation and transferred to a tube containing 4 μl of 6× stop buffer. The amounts of products were analyzed as described above. Kinetic parameters were obtained based on the Michaelis-Menten equation. V = dt[P]/dt, where [P] is the amount of products in nm. The concentration of [P] was calculated using the equation, [P] = Icleaved/(Iuncleaved + Icleaved) × [S], where [S] is concentration of substrate used, and Icleaved and Iuncleaved are band intensities of products and substrate left, respectively. The initial velocity was plotted against [S], and the values Km and Vmax were calculated by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc.) to avoid distortion of the experimental errors, which can occur during reciprocal transformation of the data. Human RFC Stimulates Human FEN1 on Double-flap Substrate—To test the influence of the human RFC complex on catalytic activity of human FEN1, we purified both enzymes to near homogeneity as shown in Fig. 1A. The RFC complex purified contained the N-terminally deleted version of RFC1, which supported DNA pol δ in vitro as efficiently as wild type (42Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 34768-34775Google Scholar, 54Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 10058-10064Google Scholar). We found that the RFC complex markedly stimulated FEN1 activity (Fig. 1B) with a double-flap DNA substrate containing a 5′ 27-nt and a 3′ 1-nt flap, a physiological form of substrate (22Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 14379-14389Google Scholar). We refer to this double-flap substrate as standard substrate in this study. Unless otherwise stated, this double-flap substrate was used to measure FEN1 endonuclease activity. Additions of 5 or 20 fmol (Fig. 1B, lanes 8–13 and 14–19, respectively) of RFC to reaction mixtures containing 1 fmol of FEN1 resulted in a significant (5–10-fold) stimulation of FEN1-catalyzed cleavage of the 5′ flap in response to concentrations of Mg2+ used (Fig. 1B). Increase in Mg2+ concentrations resulted in a linear increase in cleavage of flap DNA by FEN1 in the absence of RFC (Fig. 1, B, lanes 2–7, and C, gray circles). The addition of RFC (5 fmol) increased FEN1-catalyzed cleavage of flap dramatically at all Mg2+ concentrations tested (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 2–7 with lanes 8–13), reaching a plateau at 4 mm of Mg2+ (Fig. 1C, open circles). The addition of more (20 fmol) RFC did not further increase the stimulation (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 8–13 with 14–19). Thus, increases in Mg2+ concentrations not only enhance FEN1 activity but also increase the extent of FEN1 stimulation by RFC. With RFC (20 fmol) alone, no cleavage products were detected (Fig. 1B, lane 20). We next decided to determine optimal concentration of Mg2+ for stimulation of FEN1 by RFC. For this purpose, we tested effects of increasing concentrations (2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mm) of Mg2+ on FEN1 activity in the presence of increasing levels (0, 5, and 20 fmol) of RFC (Fig. 1D). In this experiment, we reduced the amount of FEN1 to 0.5 fmol. We found that higher concentrations (>10 mm) of Mg2+ were inhibitory to FEN1 activity. In addition, lower levels (5 fmol) of RFC stimulated FEN1 activity, most effectively in Mg2+ concentrations less than 10 mm (Fig. 1D). The addition of 20 fmol of RFC resulted in robust stimulation of FEN1 in Mg2+ concentrations at 10 mm or above, indicating that RFC allows FEN1 to overcome the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of Mg2+ (Fig. 1D). Based upon these findings, we decided to use 4 mm of Mg2+ in all subsequent reactions. RFC Accelerates FEN1 Activity in an ATP-independent Manner—Next, we examined whether RFC could stimulate FEN1 in its low concentrations. To this end, we used a very low level (0.1 fmol) of FEN1 and excess RFC (20 fmol). As shown in Fig. 2A, the amounts of products formed were barely detectable (∼0.3 fmol) after 30 min of incubation in the absence of RFC. In the presence of RFC, however, the amounts of products formed were 9.3 fmol (∼30-fold more than in its absence) after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 2, A and B). We also investigated the influence of RFC concentration on FEN1 activity in a time course experiment, and we found that increasing concentrations (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 20 fmol) of RFC increased the rate of FEN1-catalyzed cleavage (Fig. 2C). This kinetic analysis revealed that the increase in RFC concentrations enhanced markedly (>5-fold) the rate of substrate cleavage by FEN1 (Fig. 2C). In the absence of RFC, the FEN1-alone reaction continued to accumulate cleavage products up to 1 h at 37 °C, indicating that FEN1 was not inactivated during the incubation period (Fig. 2C). However, the substrate cleavage rate increased proportionally to the amount of RFC added (Fig. 2C). Thus, we concluded that RFC accelerates the FEN1-catalyzed cleavage reaction. These results indicate that the increase in FEN1 activity is because of RFC stimulation of FEN1, not because of stabilization of the FEN1 protein. Because RFC is a weak DNA-dependent ATPase (53Cai J. Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.G. Phillips B. Finkelstein J. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1996; 93: 12896-12901Google Scholar), we examined whether ATP binding or ATP hydrolysis could alter the ability of RFC to stimulate FEN1. Neither ATP nor its nonhydrolyzable analog, ATPγS (1 mm, each), affected the stimulation of FEN1 activity by RFC (Fig. 2D), indicating that FEN1 stimulation by RFC requires neither ATP binding nor hydrolysis. RFC Stimulates FEN1 Activity in a Manner Distinct from PCNA—Because FEN1 and RFC interact with PCNA, we performed mixing experiments to determine whether stimulation of FEN1 by RFC and PCNA is mutually exclusive (Fig. 3). First, we used the same concentrations (0–20 fmol; 0–1 nm) of RFC and PCNA in the presence of a fixed amount (0.5 fmol) of FEN1 as shown in Fig. 3A. The addition of increasing concentrations of RFC (Fig. 3, A, lanes 3–7, and B, closed circles) resulted in significant stimulation, whereas the addition of PCNA equivalent to RFC failed to give rise to any detectable stimulation (Fig. 3, A, lanes 9–13, and B, gray circles). We then determined concentrations of PCNA required to stimulate FEN1 activity to that comparable with RFC (data not shown), and we found that ∼200-fold more PCNA was required than RFC to obtain comparable stimulation (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 3–7 with 9–13, and D, closed and gray circles). Amounts of products formed in the presence of both RFC and PCNA (Fig. 3C, lanes 15–19) were close to the combined amounts of products formed in the presence of PCNA or RFC alone (Fig. 3D). Our results suggest that the mechanisms by which FEN1 is stimulated by RFC and PCNA are different. We also investigated whether ATP could affect stimulation of FEN1 by RFC in the presence of PCNA, but we found that it did not affect the stimulation extent (data not shown). This result indicates that stimulation of FEN1 by RFC occurs independently of the RFC loading function of PCNA. Effect of RFC on the Kinetic Parameters for FEN1 Cleavage—We next determined the reaction kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, as described under ""Materials and Methods."" The addition of RFC results in significant increase (>4-fold) in Vmax (and thus Kcat), although hardly affecting Km (Table 2). This result indicates that the addition of RFC increases Kcat/Km, the catalytic efficiency of FEN1 ∼4.8-fold (Table 2). The results of our kinetic analysis indicate that RFC increases catalytic power by increasing the turnover rate of FEN1. The two kinetic parameters also support the idea that the mechanism by which RFC stimulates FEN1 is distinct from that of PCNA, which increased Vmax 2-fold, but decreased Km ∼12-fold (29Tom S.

https://openalex.org/W2017347437,"GB virus B (GBV-B) is closely related to hepatitis C virus (HCV), infects small non-human primates, and is thus a valuable surrogate for studying HCV. Despite significant differences, the 5' nontranslated RNAs (NTRs) of these viruses fold into four similar structured domains (I-IV), with domains II-III-IV comprising the viral internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). We previously reported the in vivo rescue of a chimeric GBV-B (vGB/III(HC)) containing HCV sequence in domain III, an essential segment of the IRES. We show here that three mutations identified within the vGB/III(HC) genome (within the 3'NTR, upstream of the poly(U) tract, and NS5A coding sequence) are necessary and sufficient for production of this chimeric virus following intrahepatic inoculation of synthetic RNA in tamarins, and thus apparently compensate for the presence of HCV sequence in domain III. To assess the mechanism(s) underlying these compensatory mutations, and to determine whether 5'NTR subdomains participating in genome replication do so in a virus-specific fashion, we constructed and evaluated a series of chimeric subgenomic GBV-B replicons in which various 5'NTR subdomains were substituted with their HCV homologs. Domains I and II of the GBV-B 5'NTR could not be replaced with HCV sequence, indicating that they contain essential, virus-specific RNA replication elements. In contrast, domain III could be swapped with minimal loss of genome replication capacity in cell culture. The 3'NTR and NS5A mutations required for rescue of the related chimeric virus in vivo had no effect on replication of the subgenomic GBneoD/III(HC) RNA in vitro. The data suggest that in vivo fitness of the domain III chimeric virus is dependent on a cooperative interaction between the 5'NTR, 3'NTR and NS5A at a step in the viral life cycle subsequent to genome replication, most likely during particle assembly. Such a mechanism may be common to all hepaciviruses."
https://openalex.org/W1993844599,"In inner organs, glutamine contributes to proliferation, detoxification and establishment of a mechanical barrier, i.e., functions essential for skin, as well. However, the age-dependent and regional peculiarities of distribution of glutamine synthetase (GS), an enzyme responsible for generation of glutamine, and factors regulating its enzymatic activity in mammalian skin remain undisclosed. To explore this, GS localization was investigated using immunohistochemistry and double-labeling of young and adult human and rat skin sections as well as skin cells in culture. In human and rat skin GS was almost completely co-localized with astrocyte-specific proteins (e.g. GFAP). While GS staining was pronounced in all layers of the epidermis of young human skin, staining was reduced and more differentiated among different layers with age. In stratum basale and in stratum spinosum GS was co-localized with the adherens junction component beta-catenin. Inhibition of, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta in cultured keratinocytes and HaCaT cells, however, did not support a direct role of beta-catenin in regulation of GS. Enzymatic and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies revealed an unusual mode of regulation of this enzyme in keratinocytes, i.e., GS activity, but not expression, was enhanced about 8-10 fold when the cells were exposed to ammonium ions. Prominent posttranscriptional up-regulation of GS activity in keratinocytes by ammonium ions in conjunction with widespread distribution of GS immunoreactivity throughout the epidermis allows considering the skin as a large reservoir of latent GS. Such a depository of glutamine-generating enzyme seems essential for continuous renewal of epidermal permeability barrier and during pathological processes accompanied by hyperammonemia."
https://openalex.org/W1967974763,"Background The World Health Organization (WHO) conducted the World Health Survey (WHS) between 2002 and 2004 in 70 countries to provide cross-population comparable data on health, health-related outcomes and risk factors. The aim of this study was to apply Grade of Membership (GoM) modelling as a means to condense extensive health information from the WHS into a set of easily understandable health profiles and to assign the degree to which an individual belongs to each profile. Principal Findings This paper described the application of the GoM models to summarize population health status using World Health Survey data. Grade of Membership analysis is a flexible, non-parametric, multivariate method, used to calculate health profiles from WHS self-reported health state and health conditions. The WHS dataset was divided into four country economic categories based on the World Bank economic groupings (high, upper-middle, lower-middle and low income economies) for separate GoM analysis. Three main health profiles were produced for each of the four areas: I. Robust; II. Intermediate; III. Frail; moreover population health, wealth and inequalities are defined for countries in each economic area as a means to put the health results into perspective. Conclusions These analyses have provided a robust method to better understand health profiles and the components which can help to identify healthy and non-healthy individuals. The obtained profiles have described concrete levels of health and have clearly delineated characteristics of healthy and non-healthy respondents. The GoM results provided both a useable way of summarising complex individual health information and a selection of intermediate determinants which can be targeted for interventions to improve health. As populations' age, and with limited budgets for additional costs for health care and social services, applying the GoM methods may assist with identifying higher risk profiles for decision-making and resource allocations."
https://openalex.org/W1983029981,"Mutations in the gene for growth hormone releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR) cause isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) but this gene has not been found to affect normal variation in height. We performed a whole genome linkage analysis for height in a population from northern Sweden and identified a region on chromosome 7 with a lod-score of 4.7. The GHRHR gene is located in this region and typing of tagSNPs identified a haplotype that is associated with height (p = 0.00077) in the original study population. Analysis of a sample from an independent population from the most northern part of Sweden also showed an association with height (p = 0.0039) but with another haplotype in the GHRHR gene. Both haplotypes span the 3′ part of the GHRHR gene, including the region in which most of the mutations in IGHD have been located. The effect size of these haplotypes are larger than that of any gene previously associated with height, which indicates that GHRHR might be one of the most important genes so far identified affecting normal variation in human height."
https://openalex.org/W2162723290,"MspA is the major porin of Mycobacterium smegmatis and mediates diffusion of small and hydrophilic solutes across the outer membrane. The octameric structure of MspA, its sharply defined constriction zone, and a large periplasmic loop L6 represent novel structural features. L6 consists of 13 amino acids and is directly adjacent to the constriction zone. Deletion of 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 amino acids of the L6 loop resulted in functional pores that restored glucose uptake and growth of a porin mutant of M. smegmatis. Lipid bilayer experiments revealed that all mutant channels were noisier than wild type (wt) MspA, indicating that L6 is required for pore stability in vitro. Voltage gating of the Escherichia coli porin OmpF was attributed to loops that collapse into the channel in response to a strong electrical field. Here, we show that deletion mutants Delta7, Delta9, and Delta11 had critical voltages similar to wt MspA. This demonstrated that the L6 loop is not the primary voltage-dependent gating mechanism of MspA. Surprisingly, large deletions in L6 resulted in 3-6-fold less extractable pores, whereas small deletions did not alter expression levels of MspA. Pores with large deletions in L6 were more permissive for glucose than smaller deletion mutants, whereas their single channel conductance was similar to that of wt MspA. These results indicate that translocation of ions through the MspA pore is governed by different mechanisms than that of neutral solutes. This is the first study identifying a molecular determinant of solute translocation in a mycobacterial porin."
