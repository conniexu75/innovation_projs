https://openalex.org/W1978512827,"High-resolution gravity data obtained from the dual Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft show that the bulk density of the Moon's highlands crust is 2550 kilograms per cubic meter, substantially lower than generally assumed. When combined with remote sensing and sample data, this density implies an average crustal porosity of 12% to depths of at least a few kilometers. Lateral variations in crustal porosity correlate with the largest impact basins, whereas lateral variations in crustal density correlate with crustal composition. The low-bulk crustal density allows construction of a global crustal thickness model that satisfies the Apollo seismic constraints, and with an average crustal thickness between 34 and 43 kilometers, the bulk refractory element composition of the Moon is not required to be enriched with respect to that of Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2161990844,"Trevor Lawley and colleagues report whole-genome sequencing of a large global collection of Clostridium difficile, the most common cause of healthcare-associated infection in the developed world. Their phylogenetic analysis traces the spread of this pathogen through healthcare-associated epidemics worldwide. Epidemic C. difficile (027/BI/NAP1) has rapidly emerged in the past decade as the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide. However, the key events in evolutionary history leading to its emergence and the subsequent patterns of global spread remain unknown. Here, we define the global population structure of C. difficile 027/BI/NAP1 using whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. We show that two distinct epidemic lineages, FQR1 and FQR2, not one as previously thought, emerged in North America within a relatively short period after acquiring the same fluoroquinolone resistance–conferring mutation and a highly related conjugative transposon. The two epidemic lineages showed distinct patterns of global spread, and the FQR2 lineage spread more widely, leading to healthcare-associated outbreaks in the UK, continental Europe and Australia. Our analysis identifies key genetic changes linked to the rapid transcontinental dissemination of epidemic C. difficile 027/BI/NAP1 and highlights the routes by which it spreads through the global healthcare system."

https://openalex.org/W1982490126,"This study examines the neural coding of decision confidence when human subjects make value-based economic choices, and finds that signals of explicit confidence are encoded in the activity of ventromedial prefrontal cortex and its interaction with the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex. Decisions are never perfect, with confidence in one's choices fluctuating over time. How subjective confidence and valuation of choice options interact at the level of brain and behavior is unknown. Using a dynamic model of the decision process, we show that confidence reflects the evolution of a decision variable over time, explaining the observed relation between confidence, value, accuracy and reaction time. As predicted by our dynamic model, we show that a functional magnetic resonance imaging signal in human ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) reflects both value comparison and confidence in the value comparison process. Crucially, individuals varied in how they related confidence to accuracy, allowing us to show that this introspective ability is predicted by a measure of functional connectivity between vmPFC and rostrolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings provide a mechanistic link between noise in value comparison and metacognitive awareness of choice, enabling us both to want and to express knowledge of what we want."

https://openalex.org/W2138122783,"Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini and colleagues identify recurrent SETBP1 mutations in atypical chronic myeloid leukemia. The mutations, which cluster in a small region of SETBP1, are associated with high white blood cell counts and poor prognosis. Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) shares clinical and laboratory features with CML, but it lacks the BCR-ABL1 fusion. We performed exome sequencing of eight aCMLs and identified somatic alterations of SETBP1 (encoding a p.Gly870Ser alteration) in two cases. Targeted resequencing of 70 aCMLs, 574 diverse hematological malignancies and 344 cancer cell lines identified SETBP1 mutations in 24 cases, including 17 of 70 aCMLs (24.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 16–35%). Most mutations (92%) were located between codons 858 and 871 and were identical to changes seen in individuals with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome. Individuals with mutations had higher white blood cell counts (P = 0.008) and worse prognosis (P = 0.01). The p.Gly870Ser alteration abrogated a site for ubiquitination, and cells exogenously expressing this mutant exhibited higher amounts of SETBP1 and SET protein, lower PP2A activity and higher proliferation rates relative to those expressing the wild-type protein. In summary, mutated SETBP1 represents a newly discovered oncogene present in aCML and closely related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1964268435,"Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by repetitive twisting muscle contractions and postures. Its molecular pathophysiology is poorly understood, in part owing to limited knowledge of the genetic basis of the disorder. Only three genes for primary torsion dystonia (PTD), TOR1A (DYT1), THAP1 (DYT6) and CIZ1 (ref. 5), have been identified. Using exome sequencing in two families with PTD, we identified a new causative gene, GNAL, with a nonsense mutation encoding p.Ser293* resulting in a premature stop codon in one family and a missense mutation encoding p.Val137Met in the other. Screening of GNAL in 39 families with PTD identified 6 additional new mutations in this gene. Impaired function of several of the mutants was shown by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays."
https://openalex.org/W2140700142,"Adaptor protein-2 (AP2), a central component of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), is pivotal in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which internalizes plasma membrane constituents such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). AP2, a heterotetramer of α, β, μ and σ subunits, links clathrin to vesicle membranes and binds to tyrosine- and dileucine-based motifs of membrane-associated cargo proteins. Here we show that missense mutations of AP2 σ subunit (AP2S1) affecting Arg15, which forms key contacts with dileucine-based motifs of CCV cargo proteins, result in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 (FHH3), an extracellular calcium homeostasis disorder affecting the parathyroids, kidneys and bone. We found AP2S1 mutations in >20% of cases of FHH without mutations in calcium-sensing GPCR (CASR), which cause FHH1. AP2S1 mutations decreased the sensitivity of CaSR-expressing cells to extracellular calcium and reduced CaSR endocytosis, probably through loss of interaction with a C-terminal CaSR dileucine-based motif, whose disruption also decreased intracellular signaling. Thus, our results identify a new role for AP2 in extracellular calcium homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2086553719,"Whether the molecular drivers of tumor initiation are the same factors that promote metastasis during tumor progression is addressed in this report. In renal carcinoma, common primary driving alterations such as VHL loss do not necessarily correlate with outcome, and the authors show that additional epigenetic adaptations are required to unleash prometastatic behavior. Two important metastastic drivers, CXCR4 and CYTIP, are activated downstream of VHL loss through epigenetic reprogramming involving differential chromatin modification or DNA methylation, exemplifying the complex evolution of tumorigenic traits downstream of driving alterations. Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene, VHL, is an archetypical tumor-initiating event in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) that leads to the activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). However, VHL mutation status in ccRCC is not correlated with clinical outcome. Here we show that during ccRCC progression, cancer cells exploit diverse epigenetic alterations to empower a branch of the VHL-HIF pathway for metastasis, and the strength of this activation is associated with poor clinical outcome. By analyzing metastatic subpopulations of VHL-deficient ccRCC cells, we discovered an epigenetically altered VHL-HIF response that is specific to metastatic ccRCC. Focusing on the two most prominent pro-metastatic VHL-HIF target genes, we show that loss of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) activates HIF-driven chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression in support of chemotactic cell invasion, whereas loss of DNA methylation enables HIF-driven cytohesin 1 interacting protein (CYTIP) expression to protect cancer cells from death cytokine signals. Thus, metastasis in ccRCC is based on an epigenetically expanded output of the tumor-initiating pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2056911532,"An allosteric activator of Hsp70 mimics Hip and reduces neurotoxicity in a model for spinobulbar muscular atrophy by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of oligomeric polyglutamine-containing clients. We sought new strategies to reduce amounts of the polyglutamine androgen receptor (polyQ AR) and achieve benefits in models of spinobulbar muscular atrophy, a protein aggregation neurodegenerative disorder. Proteostasis of the polyQ AR is controlled by the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)- and Hsp70-based chaperone machinery, but mechanisms regulating the protein's turnover are incompletely understood. We demonstrate that overexpression of Hsp70 interacting protein (Hip), a co-chaperone that enhances binding of Hsp70 to its substrates, promotes client protein ubiquitination and polyQ AR clearance. Furthermore, we identify a small molecule that acts similarly to Hip by allosterically promoting Hsp70 binding to unfolded substrates. Like Hip, this synthetic co-chaperone enhances client protein ubiquitination and polyQ AR degradation. Both genetic and pharmacologic approaches targeting Hsp70 alleviate toxicity in a Drosophila model of spinobulbar muscular atrophy. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of allosteric regulators of Hsp70 and provide new insights into the role of the chaperone machinery in protein quality control."

https://openalex.org/W2090312623,"Classically, exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is rate-limiting for secretory protein trafficking because protein folding/assembly occurs there. In this study, we have exploited ""hPro-CpepSfGFP,"" a human proinsulin bearing ""superfolder"" green fluorescent C-peptide expressed in pancreatic β cells where it is processed to human insulin and CpepSfGFP. Remarkably, steady-state accumulation of hPro-CpepSfGFP and endogenous proinsulin is in the Golgi region, as if final stages of protein folding/assembly were occurring there. The Golgi regional distribution of proinsulin is dynamic, influenced by fasting/refeeding, and increased with β cell zinc deficiency. However, coexpression of ER-entrapped mutant proinsulin-C(A7)Y shifts the steady-state distribution of wild-type proinsulin to the ER. Endogenous proinsulin coprecipitates with hPro-CpepSfGFP and even more so with hProC(A7)Y-CpepSfGFP. Using Cerulean and Venus-tagged proinsulins, we find that both WT-WT and WT-mutant proinsulin pairs exhibit FRET. The data demonstrate that wild-type proinsulin dimerizes within the ER but accumulates at a poorly recognized slow step within the Golgi region, reflecting either slow kinetics of proinsulin hexamerization, steps in formation of nascent secretory granules, or other unknown molecular events. However, in the presence of ongoing misfolding of a subpopulation of proinsulin in β cells, the rate-limiting step in transport of the remaining proinsulin shifts to the ER."

https://openalex.org/W2011087576,"HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs. Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to the HuR binding sites, suggesting competitive regulation of gene expression. One such mRNA encodes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a major regulator of angiogenesis. Immunoprecipitation of RNA-protein complexes and luciferase reporter assays indicate that HuR antagonizes the suppressive activity of miR-200b, down-regulates miR-200b expression, and promotes VEGF-A expression. Indeed, Vegf-a and other angiogenic regulatory transcripts were down-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs. Interestingly, tumor growth, angiogenesis, vascular sprouting, branching, and permeability were significantly attenuated in Elavl1Mø KO mice, suggesting that HuR-regulated myeloid-derived factors modulate tumor angiogenesis in trans. Zebrafish embryos injected with an elavl1 morpholino oligomer or miR-200b mimic showed angiogenesis defects in the subintestinal vein plexus, and elavl1 mRNA rescued the repressive effect of miR-200b. In addition, miR-200b and HuR morpholino oligomer suppressed the activity of a zVEGF 3'-UTR luciferase reporter construct. Together, these studies reveal an evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional mechanism involving competitive interactions between HuR and miR-200b that controls angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2033507589,"Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) represent a promising approach for targeted knock-out of genes in cultured human cells. We used TALEN-technology to knock out the nuclear gene encoding NDUFA9, a subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I in HEK293T cells. Screening for the knock-out revealed a mixture of NDUFA9 cell clones that harbored partial deletions of the mitochondrial N-terminal targeting signal but were still capable of import. A cell line lacking functional copies of both NDUFA9 alleles resulted in a loss of NDUFA9 protein expression, impaired assembly of complex I, and cells incapable of growth in galactose medium. Cells lacking NDUFA9 contained a complex I subcomplex consisting of membrane arm subunits but not marker subunits of the matrix arm. Re-expression of NDUFA9 restored the defects in complex I assembly. We conclude that NDUFA9 is involved in stabilizing the junction between membrane and matrix arms of complex I, a late assembly step critical for complex I biogenesis and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2046149736,"The Cdc2 (also called Cdk1) kinase is first activated at the centrosome to initiate mitosis in human cells. Hagan and colleagues demonstrate that in fission yeast, Cdc2 and Polo kinase activation at the spindle pole body remotely controls not only mitotic commitment but also ‘new end take off’, the initiation of bipolar growth in G2. Activation of mitosis-promoting factor (MPF) drives mitotic commitment1. In human cells active MPF appears first on centrosomes2. We show that local activation of MPF on the equivalent organelle of fission yeast, the spindle pole body (SPB), promotes Polo kinase activity at the SPBs long before global MPF activation drives mitotic commitment. Artificially promoting MPF or Polo activity at various locations revealed that this local control of Plo1 activity on G2 phase SPBs dictates the timing of mitotic commitment. Cytokinesis of the rod-shaped fission yeast cell generates a naive, new, cell end. Growth is restricted to the experienced old end until a point in G2 phase called new end take off (NETO) when bipolar growth is triggered3. NETO coincided with MPF activation of Plo1 on G2 phase SPBs (ref. 4). Both MPF and Polo activities were required for NETO and both induced NETO when ectopically activated at interphase SPBs. NETO promotion by MPF required polo. Thus, local MPF activation on G2 SPBs directs polo kinase to control at least two distinct and temporally separated, cell-cycle transitions at remote locations."

https://openalex.org/W1999931275,"GABAergic neurogliaform cells are thought to use volume transmission and provide widespread cortical inhibition, indiscriminately. To their surprise, Chittajallu et al. found that that neurogliaform cells exert a spatially restricted inhibitory influence on the mouse canonical thalamocortical circuit, as they selectively suppress feed-forward inhibition while sparing feed-forward excitation. Despite the prevailing idea that neurogliaform cells produce a spatially unrestricted widespread inhibition, we demonstrate here that their activity attenuates thalamic-evoked feed-forward inhibition in layer IV barrel cortex but has no effect on feed-forward excitation. The result of this circuit selectivity is a dynamic regulation in the temporal window for integration of excitatory thalamic input, thus revealing a new role for neurogliaform cells in shaping sensory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2099646263,"Transcription fidelity is critical for maintaining the accurate flow of genetic information. The study of transcription fidelity has been limited because the intrinsic error rate of transcription is obscured by the higher error rate of translation, making identification of phenotypes associated with transcription infidelity challenging. Slippage of elongating RNA polymerase (RNAP) on homopolymeric A/T tracts in DNA represents a special type of transcription error leading to disruption of open reading frames in Escherichia coli mRNA. However, the regions in RNAP involved in elongation slippage and its molecular mechanism are unknown. We constructed an A/T tract that is out of frame relative to a downstream lacZ gene on the chromosome to examine transcriptional slippage during elongation. Further, we developed a genetic system that enabled us for the first time to isolate and characterize E. coli RNAP mutants with altered transcriptional slippage in vivo. We identified several amino acid residues in the β subunit of RNAP that affect slippage in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, these highly clustered residues are located near the RNA strand of the RNA-DNA hybrid in the elongation complex. Our E. coli study complements an accompanying study of slippage by yeast RNAP II and provides the basis for future studies on the mechanism of transcription fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W1980037943,"The JNK family of MAPKs is involved in a large variety of physiological and pathological processes in brain development, such as neural survival, migration, and polarity as well as axon regeneration. However, whether JNK activation is involved in axon guidance remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence indicating the JNK pathway is required for Netrin signaling in the developing nervous system. Netrin-1 increased JNK1, not JNK2 or JNK3, activity in the presence of deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) or Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), and expression of both of them further enhanced Netrin-1-induced JNK1 activity in vitro. Inhibition of JNK signaling either by a JNK inhibitor, SP600125, or expression of a dominant negative form of MKK4, a JNK upstream activator, blocked Netrin-1-induced JNK1 activation in HEK293 cells. Netrin-1 increased endogenous JNK activity in primary neurons. Netrin-1-induced JNK activation was inhibited either by the JNK inhibitor or an anti-DCC function-blocking antibody. Combination of the anti-DCC function-blocking antibody with expression of DSCAM shRNA in primary neurons totally abolished Netrin-1-induced JNK activation, whereas knockdown of DSCAM partially inhibited the Netrin-1 effect. In the developing spinal cord, phospho-JNK was strongly expressed in commissural axons before and as they crossed the floor plate, and Netrin-1 stimulation dramatically increased the level of endogenous phospho-JNK in commissural axon growth cones. Inhibition of JNK signaling either by JNK1 RNA interference (RNAi) or the JNK inhibitor suppressed Netrin-1-induced neurite outgrowth and axon attraction. Knockdown of JNK1 in ovo caused defects in spinal cord commissural axon projection and pathfinding. Our study reveals that JNK1 is important in the coordination of DCC and DSCAM in Netrin-mediated attractive signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2046728083,"Midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons are thought to guide learning via phasic elevations of firing in response to reward predicting stimuli. The mechanism for these signals remains unclear. Using extracellular recording during associative learning, we found that inhibitory neurons in the ventral midbrain of mice responded to salient auditory stimuli with a burst of activity that occurred before the onset of the phasic response of DA neurons. This population of inhibitory neurons exhibited enhanced responses during extinction and was anticorrelated with the phasic response of simultaneously recorded DA neurons. Optogenetic stimulation revealed that this population was, in part, derived from inhibitory projection neurons of the substantia nigra that provide a robust monosynaptic inhibition of DA neurons. Thus, our results elaborate on the dynamic upstream circuits that shape the phasic activity of DA neurons and suggest that the inhibitory microcircuit of the midbrain is critical for new learning in extinction."
https://openalex.org/W1983882927,"Tetraspanins have emerged as key players in malignancy and inflammatory diseases, yet little is known about their roles in angiogenesis, and nothing is known about their involvement in lymphangiogenesis. We found here that tetraspanins are abundantly expressed in human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). After intrathoracic tumor implantation, metastasis to lymph nodes was diminished and accompanied by decreased angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in tetraspanin CD9-KO mice. Moreover, lymphangiomas induced in CD9-KO mice were less pronounced with decreased lymphangiogenesis compared with those in wild-type mice. Although mouse LEC isolated from CD9-KO mice showed normal adhesion, lymphangiogenesis was markedly impaired in several assays (migration, proliferation, and cable formation) in vitro and in the lymphatic ring assay ex vivo. Consistent with these findings in mouse LEC, knocking down CD9 in human LEC also produced decreased migration, proliferation, and cable formation. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that deletion of CD9 in LEC diminished formation of functional complexes between VEGF receptor-3 and integrins (α5 and α9). Therefore, knocking down CD9 in LEC attenuated VEGF receptor-3 signaling, as well as downstream signaling such as Erk and p38 upon VEGF-C stimulation. Finally, double deletion of CD9/CD81 in mice caused abnormal development of lymphatic vasculature in the trachea and diaphragm, suggesting that CD9 and a closely related tetraspanin CD81 coordinately play an essential role in physiological lymphangiogenesis. In conclusion, tetraspanin CD9 modulates molecular organization of integrins in LEC, thereby supporting several functions required for lymphangiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2077646280,"Prolactin-stimulated adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and olfactory bulb (OB) mediates several reproductive behaviors including mating/pregnancy, dominant male pheromone preference in females, and paternal recognition of offspring. However, downstream signaling mechanisms underlying prolactin-induced adult neurogenesis are completely unknown. We report here for the first time that prolactin activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5), a MAP kinase that is specifically expressed in the neurogenic regions of the adult mouse brain. Knockdown of ERK5 by retroviral infection of shRNA attenuates prolactin-stimulated neurogenesis in SVZ-derived adult neural stem/progenitor cells (aNPCs). Inducible erk5 deletion in adult neural stem cells of transgenic mice inhibits neurogenesis in the SVZ and OB following prolactin infusion or mating/pregnancy. These results identify ERK5 as a novel and critical signaling mechanism underlying prolactin-induced adult neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2159631682,"Dystroglycan (DG) is a cell surface receptor for extracellular matrix proteins and is involved in cell polarity, matrix organization, and mechanical stability of tissues. Previous studies documented loss of DG protein expression and glycosylation in a variety of cancer types, but the underlying mechanisms and the functional consequences with respect to cancer progression remain unclear. Here, we show that the level of expression of the βDG subunit as well as the glycosylation status of the αDG subunit inversely correlate with the Gleason scores of prostate cancers; furthermore, we show that the functional glycosylation of αDG is substantially reduced in prostate cancer metastases. Additionally, we demonstrate that LARGE2 (GYLTL1B), a gene not previously implicated in cancer, regulates functional αDG glycosylation in prostate cancer cell lines; knockdown of LARGE2 resulted in hypoglycosylation of αDG and loss of its ability to bind laminin-111 while overexpression restored ligand binding and diminished growth and migration of an aggressive prostate cancer cell line. Finally, our analysis of LARGE2 expression in human cancer specimens reveals that LARGE2 is significantly down-regulated in the context of prostate cancer, and that its reduction correlates with disease progression. Our results describe a novel molecular mechanism to account for the commonly observed hypoglycosylation of αDG in prostate cancer.Background: Dystroglycan function is decreased in prostate and other cancers.Results: Decreased functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan is clinically correlated with reduced LARGE2 and restoring its expression rescues dystroglycan function, reducing the invasive and proliferative potential of prostate cancer cells.Conclusion: LARGE2 regulates α-dystroglycan function in the prostatic epithelium.Significance: Loss of LARGE2 expression may contribute to prostate cancer progression.

Notably, the overexpression of LARGE has been shown to functionally rescue αDG hypoglycosylation in cells from patients harboring mutations in other αDG glycosyltransferases (24Barresi R.

LARGE can functionally bypass α-dystroglycan glycosylation defects in distinct congenital muscular dystrophies.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition, a mutation in LARGE is responsible for the myodystrophy mouse (Largemyd, MDC1D) phenotype, features of which include αDG hypoglycosylation (25Grewal P.K. Hewitt J.E.

Although LARGE is expressed in many tissues the myodystrophy mouse phenotype is primarily evident in muscle and brain. A paralog of LARGE, LARGE2, has a narrower expression profile and is not expressed in muscle and brain. LARGE2 overexpression results in αDG hyperglycosylation and enhanced laminin binding, suggesting that LARGE and LARGE2 may be functionally redundant (26Grewal P.K. McLaughlan J.M. Moore C.J.

DG is expressed in many epithelial tissues where it is thought to mediate cell-matrix interactions important for cell polarity and tissue morphogenesis, but recent studies have shown that DG is not required for the normal development and/or maintenance of some epithelial tissues, including prostate; and, in Drosophila, DG is required for the maintenance of epithelial cell polarity only during energetic stress (28Durbeej M.

Herein we describe a novel mechanism accounting for the loss of functional αDG glycosylation in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer specimens, reduced expression of LARGE2, a protein not previously implicated in cancer. Furthermore, we show that endogenous LARGE2, and not LARGE, is responsible for mediating the functional glycosylation of αDG in prostate cancer cells and normal prostatic epithelium. Prostate tissue embedded in paraffin was sectioned at 7 μm, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. For the metastatic tissue microarray, samples were first baked at 70 °C for 64 h prior to antigen retrieval. Antigen retrieval for all samples was performed by a 20-min exposure to either citrate buffer (βDG) or proteinase K (αDG). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Sections were blocked in 10% horse serum and then incubated overnight with primary antibody, either IIH6 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 8D5 (1:100, Novocastra). Samples were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temp with a biotinylated secondary antibody, which was then detected using the ABC reagent (Vector) and DAB plus (Dako) followed by counterstain with hematoxylin. Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining was performed using standard procedures. Immunohistochemistry was performed by the UI Department of Pathology Core Lab. For evaluation of immunohistochemistry, pathologists (MMM and MBC) were blinded to sample identity. For metastases analysis, samples were scored as either positive or negative for membranous staining with the antibody. 22Rv1 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC), PC-3 (ATCC), LNCaP (M Cohen), PC-3E+, and TEM4–18 (PC-3 derivatives, Henry Lab) and GP2–293 packaging cells (BD Biosciences) were grown with 10% FBS (HyClone, Logan, Utah) and 1% non-essential amino acids. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2 and subcultured as needed. To knockdown LARGE2, pLKO1 lentiviral vectors targeting human LARGE2 were purchased from Open Biosystems (TRC collection, RHS4533-NM_152312). Five different constructs were transfected into GP2–293 cells along with the lentiviral second generation plasmid VSV-G (kind gift from the Trono Lab) and culture supernatant from these cells was used to infect PC-3E+, DU145, and 22Rv1 cells for 8 h followed by puromycin selection (1.0 μg/ml). We were able to achieve 70–80% knockdown of LARGE2 using hairpin construct sequence TRCN0000035147 and TRCN0000035148. Murine LARGE2 was excised from a mLARGE2 containing pLEX vector using NotI and cloned into the pQCXIP NotI site. Cells were selected and maintained with standard media containing 1.0 μg/ml puromycin. qPCR analysis was performed as described previously (43Svensson R.U. Barnes J.M. Rokhlin O.W. Cohen M.B.

For the analysis of bulk tumor samples, the TissueScan cDNA array (HRT103, Origene) was used. Relative expression values were calculated using the comparative Ct method (44Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25420) Google Scholar). Protein lysates were prepared from sub-confluent cultures following scrape harvesting in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm deoxycholate-Na, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0; rocked at 4 °C for 1 h, boiled 5 min) with protease inhibitors. Protein samples (50 μg, Lowry protein analysis) were electrophoresed (4–20% Tris-HCl gels) and transferred (PVDF) prior to antibody incubation. Antibodies were used as follows: 1°-IIH6, glycosylation sensitive αDG, 1:500 overnight at 4 °C in low salt buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl2,0.1% Tween 20), 2°-donkeyαmouse IgM HRP, 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature; 1°-sheep 5 core αDG, 1:100 overnight at 4 °C, 2°-donkeyαmouse IgG HRP, 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature; 1°-βDG specific 8D5 (Novocastra/Leica) for 1:200 overnight at 4 °C, 2-donkey α-mouse IgG, 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature; 1°-β-actin (Sigma), 1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature, 2°-goatαrabbit IgG HRP, 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature, was utilized as a marker for protein loading. All secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch. Cells grown to 60–80% confluency were detached (Versene, Invitrogen) and washed prior to antibody incubation. The cells were then resuspended at 5 × 105 cells in 50 μl FACS buffer (PBS + 0.02% sodium azide + 5% BSA) + IIH6 antibody (1:100) for 45 min on ice. Next, cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibody (100 μl FACS buffer plus 1:100, donkey anti-mouse IgM Dylight 488, Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed again and resuspended in 400 μl of FACs buffer, and transferred to polystyrene FACs tubes (BD Biosciences). Samples were analyzed using the Becton Dickinson LSR II flow cytometer at The University of Iowa Flow Cytometry Core Facility. The methods were used as described above but cells were incubated with 50 μl of 100 nm laminin-111 (BD Biosciences) prior to incubation with anti-laminin-111 primary antibody (1:100, Sigma) and the subsequent detection with the DyLight488 secondary antibody. To inhibit laminin-111 binding, a subset of samples was first incubated with αDG IIH6 antibody at 1:100 in 100 μl of FACS+ buffer. All steps were done on ice. Tissues were processed and antigen retrieval performed as described above. IIH6 was incubated overnight at 1:100. Tissues were washed in blocking buffer and incubated with donkey anti-mouse IgG Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1:200 and counterstained with DAPI (1:5000, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. 24 well, 8.0 μm transwell permeable inserts (Corning Life Sciences) were prepared as previously described (45Drake J.M.

Briefly, transwells were coated with laminin-511 for 1 h at room temperature prior to washing with PBS. Luciferase-expressing cells were plated at 8.0 × 104 cells/well in serum-free DMEM/F12 and allowed to migrate down a chemoattractant gradient (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS in lower chamber) for 18 h prior to trypsinization followed by quantification via bioluminescence. Data are presented as migration relative to vector control cells across an uncoated membrane. 24 well, 8.0 μm BD Biocoat matrigel inserts (BD Biosciences) were thawed and equilibrated according to the manufacturer. Cells were plated in the top chamber at 8.0 × 104 cells/well in serum-free DMEM/F12. The lower chamber was filled with DMEM/F12 containing 10% serum to induce a chemoattractive response. Following 18 h of incubation, cells were trypsinized and quantified as described above. Data are presented as invasion relative to vector control cells. 30,000 GS689.Li cells containing either empty vector or mLARGE2were plated in triplicate into 6-well dishes. On the indicated day, cells were trypsinized and counted using a Z2 series Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter) with a cell diameter range of 8–24 μm. Three counts were averaged per well.

https://openalex.org/W2024419789,"The GATA family transcription activator, Gln3 responds to the nitrogen requirements and environmental resources of the cell. When rapidly utilized, ""good"" nitrogen sources, e.g., glutamine, are plentiful, Gln3 is completely sequestered in the cytoplasm, and the transcription it mediates is minimal. In contrast, during nitrogen-limiting conditions, Gln3 quickly relocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of genes required to scavenge alternative, ""poor"" nitrogen sources, e.g., proline. This physiological response has been designated nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR). Because rapamycin treatment also elicits nuclear Gln3 localization, TorC1 has been thought to be responsible for NCR-sensitive Gln3 regulation. However, accumulating evidence now suggests that GATA factor regulation may occur by two separate pathways, one TorC1-dependent and the other NCR-sensitive. Therefore, the present experiments were initiated to identify Gln3 amino acid substitutions capable of dissecting the individual contributions of these pathways to overall Gln3 regulation. The rationale was that different regulatory pathways might be expected to operate through distinct Gln3 sensor residues. We found that C-terminal truncations or amino acid substitutions in a 17-amino acid Gln3 peptide with a predicted propensity to fold into an α-helix partially abolished the ability of the cell to sequester Gln3 in the cytoplasm of glutamine-grown cells and eliminated the rapamycin response of Gln3 localization, but did not adversely affect its response to limiting nitrogen. However, overall wild type control of intracellular Gln3 localization requires the contributions of both individual regulatory systems. We also found that Gln3 possesses at least one Tor1-interacting site in addition to the one previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2090534787,"Functional coupling between inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) represents a critical component of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in many excitable cells; however, the role of this mechanism in skeletal muscle remains elusive. In skeletal muscle, RyR-mediated Ca(2+) sparks are suppressed in resting conditions, whereas application of transient osmotic stress can trigger activation of Ca(2+) sparks that are restricted to the periphery of the fiber. Here we show that onset of these spatially confined Ca(2+) sparks involves interaction between activation of IP(3)R and RyR near the sarcolemmal membrane. Pharmacological prevention of IP(3) production or inhibition of IP(3)R channel activity abolishes stress-induced Ca(2+) sparks in skeletal muscle. Although genetic ablation of the type 2 IP(3)R does not appear to affect Ca(2+) sparks in skeletal muscle, specific silencing of the type 1 IP(3)R leads to ablation of stress-induced Ca(2+) sparks. Our data indicate that membrane-delimited signaling involving cross-talk between IP(3)R1 and RyR1 contributes to Ca(2+) spark activation in skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2034607402,"In yeast, Adh1 (alcohol dehydrogenase 1) is an abundant zinc-binding protein that is required for the conversion of acetaldehyde to ethanol. Through transcriptome profiling of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome, we identified a natural antisense transcript at the adh1 locus that is induced in response to zinc limitation. This antisense transcript (adh1AS) shows a reciprocal expression pattern to that of the adh1 mRNA partner. In this study, we show that increased expression of the adh1AS transcript in zinc-limited cells is necessary for the repression of adh1 gene expression and that the increased level of the adh1AS transcript in zinc-limited cells is a result of two mechanisms. At the transcriptional level, the adh1AS transcript is expressed at a high level in zinc-limited cells. In addition to this transcriptional control, adh1AS transcripts preferentially accumulate in zinc-limited cells when the adh1AS transcript is expressed from a constitutive promoter. This secondary mechanism requires the simultaneous expression of adh1. Our studies reveal how multiple mechanisms can synergistically control the ratio of sense to antisense transcripts and highlight a novel mechanism by which adh1 gene expression can be controlled by cellular zinc availability."
https://openalex.org/W2060970612,"NMDA receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system and play a major role in excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to visualize activation-induced structural changes in the GluN1/GluN2A NMDA receptor reconstituted into a lipid bilayer. In the absence of agonist, AFM imaging revealed two populations of particles with heights above the bilayer surface of 8.6 and 3.4 nm. The taller, but not the shorter, particles could be specifically decorated by an anti-GluN1 antibody, which recognizes the S2 segment of the agonist-binding domain, indicating that the two populations represent the extracellular and intracellular regions of the receptor, respectively. In the presence of glycine and glutamate, there was a reduction in the height of the extracellular region to 7.3 nm. In contrast, the height of the intracellular domain was unaffected. Fast-scan AFM imaging combined with UV photolysis of caged glutamate permitted the detection of a rapid reduction in the height of individual NMDA receptors. The reduction in height did not occur in the absence of the co-agonist glycine or in the presence of the selective NMDA receptor antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, indicating that the observed structural change was caused by receptor activation. These results represent the first demonstration of an activation-induced effect on the structure of the NMDA receptor at the single-molecule level. A change in receptor size following activation could have important functional implications, in particular by affecting interactions between the NMDA receptor and its extracellular synaptic partners."

To minimize lateral drift during acquisition, a nosepiece stage (Olympus) was employed. Lateral drift using this stage was ∼±6 nm over a typical 30-min acquisition. This meant no correction for drift was required after acquisition. This is comparable with the localization accuracy, due to the signal-to-noise ratio of detected single molecules, of 3–10 nm for photoactivatable localization microscopy (PALM) or ground state depletion followed by individual molecule return microscopy (GSDIM) datasets.

GSDIM microscopy was performed based on previously described methods (22Fölling J. Bossi M. Bock H. Medda R. Wurm C.A. Hein B. Jakobs S. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Fluorescence nanoscopy by ground-state depletion and single-molecule return.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) buffered paraformaldehyde for 90 min at room temperature. The extended fixation period is to immobilize as much as possible the molecules under study to minimize potential movement or antibody patching artifacts (23Sieber J.J. Willig K.I. Kutzner C. Gerding-Reimers C. Harke B. Donnert G. Rammner B. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Grubmüller H. Lang T. Anatomy and dynamics of a supramolecular membrane protein cluster.Science. 2007; 317: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Permeabilization was with 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 min. Immunodetection and staining of Munc18-1 used 1:1000 dilution of anti-Munc18-1 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences 610336) for 3 h followed by anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:1000–1:2000 dilution). All antibodies and washes were in the presence of 0.1% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween 20 to block nonspecific binding. Controls where no primary antibody was added resulted in no detectable signal using the imaging parameters (laser power, EM gain) employed (see below). Cells were not mounted for imaging but instead were imaged in photobleached and filtered (0.22 micron) PBS. To ensure efficient switching of Alexa Fluor 647, cells were imaged in 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 40 μg/ml catalase, 10% w/v glucose, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethylamine. In a typical experiment, cells were initially excited by 491-nm laser light under TIRF illumination to acquire anti-synaptotagmin 1 (polyclonal; SySy, 1:2000 dilution of primary antibody)-labeled, Alexa Fluor 488-detected vesicle fluorescence. The cell was then continuously illuminated with 640-nm laser light (∼10–12 milliwatts at the sample) under TIRF illumination for 15–30 min. Emitted fluorescence was detected using an EMCCD camera with an EM gain of 100–500 and a frame rate of 20 Hz. The resulting image sequences were subsequently analyzed using single-molecule identification and localization algorithms described below. The repeated cycling of fluorophores between the excited and dark states results in repetitive localization of the same fluorophore multiple times. The precise distances between the Alexa Fluor 647 fluorophore molecule and the epitope are difficult to estimate, and there are multiple fluorophores on each secondary antibody; however, these distances are likely to be <15 nm, based on the average diameter of an immunoglobulin of 7 nm. PALM microscopy was performed based on previously described methods (24Betzig E. Patterson G.H. Sougrat R. Lindwasser O.W. Olenych S. Bonifacino J.S. Davidson M.W. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Hess H.F.

Cells, expressing photoactivatable mCherry-labeled SNAREs, were fixed and immunostained as required, as detailed above. Cells were imaged in PBS at 21 °C. In a typical experiment, cells were initially excited by 491-nm laser light under TIRF illumination to acquire Alexa Fluor 488- or GFP-labeled vesicle fluorescence. Photoactivatable mCherry was then activated with a brief pulse (1–250 ms) of 405-nm laser light under TIRF illumination followed by acquisition of 20–40 frames using a 561-nm laser under TIRF illumination and an EMCCD camera with an EM gain of 400–600 at 5 Hz. This cycle of activation and acquisition was repeated between 150 and 300 times with the activation pulse duration increasing gradually during the experiment. Cells, expressing photoactivatable mCherry-labeled SNAREs, were imaged in phenol red-free culture medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2, 95% air. Photoactivatable mCherry was activated with a brief pulse (1–40 ms) of 405-nm laser light under TIRF illumination followed by acquisition of 100 frames using a 561-nm laser under TIRF illumination and an EMCCD camera with an EM gain of 600–800 at 20 Hz. This cycle of activation and acquisition was repeated between 150 and 300 times with the activation pulse duration increasing gradually during the experiment. For vesicle tracking and stimulation experiments, PC12 cells, expressing Neuropeptide Y-EGFP, were maintained on the microscope at 37 °C and 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were imaged in Krebs buffer (115 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm potassium chloride, 24 mm sodium bicarbonate, 2.5 mm calcium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% (w/v) BSA) adjusted to 290 mosm. For stimulation, ATP was added during the recording to a final concentration of 300 mm. Secretory vesicle movement and fusion were acquired using a 491-nm laser under TIRF illumination and an EMCCD camera with an EM gain of 200–400 at 20 Hz. For static PALM and GSDIM datasets, single molecules were detected using a Matlab routine kindly provided by Samuel Hess (Orono, ME) (25Hess S.T. Girirajan T.P.K. Mason M.D. Ultra-high resolution imaging by fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy.Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 4258-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2659) Google Scholar). For PALM datasets, individual frames between activation pulses were summed together using ImageJ before localization. Localized datasets were then used for further analysis in Matlab or rendered at high resolution. Rendering of localized molecules was performed using the same Matlab algorithms and false-colored in ImageJ. Following single-molecule localization, the spatial distribution of individual molecules was analyzed from the coordinate information. Ripley's analyses were performed using custom-written Matlab algorithms (21Smyth A.M. Rickman C. Duncan R.R. Vesicle fusion probability is determined by the specific interactions of munc18.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 38141-38148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as we reported previously. To compare the observed spatial distribution with the random state, the same number of molecules in the same spatial area was redistributed randomly 1000 times. For each simulation, the Ripley's K function and L transformation were derived. This is presented as light gray envelopes for the randomized simulations with the test case in black. Deviation of the test case above the envelopes at short radii indicates a nonrandom morphology with areas of high and low density. Deviation of the test case below the envelopes would indicate some form of minimum distance between adjacent molecules. To analyze the spatial distribution of secretory vesicles relative to the SNARE molecules, nearest neighbor analysis was performed. Using the PALM coordinates of SNARE proteins and the centroid coordinates of secretory vesicles, SNARE molecules were assigned to their nearest vesicle using the nearestneighbour routine in Matlab. A sampling radii was determined based on the range over which the t-SNAREs and v-SNARE would be able to interact using available structural information. Following allocation of molecules to their nearest secretory vesicle, the number of molecules within 82.5 nm of the centroid of each vesicle was determined. An automated particle detection and tracking system has been developed and applied. The system combines particle detection in each single image frame and frame-to-frame particle correspondence implemented in Matlab. Particle detection in each single frame comprises three components: 1) particle probability image mapping, 2) refinement of particle probability image, and 3) particle segmentation. The first component is implemented by three steps. (a) The Haar-like feature for each pixel is measured in the original grayscale image. (b) A weak threshold is applied to the Haar-like feature to coarsely classify each pixel into one of two classes: particle or background. (c) A particle probability concept is defined as the ratio of the number of spatially connected particle pixels to the total number of pixels in a small region of a particle size. Particle features are significantly enhanced in the particle probability image. The second component is implemented by applying a rotationally symmetric Gaussian low pass filter to the newly obtained particle probability image to get more accurate particle probability at each pixel. The third component is implemented by firstly estimating existing regions of particles and their corresponding markers of particles from the refined particle probability image and then using the marker-controlled watershed transform to accurately segment the particle regions from the original grayscale image. Our particle detection algorithm allows for the detection of particle positions at a subpixel level and accurate estimation of particle topologies such as size and intensity. The robust frame-to-frame particle correspondence is finally implemented by incorporating these particle topologies into the system state vector of an interacting multiple model filter to better deal with particle motion modeling and robust data association. Here, three motion models, random walk, first order, and second order linear extrapolations are used for motion modeling, and a dynamic programming algorithm is used to optimize the particle correspondence by minimizing the association cost function. Photobleaching was carried out in TIRF mode at 37 °C using an Olympus Cell∧FRAP laser scanning head in conjunction with an Olympus Cell Excellence total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) system. A circular bleach area of radius 1.06 μm was selected and bleached between frames 5 and 6 of 200, with a frame acquired every 31 ms. Bleaching was performed in the readout time of the camera, meaning that no interruption to imaging was required. ImageJ was used to extract intensity data from the resulting image files. These data consisted of the mean intensity with three circular regions of the image (r = 1.06 μm): one (Ifrap) centered on the bleached region, one outside of the cell or sheet (Iback), and one (Iref) in a region of the membrane remote from the bleach point. Inorm for each frame was calculated by correcting the Ifrap value using the Iref data, to account for the general photobleaching that occurs during acquisition, as well as normalizing to the prebleach values, according to Equation 1 below Inorm (t)=lref_pre lref (t)−lback (t)×lfrap (t)−Iback (t)Ifrap_pre (Eq. 1) where Inorm(t) is the normalized intensity; Ifrap(t) is the measured average intensity inside the bleached spot; Iref(t) is the measured average reference intensity; and Iback(t) is the measured average background intensity outside the cell. _pre is the averaging of intensity in the corresponding Region of Interest before the bleach moment and after subtraction of background intensity. Following the normalization of the data, the half-time of recovery for each curve was determined by using SigmaPlot (Scientific Computing Inc.) to fit the data with an equation of the form Inorm (t)=a+b×tt1/2+t(Eq. 2) where a is the bleach point of the curve (i.e. relative intensity immediately after bleaching) and a+b is the maximum recovered relative fluorescence. Thus, b represents the mobile fraction of the molecules. This equation assumes that all the labeled molecules move according to the same profile, which may not be the case when proteins can interact with components of their surroundings (cytosolic proteins interacting with membrane-bound proteins, for example). The presence of two pools of protein with different mobilities was considered by fitting with a bimodal form of Equation 2. Inorm (t)=a+c×b1×tt1/2(1)+t+c×b2×tt1/2(2)+t(Eq. 3) In this case, a is still the bleach point of the curve, but c represents the total mobile fraction with b1 and b2 representing the percentage of the mobile fraction with t½(1) and t½(2) respectively. A curve was considered to be bimodal (i.e. the product of two pools moving at different rates) if Equation 3 provided a better fit to the data than Equation 2 (judged from the residuals of the fit and a reduced χ-squared test). The difference in R2 value for each curve was calculated, and if the “unimodal” R2 value exceeded the bimodal R2 value for a curve, then it was assumed to consist of one pool, whereas if the bimodal R2 value was greater than the unimodal R2 value, the curve was deemed to consist of two independently moving pools. The characteristic diffusion time t½ of a population is related to the diffusion coefficient D (μm2/s) by the following D=ω24×t1/2(Eq. 4) where ω is the radius of the bleach spot. To probe the molecular organization of endogenous and heterologous Munc18-1 on a nanometer scale, we employed both GSDIM (22Fölling J. Bossi M. Bock H. Medda R. Wurm C.A. Hein B. Jakobs S. Eggeling C. Hell S.W. Fluorescence nanoscopy by ground-state depletion and single-molecule return.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and PALM (25Hess S.T. Girirajan T.P.K. Mason M.D. Ultra-high resolution imaging by fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy.Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 4258-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2659) Google Scholar). GSDIM involved immunodetecting decorated endogenous Munc18-1 with a fluorophore-conjugated antibody (Alexa Fluor 647) and driving this into a dark state using laser illumination in the presence of a reducing buffer. Single Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated antibodies, bound to immunodetected Munc18-1 molecules, spontaneously re-emerge from this dark state, permitting the localization of individual epitopes separated in a time stack (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, wild-type PC12 cells were chemically fixed for 90 min to ensure complete immobilization (23Sieber J.J. Willig K.I. Kutzner C. Gerding-Reimers C. Harke B. Donnert G. Rammner B. Eggeling C.

Anatomy and dynamics of a supramolecular membrane protein cluster.Science. 2007; 317: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and subsequently processed for GSDIM. This revealed that endogenous Munc18-1 molecules displayed a heterogeneous distribution across the plasma membrane with molecules arranged into ensembles interspersed with largely single molecules, in agreement with recent findings describing the distribution of syntaxin molecules (26Rickman C. Medine C.N. Dun A.R. Moulton D.J. Mandula O. Halemani N.D. Rizzoli S.O. Chamberlain L.H. Duncan R.R. t-SNARE protein conformations patterned by the lipid microenvironment.J. Biol.

Munc18-1 is absolutely required for exocytosis and is thought to act at the final stages of vesicle fusion (12Fisher R.J. Pevsner J. Burgoyne R.D. Control of fusion pore dynamics during exocytosis by Munc18.Science. 2001; 291: 875-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), but it remains unknown how it is spatially organized at the plasma membrane. Therefore we next decided to probe the spatial relationship between single endogenous Munc18-1 molecules and membrane-proximal secretory vesicles using GSDIM and TIRFM. Wild-type PC12 cells were fixed and processed for Munc18-1 GSDIM, whereas they were also co-immunostained against synaptotagmin 1 (an endogenous marker of the vesicular membrane). Surprisingly, these experiments revealed the preferential siting of Munc18-1 molecules in areas of the plasma membrane that were largely devoid of secretory vesicles (Fig. 1A).

https://openalex.org/W1979519674,"Heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (HS6ST) is an enzyme involved in heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis that transfers a sulfate residue to position 6 of the GlcNAc/GlcNSO(3) residues of HS, and it consists of three isoforms. Heparin, the highly sulfated form of HS, resides in connective tissue mast cells and is involved in the storage of mast cell proteases (MCPs). However, it is not well understood which isoform(s) of HS6ST participates in 6-O-sulfation of heparin and how the 6-O-sulfate residues in heparin affect MCPs. To investigate these issues, we prepared fetal skin-derived mast cells (FSMCs) from wild type (WT) and HS6ST-deficient mice (HS6ST-1(-/-), HS6ST-2(-/-), and HS6ST-1(-/-)/HS6ST-2(-/-)) and determined the structure of heparin, the protease activity, and the mRNA expression of each MCP in cultured FSMCs. The activities of tryptase and carboxypeptidase-A were decreased in HS6ST-2(-/-)-FSMCs in which 6-O-sulfation of heparin was decreased at 50% of WT-FSMCs and almost lost in HS6ST-1(-/-)/HS6ST-2(-/-)-FSMCs, which lacked the 6-O-sulfation in heparin nearly completely. In contrast, chymase activity was retained even in HS6ST-1(-/-)/HS6ST-2(-/-)-FSMCs. Each MCP mRNA was not decreased in any of the mutant FSMCs. Western blot analysis showed that tryptase (mMCP-6) was almost absent from HS6ST-1(-/-)/HS6ST-2(-/-)-FSMCs indicating degradation/secretion of the enzyme protein. These observations suggest that both HS6ST-1 and HS6ST-2 are involved in 6-O-sulfation of heparin and that the proper packaging and storage of tryptase, carboxypeptidase-A, and chymase may be regulated differently by the 6-O-sulfate residues in heparin. It is thus likely that 6-O-sulfation of heparin plays important roles in regulating MCP functions."
https://openalex.org/W2005161538,"Xylosyltransferase I (XT-I) is an essential enzyme of proteoglycan (PG) biosynthesis pathway catalyzing the initial and rate-limiting step in glycosaminoglycan chain assembly. It plays a critical role in the regulation of PG synthesis in cartilage; however, little is known about underlying mechanism. Here, we provide evidence that, in human primary chondrocytes, IL-1β regulates XT-I gene expression into an early phase of induction and a late phase of down-regulation. Based on promoter deletions, the region up to -850 bp was defined as a major element of XT-I gene displaying both constitutive and IL-1β-regulated promoter activity. Point mutation and signaling analyses revealed that IL-1β-induced promoter activity is achieved through AP-1 response elements and mediated by SAP/JNK and p38 signaling pathways. Transactivation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that AP-1 is a potent transactivator of XT-I promoter and that IL-1β-induced activity is mediated through increased recruitment of AP-1 to the promoter. Finally, we show that Sp3 is a repressor of XT-I promoter and bring evidence that the repressive effect of IL-1β during the late phase is mediated through Sp3 recruitment to the promoter. This suggests that modulation of Sp3 in cartilage could prevent IL-1β inhibition of PG synthesis and limit tissue degradation."

All nematodes display similar body plans and are encased in a collagenous exoskeleton, known as the cuticle, which covers the outermost layer of epithelial cells.

Enzymes involved in the biogenesis of the nematode cuticle.Adv. Parasitol. 2003; 53: 85-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The collagens that constitute the cuticle are formed via a multi-step process of intra- and extracellular post-translational enzymatic modifications (reviewed in Ref. 7Page A.P. Winter A.D. Enzymes involved in the biogenesis of the nematode cuticle.Adv. Parasitol. 2003; 53: 85-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An essential step in this process is catalyzed by C-P4H and occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum where secreted proteins are folded. C-P4H converts peptide bound proline residues in the X-Pro-Gly repeat region of procollagen polypeptides to 4-hydroxyproline. Mature collagen triple helices that lack this modification are thermally unstable at physiological temperatures. In most species examined, C-P4H are oligomeric complexes with the C-P4H active sites present in the α subunits and the enzyme PDI present in the β subunit (8Myllyharju J.

The diversity of complexes formed in nematodes is highlighted in Caenorhabditis briggsae, a close relative of C. elegans, where, in addition to a mixed α subunit tetramer and [DPY-18][PDI-2] dimer identical to those found in C. elegans, a [PHY-2]2[PDI-2]2 tetramer can also form (9Winter A.D.

Nematodes produce a new cuticle for each developmental stage, and in C. elegans, the C-P4H complex encoding genes are expressed almost exclusively in the cuticle collagen secreting cells of the hypodermis in waves of abundance that correspond to that of collagen (4Winter A.D.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4084-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). C-P4H activity is developmentally required in C. elegans; worms that have lost the α subunit DPY-18 are viable but show defects at the levels of worm body morphology, cuticle structure, and collagen localization (4Winter A.D.

Complete combined loss of both α subunits, DPY-18 and PHY-2, or complete single loss of the β subunit, PDI-2, results in embryonic lethality (4Winter A.D. Page A.P.

The phenotypes resulting from loss of C-P4H can be replicated using enzyme inhibitors (5Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P.

The in vivo action of the C. elegans C-P4H β subunit PDI-2 has been examined in detail with incomplete loss of function producing sterile adults with severely abnormal body morphology, cuticle structure, and collagen localization (6Winter A.D. McCormack G. Page A.P. Protein disulfide isomerase activity is essential for viability and extracellular matrix formation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 2007; 308: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although it was not possible to analyze separately the C-P4H-dependent and -independent roles of PDI-2, intact PDI-2 thioredoxin active site residues are essential for correct development (6Winter A.D. McCormack G. Page A.P. Protein disulfide isomerase activity is essential for viability and extracellular matrix formation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 2007; 308: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, loss of C. elegans PDI-2 could be completely rescued by human PDI (P4HB), suggesting it may be possible to heterologously express B. malayi PDIs in C. elegans to examine their function. The likely importance of C-P4H activity during B. malayi development and cuticle collagen modification is suggested by several lines of evidence. Chemical inhibition of C-P4H produces cuticle associated defects and a reduction in 4-hydroxyproline levels in cultured B. malayi adults (10Merriweather A. Guenzler V. Brenner M. Unnasch T.R. Characterization and expression of enzymatically active recombinant filarial prolyl 4-hydroxylase.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), whereas for cultured third stage larvae, the essential C-P4H co-factor ascorbate is necessary for correct molting and development (11Rajan T.V. Paciorkowski N. Kalajzic I. McGuiness C. Ascorbic acid is a requirement for the morphogenesis of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi.J. Parasitol. 2003; 89: 868-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adult B. malayi cuticle collagens contain 7.9% hydroxyproline (40% of prolines are hydroxylated) (12Petralanda I. Piessens W.F. Onchocerca volvulus, O. gutturosaBrugia malayiDirofilaria immitis: A comparative study of the immunochemical properties of cuticular proteins from filarial parasites.Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a level comparable with that found in C. elegans (12% hydroxyproline, 51% of prolines are hydroxylated) (13Cox G.N. Kusch M. Edgar R.S. Cuticle of Caenorhabditis elegans: its isolation and partial characterization.J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized a protein from B. malayi with homology to C-P4H α subunits, Bma-PHY-1, which showed a number of unusual properties (14Winter A.D. Myllyharju J. Page A.P. A hypodermally expressed prolyl 4-hydroxylase from the filarial nematode Brugia malayi is soluble and active in the absence of protein disulphide isomerase.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2554-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recombinant α subunits expressed alone are in general insoluble, and therefore, complexes are usually produced by co-expression of α and β subunits in systems such as insect cells. In most cases, complexes can be formed by combining α and β subunits from different species. However, when Bma-PHY-1 was expressed in an insect cell expression system, it was soluble without a β subunit, did not form complexes with β subunits from other species, and instead formed an active homotetramer (14Winter A.D. Myllyharju J. Page A.P. A hypodermally expressed prolyl 4-hydroxylase from the filarial nematode Brugia malayi is soluble and active in the absence of protein disulphide isomerase.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2554-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Despite this in vitro activity, when Bma-PHY-1 was expressed in C. elegans, it was not capable of replacing the in vivo functions of the α subunit DPY-18 (14Winter A.D. Myllyharju J. Page A.P. A hypodermally expressed prolyl 4-hydroxylase from the filarial nematode Brugia malayi is soluble and active in the absence of protein disulphide isomerase.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2554-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that either additional C-P4H α subunit-like genes were present in B. malayi, or, that only complexes containing native partner protein(s) would produce fully functional enzyme. In this study, we utilized the B. malayi genome sequence (3Ghedin E. Wang S. Spiro D. Caler E. Zhao Q. Crabtree J. Allen J.E. Delcher A.L. Guiliano D.B. Miranda-Saavedra D. Angiuoli SV Creasy T.

Draft genome of the filarial nematode parasite Brugia malayi.Science. 2007; 317: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) to ensure identification of all potential C-P4H subunits and used a recently developed approach for RNAi in this parasite (15Landmann F.

Vectors. 2012; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to demonstrate that these genes are required for development and formation of the cuticle. In addition, we uncovered a novel parasite-specific non-reducible covalent modification required for association of this critical enzyme complex. Procedures for RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, genomic DNA isolation, plasmid construction, single worm PCR, and RT-PCR assessment of transgene expression in C. elegans are provided in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” All primer names, sequences, and descriptions of their uses are given in supplemental Table S1. The abbreviations Bma and Cel are used throughout before gene and protein names to indicate B. malayi and C. elegans respectively. C. elegans strains used in this study were N2 (wild type), CB364 (dpy-18(e364) III) (4Winter A.D. Page A.P. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase is an essential procollagen-modifying enzyme required for exoskeleton formation and the maintenance of body shape in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Mol.

Protein disulfide isomerase activity is essential for viability and extracellular matrix formation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 2007; 308: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The pdi-2(tm0689) allele was maintained by selecting pdi-2(tm0689) heterozygotes, which are the only phenotypically wild type progeny segregating from strain TP69. C. elegans strains were cultured as described previously (16Stiernagle T. Maintenance of C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; 10.1895/wormbook.1.101.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). B. malayi nematodes were kindly provided by Rick Maizels and Yvonne Harcus (University of Edinburgh). For microscopy, live C. elegans were transferred to slides with a 2% agarose, 0.065% sodium azide pad. B. malayi were prepared for microscopy by transferring microfilaria to slides with a coverslip and heating the slides to 60 °C on a hot plate for 10 s to immobilize the larvae. All images were captured using an Axioskop 2 microscope (Zeiss) and an AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss). For RNAi of B. malayi, Bma-phy-1, Bma-phy-2, Bma-pdi-2, and Cel-phy-3 (negative control) were targeted following previously described methods (15Landmann F. Foster J.M. Slatko B.E. Sullivan W. Efficient in vitro RNA interference and immunofluorescence-based phenotype analysis in a human parasitic nematode, Brugia malayi.Parasit. Vectors. 2012; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro transcription templates were produced by linearizing the Bma-phy-1, Bma-phy-2, Bma-pdi-2, and Cel-phy-3 RNAi plasmids each in two separate reactions (using the cloning restriction enzymes) and single-stranded RNAs produced using a MEGAscript kit (Ambion). Equal quantities of the complementary single stranded RNAs were then annealed and the long double-stranded RNA digested with ShortCut RNase III (New England Biolabs) to produce heterogeneous short-interfering RNAs (hsiRNAs). Freshly extracted B. malayi adult females were cultured in 24-well plates containing two females per well in 1 ml of culture medium. Medium for culture of B. malayi was RPMI 1640 (with glutamine and HEPES) (Invitrogen), 1% glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Following an overnight culture period in medium alone, the parasites were exposed to RNAi for a total of 48 h by adding fresh medium containing hsiRNAs, at a final concentration of 0.5–2 μm, at the start of the culture and again after 24 h. For RNAi of C. elegans lines expressing Bma-pdi-2, the Bma-pdi-2 RNAi plasmid was transformed into bacterial strain HT115(DE3) (17Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Ingestion of bacterially expressed dRNAs can produce specific and potent genetic interference in Caenorhabditis elegans.Gene. 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar) (HT115(DE3) available from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center). RNAi by feeding was performed as described previously (18Kamath R.S. Martinez-Campos M. Zipperlen P. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Effectiveness of specific RNA-mediated interference through ingested double-stranded RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH0002)PubMed Google Scholar). As a negative control all processes were replicated using control RNAi bacteria containing the RNAi vector without an insert. tBLASTn was performed on whole genome shotgun sequences using Bma-PHY-1 and Bma-PHY-2 (maximum values selected for “alignment” and “descriptions” options). The genomic sequences of Bma-phy-1 and -2 were then used as BLASTn queries against the same database. Those hits that showed complete nucleotide identity to each gene were considered to represent that gene (to identify any potential new Bma-phy, this analysis assumes some degree of sequence divergence). This enabled all whole genome shotgun sequences with amino acid homology to PHYs (tBLASTn results) to be assigned as being derived from either Bma-phy-1 (complete nucleotide identity to Bma-phy-1) or Bma-phy-2 (complete nucleotide identity to Bma-phy-2). The BLASTn results were then subtracted from the tBLASTn results to determine if any whole genome shotgun sequences were present which were not derived from the known genes. Recombinant vectors were co-transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold, BD Pharmingen) by calcium phosphate precipitation. Sf9 or High Five (Invitrogen) insect cells were cultured as monolayers in TNM-FH (modified Grace's insect cell medium, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) or in suspension in Sf900IISFM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm plate or 1 × 106 cells/ml and infected at a multiplicity of 5 for either single or multiple virus coding for B. malayi proteins. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection, washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were further solubilized in 1% SDS. C-P4H activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo-[1-14C]glutarate, and Km and Ki values were determined as described previously (19Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Posttranslational enzymes in the biosynthesis of collagen: intracellular enzymes.Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Transgenic C. elegans carrying extrachromosomal arrays were generated by microinjection following standard protocols (20Evans T.C. Transformation and microinjection.WormBook. 2006; 10.1895/wormbook.1.108.1Crossref Google Scholar) with at least three independent lines analyzed in all cases. Repetitive extrachromosomal arrays were produced by injecting circular plasmids. These were performed by co-injecting the test plasmid at 2–25 μg/ml, the transformation marker dpy-7prom::gfp plasmid (from Iain Johnstone, University of Glasgow) at 5 μg/ml, with pBluescript SKM (Stratagene) added to give a total plasmid concentration of 150 μg/ml. To produce complex extrachromosmal arrays (21Kelly W.G. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Fire A. Distinct requirements for somatic and germline expression of a generally expressed Caernorhabditis elegans gene.Genetics. 1997; 146: 227-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), plasmids were linearized by restriction digest and co-injected with fragmented C. elegans genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was prepared for injection by digestion with PvuII followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The dpy-7prom::gfp transformation marker was digested with FspI, and plasmids for expression of B. malayi or human genes were digested with blunt cutting enzymes where possible or were subsequently treated with DNA polymerase I large (Klenow) fragment (New England Biolabs) (see supplemental Table S2). All linearized plasmids were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit. Injections to produce complex arrays were performed by co-injecting the linearized plasmid(s) each at 1 μg/ml, the transformation marker at 2 μg/ml, and fragmented C. elegans genomic DNA at 100 μg/ml. For unknown reasons, direct introduction of complex arrays by injection of the dpy-18 mutant strain CB364 resulted in high toxicity, even in the absence of B. malayi PHY and PDI expression constructs. Therefore, in these cases, injections were performed in the C. elegans wild type N2 strain, and the transgenic extrachromosomal array subsequently crossed into the dpy-18 mutant strain. B. malayi parasite extracts were made by resuspending adults in extraction buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, supplemented with protease inhibitors 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 μm E64, and 0.1 μm pepstatin) and disrupting using a 3-ml glass hand-held homogenizer (Jencons). To examine the expression of transgenic proteins, C. elegans extracts were made by adding 50 transgenic worms to 30 μl of 1XM9 (16Stiernagle T. Maintenance of C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; 10.1895/wormbook.1.101.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) with 12 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer and freezing the samples at −80 °C. For reducing gels, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol was added, and the samples were boiled before loading. Electrophoresis and Western blotting of nematode and insect cell-derived material was carried out using Bio-Rad equipment as described by the manufacturer, with Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and Hybond-P PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare). Bma-PHY-1 was detected using an anti-peptide antibody described previously (14Winter A.D. Myllyharju J. Page A.P.

When activated by a reduced ATP/ADP ratio, reflecting either increased cellular metabolic demand or reduced cellular ATP generation, KATP channel-dependent potassium efflux shortens cardiac action potential duration, allowing for a longer diastolic interval that supports myocardial relaxation and restoration of ion gradients and energetic resources as well as limits sodium and calcium entry into the cell and thus reduces energy requirements for ion transport/exchange and contraction (1Weiss J.N.

Physiol. 2005; 569: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For instance, in the heart an increase in functional sarcolemmal KATP channel presence enhances the speed and degree of shortening of action potentials and limits cardiac energy consumption in response to escalating workloads, whereas a decrease in their presence has the opposite effect (24Zingman L.V. Zhu Z. Sierra A. Stepniak E. Burnett C.M. Maksymov G. Anderson M.E. Coetzee W.A. Hodgson-Zingman D.M.

Cardiol. 2011; 51: 72-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additionally, although even a small fraction of the normal population of KATP channels can dramatically shorten the action potential duration in response to severe metabolic stress, the speed at which this myocardially protective action occurs is KATP channel expression-dependent (25Zhu Z. Burnett C.M. Maksymov G. Stepniak E. Sierra A. Subbotina E. Anderson M.E. Coetzee W.A. Hodgson-Zingman D.M. Zingman L.V. Reduction in number of sarcolemmal KATP channels slows cardiac action potential duration shortening under hypoxia.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 415: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Defining the mechanisms that control cardiac membrane KATP channel expression and associated metabolic signaling is an important step toward understanding how to promote myocardial energy efficiency and stress resistance to prevent or treat cardiac disease. Myocardial effects of KATP channel current up-regulation are mirrored in many ways by inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), including shortened action potentials, improved resistance to cell death under metabolic stress, and normalized intracellular calcium homeostasis (32Zhang R.

CaMKII is a multifunctional kinase, densely expressed in cardiomyocytes, that targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability to support short-term enhancement of cardiac performance, whereas persistent activation results in adverse cardiac remodeling and dysfunction (35Anderson M.E.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 10274-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibition of CaMKII has been shown to increase cardioprotective KATP channel surface presence and current density (29Li J. Marionneau C. Koval O. Zingman L. Mohler P.J. Nerbonne J.M. Anderson M.E. Calmodulin kinase II inhibition enhances ischemic preconditioning by augmenting ATP-sensitive K+ current.Channels. 2007; 1: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is unknown. Here we identify CaMKII as a critical regulator of the surface expression and consequent whole cell current capacity of cardiac KATP channels. We find that CaMKII activation triggers rapid internalization of cardiac KATP channels by endocytosis. This process requires phosphorylation of threonine at positions 180 and 224 and an intact YXXØ endocytosis motif, 330YSKF333of Kir6.2. A molecular model of Kir6.2 predicts that the μ2 subunit of the endocytosis adaptor protein, AP2, docks with the KATP channel by interacting with 330YSKF333 and Thr-180 on one and Thr-224 on an adjacent Kir6.2 subunit. These findings provide new insight into the regulation of cardiac KATP channels and provide valuable new targets for the promotion of cardiac energy efficiency and stress resistance.

Here we describe molecular details of Dok-3/Grb2 signal integration and function, showing that the Lyn-dependent activation of the BCR transducer kinase Syk is attenuated by Dok-3/Grb2 in a site-specific manner. This process is associated with the SH3 domain-dependent translocation of Dok-3/Grb2 complexes into BCR microsignalosomes and augmented phosphorylation of the inhibitory Lyn target SH2 domain-containing inositol 5' phosphatase. Hence, our findings imply that Dok-3/Grb2 modulates the balance between activatory and inhibitory Lyn functions with the aim to adjust BCR signaling efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1994449625,"K(ATP) channels link cell metabolism to excitability in many cells. They are formed as tetramers of Kir6.2 subunits, each associated with a SUR1 subunit. We used mutant GFP-based FRET to assess domain organization in channel complexes. Full-length Kir6.2 subunits were linked to YFP or cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) at N or C termini, and all such constructs, including double-tagged YFP-Kir6.2-CFP (Y6.2C), formed functional K(ATP) channels. In intact COSm6 cells, background emission of YFP excited by 430-nm light was ∼6%, but the Y6.2C construct expressed alone exhibited an apparent FRET efficiency of ∼25%, confirmed by trypsin digestion, with or without SUR1 co-expression. Similar FRET efficiency was detected in mixtures of CFP- and YFP-tagged full-length Kir6.2 subunits and transmembrane domain only constructs, when tagged at the C termini but not at the N termini. The FRET-reported Kir6.2 tetramer domain organization was qualitatively consistent with Kir channel crystal structures: C termini and M2 domains are centrally located relative to N termini and M1 domains, respectively. Additional FRET analyses were performed on cells in which tagged full-length Kir6.2 and tagged SUR1 constructs were co-expressed. These analyses further revealed that 1) NBD1 of SUR1 is closer to the C terminus of Kir6.2 than to the N terminus; 2) the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain is not essential for complexation with SUR1; and 3) the N-terminal half of SUR1 can complex with itself in the absence of either the C-terminal half or Kir6.2."
