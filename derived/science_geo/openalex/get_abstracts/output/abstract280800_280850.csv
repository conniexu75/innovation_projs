https://openalex.org/W2053076538,"The lunar ranging measurements now being made at the McDonald Observatory have an accuracy of 1 nsec in round-trip travel time. This corresponds to 15 cm in the one-way distance. The use of lasers with pulse-lengths of less than 1 nsec is expected to give an accuracy of 2 to 3 cm in the next few years. A new station is under construction in Hawaii, and additional stations in other countries are either in operation or under development. It is hoped that these stations will form the basis for a worldwide network to determine polar motion and earth rotation on a regular basis, and will assist in providing information about movement of the tectonic plates making up the earth's surface. Several mobile lunar ranging stations with telescopes having diameters of 1.0 m or less could, in the future, greatly extend the information obtainable about motions within and between the tectonic plates."

This result supports a traditional theory of gradual evolution rather than recent theories suggesting accelerated evolution in social mammals."

Nitric oxide was also detected in situ in nitrite-rich surface waters of the central equatorial Pacific, where it formed in daylight and disappeared rapidly at sunset. The formation and rapid cycling of nitric oxide implies the presence of other free radicals in seawater, perhaps as intermediates in ongoing autoxidation processes. The central equatorial Pacific is a nitric oxide source to the atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2125268884,"A variety of sound recordings were played to southern right whales. Whales approached the loudspeaker and made frequent sounds in response to recordings of other southern right whales, but swam away and made relatively few sounds in response to playbacks of water noise, 200-hertz tones, and humpback whale sounds. Thus it appears that southern right whales can differentiate between con-specific sounds and other sounds."
https://openalex.org/W2018716539,"A sodium-poor, calcium-rich inclusion in the carbonaceous chondrite Allende had a (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio at the time of its formation of 0.69880, as low a value as that found in any other meteorite. The higher (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios found in ordinary chondrites indicate that their formation or isotopic equilibration occurred tens of millions of years later."
https://openalex.org/W2067066321,"Between 1878 and 1882, key members of the American scientific community played an important role in Thomas A. Edison's work on electric lighting. Impressed by his abilities, these scientists came to regard Edison as a peer and led him to see himself as a scientific man. But Edison's high standing among scientists and the American public and his professed self-image as a scientist provoked America's noted experimental physicist, Henry A. Rowland, to make a ""Plea for pure science"" before the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1883."

This is the first chart of the Gulf Stream and continues today to be a good summary of its strength, course, and breadth."

https://openalex.org/W2035214242,"Lead isotopic compositions of 12 galenas from five late Archaic-initial Woodland grave and habitation sites in southern Ontario have made it possible to determine the ""most likely"" source areas for the galenas. For one of the oldest sites (Finlan), the most likely source is in the southwestern Upper Mississippi Valley (Wisconsin-Illinois-Iowa) mineral district. The seven Finlan galenas exhibit a range of isotopic ratios; three of the largest specimens have substantial isotopic variations (up to 1.8 percent in the ratio of lead-207 to lead-206) on a scale of a few centimeters. This suggests that the lead isotopic zoning ascribed to the Upper Mississippi Valley area is not sufficiently well defined to enable us to determine if all the Finlan samples were derived from a single mineral deposit. Galenas from the other sites (Constance Bay, Hind, Bruce Boyd, and Picton) most probably originated in the southeastern Ontario-northwestern New York area. Isotopic differences among the Constance Bay, Hind, and Bruce Boyd galenas, on the one hand, and the Picton galena, on the other, suggest that at least two distinct sources in that region were exploited."

https://openalex.org/W2142369412,"During the past 8 years, extended temporal and broadband spectroscopic studies carried out by x-ray astronomical satellites have led to the identification of specific compact x-ray sources as accreting neutron stars, black holes, and degenerate dwarf stars in close binary systems. Such sources provide a unique opportunity to study matter under extreme conditions not accessible in the terrestrial laboratory. Quantitative theoretical models have been developed which demonstrate that detailed studies of these sources will lead to a greatly increased understanding of dense and superdense hadron matter, hadron superfluidity, high-temperature plasma in superstrong magnetic fields, and physical processes in strong gravitational fields. Through a combination of theory and observation such studies will make possible the determination of the mass, radius, magnetic field, and structure of neutron stars and degenerate dwarf stars and the identification of further candidate black holes, and will contribute appreciably to our understanding of the physics of accretion by compact astronomical objects."

Lassen have provided quantitative data for the construction of thermal contour maps of portions of the flanks of these volcanoes. Preliminary surveys substantiate the existence of one suspected thermal anomaly on Mt. Rainier."
https://openalex.org/W2071254034,"We find that the current-sensitive noise thermometer is a satisfactory sensor of absolute temperature down to 2 mK and possibly below. Its field of application is primarily to magnetically and electrically quiet situations where accuracy is important and high precision is not required. For example the noise thermometer is an ideal instrument for calibrating a secondary thermometer, such as a pressure thermometer, whose calibration can readily and accurately be transferred from one laboratory to another. Further instrumental development for millidegree applications seems unnecessary at present. Rather the major problems in millikelvin noise thermometry that require attention in the immediate future involve establishing thermal contact to the thermometer and reducing its thermal response time."
