https://openalex.org/W2023364466,"The proU locus encodes an osmotically inducible glycine betaine transport system that is important in the adaptation to osmotic stress. We present evidence that DNA supercoiling plays a key role in the osmotic induction of proU transcription. An increase in extracellular osmolarity increases in vivo DNA supercoiling, and the expression of proU is highly sensitive to these changes. Furthermore, topA mutations can mimic an increase in osmolarity, facilitating proU expression even in media of low osmolarity in which it is not normally expressed. Selection for trans-acting mutations that affect proU expression has yielded only mutations that alter DNA supercoiling, either in topA or a new genetic locus, osmZ, which strongly influences in vivo supercoiling. Mutations in osmZ are highly pleiotropic, affecting expression of a variety of chromosomal genes including ompF, ompC, fimA, and the bgl operon, as well as increasing the frequency of site-specific DNA inversions that mediate fimbrial phase variation."
https://openalex.org/W2130535740,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) increases the steady-state RNA levels of several fibroblast extracellular matrix proteins. Using DNA transfection, we show that TGF-beta stimulates the activity of the mouse alpha 2(l) collagen promoter 5- to 10-fold in mouse NIH 3T3 and rat osteosarcoma cells. Deletion analysis indicates that a segment of this promoter between -350 and -300, overlapping a nuclear factor 1 (NF1) binding site, is needed for TGF-beta stimulation. A 3 bp substitution mutation abolishing NF1 binding to this site inhibits TGF-beta activation. Insertion of this NF1 binding site 5' to the SV40 early promoter makes the promoter TGF-beta inducible, but the 3 bp substitution does not. Similarly, when the NF1 binding site at the replication origin of adenovirus 2 and 5 is inserted 5' to the SV40 promoter, the promoter responds to TGF-beta. Therefore an NF1 binding site mediates the transcriptional activation of the mouse alpha 2(l) collagen promoter by TGF-beta."
https://openalex.org/W2120678660,"Here we describe development and application of highly sensitive fluorescence methodology for localization of single-copy sequences in interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes by nonisotopic in situ hybridization. Application of this methodology to the investigation of Epstein-Barr virus integration in the Namalwa lymphoma cell line has revealed two EBV genomes closely integrated at the known site on chromosome 1. Detecting sequences as small as 5 kb, we further demonstrate resolution within interphase nuclei of two fragments of the viral genome spaced only 130 kb apart. Results indicate that the viral genomes are in opposite orientations and separated by roughly 340 kb of cellular DNA. This work demonstrates the feasibility and resolving power of interphase chromatin mapping to assess the proximity of closely spaced DNA sequences. Implications for virology, gene mapping, and investigation of nuclear organization are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2075007419,"Functional upstream activator sequences (TAAT-GARATmotifs) of herpes simplex virus immediate-early genes were identified and shown both to bind a factor (TRF) present in uninfected HeLa cells and to confer inducibility by the virus regulatory protein, Vmw65, on a normally nonresponsive promoter. Point-mutation analyses demonstrated binding specificity and correlated binding with Vmw65 induction. Furthermore, the octamer domains of the adenovirus DNA replication origin, the histone H2B, and the immunoglobulin light chain genes bound and competed for TRF. The immunoglobulin octamer also conferred Vmw65 inducibility on the TK promoter. In addition, a modified form of TRF was specifically detected in infected cells. We conclude that TRF is similar or identical to the previously described octamer binding protein and is likely to be the target for coordinate induction of immediate-early gene expression by Vmw65."
https://openalex.org/W2072229797,"Transcription of HSV immediate early genes is stimulated by a virus structural protein, Vmw65, in a process that requires specific recognition of the sequence TAATGARAT (R = purine). Upon incubation of nuclear extracts of HSV infected cells with a short DNA fragment containing TAATGARAT, a novel virus-induced protein-DNA complex (named IEC) was detected. Addition of virion extract, containing Vmw65, to nuclear extract from uninfected cells also resulted in the formation of IEC. Vmw65 is a component of IEC, which contains proteins bound specifically to TAATGARAT. Thus, Vmw65 and cellular factors combine to form a sequence-specific DNA-binding complex. This system provides a model for studies of the regulation of inducible cellular genes."
https://openalex.org/W1562098826,"Oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence has been used to measure the dependence of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation on oxygen concentration in suspensions of isolated rat liver mitochondria. An instrument has been designed which simultaneously monitors the phosphorescence lifetime of a fluorophor and the reduction of cytochrome c by dual wavelength spectrophotometry. The phosphorescence lifetime method gives very rapid (less than 100 ms) measure of the oxygen concentration (Vanderkooi, J. M., Maniara, G., Green, T. J., and Wilson, D. F. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5476-5482) from concentrations characteristic of air-saturated media to as low as 2 x 10(-8) M. The results may be summarized as follows. For well coupled rat liver mitochondria at pH 7.0 and in the presence of ATP, as the oxygen concentration was lowered, increased cytochrome c reduction was observed to begin at oxygen concentrations greater than 20 microM. For mitochondria in the presence of uncoupler, cytochrome c reduction began at oxygen concentrations less than 1.0 microM. The oxygen dependence of reduction of cytochrome c in well coupled mitochondria treated with ATP was strongly dependent on the pH of the suspending medium. Reduction of cytochrome c began at higher oxygen concentrations as the pH was made more alkaline. The oxygen concentration for half-maximal respiratory rates was much larger for well coupled mitochondria treated with ATP (approximately 0.7 microM) than for mitochondria treated with uncoupler (less than 0.1 microM). It is concluded that the oxygen dependence of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is such that mitochondria could function in their proposed role of tissue oxygen sensors for regulation of such diverse functions as local blood flow and electrical activity in the carotid body."
https://openalex.org/W2159361278,"We have dissected the human hsp70 promoter to define sequence elements allowing response to E1A. Alterations of sequence upstream of the TATA element, either with Bal 31 nuclease or by site-directed mutagenesis, had little or no effect on the response of the promoter to E1A. In general, the basal level was reduced, indicating that these sites interact with factors important for transcription, but regulation persisted. Although a CAT gene driven by just the hsp70 TATA (void of upstream sequences) could be stimulated by E1A, a similar construct containing the early SV40 TATA element was not. Analysis of several additional such constructions indicated that the specific sequence TATAA was crucial. Substitution of the TATAA sequence with the SV40 TATTTAT element in the context of the wild-type hsp70 promoter resulted in loss of E1A inducibility, but maintenance of heat inducibility. Replacement of this element with sequences not related to any TATA element resulted in loss of activity and inducibility. Thus, the SV40 TATA equivalent is functional in the context of the hsp70 promoter but cannot be induced by E1A. We conclude that the target for E1A induction of the hsp70 promoter is TATAA, and that multiple functionally distinct TATA elements, and presumably cognate transcription factors, can be distinguished in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006979668,"The expression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) after T cell activation is regulated by NF-κB, an inducible DNA-binding protein that stimulates transcription. Proteins encoded by a variety of DNA viruses are also able to activate expression from the HIV enhancer. To determine how this activation occurs, specific genes from herpes simplex virus type 1 and adenovirus that activate HIV in T lymphoma cells have been identified. The cis-acting regulatory sequences in the HIV enhancer that mediate their effect have also been characterized. The relevant genes are those for ICP0—an immediate-early product of herpes simplex virus type 1—and the form of E1A encoded by the 13Smessenger RNA of adenovirus. Activation of HIV by adenovirus E1A was found to depend on the TATA box, whereas herpesvirus ICP0 did not work through a single defined cis-acting element. These findings suggest multiple pathways that can be used to bypass normal cellular activation of HIV, and they raise the possibility that infection by herpes simplex virus or adenovirus may directly contribute to the activation of HIV in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by mechanisms independent of antigenic stimulation in T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2122872835,"Signal recognition particle (SRP), a small ribonucleoprotein required for targeting secretory proteins to the ER, has three known functions: signal recognition, elongation arrest, and translocation promotion. Because SRP is inactivated by the sulfhydryl alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), we have attempted to establish structure-function relationships within SRP by assembling particles in which a single protein is modified. Alkylation of the 68/72 kd protein of SRP yields a particle that arrests elongation but fails to promote translocation and no longer interacts with SRP receptor. Alkylation of the 54 kd protein yields a particle that fails to recognize signal sequences. This approach has allowed us to map activities to specific protein domains on SRP, and should be generally useful for analyzing other ribonucleoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2053026856,"Rabbit antisera were raised against three overlapping synthetic peptides with sequence homology to the second conserved domain of the external envelope glycoprotein (gp120) of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All of the antisera immunoprecipitated the envelope glycoprotein. In particular, an antiserum directed against amino acids 254 to 274 of env was efficient in neutralizing three different isolates of HIV in vitro, without affecting the binding of the virus to CD4-positive cells. Therefore, this conserved region of gp120 appears to be critical in a postbinding event during virus penetration and may represent a target for antibody neutralization of HIV. These findings may be applicable in the design of a vaccine for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1964317450,"We have localized the DNA sequence that facilitates unwinding of a yeast replication origin, the H4 ARS. The readily unwound sequence lies adjacent to the previously characterized consensus core sequence of the ARS. Unwinding is detected through the formation of a single-strand-specific nuclease hypersensitive site in H4 ARS mutant derivatives present on supercoiled plasmids. Linker-scanning and linker-deletion derivatives exhibit wild-type nuclease hypersensitivity and ARS function, while large external deletions reduce or eliminate nuclease detectable unwinding and origin function. ARS unwinding and origin function can be rescued in the deletion mutants by inserting a biologically unrelated sequence with DNA unwinding properties similar to a functional ARS. The data clarify the nature of DNA sequence requirements in the ARS by suggesting that small substitutions, insertions, and deletions are tolerated in the region flanking the consensus core sequence because they do not significantly alter the unwinding properties of the region."

https://openalex.org/W2043624772,"A 50-nucleotide untranslated region is shown to be present within the coding sequence of Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4 gene 60, which encodes one of the subunits for its type II DNA topoisomerase. This interruption is part of the transcribed messenger RNA and appears not to be removed before translation. Thus, the usual colinearity between messenger RNA and the encoded protein sequence apparently does not exist in this case. The interruption is bracketed by a direct repeat of five base pairs. A mechanism is proposed in which folding of the untranslated region brings together codons separated by the interruption so that the elongating ribosome may skip the 50 nucleotides during translation. The alternative possibility, that the protein is efficiently translated from a very minor and undetectable form of processed messenger RNA, seems unlikely, but has not been completely ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W1589353440,"We have studied the domain structure of the A1 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein using both partial proteolysis and photochemical cross-linking to oligodeoxynucleotides. Both the intact A1 protein and its proteolytic fragment, the UP1 protein, can be cleaved by Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease to produce two polypeptides of 92 amino acids. These two polypeptides correspond to the internal repeat sequence previously noted by us to occur in UP1. The two polypeptides can be purified via single-stranded DNA cellulose chromatography and independently cross-linked to [32P]p(dT)8, indicating that each domain can bind to single-stranded nucleic acids. Purification and sequencing of A1 tryptic peptides that had been cross-linked to oligothymidylic acid revealed that 4 phenylalanine residues, phenylalanines 16, 58, 107, and 149 are the sites of covalent adduct formation, with phenylalanine 16 being the major site of cross-linking. These phenylalanine residues are internally homologous when the repeat sequences in A1 are aligned, that is, phenylalanines 16 and 107 occupy analogous positions in the 91-residue repeat, as do phenylalanines 58 and 149. An examination of the primary structures of a variety of eucaryotic RNA-binding proteins with sequence homology to A1 reveals that the cross-linked phenylalanines in A1 are highly conserved among all of these proteins. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that conserved residues in the 90-amino acid repeating domains shared by A1 and other single-stranded nucleic acid binding-proteins form part of an RNA-binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1588543465,"Reaction parameters were modified to enhance the in vitro reaction rate and to reveal partial and novel reactions of the group II intron 5g of the mitochondrial gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I. One alteration yields separate 5'- and 3'-exons plus linear excised intron as the main products. A linear reaction intermediate, containing intron and 3'-exon, and products resulting from cleavages at two unexpected sites were identified. Spliced exon reopening, a novel reaction between excised intron and spliced exons, appears responsible for separate 5'- and 3'-exon products."
https://openalex.org/W2168557809,"Previous work has established that the v-erbA oncogene inhibits the temperature-induced differentiation of chick erythroblasts transformed with temperature-sensitive oncogene mutants. Here we demonstrate that v-erbA in differentiating erythroblasts specifically arrests expression of the erythrocyte anion transporter (band 3) gene at the transcriptional level. The v-erbA-induced differentiation block can be overcome by inducing cells to differentiate at alkaline pH. Under these conditions, which possibly impair biological activity of v-erbA, the maturing cells now express the anion transporter gene at high levels. However, its transcription is specifically and rapidly suppressed if v-erbA activity is restored by culturing the cells at neutral pH. Similar but less pronounced inhibition of gene expression by v-erbA was observed for the δ-amino-levulinic acid synthase gene. Additional evidence obtained with an inhibitor of band 3 activity suggests that the v-erbA-induced inhibition of band 3 gene expression is at least partly responsible for the differentiation block caused by this oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2070820840,"To show that DNA containing sharp sequence-directed curvature can preferentially establish ends of supertwisted domains, a highly curved DNA from Crithidia fasciculata was cloned into two sites separated by 28% in pBR325. When this construct (pJGC2) was examined by electron microscopy, 63% of the supercoiled molecules were branched with three or more arms, and the remaining molecules appeared as linear interwound rods. The distance between the tips of two of the arms for the branched molecules measured within 2% of 28% of the DNA contour for 32% of the pJGC2 molecules, as contrasted with only 6.6% for the poorly branched pBR325 DNA. When one of the curved segments in pJGC2 was replaced by a highly curved fragment from SV40, similar results were obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2077056545,"The interaction of the lambda phage initiator protein, O, with the lambda origin sequence, ori, has been investigated. Binding of O, or its amino-terminal fragment, causes a major structural change within a 60 bp AT-rich region just to the right of the O-binding site. ATP or other molecular energy sources are not required. The modification, as assayed by nuclease sensitivity, is reduced when certain ori mutant sequences, which bind O but fail to replicate, are substituted for the wild-type sequence. The modification of DNA structure caused by the interaction of O is absolutely dependent on the presence of superhelical tension at the lambda origin sequence, and has several properties consistent with a strand separation reaction. We propose that this modification is a fundamental prepriming event that is the first stage in initiation of bidirectional replication in lambda after O binding."
https://openalex.org/W2075264413,"Monkey cell lines that constitutively synthesize 38.6 kd lac repressor protein and bear stably integrated chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) genes linked to a lac operator-containing SV40 early promoter-enhancer were generated. When grown in medium containing isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG), these cells acquired a CAT+ phenotype. In contrast, when grown in parallel in medium lacking IPTG, the cells remained CAT-. Maximum induction of CAT activity occurred after 4 days of IPTG exposure. Three days after removal of IPTG, induced cells had reverted to CAT-. Specific CAT activity increased up to 60-fold after induction, while background activity in uninduced cells was similar to or only slightly above that of parental, CAT- cells. CAT activity increased stepwise over a wide range of IPTG concentrations. Thus lac repressor-operator complexes can form on primate chromosomes and stringently block transcription from an adjoining promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1503647622,"Stimulation of washed human platelets with alpha-thrombin was accompanied by aggregation, formation of inositol phosphates and phosphatidic acid, liberation of arachidonic acid, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores, and influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. Each of these responses was potentiated by a short pretreatment with epinephrine, although alone this agent was ineffective. A prolonged (5 min) stimulation with alpha-thrombin desensitized both phospholipase C and Ca2+ mobilization to a further thrombin challenge. Epinephrine added following thrombin desensitization restored both the ability of thrombin to release Ca2+ stores and stimulate inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Resensitization was mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and lasted about 3 min, after which the Ca2+ levels returned again to basal levels. Pretreatment of platelets with phorbol dibutyrate at concentrations which specifically activate protein kinase C increased the rate of desensitization of the thrombin-induced release of Ca2+ stores and abolished the ability of epinephrine to restore the thrombin response. The protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, blocked the inhibitory effect of phorbol ester and also reduced the rate of desensitization of thrombin and subsequent epinephrine action. These results suggest that thrombin activation of protein kinase C phosphorylates and inactivates a signaling protein which is common to both thrombin and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. This protein is involved in thrombin stimulation of phospholipase C but is not directly stimulatory since epinephrine alone does not activate this enzyme. We searched for a known second messenger protein common to both thrombin and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors which was phosphorylated in intact platelets by protein kinase C in parallel with thrombin-induced desensitization. The alpha subunit of the inhibitory GTP-binding protein, Gi, was the only candidate which fulfilled all of these criteria as shown by immunoprecipitation. Therefore, we suggest that alpha i maintains the thrombin receptor in a state which can couple to phospholipase C when activated with thrombin. This permissive state of alpha i is blocked by phosphorylation by thrombin-activated protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1537266826,"Yeast RNA polymerases are being extensively studied at the gene level. The entire gene encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase A, A190, was isolated and characterized in detail. Southern hybridization and gene disruption experiments showed that the RPA190 gene is unique in the haploid yeast genome and essential for cell viability. Nuclease S1 mapping was used to identify mRNA 5' and 3' termini. RPA190 encodes a polypeptide chain of 186,270 daltons in a large uninterrupted reading frame. A dot matrix comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of subunit A190 with Escherichia coli beta' and cognate subunits B220 and C160 from yeast RNA polymerases B and C showed a conserved pattern of homology regions (I-VI). A potential DNA-binding site (zinc-binding motif) is conserved in the N-terminal region I. Remarkably, the A190 subunit does not harbor the heptapeptide repeated sequence present in the B220 subunit. The sequence of the A190 subunit diverges from B220 and C160 by the presence of two hydrophilic domains inserted between homology regions I and II, and V and VI. From their codon usage and third base pyrimidine bias, RNA polymerase genes RPA190, RPB220, RPC160, and RPC40 fall among yeast genes expressed at an average level. The RPA190 5'-flanking region contains features present in other polymerase genes that might function in regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1495299904,"We have analyzed the pattern of expression of three human metallothionein (MT) genes (MTI-F, MTI-G, and MTII-A) in the hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, in response to the metal ion inducers cadmium, copper, and zinc. The absolute number of transcripts of each of the three genes were measured, and the data clearly suggest differential regulation of these members of the MT gene family by the different inducers both in terms of the rate and the extent of transcript accumulation. The lowest levels of transcript accumulation was observed for MTI-F gene (maximum 4,000 molecules of mRNA per cell) and copper was shown to be its poorest inducer (up to 2,000 molecules per cell). Cadmium is the poorest inducer of MTI-G gene even though transcripts of this gene accumulated at comparatively higher levels than those of MTI-F. Copper- and zinc-induced MTI-G transcript accumulation was up to 12,000 molecules per cell whereas the corresponding value for cadmium was only 4,500. MTII-A was the only gene expressed in the absence of any externally added inducer. Also, in contrast to the MTI genes, the MTII-A gene was equally responsive to all the metal ions tested and the induced levels of accumulation were much higher (up to 75,000 molecules of MTII-A mRNA per cell)."
https://openalex.org/W1532564906,"The neuropeptide bombesin acts on a variety of target cells to stimulate the processes of secretion and cell proliferation. In this study we determined whether bombesin receptors interact with known guanine nucleotide-binding proteins in four different cell types: GH4C1 pituitary cells, HIT pancreatic islet cells, Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, and rat brain tissue. Maximal concentrations of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs decreased agonist binding to bombesin receptors in membranes from all four sources. In GH4C1 and HIT cell membranes GTP analogs inhibited bombesin receptor binding with IC50 values of about 0.1 microM, whereas GDP analogs were approximately 10-fold less potent. In contrast, GMP and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenylyl-imidodiphosphate had no effect at 100 microM. Equilibrium binding experiments in GH4C1 and HIT cell membranes indicated a single class of binding sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) for [125I-Tyr4]bombesin of 24.4 +/- 7.0 pM and a binding capacity of 176 +/- 15 fmol/mg protein. Guanine nucleotides decreased the apparent affinity of the receptors without significantly changing receptor number. Consistent with this observation, guanine nucleotides also increased the rate of ligand dissociation. Pretreatment of GH4C1 or HIT cells with either pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) or cholera toxin (500 ng/ml) for 18 h did not affect agonist binding to membrane bombesin receptors, its regulation by guanine nucleotides, or bombesin stimulation of hormone release. Although pertussis toxin pretreatment has been reported to block bombesin stimulation of DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells, it did not alter the binding properties of bombesin receptors in Swiss 3T3 membranes or inhibit the rapid increase in intracellular [Ca2+] produced by bombesin in these cells. In summary, our results indicate that the bombesin receptor interacts with a guanine nucleotide-binding protein which exhibits a different toxin sensitivity from those which regulate adenylate cyclase as well as those which couple some receptors to phospholipases."
https://openalex.org/W1599217059,"Helicase I has been purified to greater than 95% homogeneity from an F+ strain of Escherichia coli, and characterized as a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase and a helicase. The duplex DNA unwinding reaction requires a region of ssDNA for enzyme binding and concomitant nucleoside 5'-triphosphate hydrolysis. All eight predominant nucleoside 5'-triphosphates can satisfy this requirement. Unwinding is unidirectional in the 5' to 3' direction. The length of duplex DNA unwound is independent of protein concentration suggesting that the unwinding reaction is highly processive. Kinetic analysis of the unwinding reaction indicates that the enzyme turns over very slowly from one DNA substrate molecule to another. The ATP hydrolysis reaction is continuous when circular partial duplex DNA substrates are used as DNA effectors. When linear partial duplex substrates are used ATP hydrolysis is barely detectable, although the kinetics of the unwinding reaction on linear partial duplex substrates are identical to those observed using a circular partial duplex DNA substrate. This suggests that ATP hydrolysis fuels continuous translocation of helicase I on circular single-stranded DNA while on linear single stranded DNA the enzyme translocates to the end of the DNA molecule where it must slowly dissociate from the substrate molecule and/or slowly associate with a new substrate molecule, thus resulting in a very low rate of ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1556994095,"The iron-transport genes from the pJM1 plasmid of Vibrio anguillarum have been cloned and sequenced. Five open-reading frames have been identified, one of which encodes the outer membrane receptor for ferric anguibactin, OM2. This coding region corresponds to a protein of 726 amino acids with a Mr of 78,777. The protein has a hydrophobic signal sequence of 35 amino acids and a potential membrane-associated hydrophobic region at the carboxyl terminus. A 2.3-kilobase iron-regulated mRNA was transcribed from this region in vivo. The four other open-reading frames were shown to be involved in the regulation of OM2 expression and in iron transport by the use of insertion mutagenesis and complementation analysis. One of these open-reading frames, ORF3, encodes a 40-kDa polypeptide which, as deduced from the amino acid sequence and the hydropathy plot, is likely to be membrane-associated and together with OM2 may play a role in the transport of iron into the cell cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1580265188,"The mechanism of import of proteins into mitochondria was studied by using the peptide of the presequence of ornithine aminotransferase (the extrapeptide), which was chemically synthesized and is composed of 34 amino acids. When the extrapeptide was incubated with isolated mitochondria in the presence of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate at 25 degrees C, it was imported into the mitochondrial matrix, and the import depended on the inner membrane potential, but not added ATP. The import of several precursors of mitochondrial proteins was competitively inhibited by the presence of excess extrapeptide in the reaction system, indicating that the extrapeptide and mitochondrial proteins were imported by the same machinery. Import of the extrapeptide was significantly stimulated by addition of a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and a component of the lysate (the cytosolic factor) stimulating import of the extrapeptide was purified about 20,000 times by successive column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and aminopentyl-Sepharose 4B. The binding of the extrapeptide to liposomes composed of egg lecithin and partially purified receptor of the precursor of mitochondrial protein (Ono, H., and Tuboi, S., (1985) Biochem. Int. 10, 351-357) required the cytosolic factor when the concentration of the peptide was less than 1.5 X 10(-8) M, suggesting that the physiological binding of the precursors of mitochondrial proteins to the receptor is dependent on the cytosolic factor. The extrapeptide and the cytosolic factor were shown to form a complex. From these results, the mechanism of binding of the extrapeptide to the receptor of the mitochondrial outer membrane is suggested to be as follows: the peptide (the precursor of mitochondrial protein) and the cytosolic factor form a complex, and then the complex is recognized by and bound to the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1516241516,"Little is known about the metabolic fate of the sulfidopeptide leukotrienes (LTC4/D4/E4). Earlier studies using radiolabeled leukotrienes have shown that these potent molecules are concentrated and metabolized in the liver when administered to mice and that isolated rat hepatocytes have a high affinity uptake system for LTE4. N-Acetyl-LTE4 has been identified as a metabolite of LTC4 in the bile of rats, but the majority of the metabolites in these studies were not characterized. Based on these earlier reports, incubation of LTE4 with isolated rat hepatocytes was chosen as a model for the study of sulfidopeptide leukotriene metabolism. [3H]LTE4 was incubated with isolated rat hepatocytes and the metabolites formed were purified extensively by ODS flash column chromatography, TLC, and reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography. Metabolites were identified by retention of the radiolabel and UV absorbance at 280 nm. Purified metabolites were characterized by UV spectroscopy, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, negative ion chemical ionization gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and electron impact gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Six LTE4 hepatocyte metabolites were characterized. Metabolite A was determined to be N-acetyl-LTE4. Metabolite B was determined to be the omega-oxidation product 20-carboxy-N-acetyl-LTE4. Metabolite C was characterized as the beta-oxidation product 18-carboxydinor-N-acetyl-LTE4. A further round of beta-oxidation with a concomitant double bond reduction produced Metabolite D, identified as 16-carboxytetranordihydro-N-acetyl-LTE4. The reduction of the 14-15 double bond was most likely the result of the action of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. The UV spectrum of Metabolite E indicated the presence of a conjugated tetraene, and this metabolite was determined to be 16-carboxytetranor-delta 13-N-acetyl-LTE4. Metabolite F was identified as 14-carboxyhexanor-N-acetyl-LTE4. The observed pathway of beta-oxidation of LTE4 proceeded entirely from the C-20 methyl terminus after omega-oxidation which is in contrast to the known metabolic fate of other eicosanoids. This may be due to the failure to generate the required thioester at C-1 in LTE4 through a strong interaction of the C-5 hydroxy group with the C-1 carboxyl."
https://openalex.org/W2028541172,"The sites at which topoisomerase I interacts with the transcriptionally active ribosomal chromatin of Xenopus oocytes were mapped by treating oocyte nuclei first with camptothecin to stabilize topoisomerase I-rDNA reaction intermediates, and then with SDS to resolve these adducts as protein-linked nicks in the DNA. Strikingly, the topoisomerase I sites are concentrated in the region encoding the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs, where they are spaced with a periodicity of ∼200 nucleotides. Plasmid rDNA that has assembled into a nucleoprotein structure in an oocyte nuclear extract yields this same restricted pattern of sites, while rDNA that is not in a chromatin structure exhibits a continuum of topoisomerase I cleavages. Thus, the ∼200 bp spacing of sites of topoisomerase I interaction evidently reflects rDNA chromatin structure. These results indicate that the active rRNA genes are organized into nucleosome-like arrays, with topoisomerase I located in the linker regions."

https://openalex.org/W1537991464,"The phosphohydrolase component of the microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase system has been identified as a 36.5-kDa polypeptide by 32P-labeling of the phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate formed during steady-state hydrolysis. A 36.5-kDa polypeptide was labeled when disrupted rat hepatic microsomes were incubated with three different 32P-labeled substrates for the enzyme (glucose-6-P, mannose-6-P, and PPi) and the reaction terminated with trichloroacetic acid. Labeling of the phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate with [32P]glucose-6-P was blocked by several well-characterized competitive inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphatase activity (e.g. Al(F)-4 and Pi) and by thermal inactivation, and labeling was not seen following incubations with 32Pi and [U-14C]glucose-6-P. In agreement with steady-state dictates, the amount of [32P]phosphoryl intermediate was directly and quantitatively proportional to the steady-state glucose-6-phosphatase activity measured under a variety of conditions in both intact and disrupted hepatic microsomes. The labeled 36.5-kDa polypeptide was specifically immunostained by antiserum raised in sheep against the partially purified rat hepatic enzyme, and the antiserum quantitatively immunoprecipitated glucose-6-phosphatase activity from cholate-solubilized rat hepatic microsomes. [32P]Glucose-6-P also labeled a similar-sized polypeptide in hepatic microsomes from sheep, rabbit, guinea pig, and mouse and rat renal microsomes. The glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme appears to be a minor protein of the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum, comprising about 0.1% of the total microsomal membrane proteins. The centrifugation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized membrane proteins was found to be a crucial step in the resolution of radiolabeled microsomal proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1533580349,"Neutrophils stimulated with optimal amounts of tumor-promoters that activate protein kinase C (e.g. mezerein, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) are known to release large quantities of superoxide: approximately 40-50 nmol O2-/min/10(7) cells. Previous studies have shown that treatment of neutrophils with the calcium ionophore A23187, or with 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenonate (5-HETE), dramatically increased the ability of these cells to release O2- in response to suboptimal concentrations of the stimulants mentioned. In this manuscript, we provide data relevant to the basis of this augmentation of O2- release. The synergy with ionophore A23187 exhibited a partial requirement for extracellular Ca2+, whereas that with 5-HETE exhibited a near absolute requirement for that cation. Neutrophils stimulated with optimal amounts of tumor-promoters are known to exhibit a redistribution of protein kinase C activity from the soluble to a particulate fraction. A redistribution of kinase activity was not observed in cells stimulated synergistically. On the other hand, ionophore A23187 and 5-HETE increased the binding of a suboptimal amount of [3H] phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to intact neutrophils by approximately 25 and 50%, respectively. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (i.e. sphingosine, 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine) substantially blocked O-2 release from neutrophils stimulated either synergistically or with optimal levels of tumor-promoters. These data suggest a role for 5-HETE in modulating O-2 release by neutrophils and are discussed in relation to models of the interactions of protein kinase C with membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2000181608,"Plasmids that replicate autonomously in mouse L cells were constructed by inserting random genomic DNA fragments from Ltk- cells into a plasmid containing the HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene with a truncated low-efficiency promoter. HAT resistance was used as a selective marker. The presence of free plasmids in the DNA of transformants was demonstrated by hybridization with a specific plasmid probe, by electron microscopic visualization of circular DNA, and by recovering these plasmids by E. coli transformation. Nineteen different DNA fragments were isolated. They were characterized as murine autonomously replicating sequences by Mbol restriction endonuclease sensitivity, by bromodeoxyuridine substitution, by copy number determination, and by segregation analysis. Sequence analysis of the inserts of nine plasmids revealed a conserved element of 12 bp (CTCATGAGAGGCCAA) in five out of nine autonomously replicating sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2076343527,"We show that in stable monkey cell lines, the replication of a chimeric SV40-BPV episomal replicon occurs once and only once per cell cycle. The copy number of this episome is stably maintained even when an excess of the limiting initiation factor T antigen is provided. These experiments therefore uncover a cis-acting negative control mechanism whereby replication control is not focused on limiting the activity of positive factors; rather, replication is permitted in unreplicated replicons but is actively prevented, in cis, in replicons that have already been duplicated. We also find that the initiation factor SV40 T antigen remains associated with its SV-BPV episomal template in a kinetically stable and potentially heritable state."
https://openalex.org/W1499154937,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates release of pituitary gonadotropins by activating specific plasma membrane receptors. In the present studies, we have used activators of the Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) to probe the binding characteristics of agonist- or antagonist-occupied GnRH receptors in intact cell cultures, using a radioligand receptor assay. Specific binding of [125I-Tyr5,D-Ser(tBu)6,Pro9,NHEt]GnRH (Buserelin), a high-affinity GnRH agonist, was increased to 180% of control in the presence of 150 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or 100 nM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB), and to 125% of control in the presence of 200 microM 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, after 20 min at 23 degrees C. The PMA effects were associated with apparent increases in both binding affinity and number of binding sites. The effects of protein kinase C activators on Buserelin binding were concentration- and time-dependent and were not seen with 4 alpha-PMA or 1,2-dioctanoyl-3-Cl-glycerol, neither of which activate protein kinase C. In contrast, PMA had no measurable effects on specific binding of a GnRH receptor antagonist, Ac[D-pCl-Phe1,2,D-Trp3,125I-Tyr5,D-Lys6,D-Ala10]GnRH. When cell cultures were pretreated with 100 nM PDB in the absence of GnRH and then washed to remove the phorbol ester, no effects of prior protein kinase C activation were detected upon subsequent addition of Buserelin. However, when PDB pretreatment was carried out in the presence of 0.3 microM GnRH, residual enhancement of Buserelin binding, but not antagonist binding, was observed at either 23 or 4 degrees C. The radiolabeled agonist activated, and the antagonist blocked, GnRH receptor-mediated luteinizing hormone release and [3H]inositol phosphate production in cells preloaded with [3H]inositol. These findings suggest that the action of protein kinase C on the GnRH receptor, either direct or indirect, requires the receptor to be in an activated (agonist-occupied) state but does not require receptor internalization. The mechanism of these effects on GnRH agonist binding is not known but may involve sequestration of surface receptors, expression of new receptors, and/or modulation of GnRH receptor affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1679474380,"Recently we have identified a novel choline and ethanolamine specific phospholipase C in myocardium and have hypothesized that this enzyme is responsible for the introduction of the vinyl ether linkage into plasmenylcholine by shuttling 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol fragments from plasmenylethanolamine to plasmenylcholine (Wolf, R. A., and Gross, R. W. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7295-7303). The present study demonstrates that rabbit myocardium contains endogenous 1-O-hexadec-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol (0.46 micrograms/g) and that these moieties are selectively utilized by myocardial choline phosphotransferase to generate plasmenylcholine. The apparent Michaelis constant of CDP-choline for microsomal choline phosphotransferase was 9 microM with a corresponding Vmax of 18 pmol/mg.min utilizing endogenous 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol as substrate. The flux of CDP-choline into plasmenylcholine or phosphatidylcholine was similar despite the fact that the mass of endogenous 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol was over 20 times the mass of endogenous 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol. Augmentation of endogenous 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol content by pretreatment of myocardial microsomes with exogenous phospholipase C resulted in an 8-fold increase in plasmenylcholine synthesis. The results suggest that myocardial plasmenylcholine biosynthesis occurs by polar head group remodeling utilizing endogenous 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol as a synthetic intermediate. Flux through this pathway is likely regulated by physiologic increments in endogenous 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol content and cytosolic CDP-choline concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1482337459,"Inhibition of muscle force development by acidic pH is a well known phenomenon, yet the exact mechanism by which a decrease in pH inhibits the Ca2+-activated force in striated myofilaments remains poorly understood. Whether or not the deactivation by acidic pH involves direct competition between Ca2+ and protons for regulatory binding sites on fast skeletal troponin C (TnC) or whether other proteins in thin filament regulation are important remains unclear. We measured the effects of acidic pH on Ca2+-dependent fluorescent changes in TnC labeled with the probe danzylaziridine (Danz), which reports Ca2+ binding to the regulatory (Ca2+-specific) sites. Measurements were also made with TnCDanz complexed with the inhibitory Tn unit, TnI, and in the whole Tn complex. Our results show that a drop in pH from 7.0 to 6.5 is associated with a 1.6-fold increase in the midpoint for the relation between free Ca2+ and Ca2+ binding to the regulatory sites on TnCDanz. However, when TnCDanz was present in its complex with either TnI alone or with TnI-TnT, the increase in midpoint free Ca2+ was increased by 3.5-fold. We tested whether this potentiation in the effect of acidic pH on Ca2+ binding to TnC is due to a pH-induced alteration in the binding of TnI to TnC. A decrease in pH from 7.0 to 6.5 was associated with a halving of the affinity of TnI for TnC. We also probed the effect of acidic pH on TnI. This was done (i) by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues in TnI alone and (ii) by measuring fluorescence of TnI (in the Tn complex) labeled at Cys-133 with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. A drop in pH from 7.0 to 6.5 was associated with a 15% decrease in intrinsic fluorescence and with a 30% decrease in the fluorescence of the 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein probe. We conclude, therefore, that while protons and Ca2+ may directly affect Ca2+ binding to regulatory sites on fast skeletal TnC, the effect of acidic pH on TnC Ca2+ binding is amplified in the TnI-TnC and Tn complexes by a pH-related effect on the affinity of TnI for TnC."
https://openalex.org/W1542472162,"A novel peptide, levitide, less than Glu-Gly-Met-Ile-Gly-Thr-Leu-Thr-Ser-Lys-Arg-Ile-Lys-Gln-NH2 has been isolated from skin secretions of the South African frog Xenopus laevis and sequenced by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Synthetic oligonucleotides were used as probes to screen a X. laevis skin cDNA library for species coding for preprolevitide. Two such clones were detected and their sequences are reported here. Preprolevitide is 88 residues long, exhibits a putative signal sequence at the amino terminus, and contains the levitide peptide at the carboxyl terminus. The levitide precursor shows a striking nucleotide and amino acid (86%) sequence homology with the precursor of xenopsin, a biologically active octapeptide from Xenopus skin, and also encodes a 25-residue amphipathic peptide that is released by processing at a single arginine residue."

(1979) Genetics 93, 539-555) has a defect leading to gross deficiency of mitochondrial small ribosomal subunits. Here, we have cloned the cyt-21+ gene from a N. crassa genomic library, using the sib selection procedure (Akins, R. A., and Lambowitz, A. M. (1985) Mol. Cell Biol. 5, 2272-2278). The genomic clone contains a short split gene encoding a basic protein of 107 amino acid residues. This protein shows strong homology to Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S-16. Comparison of mutant and wild-type mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (Kuiper, M. T. R., Holtrop, M., Vennema, H., Lambowitz, A. M., and de Vries, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2848-2852) indicates that the cyt-21 gene encodes N. crassa mitochondrial ribosomal protein S-24. The expression of the cyt-21+ gene is regulated such that the level of the putative cyt-21+ mRNA is increased about 5-fold when mitochondrial protein synthesis is inhibited. We suggest that this reflects part of a general mechanism for coordinately activating Neurospora nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial constituents in response to impaired mitochondrial function. This is the first report of the cloning and characterization of a mitochondrial ribosomal protein gene from N. crassa."

https://openalex.org/W1646430880,"In order to determine whether the human insulin receptor ectodomain can be expressed as a functional protein, the coding regions for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of a full-length human insulin receptor cDNA were deleted by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resultant construct was inserted into a bovine papilloma virus vector under the control of the mouse metallothionein promoter. After transfection of mouse NIH3T3 cells, a cell line secreting an insulin binding protein was isolated. The insulin binding alpha subunit had an Mr of 138,000 and a beta subunit of Mr 48,000 (compared to 147,000 and 105,000 for the full-length human insulin receptor expressed in NIH3T3 cells). This difference in size of the alpha subunit was due to a difference in glycosylation as N-glycanase digestion reduced the apparent size of the alpha subunits of secreted and normal membrane-bound receptors to identical values. The secreted receptor formed disulfide-linked heterotetrameric structures with an Mr of 280,000. It was synthesized as an Mr 160,000 precursor which was cleaved into mature subunits with a t1/2 of 3 h. Increasing expression of the cDNA by induction with sodium butyrate lead to the appearance of an Mr 180,000 protein in the medium as well as the mature alpha and beta subunits. A Scatchard plot of insulin binding to the secreted receptor was curvilinear with a Kd of 7 X 10(-10) M for the high affinity sites and 10(-7) M for the low affinity site (compared to Kd values of 1.1 X 10(-9) M and 10(-7) M, respectively, for human insulin receptors expressed in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1491548923,"The rat liver microsomal vitamin K-dependent carboxylase catalyzes the carboxylation of peptide-bound glutamyl residues to gamma-carboxyglutamyl (Gla) residues with the concomitant formation of vitamin K 2,3-epoxide (KO). These studies have demonstrated that the half-reaction, formation of KO, occurs in the absence of carboxylation at low glutamyl substrate concentration but that the ratio of KO/Gla approaches unity as the glutamyl substrate concentration is increased. Utilization of the carboxylase substrate Phe-Leu-[gamma-3H] Glu-Glu-Leu has demonstrated that the ratios of KO/gamma-C-H bonds cleaved and Gla/gamma-C-H bonds cleaved are equivalent at high substrate concentrations and that these ratios approach unity. At low substrate concentrations, KO formation occurs at a higher rate than gamma-H bond cleavage. These data are consistent with a mechanism involving the formation of an oxygenated intermediate from vitamin KH2 and O2 that is converted to KO during hydrogen abstraction from the gamma-position of the Glu substrate. In the absence of a Glu substrate, the intermediate is converted to KO by a mechanism not coupled to glutamyl activation."

Single dnaA sites from oriC and from the mioC and dnaA gene promoters were active when combined with the primer generating element of pBR322 in a proper distance. Prereplisome assembly did not require sequences in addition to the 9-base pair consensus dnaA binding site. Inversion of the structurally asymmetric dnaA site relative to its orientation in wild type pBR322 resulted in a marked reduction in replication efficiency, as observed with five different dnaA sites studied. The direction of DNA replication was not affected."

https://openalex.org/W1539228723,"We showed previously that the cyt-21+ gene of Neurospora crassa encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein homologous to Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S-16 (Kuiper, M. T. R., Akins, R. A., Holtrop, M., de Vries, H., and Lambowitz, A. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2840-2847). A mutation in this gene, cyt-21-1, results in deficiency of mitochondrial small ribosomal subunits and small rRNA (Collins, R. A., Bertrand, H., LaPolla, R. J., and Lambowitz, A. M. (1979) Mol. Gen. Genet. 177, 73-84). In the present work, cloning and sequencing of the cyt-21-1 mutant allele show that it contains a single dG to dA transition at the 3' splice site AG of the first intron in the protein coding region. This mutation leads to inactivation of the normal 3' splice site and activation of a cryptic 3' splice site, 15 nucleotides downstream. The use of this cryptic splice site results in an in-frame deletion of 5 amino acids from the cyt-21 protein. Comparison of mutant and wild-type mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit proteins showed one protein, S-24, with an altered electrophoretic mobility, consistent with the predicted deletion. The mutant ribosomal protein is still capable of binding to mitochondrial small ribosomal subunits, but results in abnormal mitochondrial ribosome assembly."
