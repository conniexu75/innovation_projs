https://openalex.org/W2170530621,"Several physical effects allow free floatation of solid and even liquid matter. Materials may be levitated by a jet of gas, by intense sound waves, or by beams of laser light. In addition, conductors levitate in strong radio-frequency fields, charged particles in alternating electric fields, and magnets above superconductors or vice versa. Although levitation by means of ferromagnets is unstable, supper-conductors may be suspended both above and below a magnet as a result of flux pinning. Levitation is used for containerless processing and investigation of materials, for frictionless bearings and high-speed ground transportation, for spectroscopy of single atoms and microparticles, and for demonstrating superconductivity in the new oxide superconductors."
https://openalex.org/W1990103649,"Ice VI, a high-pressure form of density 1.31 g cm-(3), has a tetragonal cell of dimensions a = 6.27 A, c = 5.79 A, space group P4(2)/nmc, each cell containing ten water molecules. The structure is built up of hydrogen-bonded chdins of water molecules that are analogs of the tectosilicate chains out of which the fibrous zeolites are constructed. The chains in ice VI are linked laterally to one another to form an open, zeolite-like framework. The cavities in this framework are filled with a second framework identical with the first. The two frameworks interpenetrate but do not interconnect, and the complete structure can thus be considered a ""self-clathrate."" This structural feature is a natural way to achieve high density in tetrahedrally linked framework structures."
https://openalex.org/W2026408144,"New estimates of solar composition, compared to earlier measurements, are enriched in Fe and Ca relative to Mg, Al, and Si. The Fe/Si and Ca/Al atomic ratios are 30 to 40 percent higher than chondritic values. These changes necessitate a revision in the cosmic abundances and in the composition of the nebula from which the planets accreted (which have been based on chondritic values). These new values imply that the mantle could contain about 15 weight percent FeO and more CaMgSi(2)O(6) than has been supposed. Geophysical data are consistent with a dense, FeO-rich lower mantle and a CaMgSi(2)O(6) (diopside)-rich transition region. FeO contents of 13 to 18 weight percent appear to be typical of the mantles of bodies in the inner solar system. The oldest komatiites (high-temperature MgO-rich magmas) have a similar chemistry to the derived mantle. These results favor a chemically zoned mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2000949064,"Infrared scanning during a total eclipse has revealed hundreds of hot spots, many identified with craters smaller than the detector resolution. Areal corrections show that some of these features may have the thermal properties of bare rock. Correlation of thermal response with albedo and radar reflectivity shows discrepancies. There is a concentration of hot spots in Mare Tranquillitatis."

https://openalex.org/W2002554888,"The phases of x-ray reflection of a crystal can be measured, except for an ambiguity, if the crystal contains heavy atoms which scatter x-rays anomalously. Theoretical studies show that the method of resolving this ambiguity by choosing the phases closer to those of the heavy atoms has a good potentiality for solving complicated structures, in which the average heavy atom contribution to the intensity is as low as 10 percent."
