https://openalex.org/W2170701060,"Firefly females of the genus Photuris, long known to be carnivorous, attract and devour males of the genus Photinus by mimicking the flash-responses of Photinus females. Although suspected, this behavior had not been observed previously."
https://openalex.org/W2009495391,The 22 photographs of Mars taken by Mariner IV have been successfully received on earth. The Martian surface photographed is rather densely populated with impact craters whose sizes range up to at least 120 kilometers in diameter. We infer that the visible Martian surface is extremely old and that neither a dense atmosphere nor oceans have been present on the planet since the cratered surface was formed.
https://openalex.org/W2011644684,"Abstract : The basic physical effects used in field ion microscopy are not yet fully understood. Field evaporation rates of tungsten were measured in the range from 0.01 to 10,000,000 atomic layers/sec, yielding the polarizability of a kink site surface atom, the activation energy and the pre-exponential of the field evaporation equation. Using the polarizability, the dipole-dipole binding energy of field-adsorbed noble gases ahs been calculated, and a modified mechanism of field ionization and image interpretation is proposed. A high-voltage field ion microscope has been operated at up to 45 kV, giving an increased field of view."
https://openalex.org/W2067475202,A transient species with properties similar to the hydrated electron produced previously by electron irradiation has been observed by flash photolysis of aqueous solutions of inorganic salts and aromatic compounds including amino acids.
https://openalex.org/W2050346299,"A strain of dengue type 2 virus has been isolated from Aedes albopictus collected in Singapore. This is the first report of a natural isolation of dengue virus from this species, which has long been suspected as a vector in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2073456226,"Mice responded differentially to increases in population size, depending on their prior experience. Compared to animals grouped prior to an increase in population size, animals housed as isolates responded to grouping with more fighting, a greater diminuation of testis weight, and a higher level of locomotor activity. They also had lower testis weight and higher locomotor activity than individually housed, nongrouped controls."
https://openalex.org/W2040543484,"Mild heat treatment of water-wet marine muds resulted in the genesis of three aromatic hydrocarbons characteristic of crude oils, but which are seldom found in significant quantities in recent sediments. Whereas part of the toluene and xylenes may have stemmed from carotenoid pigments, the source of the benzene as well as the larger amount of the toluene and xylene is as yet unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1997506213,X-ray diffraction measurements of the d(001) spacing and the infrared absorption spectra of hydrogen-saturated micas show that an ion of approximately the same size and properties as hydronium is present and gives a unique absorption band at about 3470 cm-1.
https://openalex.org/W2012408824,"The crystal structure of tetrahedrite, proposed in 1934 by Pauling and Neuman, has been confirmed. Least-squares refinement reduced the initial disagreement factor from 27.9 to 4.9 percent. Antimony displays three short orthogonal bonds to sulfur atoms. Two types of copper are tetrahedrally and triangularly coordinated by sulfur, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2071530584,"In deep lakes that are near the temperature of maximum density, stability is greatest when the decrease of temperature with depth is about one-half of the decrease in temperature of maximum density with depth. Observed temperature decreases in lakes under such conditions tend to follow the curve that produces greatest stability."

https://openalex.org/W1969150175,"When rocks melt under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions, their alkali components volatilize as metals. These metal vapors act to comminute polycrystalline rocks to their component minerals. The resultant powder is porous and loosely packed and its characteristics may be compatible with the lunar surface as revealed by the Ranger photographs. If meteorite impact or lunar volcanism has produced vaporization or areas of molten lava, alkali erosion may have given dust of this character in adjacent solid areas."
https://openalex.org/W2070261415,Separate sedimentary populations are not all characterized by lognormal size distributions. Populations of different sizes of material are produced by different mechanisms of abrasion: pebbles and gravel by single-stage crushing; sand by repeated abrasion; and silt and clay by chipping from larger grains. Each mechanism imposes a different size distribution on the product.

https://openalex.org/W2029891158,Optical detection of the West Ford orbiting dipole belt was accomplished on at least four occasions during the second week in May 1963. The maximum surface brightness was about 4 percent of the night sky radiation at an effective wavelength of λ̅ = 4400 Å. The density of the belt has evidently decreased because it was not detected in a second observation period during the third week in June.

https://openalex.org/W2008668819,Photoelectric observations of the West Ford belt of copper dipoles covering the period from I week to I month after the launching show a feature considerably wider than the announced belt width. The present belt is not injurious to astronomical observatations from the ground but it could seriously aflect observations made from low-orbiting satellite systems. Much stronger belts would seriously interfere with astronomical observations.

https://openalex.org/W2040783771,Certain carbohydrates cause changes in the absorption spectrum of cytochrome c; these changes are the same as those accompanying conversion from the oxidized to the reduced form. Various carbohydrates are compared by measuring changes in absorbance at a characteristic wavelength.

https://openalex.org/W2059386700,"The sixth annual air pollution medical research conference was sponsored by the California State Department of Public Health, and was held in San Francisco during January 1963. Participants were scientists involved in research on air pollution and officials who are concerned with air pollution control and public health. The main topics of the meetings were: trends in air pollution and its effects; the body burden of pollutants; and laboratory and epidemiological relationships of respiratory disease and pollutant exposures."

The main contributions to the emission in the 5- to 21-micron range came from ozone and carbon dioxide, with water vapor playing a minor part."
