https://openalex.org/W2143729842,"Severe combined immunodeficiency–X1 (SCID-X1) is an X-linked inherited disorder characterized by an early block in T and natural killer (NK) lymphocyte differentiation. This block is caused by mutations of the gene encoding the γc cytokine receptor subunit of interleukin-2, -4, -7, -9, and -15 receptors, which participates in the delivery of growth, survival, and differentiation signals to early lymphoid progenitors. After preclinical studies, a gene therapy trial for SCID-X1 was initiated, based on the use of complementary DNA containing a defective γc Moloney retrovirus–derived vector and ex vivo infection of CD34 + cells. After a 10-month follow-up period, γc transgene–expressing T and NK cells were detected in two patients. T, B, and NK cell counts and function, including antigen-specific responses, were comparable to those of age-matched controls. Thus, gene therapy was able to provide full correction of disease phenotype and, hence, clinical benefit."

We confirmed control of the pulse-to-pulse carrier-envelope phase using temporal cross correlation. This phase stabilization locks the absolute frequencies emitted by the laser, which we used to perform absolute optical frequency measurements that were directly referenced to a stable microwave clock."

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) of the new class, named Omega, exist in several mammalian species andCaenorhabditis elegans. In humans, GSTO 1-1 is expressed in most tissues and exhibits glutathione-dependent thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities characteristic of the glutaredoxins. The structure of GSTO 1-1 has been determined at 2.0-Å resolution and has a characteristic GST fold (Protein Data Bank entry code 1eem). The Omega class GSTs exhibit an unusual N-terminal extension that abuts the C terminus to form a novel structural unit. Unlike other mammalian GSTs, GSTO 1-1 appears to have an active site cysteine that can form a disulfide bond with glutathione.

These include chemical carcinogens, therapeutic drugs, and products of oxidative stress (1Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). GST expression levels and the factors modulating them can have significant biological and clinical implications. Overexpression of some GSTs is implicated in resistance to several anti-cancer drugs (1Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). In contrast, genetically determined GST deficiencies are risk factors for cataract and several forms of cancer (1Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar, 2Sekine Y. Hommura S. Harada S. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 60: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and homozygosity for the GSTM 1 nullallele is a positive prognostic indicator for successful chemotherapy and long term survival in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (3Hall A.G. Autzen P. Cattan A.R. Malcolm A.J. Cole M. Kernahan J. Reid M.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5251-5254PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic polymorphisms influencing the substrate specificity of GSTP 1–1 (4Zimniak P. Nanduri B. Pikula S. Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Singhal S.S. Srivastava S.K. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) are risk factors for Parkinson's disease in subjects exposed to pesticides (5Menegon A. Board P.G. Blackburn A.C. Mellick G.D. Le Couteur D.G. Lancet. 1998; 352: 1344-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) Based on their sequences, the mammalian cytosolic GSTs form six evolutionarily distinct classes termed Alpha, Mu, Pi, Sigma, Theta, and Zeta (1Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar, 6Board P.G. Baker R.T. Chelvanayagam G. Jermiin L.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). There may also be additional classes in plants, insects, and other species (6Board P.G. Baker R.T. Chelvanayagam G. Jermiin L.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Although some members of the different GST classes exhibit overlapping substrate specificities, others are highly specific. Despite the diversity of substrates metabolized by this large family, many GSTs were originally identified through their activity with the xenobiotic 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and their ability to bind to glutathione affinity matrices. To identify new members of the glutathione transferase gene family on the basis of sequence similarity rather than substrate specificity, we have searched a data base containing sequences of more than 106 human expressed sequence tags. This analysis has led to identification of the class Omega glutathione transferases, a group of GSTs with novel structural and functional characteristics. We have identified a human cDNA, expressed and characterized the recombinant protein, and determined its crystal structure to 2.0-Å resolution. Recombinant human Omega class GST (GSTO 1-1) exhibits a glutathione-dependent thiol transferase activity and catalyzes glutathione-dependent reduction of dehydroascorbate. These activities are not associated with other human GSTs but are characteristic of the glutaredoxins (7Washburn M.P. Wells W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Omega class GSTs have a unique N-terminal extension, and the crystal structure reveals an active site cysteine residue distinct from the tyrosine and serine residues characteristic of other eukaryotic GSTs (8Board P.G. Coggan M. Wilce M.C. Parker M.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Stenberg G. Board P.G. Mannervik B.

The human EST data base was searched using the tBLASTn version of the BLAST program (11Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) with human Theta and Zeta class amino acid sequences as query sequences. An EST (GenBank™ accession number W38456) encoding an unknown protein with low similarity to both Theta and Zeta class GSTs was identified, and the cDNA clone was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium. The complete cDNA sequence was obtained on each strand by subcloning restriction fragments and by the use of a Thermo sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA sequence has been submitted to GenBank™ as accession numberAF212303. Although a large number of GSTs and related protein sequences are available, to simplify computations and to promote legibility, representative GST and GST-like amino acid sequences were selected from previously described GST classes and related proteins. The sequences were obtained from GenBank™ and aligned using CLUSTAL W (12Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) and GDE (13Smith S.W. Overbeek R. Woese C.R. Gilbert W. Gillevet P.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 671-675PubMed Google Scholar). The revised alignment, which agrees with predictions based on molecular modeling and crystal structure, is available from Dr. P. Board at the John Curtin School of Medical Research web site. A phylogenetic tree was obtained by maximum likelihood analysis of all the sites in the above-mentioned alignment. The data was analyzed using the JTT-F substitution model (14Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar), and local bootstrap probabilities were estimated for the internal branches using the PROTML program (15Adachi J. Hasegawa M. MOLPHY Version 2.3. The Institute of Mathematical Statistics, Tokyo1996Google Scholar). The phylogenetic analysis involved two examinations of the sequence alignment with different input order of the sequences. Each analysis involved two steps: stepwise addition and nearest neighbor interchanges. The most likely tree was compared with the remaining trees using the test of Kishino and Hasegawa (16Kishino H. Hasegawa M. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2851) Google Scholar). Recombinant GSTO 1-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by two separate methods using either the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and glutathione affinity chromatography or the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) and nickel agarose affinity chromatography. Specifically, the GSTO1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (sense primer 5′-AGGATCCACGATGTCCGGGGAGTCAG-3′, antisense primer 5′-CGAATTCAGAGCCCATAGTCACAG-3′) and cloned between theBamHI and EcoRI sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and transformed into BL21 [DE3] cells (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI). Briefly, a seed culture of the transformed cells was grown to A 600 of 0.4–0.6, scaled up, and grown again to the same density, induced with IPTG (50 μm), and grown for a further 2 h at 37 °C. The GST fusion protein product was purified from the soluble fraction of a cell lysate and cleaved with thrombin. GSTO 1-1 was isolated by further chromatography using anion exchange. 2Further details are available from Dr. Philip Board at the John Curtin School of Medical Research web site. Recombinant GSTO 1-1 was also expressed with an N-terminal 6×His tag from the plasmid pQE30 and purified on nickel agarose largely as described for the preparation of recombinant mouse GSTT 1-1 (17Whittington A. Vichai V. Webb G. Baker R. Pearson W. Board P. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The enzyme was eluted in 500 mm imidazole, 50 mmsodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and was essentially pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl, 60 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.0, before storage at −80 °C. For crystallography by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method, GSTO 1-1 was expressed as a SeMet-substituted protein. pGEX-2T with the GSTO 1-1 insert was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli B834 (Novagen), and the resulting cells were grown in the presence of 100 mg/liter d,l-selenomethionine (Bachem) essentially as described previously (18Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar).2 Purified GSTO 1-1 was exchanged into fresh 0.025 m Tris-HCl, 0.06 m NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and brought to 20–25 mg/ml in Centricon units (Millipore, Bedford, MA). When the intent was to crystallize the covalent glutathione adduct of GSTO 1-1, dithiothreitol was used at 1 mm, and GSH:GSSG (5:1) was added to 2 mm. Screening by hanging drop/vapor diffusion using Crystal Screen I (Hampton Research, Laguna Hills, CA) identified a condition (#47) requiring minimal optimization. Both glutathione-complexed and glutathione-free crystals grew in drops containing 8–12 mg/ml protein with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 1.0–1.2m (NH4)2SO4. Size exclusion chromatography was conducted on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline and run at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Standards (Sigma) included bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), bovine carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), horse cytochrome c(12.4 kDa), and bovine aprotinin (6.5 kDa). Sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed using a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. Sample concentrations of 0.11, 0.17, and 0.34 mg/ml in charcoal epon cells were centrifuged at rotor speeds of 18,000, 25,000, and 31,000. Samples were referenced to the dialysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Data were analyzed using the program NONLIN (University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT). Enzymatic activity with a range of substrates (Table I) was determined as described (6Board P.G. Baker R.T. Chelvanayagam G. Jermiin L.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 17Whittington A. Vichai V. Webb G. Baker R. Pearson W. Board P. Biochem.

Thiol transferase activity was measured with hydroxyethyl disulfide as a substrate (20Axelsson K. Eriksson S. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase activity was determined spectrophotometrically with dehydroascorbate prepared immediately before use (21Wells W.W. Xu D.P. Washburn M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase assays, the purified enzyme was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, to remove dithiothreitol.Table IActivity of recombinant GST0 1-1 with various substratesSpecific activityμmol/min/mg1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene0.18 ± 0.0061,2-DichloronitrobenzeneND7-Chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole0.05 ± 0.0041,2-Epoxy-3-(4-nitrophenoxy) propaneND4-Phenyl-but-3-en-2-oneNDEthacrynic acidNDp-Nitrobenzyl chlorideNDp-Nitrophenyl acetate0.06 ± 0.012Menaphthyl sulfateNDDichloromethaneNDDichloroacetic acidNDt-Butyl hydroperoxideNDCumene hydroperoxideNDtrans,trans-Nona-2,4-dienalNDtrans,trans-Deca-2,4-dienalNDtrans-HexenalNDtrans-Octenal0.03 ± 0.006trans-Nonenal0.03 ± 0.003Dehydroascorbate reductase0.16 ± 0.005Thiol transferase2.92 ± 0.120All values are the mean ± S.D. of between 3 and 6 determinations.

Northern blots containing mRNA from multiple human tissues obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized with32P-labeled GSTO 1-1 cDNA in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at 68 °C and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The filters were subsequently hybridized with a labeled β-actin cDNA probe to evaluate track loading. Western blots were developed with a 1:400 dilution of rabbit antiserum raised against His-tagged recombinant GSTO 1-1, and goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma) (22Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The primary antiserum does not cross-react with native GSTs from the other classes; however, we have noted some cross-reactivity with recombinant proteins expressed with the poly-His tag. Multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected from crystals of SeMet-substituted apo-GSTO 1-1 on Beam Line X12-C of the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Brookhaven, New York. Before data collection at 100 K, crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution of 2.0m Li2SO4 and 5% glycerol. The Se-absorption edge was determined by a fluorescence scan, and three wavelengths were selected for data collection corresponding to the peak (maximum f ′, λ = 0.9795 Å), the inflection point (minimum f ′, λ = 0.9802 Å), and a high energy wavelength remote from the edge (λ = 0.9500 Å). Inverse beam geometry was employed, and data were collected in two 75° sweeps in 0.5° oscillation steps for each wavelength, using a Brandeis charge-coupled device detector. All data were indexed, measured, and scaled with the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and then processed with the CCP4 package (24Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Data on native (i.e. not SeMet-substituted) crystals with and without glutathione covalently bound were collected on a Rigaku Raxis II image plate detector using copper-Kα x-rays from a Rigaku RU-200 generator equipped with Molecular Structure Corp. focusing mirrors.

Open table in a new tab Four of the seven expected selenium sites were found in anomalous difference Patterson maps calculated at the peak anomalous wavelength using the program PATSOL (25Tong L. Rossmann M.G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 15-21Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and initial phases were calculated with SHARP (26De La Fontelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Examination of log-likelihood gradient maps revealed two more selenium sites. The last remaining selenium site corresponding to methionine near the N terminus (the fourth amino acid residue of the recombinant protein) was disordered and was not placed. Phase calculation in SHARP using the six located sites gave phases with an excellent overall figure of merit (Table II). 2.1 Å resolution maps calculated after density modification by histogram matching and solvent flipping in SOLOMON (27Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) were used for model building (Fig.1). The initial model was built using the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The high quality of the initial experimental electron density map and known selenium sites allowed unambiguous tracing for all of the protein backbone and side chains except for the first seven amino acids. The first three (Gly-Ser-Thr) were a legacy of the recombinant construct. The protein model was refined against 2.0-Å data collected from native (non SeMet) crystals of the GSTO 1-1 complex with GSH. Refinement was carried out using conjugate-gradient least squares and simulated-annealing protocols in X-PLOR 3.851 (29Brugner A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1996Google Scholar) and monitored with the R free value using a 5% randomly selected test set. A model for GSH covalently bound to Cys-32 as well as chemically reasonable water molecules and sulfate ions was built into ςA-weighted 2F o − F c maps (30Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The final model contained 110 water molecules, 2 sulfate ions, disulfide-linked GSH, and the entire polypeptide minus the first seven residues.

Baker R.T. Chelvanayagam G. Jermiin L.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) revealed clones with around 40% sequence identity with the residues between positions 19 and 77 of GSTZ1. Preliminary alignments suggested these were distinct from previously described human GSTs, and a representative EST clone (GenBank™ accession number W38456) was selected for further characterization. Subsequent studies revealed that this cDNA encoded a protein belonging to a distinct new class within the GST family. This class has been named Omega in accordance with established guidelines (31Mannervik B. Awasthi Y.C. Board P.G. Hayes J.D. Di Ilio C. Ketterer B. Listowsky I. Morgenstern R. Muramatsu M. Pearson W.R. Pickett C.B. Sato K. Widersten M. Wolf C.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 305-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Sequencing of both strands of the cDNA contained in the EST cloneW38456, which we termed pGSTO 1, revealed 26 base pairs of 5′ non-coding sequence, 723 base pairs of coding sequence, and 51 base pairs of 3′ non-coding sequence (Fig. 2). The cDNA encodes a peptide of 241 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 27,566 Da. A similar cDNA sequence encoding the same peptide has been submitted to GenBank™ by others with accession number U90313. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence with representative sequences from previously described GST classes and GST-like proteins2 highlights the similarities and significant differences between GSTO 1-1 and the previously defined classes. Although we first identified GSTO 1-1 as a human EST, searches of additional data bases have identified highly similar sequences in the mouse (U80819), rat (AB008807), and a nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) (P34345). These have 72, 76, and 34% sequence identity respectively. A pig EST (F14520) also shows sufficient similarity over its incomplete sequence to be placed in the Omega class. The sequence alignment was used to generate a phylogenetic tree using the maximum-likelihood approach. The tree in Fig.3 is the most likely tree; another five locally optimal trees were identified, none differing significantly from the most likely tree. The tree in Fig. 3 clearly groups human Omega with the homologous sequences from the mouse, rat, and nematode in a distinct cluster, supporting the designation of this group as the Omega class. The alignment and tree also show that the Zeta class is the most similar of the previously defined classes and that the well characterized GST classes are all supported by local bootstrap probabilities ranging from 90 to 100%. Several sequences not yet clearly characterized as GSTs (i.e. soybean heat-shock protein, yeast membrane protein, and E. coli stringent starvation protein) were included in the alignment because they appear to be members of the GST structural family. The phylogenetic relationships of these sequences are uncertain, but there is an indication that the potato GST and soybean heat-shock protein are part of the Omega class. A notable feature of the human, mouse, pig, and nematode Omega GSTs is a 19–20-residue N-terminal extension not found in any previously described GST. This was not noted in the homologous rat sequence reported as a glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase (32Ishikawa T. Casini A.F. Nishikimi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28708-28712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but translation with a reading frame adjustment of the rat sequence upstream of the reported translation-initiating ATG codon reveals an N-terminal sequence similar to that in the other species. Additional rat cDNAs need to be sequenced to determine if there is a species difference or if there is a cloning artifact in the clone reported by Ishikawa et al. (32Ishikawa T. Casini A.F. Nishikimi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28708-28712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Northern blots of RNA from a range of human tissues showed a single hybridizing species of approximately 0.8 kilobases (Fig. 4). The level of hybridization indicates that GSTO 1 mRNA is expressed in all tissues tested, with the greatest expression in liver, skeletal muscle, and heart and relatively low levels in brain, placenta, and lung. The level of expression in skeletal muscle and heart is difficult to judge accurately because the loading control hybridization with a β-actin probe shows strong hybridization to an extra 1.8-kilobase band that tends to obscure the 2-kilobase β-actin band found in all tissues. A survey of the EST data base has confirmed that GSTO 1 is expressed in a wide range of human tissues including aorta, bone, brain, breast, central nervous system, colon, esophagus, foreskin, germ cell, heart, kidney, lung, lymph, muscle, ovary, pancreas, parathyroid, placenta, prostate, spleen, stomach, testis, uterus, and whole embryo. The broad range of expression of GSTO 1 contrasts with many other GSTs that show distinct tissue-specific expression and suggests that it plays a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. A Western blot of cytosolic extracts from human liver and Jurkat cells revealed a single cross-reacting protein with an apparent mass of 31 kDa (not shown), co-migrating with purified recombinant GSTO 1. As the deduced amino acid sequence predicts a mass of 27.5 kDa, GSTO 1 migrates anomalously in reducing SDS-PAGE. Size exclusion chromatography of recombinant GSTO 1 on a calibrated Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column estimated its mass as 56 kDa, indicating that GSTO 1 forms a dimer (GSTO 1-1) under native conditions. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at protein concentrations of 0.11, 0.17, and 0.34 mg/ml. For the two higher concentrations, NONLIN analysis yielded good fits to molecular masses of 54,545 Da (0.34 mg/ml) and 54,145 Da (0.17 mg/ml), each indicating a dimer. The data collected at 0.11 mg/ml displayed evidence of some non-ideality and fit better to a model taking account of some non-equilibrium behavior (90% dimer and 10% incompetent monomer). More extensive studies would be needed to confirm this observation and extend it into a lower concentration range. To test recombinant GSTO 1-1 for GST-like activities, assays were performed with compounds that are substrates for GSTs of other classes. Also, as the homologous rat sequence was reported to encode a glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase (32Ishikawa T. Casini A.F. Nishikimi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28708-28712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), that activity and glutathione-dependent thiol transferase activity were determined. GSTO 1-1 has little activity with most GST substrates (Table I). There was low but detectable activity with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, which is generally a good substrate for members of the Alpha, Mu, and Pi classes. Similarly, there was low but measurable activity with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl) trans-octenal and trans-nonenal, substrates utilized preferentially by Alpha class GSTs (22Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase activity was detected in preparations of recombinant human GSTO 1-1. This has been reported in a number of tissues from several species (33Paolicchi A. Pezzini A. Saviozzi M. Piaggi S. Andreuccetti M. Chieli E. Malvaldi G. Casini A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and, in most cases, attributed to glutaredoxin (also termed thiol transferase). Consequently, the thiol transferase activity of the recombinant enzyme was determined and found to be the highest of all the activities investigated (Table I) Similar results were obtained with GSTO 1-1 prepared from a GST fusion or with an N-terminal His tag. Thus the Omega class GSTs have activities similar to those of the glutaredoxins. Similarities in the protein fold of the glutaredoxins and the N-terminal domain of the cytosolic GSTs have been noted (34Sinning I. Kleywegt G.J. Cowan S.W. Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Huber R. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Ji X. Board P.G. Olin B. Mannervik B. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and low thiol transferase activity (74.3 nmol/mg/min) has been attributed to a Mu class GST from bovine lens (35Dal Monte M. Cecconi I. Buono F. Vilardo P.G. Del Corso A. Mura U. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In other unpublished studies we examined the thiol transferase activity of a range of GSTs from the Alpha, Mu, Pi, Theta, and Zeta classes (GSTA 1-1, GST 2-2, GSTA 4-4, GSTM 1-1, GSTM 2-2, GSTM 3-3, GSTM 4-4, GSTP 1-1, GSTT 2-2, GSTT 1-1, GST Z 1-1). With the exception of GSTM2-2, which had low activity, all were essentially inactive. It is therefore clear that the glutaredoxin-like activities of GSTO 1-1 are not a common feature of other cytosolic GSTs despite similarities in their structure. The structure of a covalent comple"

Polarized femtosecond spectroscopies show that excitations migrate unidirectionally from aggregated, randomly oriented polymer segments outside the pores to isolated, aligned polymer chains within the pores. Energy migration along the conjugated polymer backbone occurred more slowly than Forster energy transfer between polymer chains. The different intrachain and interchain energy transfer time scales explain the behavior of conjugated polymers in a range of solution environments.

All 10 subunits exhibit a high degree of identity with the corresponding human proteins, and 9 of the 10 subunits are conserved among the three eukaryotic RNA polymerases I, II, and III. Notable features of the model include a pair of jaws, formed by subunits Rpb1, Rpb5, and Rpb9, that appear to grip DNA downstream of the active center. A clamp on the DNA nearer the active center, formed by Rpb1, Rpb2, and Rpb6, may be locked in the closed position by RNA, accounting for the great stability of transcribing complexes. A pore in the protein complex beneath the active center may allow entry of substrates for polymerization and exit of the transcript during proofreading and passage through pause sites in the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1975881038,"Memories are thought to be due to lasting synaptic modifications in the brain. The search for memory traces has relied predominantly on determining regions that are necessary for the process. However, a more informative approach is to define the smallest sufficient set of brain structures. The rutabaga adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme that is ubiquitously expressed in the Drosophila brain and that mediates synaptic plasticity, is needed exclusively in the Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies for a component of olfactory short-term memory. This demonstrates that synaptic plasticity in a small brain region can be sufficient for memory formation."

https://openalex.org/W1577322643,"Photonic crystals are attracting current interest for a variety of reasons, such as their ability to inhibit the spontaneous emission of light. This and related properties arise from the formation of photonic bandgaps, whereby multiple scattering of photons by lattices of periodically varying refractive indices acts to prevent the propagation of electromagnetic waves having certain wavelengths. One route to forming photonic crystals is to etch two-dimensional periodic lattices of vertical air holes into dielectric slab waveguides. Such structures can show complete photonic bandgaps, but only for large-diameter air holes in materials of high refractive index (such as gallium arsenide, n = 3.69), which unfortunately leads to significantly reduced optical transmission when combined with optical fibres of low refractive index. It has been suggested that quasicrystalline (rather than periodic) lattices can also possess photonic bandgaps. Here we demonstrate this concept experimentally and show that it enables complete photonic bandgaps--non-directional and for any polarization--to be realized with small air holes in silicon nitride (n = 2.02), and even glass (n = 1.45). These properties make photonic quasicrystals promising for application in a range of optical devices."

Early population doubling level complementary DNA-1 (EPC-1, an age-dependent gene) expression in cells from the cloned animals was 3.5- to 5-fold higher than that in cells from age-matched (5 to 10 months old) controls.

https://openalex.org/W1543800239,"There is increasing evidence that inhomogeneous distributions of charge and spin--so-called ""striped phases""--play an important role in determining the properties of the high-temperature superconductors. For example, recent neutron-scattering measurements on the YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ family of materials show both spin and charge fluctuations that are consistent with the striped-phase picture. But the fluctuations associated with a striped phase are expected to be one-dimensional, whereas the magnetic fluctuations observed to date appear to display two-dimensional symmetry. We show here that this apparent two-dimensionality results from measurements on twinned crystals, and that similar measurements on substantially detwinned crystals of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$ reveal the one-dimensional character of the magnetic fluctuations, thus greatly strengthening the striped-phase interpretation. Moreover, our results also suggest that superconductivity originates in charge stripes that extend along the b crystal axis, where the superfluid density is found to be substantially larger than for the a direction."
https://openalex.org/W2141292442,"Neuromedin U is a bioactive peptide first isolated from porcine spinal cord. In this paper, we demonstrate that neuromedin U is the cognate ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor, FM-3, isolated originally as a homologue of neurotensin and growth hormone secretogogue receptors. Neuromedin U induced specific and evident elevation of extracellular acidification rates, arachidonic acid metabolite release, and intracellular Ca2+mobilization in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human FM-3. In addition, radiolabeled neuromedin U specifically bound to membrane fractions prepared from these cells with high affinity. We subsequently analyzed the tissue distribution of neuromedin U and FM-3 mRNAs in rats using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Neuromedin U mRNA was highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, and the highest expression was detected in the pituitary gland. On the other hand, FM-3 mRNA was highly expressed in the small intestine and lung, suggesting that neuromedin U plays important roles in these tissues.

However, most of their ligands are yet unidentified, so these are called “orphan” GPCRs. The identification of ligands for orphan GPCRs will promote better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms responsible for various physiological phenomena. We have recently established a strategy widely applicable to identify orphan GPCR ligands (1.Hinuma S. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Masuo Y. Asano T. Matsumoto H. Sekiguchi M. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Fujino M. Nature. 1998; 393: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X.

Our strategy is principally to search agonistic ligands by monitoring signal transductions in cells expressing orphan GPCRs. To detect cellular changes caused by the interaction of orphan GPCRs and their ligands, we have frequently measured extracellular acidification rates in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing orphan GPCRs (3.Hinuma S. Onda H. Fujino M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Almost all intracellular changes, including the activation of GPCRs, result in the acidification of the extracellular environment, and such extracellular acidification can be monitored by the microphysiometric assay using a Cytosensor (4.McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In the screening of various synthetic compounds, including known bioactive peptides, we found that CHO cells expressing an orphan GPCR, FM-3, were responsible to neuromedin U in the microphysiometric assay. FM-3 was first isolated from a mouse T-cell cDNA library, and subsequently its human counterpart was isolated from a genomic library through screening with a mouse cDNA probe (5.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses indicate that FM-3 shows moderate sequence identity with neurotensin (NT) and growth hormone secretogogue (GHS, ghrelin) (6.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7105) Google Scholar) receptors. However, HEK-293 cells expressing FM-3 failed to bind a GHS receptor agonist (MK-0677), NT, and some known bioactive peptides; therefore, FM-3 has remained as an orphan GPCR. On the other hand, neuromedin U-8 and U-25 were isolated as bioactive peptides originally from the porcine spinal cord on the basis of their contractile activity to rat uterine smooth muscle (7.Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8.Minamino N. Sudoh T. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Peptides. 1985; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Neuromedin U reportedly shows various biological activities, including hypertensive effects on rats in vivo (7.Minamino N.

In this report, we will demonstrate that FM-3 is a specific receptor for neuromedin U. In addition, we will show here the tissue distribution of rat neuromedin U and FM-3 mRNAs analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot analyses for human and rat FM-3 genes. The entire coding region of human FM-3 cDNA (5.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR from human brain cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and inserted into the downstream region of an SR α promoter in the expression vector pAKKO-111H (13.Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K. Tanaka H. Nagai Y. Onda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resultant expression vector plasmid was transfected into dhfr − CHO cells, and then transformed dhfr + CHO cells (CHO-hFM-3) were selected as described previously (13.Hinuma S. Hosoya M. Ogi K. Tanaka H. Nagai Y. Onda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing human NT type 1 and rat GHS receptors were established by a similar procedure. Porcine neuromedin U-8 and U-25 and rat U-23 were purchased from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland); human U-25 was synthesized by the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Other peptides were purchased from commercial suppliers. Extracellular acidification rates were measured with a Cytosensor (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). After CHO-hFM-3 or mock-transfected (i.e. only the vector without FM-3 cDNA was transfected) CHO cells were dispersed with trypsin, and they were dispensed into cell capsules (Molecular Devices) at 2.7 × 105 cells per capsule and cultured overnight, respectively. Then each cell capsule was attached to the device, and the cells were continuously loaded with a low buffered RPMI 1640 medium (Molecular Devices) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) until the acidification rates became stable. The acidification rates were measured every 120 s (flow on at 100 μl/min for 80 s; flow off for 8 s; measuring acidification rates for 30 s). CHO-hFM-3 and mock-transfected CHO cells were seeded in black-walled, clear-base, 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar, UK) at 3 × 104cells per well and cultured overnight. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mm probenecid and 4 μm Fluo-3AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). The cells were washed four times with the solution without Fluo-3AM, and then changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were measured with a fluorometric-imaging plate reader system (FLIPR; Molecular Devices) before and after the addition of samples. The arachidonic acid (AA)-metabolite release assay was performed principally according to the method described previously (14.Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Sekiguchi M. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Regul. Pept. 1999; 83: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A tyrosine residue at the N terminus of porcine U-8 was radioiodinated with Na[125I] (IMS-30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a method with lactoperoxidase (Sigma) (15.Ohtaki T. Watanabe T. Ishibashi Y. Kitada C. Tsuda M. Gottschall P.E. Arimura A. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After the radioiodination, labeled and unlabeled peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Aliquots of the labeled peptide were stored at −30 °C until use. The membrane fractions of CHO-hFM-3 cells were prepared by a method described previously (16.Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Takekawa S. Kizawa H. Sakamoto J. Miyamoto M. Hinuma S. Kitano K. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). They were incubated with 125I-labeled porcine U-8 in 100 μl of the binding buffer containing 0.1% BSA in 96-well microplates (Serocluster, Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at room temperature for 1.5 h. To determine the amounts of nonspecific binding, unlabeled porcine U-8 (final concentration at 10−6m) was simultaneously added to the wells. After the incubation, bound and free radioactivities were separated through rapid filtration using glass-fiber filter units (GF/C, Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) equipped with a 96-well cell harvester (Packard). The filter units were completely dried, and Microcinti O (Packard) was added to each well. The radioactivity of each well was then measured with a TopCount liquid scintillation counter (Packard). Rat FM-3 cDNA was isolated from poly(A)+ RNA of rat brain. We first designed the primers, 5′-GGGCTTGCCTCTGGAGCTTTATGAGAT-3′ and 5′-CGGGTTGGCTGCTGAGCCGAGATAGAA-3′, and then performed PCR in a reaction mixture (25 μl in total) containing a 0.2 μmconcentration of each primer, a template cDNA synthesized from a rat brain poly(A)+ RNA using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH), 0.4 mmdNTPs, 1.25 units of KlenTaq DNA polymerase (CLONTECH), and 2.5 μl of the buffer provided by the manufacturer under the conditions at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. Based on the partial rat cDNA sequence thus obtained, we synthesized various primers and isolated cDNA fragments, which covered a full coding region, by using a method consisting of 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends with a Marathon cDNA amplification kit. Finally, we isolated a rat FM-3 cDNA with a full coding region from the rat brain cDNA by PCR with a primer set (5′-GTCGACCATGCTCTCCCCAAATGCTTCAACGGG-3′ and 5′-GCTAGCTTATTCAGGAGGGTCTGTCTCTTGCTC-3′). Poly(A)+ RNAs were prepared from the tissues of 8- to 12-week-old Wistar rats, and cDNAs were synthesized from them as described previously (14.Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Sekiguchi M. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Regul. Pept. 1999; 83: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs of the placenta and mammary gland were prepared from female rats at 17 days in pregnancy. We quantified rat FM-3 and neuromedin U mRNAs by means of a Prism 7700 sequence detector (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with primer sets (5′-CATCTGTTGCATTGAGGAAGCT-3′ and 5′-TTCTCAGTTTGCTCCTGAGGC-3′ for neuromedin U; 5′-CCGGAGACAAGTGACCAAGATG-3′ and 5′-TGACACGACGCTCCACATGA-3′ for FM-3) and fluorescent-labeled probes (5′(FAM)-TGCCGTGTCCTGATGGAGATTTTCCA-(TAMRA)3′ for neuromedin U; 5′(FAM)-TGTTTGTCCTGGTCGTGGTGTTTGGCAT-(TAMRA)3′ for FM-3), respectively. PCR was carried out in a 25-μl reaction mixture prepared with a TaqMan universal PCR master mix (PE Biosystems) containing a cDNA solution synthesized from 4 ng of poly(A)+ RNA, a 0.2 μm concentration of each primer, and 0.1 μm probe. PCR was performed under the following conditions: at 50 °C for 10 min for the reaction of uracil-N-glycosylase to prevent the amplification of PCR products carried over; at 95 °C for 15 min for the activation of AmplyTaq Gold DNA polymerase; and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. To obtain calibration curves, we amplified the known amounts of rat neuromedin U and FM-3 cDNA fragments in the same manner as the samples. Good linear relationships were obtained between the amount of rat neuromedin U and FM-3 cDNA input and the release of the reporter dye within the range of 1 to 106copies, respectively. Rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) mRNA expression was also measured as an internal control using rodent G3PDH control reagents (PE Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In most tissues, the expression levels of G3PDH mRNA ranged from 0.7 × 105 to 13.3 × 105 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA, except in the skeletal muscle and costal cartilage (45.6 × 105 and 22 × 105 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA, respectively). Human and rat genomic DNAs (5 μg, CLONTECH) were digested withEcoRI, subjected to electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membrane Biodyne B (Pall BioSupport Corp., Glen Cove, NY). These filters were hybridized with human and rat FM-3 cDNA probes (0.3 kb), which were amplified by PCR with primers corresponding to the coding region of the second and forth transmembrane domain, after labeling with [32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) using a Multiprime DNA-labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed at 59 °C overnight in a hybridization solution containing 0.5 mNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, and 1% BSA. The filters were washed with 0.5 × SSC (15 mm NaCl and 1.5 mm sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS at 59 °C and then exposed to imaging plates (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 48 h, and hybridization signals were detected using a gel and blot imaging system (Storm model 860, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TheEcoRI-digested rat genomic DNA was electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel, and the DNA fragments were extracted from the gel using Suprec-01 DNA recovery cartridges (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan). Rat FM-3 and its related genomic gene fragments were amplified by PCR with primers (5′-AGCTGGGTGCAGGTGGCTGTTACTTCC-3′ and 5′-CTTGCTCACACCCTGGATCCCTGTTCT-3′) designed from the second extracellular and C-terminal coding regions of the rat FM-3 cDNA, under the conditions at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 36 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s, 64 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. After gel electrophoresis, amplified DNA fragments thus obtained were recovered from the agarose gel using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and their sequences were directly determined. We examined various synthetic compounds on CHO-hFM-3 cells in the microphysiometric assay and found that specific and dose-dependent promotion of extracellular acidification rates was induced in these cells by porcine U-8 (Fig. 1). At the dose of 10−7m porcine U-8 induced the robust elevation of acidification rates, and this elevation reached a maximum (220% of the basal level). The significant elevation of the acidification rates was observed even at the dose of 10−11m. In contrast, mock-transfected CHO cells did not respond at all to porcine U-8 at 10−7m. We analyzed cellular changes induced in CHO-hFM-3 cells by neuromedin U. In the FLIPR assay, we found that porcine U-8 induced the rapid mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ at the doses from 10−7 to 10−9m (Fig. 2). However, porcine U-8 at 10−7m did not induce the Ca2+ mobilization in mock-transfected CHO cells. Because extracellular AA release is caused by the activation of phospholipase A2, which is closely linked to Ca2+ influx, we next compared the potency of human U-25, porcine U-25 and U-8, and rat U-23 in CHO-hFM-3 cells in the AA release assay (Fig. 3). The potency of rat U-23 seemed to be about two times higher than that of others with a median effective concentration (EC50) of 1.3 × 10−9m.Figure 3AA release from CHO-hFM-3 cells after stimulation with neuromedin U derived from different species.CHO-hFM-3 cells were incubated overnight with 3H-labeled arachidonic acid. After being washed, the cells were incubated for 30 min with human U-25 (■), rat U-23 (▵), porcine U-25 (○), and porcine U-8 (●). Radioactivities released into supernatants were then measured.

To confirm the specific interaction of FM-3 and neuromedin U, we applied porcine U-8, a synthetic GHS of GHRP-6 (17.Smith R.G. Cheng K. Schoen W.R. Pong S.S. Hickey G. Jacks T. Butler B. Chan W.W. Chaung L.Y. Judith F. Tayor J. Wyvratt M.J. Fisher M.H. Science. 1993; 260: 1640-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and human NT at 10−7m on CHO-hFM-3 cells, mock-transfected CHO cells, and CHO cells expressing NT type 1 or GHS receptor, respectively. As shown in Fig.4, only porcine U-8 could induce AA release in CHO-hFM-3 cells. In contrast, GHRP-6 and NT specifically induced AA release from CHO cells expressing GHS or NT receptor, respectively, but porcine U-8 did not induce AA release from these cells as well as mock-transfected CHO cells. We examined the binding of neuromedin U to FM-3. 125I-Labeled porcine U-8 efficiently bound to the membrane fractions prepared from CHO-hFM-3 cells. Unlabeled neuromedin U inhibited this binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). Rat U-23 was the most potent in this competitive binding assay with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.9 × 10−11m. On the other hand, IC50 values of human and porcine U-25 were 1.4 × 10−10m and 1.7 × 10−10m, respectively. Porcine U-8 was the least potent with IC50 of 5.1 × 10−10m. However, GHRP-6, human NT, and pancreatic peptide (PP) had no detectable inhibitory activity at 10−7m in this assay. Scatchard analysis showed that CHO-hFM-3 cells expressed a single class of high affinity binding sites for 125I-labeled porcine U-8 (Fig.5 B). The dissociation constant (K d) was 6.6 × 10−11m, and the number of maximal binding sites (B max) was 2.4 pmol mg−1 protein. We analyzed the tissue distribution of rat neuromedin U and FM-3 mRNAs. Because the sequence of rat FM-3 cDNA has not been reported, we designed some primers based on the known human and mouse FM-3 cDNA sequences (5.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and isolated a rat FM-3 cDNA by RT-PCR (Fig. 6). The isolated cDNA encoded an open reading frame with 412-amino acid length. The N-terminal portion of rat FM-3 was slightly longer than those of human and mouse FM-3. Rat FM-3 shared 71% and 80% amino acid sequence identity with human and mouse FM-3, respectively. When analyzing rat FM-3 cDNAs amplified from jejunum poly(A)+ RNA by RT-PCR, we found that some splicing variants existed in rat FM-3 cDNAs. One of them, which was a major PCR product, contained an intron in the sixth transmembrane domain and did not seem to encode a functional receptor (data not shown). Therefore, to avoid the amplification of this variant, we designed primers and a probe to quantify FM-3 mRNA by RT-PCR using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. As shown in Fig. 7 (upper panel), the highest level of neuromedin U mRNA was detected in the pituitary gland (9.6 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA). In the gastrointestinal tract, high levels of expression were detected in the duodenum and jejunum (7.6 × 103 and 5.6 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA, respectively), whereas the expression levels were low in the caecum (0.3 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA) but high levels in the colon and rectum (2.4 × 103 and 3.0 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA, respectively). In the central nervous system, moderate levels of the expression were detected in the striatum, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord (0.4 × 103 to 1.0 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA). In the other peripheral tissues, moderate levels of expression were observed in the thyroid gland, trachea, testis, and ovary (0.3 × 103 to 1.2 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA). FM-3 mRNA was mainly detected in the small intestine and lung (2.1 × 103 to 3.1 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA) (Fig. 7, lower panel). There was a clear difference in the expression levels between the small and large intestine: expression levels in the small intestine were greater than those in the large intestine. FM-3 mRNA levels in the central nervous system were rather low (0.02 × 103 to 0.04 × 103 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA). A very low level of FM-3 mRNA expression was detected in the pituitary gland where the highest level of neuromedin U mRNA was detected. We analyzed human and rat FM-3 genes by Southern blot analyses after the electrophoresis of human and rat genomic DNAs digested with EcoRI. As shown in Fig. 8 A, by using a radiolabeled human FM-3 cDNA fragment as a probe, we detected a clear hybridized band (indicated with a in lane 1) of 10.5 kb in the human genomic DNA. This band was expected to be derived from the human FM-3 gene. In addition, we detected a fainter band (b in lane 1) around 5.3 kb in the human genomic DNA, suggesting that a gene with a similar DNA sequence to the FM-3 gene exits in the human genome. Using the same probe, we detected two hybridized bands of 19 and 8 kb (c and d, respectively, in lane 2) in the rat genomic DNA, suggesting that there are two genes corresponding to the human FM-3 gene in rats. On the other hand, by using a radiolabeled rat FM-3 cDNA probe, we detected a single band (a in lane 3) in the human genomic DNA at the same position when hybridizing with the human cDNA probe. These results indicated that the isolated rat FM-3 gene actually corresponded to the human FM-3 gene. We could not detect a hybridization signal at the position corresponding to the bandb in lane 1, suggesting that its sequence was not as similar to the rat FM-3 as it was to the human FM-3. Using the rat probe, we detected clearly two hybridized bands (c andd, respectively, in lane 4) in the rat genomic DNA at the same position when hybridizing with the human cDNA probe, suggesting that there are two FM-3-like genes in the rat genomic DNA. We subsequently analyzed the relation of two bands hybridized in the rat genomic DNA using the FM-3 cDNA probes. After gel electrophoresis, we extracted DNA fragments at the position corresponding to each band and then performed PCR with primers designed from the rat FM-3 cDNA. As shown in Fig. 8 B, a DNA fragment of 1.2 kb was amplified from the extracted genomic DNA corresponding to the band c. As a result of sequence analysis for the amplified DNA fragment, we found that it completely matched with rat FM-3 cDNA sequence except for the additional sequence of an intron (334 bp), which was inserted at the position of Ile-287 in the coding region of the rat FM-3 cDNA. These results demonstrated that this fragment was derived from the rat FM-3 gene. On the other hand, a DNA fragment with 877 bp was amplified from the bandd. The DNA sequence of the amplified fragment had 91% identity with that of the rat FM-3 cDNA. However, this fragment (FM-3-related gene) did not appear to encode a functional open reading frame, because one base insertion caused a frameshift and stop codons were detected in the sequence. It was thus impossible that the DNA corresponding to the band d could encode a functional receptor, although its sequence was highly similar to the rat FM-3 gene. In addition, an intron-like sequence did not exist in this FM-3-related gene. We speculated that this might be a pseudogene of FM-3. Taken together, our Southern hybridization analyses indicated that the rat FM-3 gene, which we isolated, was the orthologue of the human FM-3 gene. So far FM-3 has remained as an orphan GPCR, because some peptides, including a synthetic GHS, NT, endothelin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), growth hormone-releasing hormone, somatostatin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, calcitonin, and galanin were examined as to whether they could act as FM-3 ligands, but they failed to stimulate HEK293 cells expressing FM-3 (5.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrated that neuromedin U showed a specific and very potent agonistic activity to CHO-hFM-3 cells and specifically bound to their membrane fractions with high affinity at a K d level of 66 pm. Our data unequivocally demonstrate that neuromedin U is the cognate ligand of FM-3. Because neuromedin U caused Ca2+ influx and AA release in CHO-hFM-3 cells, FM-3 was hypothesized to couple to Gq in the signal transduction pathway. We could not detect apparent changes in cAMP production in CHO-hFM-3 cells treated with neuromedin U (data not shown). Since neuromedin U was first purified from porcine spinal cord (7.Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8.Minamino N. Sudoh T. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Peptides. 1985; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it has been isolated from a number of species (18.Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In a comparison of neuromedin U peptides derived from different species, the C-terminal five amino acid residues were totally conserved, suggesting that this region is of major importance. It has been reported that amidation of the C-terminal asparagine is indispensable for neuromedin U to exhibit biological activities (7.Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, neuromedin U shares a consensus sequence, LXRPRX-amide, with PP and the same asparagine amide C terminus with VIP, respectively (7.Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although both PP and VIP did not stimulate CHO-hFM-3 cells, we found thatAplysia small cardioactive peptide B (SCPB) (19.Morris H.R. Panico M. Karplus A. Lloyd P.E. Riniker B. Nature. 1982; 300: 643-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), having a consensus motif, LXXPRX-amide, with neuromedin U, showed a very low but significant agonistic activity to CHO-hFM-3 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the LXXPRX-amide motif is needed for neuromedin U to interact with FM-3, but in the case of PP, its N-terminal portion might hinder the interaction with FM-3. Neuromedin U shows slight sequence homology with NT and ghrelin. However, neither NT nor ghrelin stimulated CHO-hFM-3 cells (data not shown). This might be due to the fact that NT and ghrelin do not share the consensus motif LXXPRX-amide (Fig.9). There has been little information on the tissue distribution of FM-3 mRNA. FM-3 transcripts of 2 and 5 kb have been reportedly detected in some tissues, in particular, they are found by Northern blot analyses to be abundant in the testis of mice (5.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To know more precise distribution of its mRNA in rats, we isolated rat FM-3 cDNA and analyzed the tissue distribution of FM-3 mRNA by the quantitative RT-PCR. However, we could not detect a high level of FM-3 mRNA expression in the testis in rats by RT-PCR. This may be due to species difference or selective amplification of FM-3 cDNAs in our analyses. Moreover, we also analyzed the distribution of neuromedin U mRNA to compare it with that of FM-3 mRNA. Both neuromedin U and FM-3 mRNAs were highly expressed in the small intestine, whereas in the large intestine the expression levels of neuromedin U mRNA were relatively high but FM-3 mRNA expression levels were low. It is reported that neuromedin U-like immunoreactivity is abundantly detected in the gastrointestinal tract (20.Domin J. Ghatei M.A. Chohan P. Bloom S.R.

Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10.Benito-Orfila M.A. Domin J. Nandha K.A. Bloom S.R. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 1988; 155: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is suggested that neuromedin U and FM-3 play important roles in the gastrointestinal tract. It is reported that both neuromedin U mRNA and neuromedin U-like immunoreactivity are abundantly detected in human and rat pituitary gland (20.Domin J. Ghatei M.A. Chohan P. Bloom S.R. Peptides. 1987; 8: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 27.Steel J.H. Van Noorden S. Ballesta J. Gibson S.J. Ghatei M.A. Burrin J. Leonhardt U. Domin J. Bloom S.R. Polak J.M.

Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We also detected the highest level of neuromedin U mRNA expression in rat pituitary gland. In immunocytochemical analyses, neuromedin U-positive cells are reportedly observed in the anterior lobe of the pituitary and they are colocalized in the corticotrophes (27.Steel J.H. Van Noorden S. Ballesta J. Gibson S.J. Ghatei M.A. Burrin J. Leonhardt U. Domin J. Bloom S.R. Polak J.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the rat brain, neuromedin U-positive nerve fibers are observed in the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei (22.Ballesta J. Carlei F. Bishop A.E. Steel J.H. Gibson S.J. Fahey M. Hennessey R. Domin J. Bloom S.R. Polak J.M. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 797-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27.Steel J.H. Van Noorden S. Ballesta J. Gibson S.J. Ghatei M.A. Burrin J. Leonhardt U. Domin J. Bloom S.R. Polak J.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, the subcutaneous administration of neuromedin U into rats results in increasing plasma adrenocorticotropin and corticosterone concentrations (29.Malendowicz L.K. Nussdorfer G.G. Markowska A. Tortorella C. Nowak M. Warchol J.B. Neuropeptides. 1994; 26: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that neuromedin U is involved in the control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. However, we detected only low levels of FM-3 mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal gland. In addition, it is reported that neuromedin U potently contracts isolated rat uterus (7.Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8.Minamino N. Sudoh T. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Peptides. 1985; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and human bladder (9.Maggi C.A. Patacchini R. Giuliani S. Turini D. Barbanti G. Rovero P. Meli A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and that abundant neuromedin U binding sites are detected in rat uterus (18.Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30.Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Jamal H. Akinsanya K.O. Bloom S.R. Smith D.M. Peptides. 1999; 20: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, we detected very low levels of FM-3 mRNA expression both in the uterus and bladder in rats. It has been proposed that neuromedin U acts as a neuropeptide or neuromodulator rather than a circulating hormone, because plasma neuromedin U levels seem to be fairly low (20.Domin J. Ghatei M.A. Chohan P. Bloom S.R. Peptides. 1987; 8: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the discrepancy of the FM-3 and neuromedin U distributions is that other unknown receptors responsible for neuromedin U may exist in these tissues. Although the results of our Southern blot analyses clearly indicated that the rat cDNA, which we isolated, was the orthologue of the human FM-3 cDNA, we detected an additional fainter band in the human genomic DNA using the human FM-3 cDNA probe. This band suggested that a gene with homologous sequence with the FM-3 gene might exist in the human genome. It may be one of the candidate genes for a neuromedin U receptor subtype, although it might be a pseudogene as found in the rat genome. In the rat genome, we found that there was a FM-3-related gene in addition to the FM-3 gene. However, this gene did not encode a functional receptor, though it had a highly conserved sequence with the rat FM-3 gene. Under the conditions of lower stringency, in the rat genomic DNA, we could not detect additional bands hybridized clearly with the rat FM-3 probe (data not shown), suggesting that other genes with at least a highly similar sequence to FM-3 do not exist in the rat genome. Future studies are necessary to confirm whether there are functional receptor subtypes for neuromedin U. In the lung, a high level of FM-3 mRNA expression was detected, whereas neuromedin U mRNA expression was low. The similar pattern was observed in the femur. Although there is the possibility that neuromedin U is delivered to these tissues by a certain mechanism such as neuronal processes, further studies are required to clarify pathways for neuromedin U to act on FM-3. Neuromedin U and FM-3 mRNAs were found to be localized in a variety of tissues, suggesting that they have multiple unknown functions. The discovery of a specific receptor for neuromedin U will give novel insights into the physiological significance of neuromedin U and should enhance the search for its agonists and antagonists.

We used an expression-cloning screen to search for mouse proteins that are degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent N-end rule pathway in a reticulocyte lysate. One substrate thus identified was RGS4, a member of the RGS family of GTPase-activating proteins that down-regulate specific G proteins. A determinant of the RGS4 degradation signal (degron) was located at the N terminus of RGS4, because converting cysteine 2 to either glycine, alanine, or valine completely stabilized RGS4. Radiochemical sequencing indicated that the N-terminal methionine of the lysate-produced RGS4 was replaced with arginine. Since N-terminal arginine is a destabilizing residue not encoded by RGS4 mRNA, we conclude that the degron of RGS4 is generated through the removal of N-terminal methionine and enzymatic arginylation of the resulting N-terminal cysteine. RGS16, another member of the RGS family, was also found to be an N-end rule substrate. RGS4 that was transiently expressed in mouse L cells was short-lived in these cells.

A short in vivohalf-life of a regulator provides a way to generate its spatial gradients and allows for rapid adjustments of its concentration, or subunit composition, through changes in the rate of its synthesis or degradation. Damaged or otherwise abnormal proteins tend to be short-lived as well (6Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar).

The essential component of one degradation signal, called the N-degron, is a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein (9Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). A set of amino acid residues that are destabilizing in a given cell yields a rule, called the N-end rule, which relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue. The N-end rule pathway is present in all organisms examined, from mammals and plants to fungi and prokaryotes (10Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We discovered that in addition to the expected removal of N-terminal Met from the newly formed RGS4, the resulting N-terminal Cys of RGS4 was arginylated, presumably by a distinct R-transferase whose Cys specificity is different from that of the known R-transferases. Thus modified RGS4 bore N-terminal Arg, a primary destabilizing residue, and was degraded by the N-end rule pathway in reticulocyte lysate.DISCUSSIONWe searched for substrates of the mammalian N-end rule pathway by testing some of the previously known candidates and also by employing a modification of the sib selection-based in vitro screen (42Lustig K.D.

We report the following results.1) The in vitro activated, proteolytically processed larger (80 kDa) subunit of the cysteine protease m-calpain was previously shown to bear N-terminal Lys (59Brown N. Crawford C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a type 1-destabilizing residue in the N-end rule (10Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We expressed this subunit, termed Lys-mCL, in the reticulocyte lysate as a Ub-Lys-mCL fusion. The resulting Lys-mCL was not a substrate of the N-end rule pathway, despite the presence of a destabilizing N-terminal residue. Since an N-degron is a bipartite signal (12Bachmair A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1989; 56: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 13Johnson E.S. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1990; 346: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Suzuki T. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6017-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the absence of active N-degron from Lys-mCL could be due to the absence of a targetable internal Lys residue, the second determinant of an N-degron. Another possibility is a steric hindrance in the binding of UBR1 to the N-terminal lysine of Lys-mCL. Thus, a destabilizing N-terminal residue is not the sole essential determinant of an active N-degron, as demonstrated previously with engineered N-end rule substrates (12Bachmair A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1989; 56: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).2) A major fraction (75–85%) of mouse RGS4 synthesized in reticulocyte lysate was rapidly degraded by a pathway that was proteasome-dependent and apparently also Ub-dependent. The other 15–25% of the newly made RGS4 was found to be stable in the lysate.3) The degradation of RGS4 was inhibited by dipeptides bearing type 1-destabilizing N-terminal residues (Arg-β-Ala or Lys-Ala) but was unaffected by dipeptides bearing a type 2-destabilizing N-terminal residue (Trp-Ala) or a type 3 residue (Ala-Lys and Ala-Arg).4) Radiochemical sequencing of RGS4 produced in reticulocyte lysate and labeled with either [3H]arginine, [3H]lysine, or [3H]leucine revealed the presence of posttranslationally conjugated Arg at the N terminus of RGS4. The deduced N-terminal sequence of RGS4 was Met-Cys-Lys-Gly-. The observed/inferred sequence was Arg-Cys-Lys-Gly-. This result and, independently, the fact that degradation of RGS4 was inhibited by type 1 but not by type 2 dipeptides strongly suggested the following model: the N-terminal Met of newly formed RGS4 is removed by MetAPs; the resulting N-terminal Cys is arginylated by R-transferase; and the arginylated RGS4 is targeted for processive degradation by the UBR1-encoded E3α and the rest of the N-end rule pathway.5) In agreement with a prediction of this model, the degradation of RGS4 in reticulocyte lysate was found to require Cys-2 residue, which becomes N-terminal after the MetAP-mediated cotranslational removal of Met. Specifically, the RGS4 mutants C2G, C2V, and C2A, in which Cys-2 was replaced with Gly, Val or Ala, were completely stable in the lysate. The former two residues are stabilizing in the N-end rule, and neither of the 3 residues is expected to interfere with the removal of N-terminal Met by MetAPs (64Walker K.W. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13403-13409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).6) A Lys → Ser replacement at the encoded position 3 of RGS4 also completely stabilized the resulting RGS4K3S protein. However, a Lys → Arg replacement at this position had no effect on the degradation of RGS4K3R. Thus, Lys-3 is not required for ubiquitylation of RGS4. However, the presence of a basic residue (either Lys or Arg) immediately after Cys is essential for the RGS4 degradation by the N-end rule pathway. One possibility is that the requirement for a basic residue at this position reflects the substrate specificity of an uncharacterized R-transferase that arginylates the N-terminal Cys.7) The mouse protein Gβ5L, a member of the family of β subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (66Watson A.J. Agaray A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that bore the (initial) N-terminal Met-Cys, was tested and found not to be an N-end rule substrate, similarly to the RGS4K3S mutant, which also bore the (initial) N-terminal sequence Met-Cys but was not degraded by the N-end rule pathway. Thus, the N-terminal Cys of wild type RGS4 is an essential determinant of its N-degron, but other N terminus-proximal residues are relevant as well.8) Similarities among the N-terminal sequences of RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16 (67Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggested that RGS5 and RGS16 may also be N-end rule substrates. This prediction was tested, thus far, with RGS16, and was confirmed.9) RGS4 was transiently expressed in mouse L cells and found to be an unstable protein, with the half-life of 40–50 min. The in vivo degradation of RGS4 was proteasome-dependent, as indicated by the nearly complete stabilization of RGS4 in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132. However, the targeting of RGS4 in thisin vivo setting involved primarily a degron distinct from the Cys-based N-degron, because N-terminal variants of RGS4 such as RGS4C2V and RGS4C2G, which were completely stable in reticulocyte lysate, remained unstable in L cells.We consider the latter result first. 15–25% of the reticulocyte lysate-produced RGS4 was resistant to degradation by the N-end rule pathway (paragraph 2 above). An analogous protection of RGS4 against targeting by the N-end rule pathway in L cells might involve a much higher fraction of the newly formed RGS4. The mechanism of protection may be a modification of the N-terminal Cys, for example, its palmitoylation (45Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 47Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that would be expected to preclude the arginylation and degradation of RGS4 by the N-end rule pathway. Thus it is possible, indeed likely, that there is a kinetic competition among these reactions at the N-terminal Cys of a nascent RGS4 protein. In experiments to address this model, we added varying amounts of acetyl-CoA or palmitoyl-CoA (the substrates of N-terminal acetylases and palmitoyltransferases) to reticulocyte lysate; no effect of the added compounds on the degradation of newly formed RGS4 in the lysate was observed. 5I. Davydov and A. Varshavsky, unpublished data. A second possibility is a spatial localization of RGS4 in L cells that protects it from degradation by the N-end rule pathway but leaves RGS4 still targetable by another proteasome-dependent pathway(s) that is inactive in reticulocytes. Yet another possible reason for the difference between the results with reticulocyte lysateversus L cells is that the cysteine branch of the N-end rule pathway may be cell type-specific; for example, a Cys-specific R-transferase is present in reticulocytes but might be expressed at a lower level in L cells. In recent experiments, RGS4 was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, through microinjection of RGS4 mRNA. It was found that, similarly to the results with reticulocyte extracts, RGS4 was degraded in oocytes by the cysteine branch of the N-end rule pathway. 6J. Sheng, I. Davydov, and A. Varshav"
https://openalex.org/W2058296112,"EGR-1, a transcription factor with important functions in the regulation of growth and differentiation, is highly expressed in brain. Previous studies have shown that EGR-1 suppresses the transformed phenotype. However, the expression and role of EGR-1 in human glioblastoma cells are not yet determined. In this study, we found that the basal expression of the EGR-1 protein is undetectable, but is inducible in four human glioblastoma cell lines. To determine EGR-1 functions, we re-expressed EGR-1 in human glioblastoma U251 cells and found that the secretion of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and fibronectin (FN) was greatly enhanced. Addition of anti-TGF-β antibodies completely inhibited the secretion of PAI-1, but had little effect on secretion of FN, indicating that PAI-1 is under the control of EGR-1-induced TGF-β1. An examination of the promoter of the FN gene revealed two EGR-1-binding sites between positions −75 and −52 and positions −4 and +14 that specifically bound EGR-1 in gel mobility shift experiments. Utilizing wild-type and mutant FN promoter/luciferase reporter genes, we demonstrated that EGR-1 positively regulated the activity of the FN gene. In addition, cell adhesion and migration were greatly increased in the EGR-1-expressing cells, and adhesion was reversed by addition of RGD-containing peptides. These results suggest that EGR-1 may regulate cell interaction with the extracellular matrix by coordinated induction of TGF-β1, FN, and PAI-1 in human glioblastoma cells. EGR-1, a transcription factor with important functions in the regulation of growth and differentiation, is highly expressed in brain. Previous studies have shown that EGR-1 suppresses the transformed phenotype. However, the expression and role of EGR-1 in human glioblastoma cells are not yet determined. In this study, we found that the basal expression of the EGR-1 protein is undetectable, but is inducible in four human glioblastoma cell lines. To determine EGR-1 functions, we re-expressed EGR-1 in human glioblastoma U251 cells and found that the secretion of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and fibronectin (FN) was greatly enhanced. Addition of anti-TGF-β antibodies completely inhibited the secretion of PAI-1, but had little effect on secretion of FN, indicating that PAI-1 is under the control of EGR-1-induced TGF-β1. An examination of the promoter of the FN gene revealed two EGR-1-binding sites between positions −75 and −52 and positions −4 and +14 that specifically bound EGR-1 in gel mobility shift experiments. Utilizing wild-type and mutant FN promoter/luciferase reporter genes, we demonstrated that EGR-1 positively regulated the activity of the FN gene. In addition, cell adhesion and migration were greatly increased in the EGR-1-expressing cells, and adhesion was reversed by addition of RGD-containing peptides. These results suggest that EGR-1 may regulate cell interaction with the extracellular matrix by coordinated induction of TGF-β1, FN, and PAI-1 in human glioblastoma cells.

EGR-1 contains three zinc finger motifs that bind and regulate transcription through GC-rich elements (GCEs)1 with a consensus sequence of 5′-GCG(T/G)GGGCG-3′ (2.Chavrier P. Vesque C. Galliot B.

The promoter regions of many genes, including several growth factors and cytokines, are regulated by EGR-1 (for a review, see Ref. 5.Liu C. Rangnekar V.M. Adamson E. Mercola D. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 3-28PubMed Google Scholar). The Egr-1 gene is rapidly and transiently induced by growth factors and other signals and is functionally implicated in cell proliferation and in differentiation processes (6.Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 7.Sukhatme V.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 859-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Nguyen H.Q. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Egr-1 is broadly expressed during development and in the tissues of adults of many species. It can be found in epithelial tissues, heart, thymus, and central and peripheral nervous systems. The basal expression of the EGR-1 protein in adult rat and mouse brain is high (for a review, see Ref. 9.Beckmann A.M. Wilce P.A. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 477-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). At a functional level, severalin vitro and in vivo studies initially characterized Egr-1 as having a role in the control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and development. However, whether EGR-1 is a participant in disparate activities or is a more central factor regulating coordinate expression of a characteristic phenotype is unclear. Our previous studies have shown that stable re-expression of EGR-1 inhibits transformation in model cells and in several human tumor cell lines (10.Huang R.-P. Fan Y. de Belle I. Niemeyer C.

Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). The re-expression ofEgr-1 in fibrosarcoma HT-1080, glioblastoma U251, and U373 cells leads to decreased DNA synthesis, growth, and tumorigenicity (39.Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of the EGR-1 suppressive function has been studied in detail in fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells (40.Liu C. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11831-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 41.de Belle I. Huang R.-P. Fan Y. Liu C. Mercola D. Adamson E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4400-4411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The EGR-1 protein specifically binds the GCE sites of the human TGF-β1 promoter, transactivates the TGF-β1 gene, and enhances the expression and secretion of functional TGF-β1 in the Egr-1-expressing fibrosarcoma cell line, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and restoration of anchorage-dependent growth (40.Liu C. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11831-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is the prototype of a large family of cytokines that control cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and extracellular matrix metabolism. TGF-β1 has been shown to induce fibronectin (FN) expression at both the mRNA and protein levels (12.Dean D.C. Newby R.F. Bourgeois S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2159-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24.Ignotz R.A. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4337-4345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and promotes net matrix deposition by increasing the expression of specific ECM components such as FN and collagen and by up-regulating the expression of inhibitors of ECM proteases such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (13.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, 26.Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). FN plays an important role in organizing the extracellular matrix and facilitates cell adhesion, migration, wound healing, and tumor metastasis (14.Hynes R.O. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 15.Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). We previously showed that the level of FN secretion dramatically increases in human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cell lines transfected with the Egr-1 gene. Surprisingly, we found that EGR-1 directly binds to GC-rich elements in the FN promoter (42.Liu C. Yao J. de Belle I. Huang R.-P. Adamson E. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4400-4411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although a functional effect of EGR-1 on transcriptional activity was not shown, the increased secretion of FN was found to enhance attachment in an RGD-dependent manner, and attachment was further enhanced by the TGF-β1-dependent secretion of PAI-1. Thus, the increased expression of endogenous FN in human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells cooperates with increased expression of TGF-β1 to suppress the transformed phenotype and to suppress tumor growth in vivo(39.Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Liu C. Yao J. de Belle I. Huang R.-P. Adamson E. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4400-4411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine whether EGR-1 plays a more general role in the control of cell growth, we examined the basal level of EGR-1 protein expression in four glioblastoma cell lines and re-expressed Egr-1 in the human glioblastoma cell line U251. We report here that the basal expression of EGR-1 was found to be undetectable in the four lines examined. Re-expression of EGR-1 leads to the increased expression of TGF-β1 and PAI-1 and, in addition, enhances the secretion of FN. We show that the regulation of the FN gene by EGR-1 is direct by binding to two sites of the FN promoter and that these sites function to increase the transcriptional activity of the FN gene. The expression of EGR-1 in U251 cells results in reduction of cell growth rate (39.Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar) and promotion of cell adhesion as well as cell migration. These results indicate important regulatory roles of EGR-1 and FN that may be altered during tumor progression. Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFEgr-1+/+ and MEFEgr-1−/−) derived from wild-type and knockout EGR-1 mouse embryos were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The human glioblastoma cell lines U251 and T98G were gifts from Dr. Hoi U (University of California at San Diego), and PA317 was a gift from Dr. H. Fakhrai. Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 10% CO2. UN and UE-1 cells are transfected clones of U251 that stably express pCMV, an empty vector, or pCMVEgr-1, which carries a full-length mouse Egr-1 cDNA, and were maintained in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (39.Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). A retroviral vector, pLHCX (55.Potapova O. Fakhrai H. Bbbaird S. Mercola D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 280-286PubMed Google Scholar), containing the full-length mouse Egr-1cDNA was transfected into an amphotropic retrovirus producer cell line, PA317. High titer retrovirus producer clones were obtained by growing in the presence of 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. The medium from the cultured clones containing the retrovirus was harvested from the confluent producer clones, filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter, and then incubated with U251 cells for 2 h in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml). 48 h after retrovirus infection, cells were cultured in medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. After 2 weeks of selection, the hygromycin-resistant colonies were used for Western blot analysis to assess the expression of EGR-1 before use in further analyses. The representative clones UX-13, UE-13, and UE-21 as well as UE-1, prepared as described previously (39.Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar), were used for further studies. Cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2, incubated overnight, washed twice with PBS, and lysed by scraping from the plates with boiling lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1.0 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4). In cases where the cells were stimulated by mitogens, the cells were grown to confluence; made “quiescent” by serum deprivation overnight; and treated with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or 40 J/m2 UV-C for 2 h before lysis. After boiling for an additional 5 min, the lysates were passed through a 26-gauge needle to shear DNA and centrifuged for 5 min to pellet insoluble material. Nuclear protein was obtained from cells as described previously (29.Dean D.C. Bowlus C.L. Bourgeois S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. 50–100 μg of cellular proteins or 50 μg of nuclear protein were added to an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were incubated with anti-EGR-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and autoradiographed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To show equal loading of protein, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). The intensity of the bands was determined by image analysis using an Eastman Kodak Digital ScienceTM one-dimensional image analysis system. Cells (1 × 105) were plated in triplicate on 12-well plates, and 24 h later, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium and incubated for 24 h. The serum-free “conditioned” medium was then collected and centrifuged. One-half of the conditioned medium was used to determine active TGF-β1 secreted by cells using a TGF-β1 ELISA system (Promega, Madison, WI). The other half of the conditioned medium was activated by acidification with 1 n HCl to pH 2.0–3.0 for 15 min, neutralized with an equal volume of 1 n NaOH, and assayed as total TGF-β1 with the TGF-β1 ELISA system. The number of cells was determined by harvesting and counting (Coulter Counter, Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). In the case of U251, MEFEgr-1+/+, and MEFEgr-1−/− cells stimulated by mitogenic stimuli, the quiescent cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PMA, 20% FBS, or 40 J/m2 UV-C for 4 h, and media without serum were replaced and incubated for 24 h. After 24 h, the medium was collected for TGF-β1 ELISA. For the PAI-1 assay, 2 × 105 cells were plated on six-well tissue culture plates in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated overnight. The medium was then removed, and the cells were subjected to cysteine/methionine-free DMEM in the absence or presence of 30 μg/ml monoclonal mouse anti-TGF-β1/2/3 antibody (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) for 2 h, at which time, [35S]cysteine/methionine was added to 50 μCi/ml (1180 Ci/mmol; Tran35S-label, ICN Biochemicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) for an additional 2 h. Extracellular matrix was prepared as described (27.Der C.J. Ash J.F. Stanbridge E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1981; 52: 151-166PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled cell monolayers were rinsed with PBS, and the cytosolic and nuclear proteins were extracted by subsequent washes with hypotonic buffer containing sodium deoxycholate. The remaining labeled extracellular matrix proteins were recovered by addition of electrophoresis buffer to the washed wells, followed by scraping. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were treated with Fluoro-HancerTM autoradiography enhancer (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) for 30 min, followed by drying and autoradiography. For the FN assay, 2 × 105 cells were plated on six-well tissue culture plates. The cells were treated overnight without or with 30 μg/ml monoclonal mouse anti-TGF-β1/2/3 antibody in cysteine/methionine-free medium. The next day, [35S]cysteine/methionine was added to 50 μCi/ml for 2 h. The media were collected and subjected to adsorption on gelatin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100 as described (28.Cárcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were treated with Fluoro-HancerTMfor 30 min, followed by drying and autoradiography. The fragment containing the FN promoter region positions between −105 and +14 was cleaved from phFN105CAT (a gift from Dr. K. Oda) with BglII and HindIII (43.Suzuki M. Oda E. Nakajima T. Sekiya S. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3010-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and inserted into the BglII/HindIII sites of the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega), thereby replacing the SV40 promoter to generate pGLFN105 (see Fig. 6 A). Mutant FN/luciferase constructs were created by incorporating each of the mutagenic primers independently into pGLFN105 using the TransformerTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Mutagenic primers for each specific site are as follows: FNAM, a mutation of GCE-A in the FN promoter, GGTCTCTCCTATACCGCGCCCCG; and FNBM, a mutation of GCE-B in the FN promoter, CTCCGACGCCCATACCGGCTGTGC. The identity and integrity of the resulting plasmids, pGLFN105, pGLFNAM, and pGLFNBM, were verified by DNA sequence analysis. For the transient transfection experiment assays, parental cells (U251) and EGR-1-expressing cloned cells (UE-1) were grown on six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and treated with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 2 μg of reporter construct alone or combined with various amounts of expression plasmids. Cells were maintained in the presence of the Lipofectin complexes for 16 h, washed with PBS, and then grown in DMEM containing 5% FBS. After 32 h of incubation, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay kit (Promega). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from a clone with maximum EGR-1 expression (UE-1) and from non-expressing cells (U251 and UN) as described (29.Dean D.C. Bowlus C.L. Bourgeois S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations in the nuclear extracts were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides bearing sequences corresponding to either −75 to −52 base pairs or −4 to +14 base pairs of the human FN promoter, termed GCE-A and GCE-B, respectively (see Fig.6 A), were selected based on an analysis of the sequence of the human FN promoter region for the presence of GCEs (Transcription Element Search software). The DNA sequences for the two oligonucleotides are as follows: GCE-A, 5′-GATCTCTCTCCTCCCCCGCGCCCCGGGG-3′; and GCE-B, 5′-GATCTCCGACGCCCGCGCCGGCTGTG-3′. The prototypic EGR-1-binding sites are underlined. The GCE-A and GCE-B oligonucleotides were end-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the supplier's specification and used as probes A and B. Gel shift assays were performed as follows. Nuclear extracts (20 μg of protein) were incubated with radiolabeled DNA probe (1 × 105cpm) for 20 min at 4 °C in a 20-μl reaction containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml spermidine, 10% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free DNA probe by electrophoresis on 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film for autoradiography. For the competition experiments, excess unlabeled oligonucleotides for probes A and B or oligonucleotides containing two EGR-1-binding consensus sequences (GCE) and mutated EGR-1-binding sequences were incubated with the reaction mixture for 15 min at 4 °C before addition of radiolabeled probes A and B. Similarly, in the antibody supershift experiments, the specific antibodies against EGR-1 (38.Huang R.-P. Darland T. Okumura D. Mercola D. Adamson E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar) were added to the binding reactions and incubated for 15 min before the appropriate radiolabeled probe was added. Adhesion assays were performed essentially as described previously (42.Liu C. Yao J. de Belle I. Huang R.-P. Adamson E. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4400-4411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to recover from any stress or alteration caused by the harvesting procedure. The cells, at a density of 2 × 104cells/well, were then added to 96-well flat-bottom ELISA plates (Sarstedt Inc., Newton, NC) that has been pretreated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h to block nonspecific sites. In some cases, 10 μg/ml GRGDSP or GRGESP peptide (gifts from Dr. R. Pasqualini, Burnham Institute) was added to the cells. The cells were allowed to attach for 3 h at 37 °C in a 10% CO2incubator. The wells were then washed gently with warm PBS to remove unattached cells. The number of cells attached to the wells was estimated by the tetrazolium-based colorimetric MTS/PMS assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cell migration was measured by thein vitro wound healing assay. Cells (2.5 × 104/cm2) were plated on 60-mm dishes in DMEM containing 5% FBS overnight and then “wounded” by removing a thin line of cells with a yellow plastic tip. After washing twice with serum-free DMEM, the cells were incubated for 21 h in DMEM containing 5% FBS to allow the cells to migrate into the wound areas. The same areas were photographed before and after a 21-h period. Several groups have reported that the basal levels ofEgr-1 mRNA (31.Milbrant J.

Lett. 1991; 122: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) are readily detectable in normal mouse and rat cells and tissues. The EGR-1 protein appears to play important roles in normal brain development and brain injury responses following ischemia and nerve transection (35.McCormack M.A. Rosen K.M. Villa-Komaroff L. Mower G.D. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 12: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36.Kaplan I.V. Guo Y. Mower G.D. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 90: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To understand the importance of Egr-1 in human normal brain and brain tumors, we examined four glioblastoma cell lines: U251, T98G, U-373MG, and U-87MG. Western blot analysis showed that the basal expression of the EGR-1 protein in these cell lines was undetectable, whereas the basal expression of EGR-1 in rat primary astrocytes was readily detectable (data not shown). The basis of this effect was explored in detail in these cell lines (Fig.1). Steady-state EGR-1 expression was nearly undetectable in cells growing in complete medium containing 5–10% fetal bovine serum or in cells made quiescent by culturing in 0.5% serum for 24 h. Quiescent cells were treated with PMA, 20% fetal bovine serum, or 40 J/m2 UV for 2 h since these stimuli are known to induce both Egr-1 mRNA and EGR-1 protein synthesis (33.Sukhatme V.P. Cao X.

The EGR-1 protein was differentially induced by UV, PMA, and serum stimulation (Fig. 1). Moreover, the protein exhibits the characteristic broad band distribution centered at an apparent size of 85 kDa (5.Liu C. Rangnekar V.M. Adamson E. Mercola D.

This led us to investigate the functional effects of re-expression of Egr-1in glioblastoma cells. It is known that re-expressed EGR-1 inhibits proliferation and transformation of v-sis-transformed NIH/3T3 cells (38.Huang R.-P. Darland T. Okumura D. Mercola D. Adamson E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar) and human tumor cell lines such as fibrosarcoma HT-1080, osteosarcoma Saos2, glioblastoma U251 and U373, and breast carcinoma ZR75-1 (39.Huang R.-P. Liu C. Fan Y. Mercola D. Adamson E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5054-5062PubMed Google Scholar). In at least one case, it has been shown that EGR-1 directly activates the expression and secretion of active TGF-β1 (40.Liu C. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11831-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Several other proteins and activities that may be under the control of TGF-β1 also are increased, such as p21Waf1/Cip1 (41.de Belle I. Huang R.-P. Fan Y. Liu C. Mercola D. Adamson E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3633-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), fibronectin and PAI-1 (42.Liu C. Yao J. de Belle I. Huang R.-P. Adamson E. Mercola D. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3633-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-β1 is an important marker of functional EGR-1. To examine whether the induced expression of the EGR-1 protein in the stimulation of U251 cells increased the secretion of TGF-β1, we tested the TGF-β1 secretion in culture medium from normal parental cells, quiescent cells, and PMA-, UV-, and fetal bovine serum-stimulated cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, TGF-β1 secretion was greatly increased up to 9.8-fold following stimulation with PMA and 4.2-fold following stimulation with UV. However, TGF-β1 secretion was increased only a little in U251 cells following stimulation with fetal bovine serum. In contrast to the induction of EGR-1 expression by stimulation, the induction of TGF-β1 seemed not to correlate completely. Since the induction of TGF-β1 by mitogenic stimuli such as PMA, stress, and UV irradiation through the AP-1 (Jun-Fos) complex has been reported broadly (56.Kim S.-J. Denhez F. Kim K.Y. Holt J.T.

These studies examine the influence of TNF on ion channel opening and death in a model rat liver cell line (HTC). TNF (25 ng/ml) elicited a 2- and 5-fold increase in K+ and Cl− currents, respectively, in HTC cells. These increases occurred within 5–10 min after TNF exposure and were inhibited either by K+ or Cl−substitution or by K+ channel blockers (Ba2+, quinine, 0.1 mm each) or Cl− channel blockers (10 μm 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid and 0.1 mm N-phenylanthranilic acid), respectively. TNF-mediated increases in K+ and Cl− currents were each inhibited by intracellular Ca2+ chelation (5 mm EGTA), ATP depletion (4 units/ml apyrase), and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors chelerythrine (10 μm) or PKC 19–36 peptide (1 μm).

In liver, TNF exhibits pleiotropic effects, ranging from reduction of bile flow to hepatocellular apoptosis (10.Whiting J.F. Green R.M. Rosenbluth A.B Gollan J.L.

Despite this body of evidence, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the responsible pathways that couple TNF to liver damage.There is abundant information to suggest that apoptosis is associated with increases in mitochondrial membrane permeability but considerably less is known with respect to the role of the plasma membrane. In a limited number of cell types, increases in plasma membrane permeability to ions represent early responses to apoptotic stimuli. In cultured neurons, serum withdrawal increases voltage-activated K+channel activity and cell death, and in lymphocytes, engagement of the cell surface protein Fas leads to K+ loss, activation of outwardly rectifying Cl− channels, and apoptosis (18.Yu S.P. Yeh C.H. Sensi S.L. Gwag B.J. Canzoniero L.M. Farhangrazi Z.S. Ying H.S. Tian M. Dugan L.L. Choi D.W. Science. 1997; 278: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 19.Hughes Jr., F.M.

Gulbins E. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6169-6174Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Conversely, pharmacological blockade of K+ or Cl− channels blunts apoptosis in these experimental models. Thus, K+ and Cl− channels may play important roles in apoptotic processes.Based on its function in inducing apoptosis, there is reason to believe that TNF could influence cell death through activation of ion channels. In support of this, TNF increases K+ currents in selected neurons and activates Cl− currents in neutrophils (21.Houzen H. Kikuchi S. Kanno M. Shinpo K. Tashiro K. J Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,22.Schumann M.A. Gardner P. Raffin T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2134-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether TNF affects plasma membrane ion channels in other cell types or whether such channels are involved in TNF-mediated cell death. In this study, we have examined the effects of TNF on plasma membrane conductance and death in the model hepatocyte-like cell line HTC. Our results suggest that TNF activates K+ and Cl− channels and that channel activation is an early signal in pathways leading to TNF-mediated liver cell death.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined the role of plasma membrane ion channels in TNF signaling. Our observations suggest that TNF increases membrane permeability to K+ and Cl− in HTC cells through activation of ion channels and that TNF-mediated cell death is delayed by blockade of these channels. Our data are thus consistent with the hypothesis that channel opening is an early event in a TNF-mediated pathway that leads to liver cell death.Two principal findings support the concept that TNF activates K+ and Cl− channels. First, TNF increased membrane currents (I0 and I−80) at potentials corresponding to the opening of K+ and Cl−channels. Second, the TNF-evoked increases in these currents were selectively prevented by either K+ or Cl−removal or by exposure to K+ or Cl− channel blockers, respectively. Our data thus extend observations in neurons, in which TNF activates K+ channels (21.Houzen H. Kikuchi S. Kanno M. Shinpo K. Tashiro K. J Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and neutrophils, in which TNF activates Cl− channels (22.Schumann M.A. Gardner P. Raffin T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2134-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and demonstrate that TNF can activate K+ and Cl− channels in the same cell type.Unexpectedly, the TNF-elicited increase in K+ current (I0) was inhibited by Cl− removal. However, this current was not attenuated by Cl− channel blockers. This suggests that K+ channel opening does not depend on Cl− movement per se. Rather, it raises the possibility that Cl− binding itself affects K+channel kinetics. Precedent for such an effect exists in corneal epithelia, where extracellular Cl− is necessary for K+ channel opening (29.Rae J.L. Dewey J. Cooper K. Gates P. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 114: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The significance of this Cl− dependence in HTC cells is uncertain, but such a mechanism could coordinate the concerted opening of K+ and Cl− channels.The onset of K+ and Cl− current activation occurred within 3–5 min after TNF exposure. These observations implied that channel opening was mediated by an intracellular signaling cascade. Although the precise details of this cascade have not been defined in this study, our data suggest that PKC activation is involved. Consistent with this interpretation, the increase in both K+ and Cl− currents was blocked by (a) chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with EGTA, (b) hydrolysis of intracellular ATP with apyrase, and (c) two structurally unrelated PKC inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action, chelerythrine and PKC inhibitory peptide. In contrast to findings in neutrophils (22.Schumann M.A. Gardner P. Raffin T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2134-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our observations in liver cells indicated that TNF did not increase [Ca2+]i and that TNF-activated currents were not attenuated by inhibition of CaMKII. Thus, mechanisms that couple TNF to channel activation appear to exhibit tissue specificity.PKC has been identified as a mediator for several actions of TNF (30.Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Kampen E. Himmler A. Machleidt T. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17997-18001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Gorospe M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol.

Siebler M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1375-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the PKC isoforms responsible for the K+ and Cl− channel opening in HTC cells remain to be determined. Clues to the types of PKC isoforms involved come from a distinct experimental model of liver cell death, in which the bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid produces apoptosis in a PKC-dependent fashion. In this model, glycochenodeoxycholic acid elicits membrane translocation of PKC-α, PKC-δ, and PKC-ε (26.Jones B.A. Rao Y.P. Stravitz R.T. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1109-G1115PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that one (or more) of these PKC isoforms may be relevant to the actions of TNF described in the present study. In HTC cells, PKC-α appears to mediate the opening of K+ channels in response to oxidants and Cl−channels in response to swelling (27.Wang Y. Sostman A. Roman R. Stribling S. Vigna S. Hannun Y. Raymond J. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18107-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28.Roman R.M. Bodily K.O. Wang Y. Raymond J.R Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that PKC-α may also couple TNF to K+ and Cl−channel activation. This issue is worthy of experimental pursuit.Our findings regarding TNF and its effects on cell death mirror observations made by others in model liver cell systems (11.Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kim Y.M. de Vera M.E Watkins S.C Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In particular, TNF-mediated cell death required the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. This implies that TNF activates parallel transcription-dependent pathways (which appear to involve the transcription factor NF-κB, cf. Ref.11.Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which serve to prevent cell death. In our hands, liver cell death appeared to occur through both apoptosis and necrosis, given that TNF increased trypan blue uptake (characteristic of necrotic cell death) and the extent of nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation (characteristic of apoptosis) with similar kinetics. Of note, TNF-mediated K+ and Cl− channel activation (within minutes) and cessation of channel activation (by 1 h) occurred much earlier than the onset of cell death (within 4 h). This suggests that these channels occupy early positions in TNF-mediated signaling pathways. Furthermore, our findings raise the possibility that one of these pathways could lead to cell death. Consistent with this interpretation, we have shown that K+and Cl− channel blockers delay the progression to TNF-mediated liver cell death. With this in mind, K+ and Cl− channels may represent attractive therapeutic targets to attenuate liver injury from TNF.It should be emphasized that TNF alone was sufficient to evoke K+ and Cl− channel opening in HTC cells, but cell death required the addition of actinomycin D. This implies that signaling cascades enabled by K+ and Cl−channel opening would not overcome cytoprotective pathways disabled by actinomycin D (see above). In the presence of actinomycin D, K+ and Cl− channel blockade reduced cell death for up to 8 h after TNF exposure, a time in which near maximal cell death had occurred in the absence of channel blockade. However, K+ and Cl− channel blockade did not ultimately prevent TNF-mediated cell death. A possible interpretation is that K+ and Cl− channels participate in the early phases of TNF-mediated signaling pathways that lead to cell death but that later onset, channel-independent pathways are also involved in the death response to TNF. Precedent for this concept exists in biphasic activation of Jun and p38 kinases by TNF, the early phase of which is anti-apoptotic and the later phase of which appears to be linked to apoptosis (35.Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Similarly, in selected instances, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 may only delay cell death (36.Bissonnette R.P. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 37.Yin D.X. Schimke R.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4922-4928PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of parallel pathways to cell death that exhibit distinct temporal characteristics.Although our data support a role for K+ and Cl− channels in TNF-mediated liver cell death, two additional caveats apply. First, Ba2+, quinine, NPPB, and DPC, each of which delayed cell death induced by TNF, may have had effects other than blockade of K+ or Cl−channels. The use of structurally dissimilar agents renders this less likely, but the possibility of nonspecific effects cannot be discounted. Second, the observations reported here may not apply to all mammalian tissues. In particular, in astrocytes, TNF has been shown to inhibit rather than activate K+ currents (34.Koller H. Allert N. Oel D. Stoll G. Siebler M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1375-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the results reported in the present study must be extrapolated with care.An important question is how activation of K+ and Cl− channels contributes to downstream effects of TNF. One intriguing possibility is that K+ and Cl−efflux through conductive pathways leads to liver cell shrinkage. Although speculative, this could have at least two consequences. First, cell shrinkage itself can lead to apoptosis (38.Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 39.Kurz A.K. Schliess F. Haussinger D. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 774-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40.Bilney A.J. Murray A.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 41.Chan W.H., Yu, J.S. Yang S.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A second consequence could be reduction of bile formation, achieved through volume-sensitive inhibition of insertion of organic anion transporters into the apical membrane (42.Haussinger D. Saha N. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Gerok W. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 43.Kubitz R. D'urso D. Keppler D. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1438-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This too is consistent with effects of TNF, which reduces both bile flow as well as the abundance of plasma membrane organic anion transporters in hepatocytes (10.Whiting J.F. Green R.M. Rosenbluth A.B Gollan J.L. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 1273-1278PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Moseley R.H. Wang W. Takeda H. Lown K. Shick L. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G137-G146PubMed Google Scholar). These areas are worthy of further study and could lead to new insights with respect to TNF action. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF)1 is an inflammatory cytokine that induces programmed cell death in a variety of tissue types (1.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar).

Despite this body of evidence, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the responsible pathways that couple TNF to liver damage. There is abundant information to suggest that apoptosis is associated with increases in mitochondrial membrane permeability but considerably less is known with respect to the role of the plasma membrane. In a limited number of cell types, increases in plasma membrane permeability to ions represent early responses to apoptotic stimuli. In cultured neurons, serum withdrawal increases voltage-activated K+channel activity and cell death, and in lymphocytes, engagement of the cell surface protein Fas leads to K+ loss, activation of outwardly rectifying Cl− channels, and apoptosis (18.Yu S.P. Yeh C.H. Sensi S.L. Gwag B.J. Canzoniero L.M. Farhangrazi Z.S. Ying H.S. Tian M. Dugan L.L. Choi D.W. Science. 1997; 278: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 19.Hughes Jr., F.M.

Gulbins E. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6169-6174Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Conversely, pharmacological blockade of K+ or Cl− channels blunts apoptosis in these experimental models. Thus, K+ and Cl− channels may play important roles in apoptotic processes. Based on its function in inducing apoptosis, there is reason to believe that TNF could influence cell death through activation of ion channels. In support of this, TNF increases K+ currents in selected neurons and activates Cl− currents in neutrophils (21.Houzen H. Kikuchi S. Kanno M. Shinpo K. Tashiro K. J Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,22.Schumann M.A. Gardner P. Raffin T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2134-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether TNF affects plasma membrane ion channels in other cell types or whether such channels are involved in TNF-mediated cell death. In this study, we have examined the effects of TNF on plasma membrane conductance and death in the model hepatocyte-like cell line HTC. Our results suggest that TNF activates K+ and Cl− channels and that channel activation is an early signal in pathways leading to TNF-mediated liver cell death. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have examined the role of plasma membrane ion channels in TNF signaling. Our observations suggest that TNF increases membrane permeability to K+ and Cl− in HTC cells through activation of ion channels and that TNF-mediated cell death is delayed by blockade of these channels. Our data are thus consistent with the hypothesis that channel opening is an early event in a TNF-mediated pathway that leads to liver cell death.Two principal findings support the concept that TNF activates K+ and Cl− channels. First, TNF increased membrane currents (I0 and I−80) at potentials corresponding to the opening of K+ and Cl−channels. Second, the TNF-evoked increases in these currents were selectively prevented by either K+ or Cl−removal or by exposure to K+ or Cl− channel blockers, respectively. Our data thus extend observations in neurons, in which TNF activates K+ channels (21.Houzen H. Kikuchi S. Kanno M. Shinpo K. Tashiro K. J Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 990-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and neutrophils, in which TNF activates Cl− channels (22.Schumann M.A. Gardner P. Raffin T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2134-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and demonstrate that TNF can activate K+ and Cl− channels in the same cell type.Unexpectedly, the TNF-elicited increase in K+ current (I0) was inhibited by Cl− removal. However, this current was not attenuated by Cl− channel blockers. This suggests that K+ channel opening does not depend on Cl− movement per se. Rather, it raises the possibility that Cl− binding itself affects K+channel kinetics. Precedent for such an effect exists in corneal epithelia, where extracellular Cl− is necessary for K+ channel opening (29.Rae J.L. Dewey J. Cooper K. Gates P. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 114: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The significance of this Cl− dependence in HTC cells is uncertain, but such a mechanism could coordinate the concerted opening of K+ and Cl− channels.The onset of K+ and Cl− current activation occurred within 3–5 min after TNF exposure. These observations implied that channel opening was mediated by an intracellular signaling cascade. Although the precise details of this cascade have not been defined in this study, our data suggest that PKC activation is involved. Consistent with this interpretation, the increase in both K+ and Cl− currents was blocked by (a) chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with EGTA, (b) hydrolysis of intracellular ATP with apyrase, and (c) two structurally unrelated PKC inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action, chelerythrine and PKC inhibitory peptide. In contrast to findings in neutrophils (22.Schumann M.A. Gardner P. Raffin T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2134-2140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our observations in liver cells indicated that TNF did not increase [Ca2+]i and that TNF-activated currents were not attenuated by inhibition of CaMKII. Thus, mechanisms that couple TNF to channel activation appear to exhibit tissue specificity.PKC has been identified as a mediator for several actions of TNF (30.Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Kampen E.

Siebler M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1375-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the PKC isoforms responsible for the K+ and Cl− channel opening in HTC cells remain to be determined. Clues to the types of PKC isoforms involved come from a distinct experimental model of liver cell death, in which the bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid produces apoptosis in a PKC-dependent fashion. In this model, glycochenodeoxycholic acid elicits membrane translocation of PKC-α, PKC-δ, and PKC-ε (26.Jones B.A. Rao Y.P. Stravitz R.T. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1109-G1115PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that one (or more) of these PKC isoforms may be relevant to the actions of TNF described in the present study. In HTC cells, PKC-α appears to mediate the opening of K+ channels in response to oxidants and Cl−channels in response to swelling (27.Wang Y. Sostman A. Roman R. Stribling S. Vigna S. Hannun Y. Raymond J. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18107-18113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28.Roman R.M. Bodily K.O. Wang Y. Raymond J.R Fitz J.G. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that PKC-α may also couple TNF to K+ and Cl−channel activation. This issue is worthy of experimental pursuit.Our findings regarding TNF and its effects on cell death mirror observations made by others in model liver cell systems (11.Xu Y. Bialik S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1402-1411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In particular, TNF-mediated cell death required the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. This implies that TNF activates parallel transcription-dependent pathways (which appear to involve the transcription factor NF-κB, cf. Ref.11.Xu Y. Bialik S. Jones B.E Iimuro Y. Kitsis R.N Srinivasan A. Brenner D.A. Czaja M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1058-C1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which serve to prevent cell death. In our hands, liver cell death appeared to occur through both apoptosis and necrosis, given that TNF increased trypan blue uptake (characteristic of necrotic cell death) and the extent of nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation (characteristic of apoptosis) with similar kinetics. Of note, TNF-mediated K+ and Cl− channel activation (within minutes) and cessation of channel activation (by 1 h) occurred much earlier than the onset of cell death (within 4 h). This suggests that these channels occupy early positions in TNF-mediated signaling pathways. Furthermore, our findings raise the possibility that one of these pathways could lead to cell death. Consistent with this interpretation, we have shown that K+and Cl− channel blockers delay the progression to TNF-mediated liver cell death. With this in mind, K+ and Cl− channels may represent attractive therapeutic targets to attenuate liver injury from TNF.It should be emphasized that TNF alone was sufficient to evoke K+ and Cl− channel opening in HTC cells, but cell death required the addition of actinomycin D. This implies that signaling cascades enabled by K+ and Cl−channel opening would not overcome cytoprotective pathways disabled by actinomycin D (see above). In the presence of actinomycin D, K+ and Cl− channel blockade reduced cell death for up to 8 h after TNF exposure, a time in which near maximal cell death had occurred in the absence of channel blockade. However, K+ and Cl− channel blockade did not ultimately prevent TNF-mediated cell death. A possible interpretation is that K+ and Cl− channels participate in the early phases of TNF-mediated signaling pathways that lead to cell death but that later onset, channel-independent pathways are also involved in the death response to TNF. Precedent for this concept exists in biphasic activation of Jun and p38 kinases by TNF, the early phase of which is anti-apoptotic and the later phase of which appears to be linked to apoptosis (35.Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Similarly, in selected instances, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 may only delay cell death (36.Bissonnette R.P. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 37.Yin D.X. Schimke R.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4922-4928PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of parallel pathways to cell death that exhibit distinct temporal characteristics.Although our data support a role for K+ and Cl− channels in TNF-mediated liver cell death, two additional caveats apply. First, Ba2+, quinine, NPPB, and DPC, each of which delayed cell death induced by TNF, may have had effects other than blockade of K+ or Cl−channels. The use of structurally dissimilar agents renders this less likely, but the possibility of nonspecific effects cannot be discounted. Second, the observations reported here may not apply to all mammalian tissues. In particular, in astrocytes, TNF has been shown to inhibit rather than activate K+ currents (34.Koller H. Allert N. Oel D. Stoll G. Siebler M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1375-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the results reported in the present study must be extrapolated with care.An important question is how activation of K+ and Cl− channels contributes to downstream effects of TNF. One intriguing possibility is that K+ and Cl−efflux through conductive pathways leads to liver cell shrinkage. Although speculative, this could have at least two consequences. First, cell shrinkage itself can lead to apoptosis (38.Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 39.Kurz A.K. Schliess F. Haussinger D.

Yang S.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 178: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A second consequence could be reduction of bile formation, achieved through volume-sensitive inhibition of insertion of organic anion transporters into the apical membrane (42.Haussinger D. Saha N. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Gerok W. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 43.Kubitz R. D'urso D. Keppler D. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1438-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This too is consistent with effects of TNF, which reduces both bile flow as well as the abundance of plasma membrane organic anion transporters in hepatocytes (10.Whiting J.F. Green R.M. Rosenbluth A.B Gollan J.L. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 1273-1278PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Moseley R.H. Wang W. Takeda H. Lown K. Shick L. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Am. J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) revealed the involvement of a surprisingly complex cascade of reactions in the maturation process in which numerous auxiliary proteins are implicated. One class of them was found to participate in metal center assembly by stabilizing a partially unfolded apoprotein conformation that is competent for the specific binding of a metal ion or a metal cofactor (1.Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2.Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B.

This mechanism is reminiscent of the role postulated for molecular chaperones, which facilitate the correct folding of nascent polypeptide chains in vivo but are not components of the final structures. Accordingly, these particular auxiliary proteins were designated specific chaperone-type proteins (1.Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2.Blasco F. Dos Santos J.P. Magalon A. Frixon C. Guigliarelli B. Santini C.L. Giordano G. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), their mode of action and the basis of their specificity being not yet fully understood. One type of enzymes whose metal center formation has been studied in some detail are hydrogenases. They play a central role in the metabolism of many microorganisms by catalyzing the production or consumption of molecular hydrogen according to the reaction, H2 ↔ 2H+ + 2e−. These enzymes can be divided into two major families: iron-only hydrogenases ([Fe]-hydrogenases) and nickel-iron hydrogenases ([NiFe]-hydrogenases) (6.Wu L.F. Mandrand M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 10: 243-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Przybyla A.E. Robbins J. Menon N. Peck Jr., H.D. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 8: 109-135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are composed of a small electron transfer subunit (28–35 kDa) and a large catalytic subunit (45–65 kDa). In [NiFe]-hydrogenases, the large subunit harbors the metal center ligated to the protein by one motif in the amino-terminal portion of the polypeptide (RXCX 2CX 3H) and a second one at the carboxyl-terminal region (DPCX 2CX 2(H/R)) (6.Wu L.F. Mandrand M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 10: 243-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). A major and so far highly conserved characteristic of [NiFe]-hydrogenases is their complex biogenesis, which involves at least seven accessory gene products (9.Maier T. Böck A. Hausinger R.P. Eichhorn G.L. Marzilli L.G. Mechanisms of Metallocenter Assembly. VCH, New York1996: 173-192Google Scholar). Although this pathway is far from being understood, substantial progress has been made regarding the maturation of the catalytic subunit. A current model suggests that maturation is initiated by the binding of iron together with the diatomic ligands followed by nickel insertion. Finally, the metal-containing precursor is converted to the mature form by proteolytic removal of a C-terminal extension, mediated by a specific protease (10.Binder U. Maier T. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11.Maier T. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12.Rossmann R. Sauter M.

Biochem. 1995; 227: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of one of these proteases, namely the hydrogenase 2-specific protease ofEscherichia coli, HybD (14.Fritsche E. Paschos A. Beisel H.G. Böck A. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), has been resolved recently by x-ray crystallography. Another accessory protein, HypC, is a specific chaperone-type protein required for the maturation of the catalytic subunit of the hydrogenase 3 (5.Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Such genes coding for auxiliary proteins have been found in all organisms synthesizing [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Here we report on the interaction between the precursor form (pre-HycE) of the large subunit of the hydrogenase 3 from E. coli and the chaperone-type protein HypC. We identified cysteines both in HypC and pre-HycE as being essential for the interaction. A model is presented for the role of the cysteine residues of pre-HycE in the metal incorporation process. E. coli DH5α was used as host for plasmid construction and maintenance. The other strains employed in this study were derivatives of E. coli MC4100 (15.Casadaban M.J. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4530-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), namely HD705 (MC4100, ΔhycE) (16.Sauter M. Böhm R. Böck A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), HD709 (MC4100, ΔhycI) (10.Binder U. Maier T. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and DHP-C (MC4100, ΔhypC) (17.Jacobi A. Rossmann R. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by recombinant polymerase chain reaction either on the pACE1 plasmid (18.Theodoratou E. Paschos A. Mintz-Weber S. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 173: 110-116Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) to yield hycE mutants or on the pJA1021 plasmid (17.Jacobi A. Rossmann R. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) to yield hypC mutants. The Expand High Fidelity polymerase chain reaction system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. This approach is based on the polymerase chain reaction amplification of an entire plasmid DNA by mutagenic primers divergently oriented but overlapping in their 5′-ends (19.Ansaldi M. Lepelletier M. Mejean V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 110-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20.Du Z. Regier D.A. Desrosiers R.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 376-378PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 62-66PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting linear DNA molecules are then transformed into therecA − DH5α strain and replicating circles are subsequently recovered by recombination between the homologous ends of the linear template. The cysteine residues at positions 241, 244, 531, and 534 of HycE were replaced by alanine via this procedure using the following primer pairs: EC241A-EC241Arev, EC244A-EC244Arev, EC531A-EC531Arev, and EC534A-EC534Arev (Table I). The Cys2and the Pro6 residues of HypC were replaced using the following primer pairs: HypC2rev-HypC2A, HypC2rev-HypC2S, HypC2rev-HypC2R, and HypCP6rev-HypCP6 (TableI). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting mutated plasmids were used to transformE. coli HD705 in the case of the pACE1 derivatives or DHP-C in the case of the pJA1021 plasmid series.Table IOligonucleotide primers used in this workDesignationsSequences (5′ to 3′)EC241AGCAGATCCCGGCCACACGGTCAGAGAGCEC241revGGGATCTGCGGCTTTGCCCACAGCACCEC244AGGCAAAGCCGGCGATCCCGCACACACGGEC244ArevGGCTTTGCCCACAGCACCGCCTACACCEC531AACAGGAGTAGGCAGGGTCGAGGCTACCEC531ArevTACTCCTGTACCGACCGCATGACCGTCEC534AGCGGTCGGTAGCGGAGTAGCAAGGGTCEC534ArevACCGACCGCATGACCGTGGTCGATGTGHypC2revATAGGCGTTCCCGGCCAGATCCGCACCATTGACGGHypC2AGCCGGGAACGCCTATGGCCATCGCTGTGTCTCCHypC2SGCCGGGAACGCCTATGCTCATCGCTGTGTCTCCHypC2RGCCGGGAACGCCTATGCGCATCGCTGTGTCTCCHypCP6GATCTGGCCGG(A/T/C)AACGCCTATGCACATCGCHypCP6revGGCCAGATCCGCACCATTGACGGCAACCAG Open table in a new tab Strains were cultivated anaerobically in TGYEP medium containing 30 mmsodium formate as described previously (5.Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and supplemented with a 1 μm concentration each of sodium molybdate and sodium selenite and 5 μm nickel chloride. When required, chloramphenicol was added at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. Following the addition of a 1% inoculum, cultures were grown at 37 °C until they reached an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm (A 600). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cytoplasmic fractions obtained by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g (named S100 extracts), and crude extracts were prepared as described previously (5.Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Total hydrogenase activity of crude extracts was assayed by H2-dependent reduction of benzyl viologen as described by Ballantine and Boxer (22.Ballantine S.P. Boxer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 454-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed in μmol of H2/min/mg of total protein. Proteins separated on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel by using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blotted with anti-HycE antibody (1:1000) or anti-HypC antibody (1:500). For antibody detection, the protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) and the Chemiluminescent Lumilight kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals were used. Electrophoresis on nondenaturing gels was conducted as described previously (5.Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), employing 40 μg of total protein from S100 extracts. Strains were cultivated at 37 °C in 250 ml of TGYEP medium supplemented with 30 mmformate, 1 μm sodium molybdate, 1 μm sodium selenite, and 150 nm63Ni (specific radioactivity, 190 μCi/μmol). At an A 600 of 1.0–1.2, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing a 30 μg/ml concentration each of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and DNase I. S100 extracts were then prepared and applied onto a 10% nondenaturing gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography for 1 week. 40 μg of total protein from S100 extracts were incubated for 15 min with or without 15 mm dithiothreitol followed by the addition of one-fourth volume of 0.5 m iodoacetamide or potassium iodoacetate in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.7. After 5 min or 30 min at room temperature, the samples were mixed with the sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Among the auxiliary proteins required for hydrogenase maturation is a family of small proteins from 80 to 110 residues in size with an acidic character (pI ∼4–5). They are products of hypC, hybG, or hupF genes. It was shown that HypC from E. coli is able to form a stable complex with the immature form of the large subunit of the hydrogenase 3, HycE (5.Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid-derived sequence of HypC with those of homologs from other organisms is given in Fig.1. Noteworthy is the presence of a conserved motif at the amino-terminal part of the protein, namely MC(L/I/V)(G/A)(L/I/V)P. Amino-terminal sequencing of the purified HypC protein indicated that the methionine residue is post-translationally removed (data not shown), yielding an N terminus with a reactive thiolate. To examine its possible role in the maturation process, this cysteine residue (Cys2) and Pro6 from HypC were chosen as candidates for site-directed mutagenesis and were replaced individually by either neutral (alanine and serine) or charged (arginine) amino acids and by alanine and threonine, respectively. The resulting pJA1021 derivatives carrying the mutated genes were used to transform strain DHP-C, which lacks the chromosomal hypCgene. The transformants were grown under fermentative conditions, and the cells were analyzed for H2-dependent benzyl viologen reduction (Table II) and for processing of the large subunit HycE (Fig.2). Transformants carrying plasmids in which Cys2 of HypC was replaced were devoid of hydrogenase 3 activity, supporting the idea that the maturation of the enzyme may be blocked. In contrast, replacement of Pro6 had no effect. To ascertain that the cellular level of the mutant proteins was not changed, the transformants were analyzed by immunoblotting. It was found that under fermentative conditions they produced the same amount of HypC as present in the strain transformed with the plasmid carrying the wild-type hypC gene (data not shown). Fig. 2 displays the immunoblotting analysis of the maturation state of HycE in the transformants carrying the different hypC alleles. HycE was present in the parental strain MC4100 in the mature form (Fig. 2,lane 1) and in the DHP-C strain in the precursor form (Fig. 2, lane 3). DHP-C transformants with the pJA1021 plasmid (Fig. 2, lane 4) or that coding for the Pro6 variant (data not shown) exhibited a partial restoration of the maturation of HycE, confirming that these substitutions did not abolish the HypC function. Laser densitometry analysis indicated that the processing level was approximately 30%, which agrees with previous findings (17.Jacobi A. Rossmann R. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) that complementation of a DHP-C strain by the respective gene in trans restores maturation of hydrogenase 3 only to a limited extent. The lack of full complementation has been interpreted previously by the assumption that maturation follows a channeled pathway that requires the stoichiometric amount and activity of the components involved (17.Jacobi A. Rossmann R. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24.Menon N.K. Robbins J. Wendt J.C. Shanmugam K.T. Przybyla A.E. J.

Any effect of overexpression of the hypC gene in trans on the maturation process can be ruled out (Table II). In agreement with the inability of the Cys2 mutant proteins to support the generation of hydrogenase activity, HycE is not processed in these strains (Fig. 2, lanes 5–7).Table IITotal hydrogenase activity of wild-type and mutant E. coli strainsStrainEnzyme activityμmol H2 min −1 mg −1 total proteinsMC41000.56MC4100/pJA10210.52DHP-C aThe basal value of HD705 (ΔhycE) or of DHP-C (ΔhypC) represents the activities of hydrogenases 1 and 2.0.06DHP-C/pJA10210.18DHP-C/pJA1021(C2A)0.01DHP-C/pJA1021(C2S)0.01DHP-C/pJA1021(C2R)0.01DHP-C/pJA1021(P6A)0.17DHP-C/pJA1021(P6T)0.16HD705 aThe basal value of HD705 (ΔhycE) or of DHP-C (ΔhypC) represents the activities of hydrogenases 1 and 2.0.05HD705/pACE10.54HD705/pACE1(C241A)0.05HD705/pACE1(C244A)0.05HD705/pACE1(C531A)0.06HD705/pACE1(C534A)0.06Cells were grown under anaerobic conditions in TGYEP medium.

Open table in a new tab Cells were grown under anaerobic conditions in TGYEP medium. Values give the average of data from three independent experiments. To gain further insight into the impairment of the HypC function, the ability of the HypC variants to form a complex with the precursor form of HycE during the maturation process was examined. A ND-PAGE system was employed to study in vivo complex formation between HypC and pre-HycE (5.Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). S100 extracts from strains transformed with the different plasmids were separated by ND-PAGE, and Western blot experiments were performed using antisera directed against HypC. The results show that the Cys2 mutants were no longer able to form a complex with the immature form of HycE (Fig.3). They migrate in the position of free HypC with the interesting exception of the C2S variant. There is no obvious explanation for its retarded migration, but it could be the consequence of some modification at the hydroxyl or at the amino group of the amino-terminal serine. Again, the variant in which Pro6 was replaced showed the same pattern as the wild-type protein (data not shown). The drastic effect of the cysteine substitutions in HypC raised the question of the nature of its interaction with pre-HycE. In view of the specificity of the interaction and of the deleterious effect of the C2 replacement in HypC, a plausible assumption was that one of the conserved cysteine residues in HycE may be also involved. Hence, each of the cysteine residues present in the two nickel-binding motifs of HycE were substituted by an alanine residue via site-directed mutagenesis, which led to genes coding for the C241A, C244A, C531A, and C534A mutant HycE proteins. Under fermentative conditions, none of the mutants exhibited hydrogenase 3 activity (Table II). These observations were corroborated by the results of the immunoblotting analysis of HycE. As already noted previously for other auxiliary proteins involved in hydrogenase maturation (17.Jacobi A. Rossmann R. Böck A. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 18.Theodoratou E. Paschos A. Mintz-Weber S. Böck A. Arch.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4851-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26.Massanz C. Friedrich B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14330-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the deletion of the chromosomalhycE gene cannot be fully complemented by expression ofhycE in trans (Fig.4, lane 3), possibly because of some imbalance in stoichiometry between pre-HycE and the components of the maturation machinery. Despite a low processing level, the expression of hycE in transyielded hydrogenase 3 activity nearly identical to that of the parental strain (Table II). With the striking exception of the C534A mutant, none of the other mutant proteins were subjected to HycI-mediated proteolysis (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, therefore, replacement of Cys534 by alanine allows C-terminal processing but prevents development of hydrogenase activity (Table II). We then investigated whether the mutated HycE polypeptides, notably the C534A variant, could incorporate nickel. To this end, cultures were grown in presence of 63Ni, S100 extracts were separated by ND-PAGE, and 63Ni-labeled proteins were identified by autoradiography (Fig. 5) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). In the case of the parental strain MC4100 (Fig. 5, lane 1,band 1), a major 63Ni signal comigrated with material immunoreacting with antiserum directed against HycE. It corresponds to the mature form of HycE as displayed by ND-PAGE (Fig. 6 A, lane 1). In addition, a slower migrating 63Ni-labeled protein band also present in the HD705 extract (which is devoid of the hycE gene) can be seen (Fig. 5, lane 2). It may represent the large subunit of either hydrogenase 1 or 2. In the case of the HD709 extract, two major pre-HycE conformers produced in absence of the HycI protease and identified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6 A,lane 3) contained 63Ni (Fig. 5,lane 3, bands 2 and3), one of them being associated with HypC (band 2) (see Fig. 6). Finally, from the four HycE variants, only that carrying the C534A replacement gave a 63Ni-labeled protein band that immunoreacted with anti-HycE antiserum and was equivalent to the signal obtained with the transformant carrying the plasmid with the wild-type hycE gene (Fig. 5,lanes 5 and 9, band 1). These results support the notion that nickel incorporation in the C534A variant is not accompanied by the generation of hydrogenase 3 activity.Figure 6Immunoblotting analysis of HypC-pre-HycE complex formation in transformants carrying mutated hycEalleles on a plasmid.

Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As expected, the C534A protein that underwent HycI-mediated processing was able to specifically interact with HypC (Fig. 6 B, lane 7). The same result was obtained for the transformants possessing the HycE variants C244A and C531A. On the other hand, the C241A variant was unable to interact with HypC (Fig. 6 B). It was previously pointed out (5.Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that only a certain conformer of pre-HycE is competent to bind HypC (Fig.6 A, lane 3, band 2), whereas the majority of the immature polypeptide cannot participate in this interaction (Fig. 6 A, lane 3, band 3), at least under the experimental conditions employed. Indeed, the absence of the characteristic fastest migrating immunoreactive form of HycE in the C241A mutant (Fig. 6 A, lane 4,band 2) is paralleled by the absence of a HypC-pre-HycE complex (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). The results described thus far had indicated that cysteine residues both in HypC and HycE are essential for the complex formation between the two proteins. This prompted the analysis of whether the formation of a disulfide bridge could be responsible for the protein-protein interaction. For this purpose, S100 extracts of strain HD709, which contain large amount of the complex (Fig. 6 B, lane 3), were analyzed under both reducing and nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting analysis using antiserum directed against HycE. There was no alteration of the migration of the HycE polypeptide under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 7,lanes 2 and 5). As a control, extracts from strain DHP-C (ΔhypC), which contain the precursor form of HycE, were analyzed under identical conditions, and an identical pattern was observed. These observations provide circumstantial evidence that HypC does not interact with pre-HycE via the formation of a disulfide bridge that under nonreducing conditions should give rise to a slower migrating species. To further characterize the interaction, HD709 extracts were treated with different alkylating or reducing reagents and then separated by ND-PAGE. Although some dissociation occurred as indicated by the appearance of free HypC, the presence of 10 or 25 mmdithiothreitol was not sufficient to fully resolve the complex (data not shown). In the absence of reducing agents, the complex is extremely stable, since no dissociation is detectable after 2 h of incubation. The amenability of the cysteine residues within the complex to alkylation was then determined by their reaction with iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide. Thiols potentially masked in disulfide bonds under these native conditions were reduced by preincubation with dithiothreitol, and the electrophoretic behavior of HypC associated or not with pre-HycE was examined by ND-PAGE. The reaction of such S100 extracts from strain HD709 treated with each of the alkylating agents either under reducing or nonreducing conditions resulted in the complete dissociation of the complex after only 5 min of incubation (Fig. 8). Any accessible thiolate group not involved in disulfide bond formation should react and subsequently carry one negative charge after modification with iodoacetic acid. The different electrophoretic mobility of the liberated HypC revealed that alkylation of the protein had occurred. A key role in the maturation process of [NiFe]-hydrogenases has been demonstrated recently for the chaperone-type protein HypC and its interaction with the HycE apoprotein of the E. colihydrogenase 3 (5.Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This complex has been identified in each of the mutants with a lesion in hyp genes, supporting the idea that its formation may constitute an early step in the maturation process (5.Drapal N. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present work, it was shown that cysteine residues both from HypC and the precursor form from the large subunit are crucial for the interaction. Fig. 9 displays the function of the thiolates in liganding the [NiFe] cluster in the mature subunit (Fig. 9 A) as delineated from the three-dimensional structure of the Desulfovibrio gigas enzyme (8.Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar) and compares it with the role postulated for these thiolates during the maturation process on the basis of the results reported (Fig. 9 B). The proposed model implies that (i) Cys241 is masked in pre-HycE by the interaction with HypC, (ii) Cys244coordinates the iron, (iii) Cys531 coordinates the nickel, and (iv) Cys534 provides a free thiolate attacking the nickel and iron atoms after proteolytic removal of the carboxyl terminus and thereby closes the bridge. Below we will discuss the evidence available that supports this model. When each of the four cysteine residues playing a role in the ligation of the [NiFe] cluster of the mature subunit was replaced by an alanine, the C241A variant was the only one that was no longer able to interact with HypC. It is assumed that the effect is specific, since an identical replacement of Cys244 only 3 residues away allowed the interaction to take place. In addition, exchange of the well conserved Arg239 residue by leucine also in close vicinity of Cys241 did not prevent complex formation. 2A. Magalon and A. Böck, unpublished results. It is assumed that Cys241 of pre-HycE directly or indirectly interacts with Cys2 from the HypC protein. The chemical nature of the interaction is unknown at present and requires the purification of substantial amounts of the maturation intermediate. It could consist in the interaction of each thiol as hydrogen donor with a strong acceptor group from the other partner. Alternatives would be that the thiols of Cys2 of HypC and Cys241of HycE could be sandwiched by some metal ion, like iron or zinc. However, the in vitro addition of chelating agents as EDTA or 2,2′dipyridyl has no influence on the complex stability (data not shown). Interestingly, once the complex is formed it cannot be titrated by a surplus of a HypC variant in which the N-terminal cysteine was replaced by an alanine or serine residue.2 If the interaction were noncovalent and assuming that the specificity of recognition is not only determined by the two cysteine residues, this should have been the case. Disulfide bonding as a possibility can be ruled out because the complex is readily dissociated by iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide and because no migration difference of the complex under SDS-PAGE was observed under oxidative compared with reducing conditions. There are substantial number of arguments that the two metals are incorporated separately into the precursor of HycE. The most convincing ones are that the precursor formed in a strain grown in absence of nickel can be matured in vitro by the addition of nickel alone (11.Maier T. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10089-10093Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This provides support for the contention that iron has already been incorporated and that nickel is inserted independently as a late step. Furthermore, the maturation endopeptidase scans the precursor for the presence of nickel by binding to the metal, which excludes the existence of the bridged cluster (14.Fritsche E. Paschos A. Beisel H.G. Böck A. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27.Theodoratou E. Paschos A. Magalon A. Fritsche E. Huber R. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1995-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Evidence that Cys244 carries the iron in the precursor can only be deduced from the structure of the mature cluster (8.Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). The direct interaction between Cys541 and nickel, however, has been proven in the case of [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio baculatus in which the cysteine is naturally substituted by a selenocysteine whose selenium atom has been shown to directly interact with nickel (28.He S.H. Teixeira M. LeGall J. Patil D.S. Moura I. Moura J.J. DerVartanian D.V. Huynh B.H. Peck Jr., H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2678-2682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Eidsness M.K. Scott R.A. Prickril B.C. DerVartanian D.V. Legall J. Moura I. Moura J.J. Peck Jr., H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An intriguing finding was also that Cys534 of HycE is not essential for maturation. The C534A variant forms a complex with HypC, accepts nickel, and is proteolytically processed but does not yield an active enzyme. Incorporation of nickel and processing, although not interaction with HypC, was recently demonstrated for an analogous mutant in the large subunit of the NAD-reducing hydrogenase ofAlcaligenes eutrophus (26.Massanz C. Friedrich B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14330-14337Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cys534, which provides the thiolate for bridging the iron and the nickel in the mature cluster, does not interact with the metals during the maturation process. Based on these results, a working model on the sequence of events in the assembly of the [NiFe] center is proposed (Fig. 9). First, the thiolate of Cys241 is masked by interaction with HypC. Since nickel can be incorporated into this complex, Cys241 cannot be involved in the initial ligation of the metals of the center. Second, iron binding takes place at Cys244, and nickel is coordinated by Cys531. The key intermediate for the assembly of metal center, therefore, is the complex between pre-HycE carrying the iron at Cys244and the chaperone-type protein HypC. It is assumed that the C terminus of HycE sticks out of the complex so that nickel can be added to Cys531. By an unknown reaction, the linkage between pre-HycE and HypC is then cleaved, rendering pre-HycE a substrate for the endopeptidase. Only nickel-containing pre-HycE from which HypC has been released can be cleaved by the endopeptidase.2 This cleavage triggers a conformational switch feeding the C terminus toward the two metals and closing the bridge between them by reaction with the free thiol of Cys534. For a proof of this model, a number of questions have to be answered. The most relevant ones are the disclosure of the chemical nature of the interaction of pre-HycE with HypC and the determination of the reaction that leads to the release of HypC. We thank Dr. F. Lottspeich for the amino-terminal sequencing analysis of HypC and valuable discussions and Dr. R. Glass for helpful discussions and advice."
https://openalex.org/W2088681937,"The Notch signal transduction pathway is a highly conserved regulatory system that controls multiple developmental processes. We have established an erythroleukemia cell model to study how Notch regulates cell fate and erythroleukemic cell differentiation. K562 and HEL cells expressed the Notch-1 receptor and the Notch ligand Jagged-1. The stable expression of the constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch-1 (NIC-1) in K562 cells inhibited erythroid without affecting megakaryocytic maturation. Expression of antisense Notch-1 induced spontaneous erythroid maturation. Suppression of erythroid maturation by NIC-1 did not result from down-regulation of GATA-1 and TAL-1, transcription factors necessary for erythroid differentiation. Microarray gene expression analysis identified genes activated during erythroid maturation, and NIC-1 disrupted the maturation-dependent changes in the expression of these genes. These results show that NIC-1 alters the pattern of gene expression in K562 cells leading to a block in erythroid maturation and therefore suggest that Notch signaling may control the developmental potential of normal and malignant erythroid progenitor cells."

The parasite exhibits an intricate life cycle in which the extracellular, flagellated promastigote exists in the phlebotomine sandfly vector, and the intracellular amastigote resides in the phagolysosome of macrophages and other reticuloendothelial cells of the mammalian host. Drugs are the only defense against visceral leishmaniasis, but the efficacy of these empirically derived agents is compromised both by drug toxicity and resistance (1.Grogl M. Thomason T.N. Franke E.D. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1992; 47: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, it is increasingly imperative to identify new and unique biochemical targets in the parasite for potential therapeutic exploitation. Among the most conspicuous metabolic differences between parasites and their mammalian hosts is the purine pathway. Whereas animal cells synthesize purine nucleotides de novo, all protozoan parasites are incapable of synthesizing purines and depend upon purine acquisition from their hosts to survive and proliferate (2.Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Müller M. Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1995: 89-117Google Scholar). Hence, each genus of parasite has evolved a unique complement of purine salvage enzymes in order to scavenge purines from the host milieu (2.Berens R.L. Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Marr J.J. Müller M. Purine and Pyrimidine Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1995: 89-117Google Scholar). The first step in this salvage process involves the translocation of purines across the parasite plasma membrane, a process mediated by membrane permeases. These permeases also initiate the uptake of pyrazolopyrimidine nucleobase and nucleoside analogs of hypoxanthine and inosine that are selectively toxic to Leishmania spp. (3.Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4.Marr J.J. Berens R.L. Cohn N.K. Nelson D.J. Klein R.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 25: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, purine transporters play vital roles in both purine nutrition and antiparasitic drug targeting intimating that these membrane proteins could be targets for either inhibitor or cytotoxic ligand development. Genetic and biochemical investigations have demonstrated that L. donovani promastigotes express two nucleoside transport activities of nonoverlapping ligand specificity (5.Iovannisci D.M. Kaur K. Young L. Ullman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The first, LdNT1, transports adenosine, pyrimidine nucleosides, and the cytotoxic adenosine analog tubercidin, and the second, LdNT2, recognizes inosine, guanosine, and the cytotoxic inosine isomer formycin B (FoB)1 (5.Iovannisci D.M. Kaur K. Young L. Ullman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6.Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). MutantL. donovani clones deficient in LdNT1 or LdNT2 activity have been isolated by virtue of their resistance to either tubercidin or FoB, respectively (5.Iovannisci D.M. Kaur K. Young L. Ullman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The availability of these transport-deficient mutants and the ability to transfect Leishmania with cosmid expression libraries (7.Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) provided an avenue for cloning the genes encoding nucleoside transporter proteins by selecting for functional recovery of the wild type drug sensitivity phenotype and, thus, nucleoside transport capability. This functional rescue scheme was previously employed to clone the LdNT1 locus (8.Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Functional rescue has now been exploited to isolate LdNT2. LdNT2 is present as a single copy gene within the leishmanial genome and encodes a transcript of ∼3 kb. Functional expression ofLdNT2 in nucleoside transport-deficient L. donovani and in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed LdNT2 to be a novel high affinity inosine-guanosine transporter with a singular predicted membrane topology. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or Life Technologies, Inc. Radiolabeledd-[2,8-3H]inosine (31.3 Ci mmol−1) andd-[8-3H]guanosine (5.0 Ci mmol−1) were purchased from Moravek (Brea, CA). α-[32P]dCTP (3000 Ci mmol−1) was procured from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Hygromycin B was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and G418 from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). All other chemicals, materials, and reagents were of the highest grade commercially available and bought from either Aldrich or Sigma. L. donovani wild type (DI700) and LdNT2-deficient (FBD5) parasites (5.Iovannisci D.M. Kaur K. Young L. Ullman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were propagated at 26 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-Leishmania (DME-L) medium (9.Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) containing 100 μm xanthine as a purine source. The FBD5 cells were maintained continuously in DME-L supplemented with 1 μm FoB to ensure that the population did not harbor any wild type revertants. Transfectants were propagated in DME-L supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μg ml−1 of hygromycin B (DME-L/FBS/HYG). To isolate cosmids containing LdNT2, 30 independent transfections were performed, using previously reported parameters (10.Descoteaux A. Garraway L.A. Ryan K.A. Garrity L.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 22-48Google Scholar), on exponentially growing FBD5 cells resuspended at 1 × 108 cells ml−1 in electroporation buffer (10.Descoteaux A. Garraway L.A. Ryan K.A. Garrity L.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 22-48Google Scholar). FBD5 promastigotes were transfected with 10 μg of DNA prepared from a cosmid library of L. donovani Ld4 strain DNA in the shuttle vector cLHYG, which encompasses the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (7.Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transfectants were maintained in the absence of hygromycin B for 24 h post-transfection, after which time they were plated on semi-solid (1% Noble agar, Difco) DME-L/FBS/HYG and incubated at 26 °C in 5% CO2. After 2–3 weeks, isolated colonies were picked and inoculated into individual wells of 96-well microtiter plates containing 200 μl of DME-L/FBS/HYG and proliferated at 26 °C in 5% CO2 until individual wells contained at least 5 × 106 cells ml−1. To screen for FoB-sensitive FBD5 transfectants, aliquots of 10 μl from individual wells of the master microtiter plate were transferred into wells of two replica 96-well microtiter plates, one plate containing DME-L/FBS/HYG supplemented with 1 μm FoB and the other containing DME-L/FBS/HYG alone. Clones that were determined to be susceptible to 1 μm FoB were expanded from the appropriate wells in the master microtiter plates, and the cosmids were rescued from these transfectants by alkaline lysis (10.Descoteaux A. Garraway L.A. Ryan K.A. Garrity L.K. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 1: 22-48Google Scholar). Cosmids F30F12 and F44H9 were subjected to restriction digestion with BamHI, BglII,EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII,NotI, SacII, and XbaI. To localize theLdNT2 gene within the F30F12 cosmid, various restriction fragments were subcloned into the leishmanial shuttle vector pSNAR, encompassing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (11.Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tested for restoration of FoB sensitivity after transfection into FBD5 cells and selection in 20 μg ml−1 G418.

Restriction enzyme-digested DNA was blotted onto GeneScreen Plus® hybridization transfer membrane (NEN Life Science Products) and hybridized to a 2.2-kb HindIII fragment derived from the 5-kb EcoRV fragment in pSNAR that contains theLdNT2 ORF. Total cellular RNA was isolated from ∼5 × 108 exponentially growingL. donovani promastigotes using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA, prepared from total RNA using the Oligotex mRNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), was subjected to denaturing agarose electrophoresis, transferred to a GeneScreen Plus® hybridization transfer membrane (NEN Life Science Products), and probed with the 2.2-kb HindIII fragment described above. Signals were normalized by hybridization to probes corresponding to Leishmania enriettiiα-tubulin gene (23.Landfear S.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Wirth D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). LdNT2-mediated transport was measured both in FBD5 L. donovani and X. laevisoocytes. For expression in oocytes, a 2.2-kb HindIII fragment encompassing the entire LdNT2 ORF, ∼100 bp of 5′-untranslated region, and 600 bp of 3′-untranslated region was excised from the 5-kb EcoRV fragment and subcloned into the pOG-1 oocyte expression vector (24.Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), creating pLdNT2-OG-1. For expression in L. donovani, an ∼2.5-kbBamHI-NotI fragment from pLdNT2-OG-1 encompassing the 2.2-kb HindIII LdNT2 fragment and ∼300 bp of pOG-1 vector-derived sequence encoding the 3′-untranslated region of the X. laevis β-globin gene was subcloned into the appropriate sites within the leishmanial expression vector pALTNEO (25.Laban A.

FBD5 promastigotes were transfected with either pLdNT2-ALTNEO or pALTNEO, and the resulting transfectants were maintained continuously in DME-L/FBS supplemented with 25 μg ml−1G418. Uptake of [3H]inosine (0.31 Ci mmol−1) and [3H]guanosine (0.05 Ci mmol−1) was measured in FBD5 cells harboring either pLdNT2-ALTNEO or pALTNEO as described previously (6.Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, FBD5 promastigotes (4 × 108cells ml−1), resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and supplemented with 10 mmd-glucose, were mixed with radiolabel for various times. Uptake was terminated by a modified oil-stop technique using a dibutyl phthalate cushion (6.Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). All transport measurements on theLdNT2 transfectants were performed on stationary phase parasites, since inosine transport into exponentially growing parasites was nonlinear at concentrations proximal to the K mvalue even after a few seconds. Technical limitations of the transport assay precluded the use of fewer cells. Initial rates for each nucleoside concentration were determined by linear regression analysis over the linear portions of the assay, and K m values were determined by Hanes analysis. Competition experiments were performed in the same buffer containing 1 μm[3H]inosine (0.31 Ci mmol−1) and 100 μm unlabeled inhibitor. Oocytes were dissected and defolliculated as described previously (26.Chiang C.-W. Carter N.S. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Naguib F.N.M. El Kouni M.H. Ullman B. Wilson C.M. J. Biol.

Control oocytes were injected with equivalent volumes of water. [3H]Inosine (31.3 Ci mmol−1) and [3H]guanosine (5.0 Ci mmol−1) uptake was assayed after 3 days of cRNA expression. Each oocyte was dissolved in 0.25 ml of 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and oocyte-associated radiolabel incorporation was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The cloning of LdNT2 was predicated on the functional restoration of a wild type phenotype (FoB-sensitive, nucleoside transport-competent) in a FoB-resistant, nucleoside transport-deficient (FBD5) background (5.Iovannisci D.M. Kaur K. Young L. Ullman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Six thousand independent hygromycin B-resistant colonies representing more than five genome equivalents of leishmanial DNA (7.Ryan K.A. Dasgupta S. Beverley S.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 131: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were picked after transfection with a leishmanial cosmid library and tested for sensitivity to 1 μm FoB. Of these, only two colonies exhibited a wild type FoB-sensitive phenotype, and both were subsequently determined to be inosine transport-proficient (data not shown). The cosmids, designated F30F12 and F44H9, were recovered from the two FoB-sensitive transfectants and subjected to restriction endonuclease analysis with the enzymes EcoRI, NotI, HindIII,XbaI, SacII, EcoRV, BglII, and BamHI. Restriction mapping revealed that both cosmids were distinct, but both contained a common ∼11-kb EcoRI fragment. The cosmid F30F12 (Fig.1 A) was selected for further analysis. The location of the LdNT2 gene was determined by subcloning fragments of F30F12 DNA into the leishmanial transfection vector pSNAR (11.Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18427-18430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transfecting them back into FBD5 cells, and testing for concomitant restoration of FoB sensitivity and inosine transport capability (Fig. 1). A 5-kb EcoRV fragment conferring the appropriate phenotype was sequenced in its entirety, and an ORF (LdNT2) was identified that upon conceptual translation encoded a hydrophobic polypeptide with significant homology to other parasite and mammalian equilibrative nucleoside transporters (8.Vasudevan G.

This result is compatible with the nucleotide sequence of the 5-kb EcoRV fragment that encompasses LdNT2. The Southern blot of FBD5 genomic DNA hybridized with the LdNT2 ORF was identical to that of wild type DNA (Fig. 4 A), demonstrating that neither a gross deletion nor rearrangement of the LdNT2 locus confers the nucleoside transport-deficient phenotype on FBD5 cells. Northern analysis of wild type poly(A)+ RNA revealed a major LdNT2 transcript of ∼3-kb (Fig. 4 B). A fainter hybridizing band at ∼5 kb was also observed, which could conceivably be an unprocessed mRNA. FBD5 cells, as well as FBD5 cells transfected with either pALTNEO or pLdNT2-ALTNEO, also expressed both the major and minor transcripts, indicating that loss of LdNT2 function in FBD5 cells cannot be attributed to a lack ofLdNT2 transcription (Fig. 4 B). As expected,LdNT2 is overexpressed in the FBD5 strain transfected with pLdNT2-ALTNEO. The size of this transcript, which arises from splice acceptors within the vector and insert, is also ∼3 kb. Levels of poly(A)+ RNA were normalized for each cell line using the L. enriettii α-tubulin gene (23.Landfear S.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Wirth D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1070-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). There is an additional band that hybridizes to the α-tubulin probe in the pLdNT2-ALTNEO lane, suggestive of an alternatively spliced transcript, the reason for which is unclear. To establish that LdNT2 is a functional nucleoside transporter,LdNT2 was subcloned into the pALTNEO leishmanial expression vector and transfected into FBD5 cells. Uptake assays using 5 μm [3H]inosine confirmed that transfection with LdNT2 bestows a robust inosine transport phenotype on FBD5 cells (71 pmol/s/108 cells) (Fig.5). FBD5 cells transfected with pALTNEO alone displayed only minimal inosine transport capability (1 pmol/s/108 cells) (Fig. 5). Substrate saturation curves with FBD5 pLdNT2-ALTNEO cells revealed that [3H]inosine and [3H]guanosine transport displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparentK m value of 0.3 ± 0.1 (n = 4) and 1.7 ± 0.5 μm (n = 3), respectively. Representative experiments for both inosine and guanosine are displayed in Fig. 6. These values are comparable to those determined for wild type parasites (data not shown and Ref. 6.Aronow B. Kaur K. McCartan K. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Figure 6LdNT2-mediated transport kinetics. A and B, uptake ofd-[2,8-3H]inosine (specific activity 0.31 Ci mmol−1) ord-[8-3H]guanosine (specific activity 0.05 Ci mmol−1) by FBD5 cells transfected with pLdNT2-ALTNEO was determined over a 7-s period for a range of substrate concentrations (either 0.25–5 μm for inosine or 0.5–10 μm for guanosine). The rate of uptake was determined at each substrate concentration by linear regression analysis. The results represented as a Hanes analysis are expressed as either inosine (μm) versus inosine (μm)/rate of uptake (pmol/s/108 cells) or guanosine (μm) versus guanosine (μm)/rate of uptake (pmol/s/108 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An inhibition profile determined for LdNT2-mediated transport into pLdNT2-ALTNEO FBD5 transfectants revealed that 1 μm [3H]inosine transport was inhibited by a 100-fold excess of nonradiolabeled inosine (96%), guanosine (96%), and several analogs, including 8-aminoguanosine (95%), 6-thioguanosine (94%), FoB (74%), 4-thiopurinol riboside (54%), and allopurinol riboside (44%). No inhibitory effects were observed with 9-deazainosine (5%) and 2-aminopurine riboside (<1%) (Fig.7). By contrast a 100-fold excess of the naturally occurring nucleosides, adenosine (<1%), xanthosine (35%), uridine (33%), cytidine (<1%), and thymidine (14%), as well as the nucleobases, adenine (6%), hypoxanthine (24%), guanine (26%), xanthine (12%), thymine (<1%), and uracil (1%), only inhibited 1 μm [3H]d-inosine marginally (Fig. 7). LdNT2-mediated inosine transport was also not impacted by 100 μm 4-nitrobenzyl-6-thioinosine (NBMPR) (<1%) (Fig. 7), a potent inhibitor of mammalian nucleoside transport at nanomolar concentrations (30.Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The phenotypic consequence of restored nucleoside transport proficiency in FBD5 cells was also assessed by growth phenotype in FoB. The effective concentration of FoB that inhibited growth of theLdNT2 transfectants by 50% (EC50 value) was 4.5 ± 3.9 nm (n = 4), a value similar to that determined for wild type promatigotes (5.1 ± 3.5 nm) (n = 4) (5.Iovannisci D.M. Kaur K. Young L. Ullman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, FBD5 cells transfected with the empty pALTNEO vector exhibited an EC50value of 5.7 ± 0.9 μm (n = 4). To confirm that LdNT2 by itself encodes a functional inosine-guanosine transporter, LdNT2 cRNA was expressed inXenopus oocytes. Oocytes injected with the LdNT2cRNA transported [3H]inosine and [3H]guanosine 10–20-fold more efficiently than water-injected control oocytes (Fig. 8). Rates of uptake were 0.36 and 0.32 pmol min−1(oocyte)−1 for inosine and guanosine, respectively. LdNT2 encoding the L. donovaniinosine-guanosine transporter was identified and cloned after screening for restoration of a wild type phenotype in inosine-guanosine transport-deficient FBD5 cells following transfection with anLdNT2-containing cosmid. A similar functional rescue strategy has also been exploited to pinpoint and isolate theLdNT1 locus encoding the L. donovaniadenosine-pyrimidine nucleoside transporters (8.Vasudevan G. Carter N.S.

ENTs are distinct from bacterial nucleoside transporters (36.Westh Hansen S.E. Jensen N. Munch-Petersen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37.Craig J.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3557-3560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) both in their primary sequences and topological profiles. Multisequence alignment of LdNT2 with other members of this family reveal that LdNT2 shares a number of common residues, most of which reside in predicted membrane-spanning domains, including the charged residues aspartate 389 and arginine 393 within predicted TM 7 (Fig. 2). Hydropathy predictions suggest that LdNT2 exhibits an unusual nine membrane-spanning topology with a large hydrophilic loop between TMs 5 and 6, whereas other members of the ENT family are conjectured to possess 11 membrane-spanning domains. The inferred model for LdNT2 lacks a membrane-spanning domain equivalent to TM 2 of other members of the ENT family and predicts that TM 8 encompasses two of the carboxyl-terminal membrane-spanning domains of the other transporters. If this model is correct, it suggests that the large hydrophilic loop would be on the opposite side of the membrane from the amino terminus, unlike the other ENTs. Whether this loop is exo- or endofacial in any of these transporters, however, is unknown, since these topological predictions have yet to be confirmed experimentally for any ENT member. The topological predictions for LdNT2 were made by three independent algorithms (19.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17088) Google Scholar, 20.Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 21.Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) in which individual parameters for length of membrane-spanning regions, hydrophobicity, and surface probability were considered. These same algorithms predict 11 membrane-spanning regions for other ENT members. Functional characterization of LdNT2 indicates that it is a novel high affinity transport system for both inosine and guanosine (Fig. 6) that excludes other purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and bases (Fig. 7). This unusual ligand specificity and affinity are distinct from all previously characterized ENTs from both mammalian cells and parasites. For instance, hENT1 and hENT2 both exhibit a broad ligand specificity for all naturally occurring purine and pyrimidined-nucleosides (30.Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), but the affinities of the human transporters for these nucleoside ligands are much lower than for either LdNT1 (8.Vasudevan G. Carter N.S. Drew M.E. Beverley S.M. Sanchez M.A. Seyfang A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or LdNT2. It is worth noting, however, a sodium-dependent nucleoside transport activity that appears to be specific for guanosine has been described in human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (40.Flanagan S.A. Meckling-Gill K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18026-18032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). LdNT2 also recognizes a variety of cytotoxic inosine and guanosine analogs, although large excesses of 2-aminopurine riboside and 9-deazainosine failed to impede inosine entry (Fig. 7). The inability of LdNT2 to recognize efficiently either 2-aminopurine riboside or adenosine implies that the exocyclic oxygen on C-6 of the purine ring is a critical determinant for ligand recognition by LdNT2. The inosine analog NBMPR, in which the C-6 hydroxyl is replaced by anS-nitrobenzyl moiety, does not inhibit LdNT2 at 100 μm, a concentration 3 orders of magnitude greater than that required to inhibit hENT1 (30.Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Southern analysis revealed that LdNT2 is present as a single copy within the leishmanial genome and that there are no gross anomalies in the LdNT2 locus of the mutant FBD5 line. Moreover, LdNT2-specific transcripts of a comparable size and intensity were observed in both wild type and mutant parasites. These results indicate that loss of LdNT2 function in FBD5 cells is most likely due to minor deletions or point mutations within theLdNT2 ORF. Whether this loss of function is due to mutations within both LdNT2 alleles or to mutations within one allele with a concomitant loss of heterozygosity, as has been previously observed for Leishmania (41.Hwang H.-Y. Gilberts T. Jardim A. Shih S. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30840-30846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42.Gueiros-Filho F.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5655-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), is unknown. Isolation and sequence analysis of the mutant LdNT2 locus from FBD5 cells should differentiate between these two models. The availability of a molecular clone encoding LdNT2, a mutant strain deficient in LdNT2 activity, and both homologous and heterologous expression systems in which to assess LdNT2 function provide a foundation for a thorough analysis of nucleoside transport activity in Leishmania. LdNT2-deficient mutants, the ability to create further mutants, and the identification of conserved residues among nucleoside transporters provide an avenue for the genetic dissection of nucleoside transport both by forward and reverse genetic techniques and suggest LdNT2 as a paradigm for the study of nucleoside transport in higher eukaryotes. Particularly noteworthy is the ability to generate nonlethal loss-of-function mutants with facility. Finally, it is worth noting that functional differences between parasite and mammalian transporters might be exploited therapeutically. Indeed, the selective toxicity of the drugs melarsoprol and pentamidine, both currently employed in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis, is mediated by their uptake on a novel adenine-adenosine transporter (P2) (43.Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 44.Carter N.S. Berger B.J. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28153-28157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Since LdNT2 differs from its human counterparts in terms of ligand specificity, ligand affinities, and inhibitor profiles, these discrepancies might ultimately be availed of pharmacologically. We thank Stephen M. Beverley for the generous gift of the leishmanial cosmid library and for critically reading the manuscript."

Flagellar rotation by wild-type PomA dimer was completely inactivated by phenamil, a sodium channel blocker. However, activity was retained in the presence of phenamil when either half of the dimer was replaced with a phenamil-resistant subunit, indicating that both subunits must bind phenamil for motility to be fully inhibited.

It is thought that ions passing through those proteins somehow generate torque (16.Meister M. Lowe G. Berg H.C.

Bacteria such as alkalophilic Bacillus and Vibriospecies use the electrochemical gradient of sodium to drive flagellar rotation (4.Imae Y. Atsumi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The sodium-driven motor has advantages for studying the motor function, because sodium-motive force can be easily manipulated, and amiloride and phenamil work as specific inhibitors of their function (26.Sugiyama S. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Imae Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8215-8219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Atsumi T. Sugiyama S. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Imae Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1634-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four proteins essential for torque generation, PomA, PomB, MotX, and MotY, were recently identified in the polar flagellar motor of Vibrio alginolyticus (28.Asai Y. Kojima S. Kato H. Nishioka N. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5104-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29.Okunishi I. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PomA and PomB are homologous to MotA and MotB and contain four and one transmembrane segments, respectively. Both MotX and MotY, which were first identified in Vibrio parahaemolyticus (30.McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.McCarter L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have a putative single transmembrane segment; they are unique to the sodium-type motor, and their function is unknown so far. We recently showed that PomA and PomB functionally interact with each other in a molar stoichiometric ratio of 2 PomA:1 PomB and together form a sodium-conducting channel (32.Sato K. Homma M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5718-5722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PomA forms a stable homodimer when expressed in the absence of PomB, implying that this may be the absolute number of PomA subunits in the functional complex. In this study, we describe a fusion protein that contains different combinations of wild-type PomA or mutant (P199L or D148Y) subunits that we have used to evaluate whether adjacent PomA domains may be required for torque generation. Our results demonstrate that PomA functions as an even number of subunits in a single functional complex and that both subunits contribute to PomA-PomB assembly. V. alginolyticus strains NMB190 (Rifr, Pof+, Laf−,ΔpomA) (33.Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Sockett R.E. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6332-6338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and VIO5 (Rifr, Pof+, Laf−) were used. E. colistrain JM109 (recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi - , hsdR17, relA1, supE44, λ - , Δ(lac-proAB); (F′, traD36, proAB, lacI q , lacZΔM15)) was used for DNA manipulations. V. alginolyticus cells were cultured at 30 °C in VC medium (0.5% (w/v) polypeptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.4% (w/v) K2HPO4, 3% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) glucose) or VPG medium (1% (w/v) polypeptone, 0.4% (w/v) K2HPO4, 3% (w/v) NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) glycerol). For swarm assay, a VPG-0.3% agar plate was used. E. colicells were cultured at 37 °C in LB medium. When necessary, kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml for Vibriocells or 25 μg/ml for E. coli cells. Plasmid pKS101, a pSU41-based plasmid, was constructed to carryhis 6 -pomA under the lacpromoter control. A 0.8-kb1DNA fragment including the pomA open reading frame with a 5′ attachment of 5′-ATTGGATCCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACATGGATTTAGCAACCCTATTA-3′ (initiates as Met-His6; the underline indicates the created (BamHI and EcoT22I) restriction sites) was originally prepared by polymerase chain reaction and cloned intoBamHI-digested pSU41. Plasmid pKS105, encoding the tandem PomA with a six-histidine linker, was generated by engineering anEcoT22I site at the 3′-end of the pomA clone and then linked to the 5′-end ofhis 6 -pomA via EcoT22I. pKS106 (PomA-PomA), a pSU41-based plasmid with a kanamycin resistance marker, encoded the tandem PomA under lac promoter control. An oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-ATGCATTATCCGTACGATGTTCCAGATTATGCAATAGAAGGTCGCATGCAT-3′ was inserted into the EcoT22I site of pKS105, allowing an in frame insertion of the sequence MHYPYDVPDYAIEGR into the 3′-end of the pomA clone. The final linking sequence was MHYPYDVPDYAIEGRM-His6, i.e. a hemagglutinin tag and six histidines. Plasmid pKS107 (PomA-P199L) was prepared by the insertion of a 0.8-kb DraI fragment of pKS106 into the corresponding site of pMK101-P199LKm. pMK101-P199LKm was constructed by the insertion of a 0.8-kb BamHI fragment of pMK101-P199L (34.Kojima S. Kuroda M. Kawagishi I. Homma M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) into the corresponding site of pSU41. A 1.0-kb HindIII fragment of pKS106 was ligated with pMK101-P199LKm that had been partially digested with HindIII, creating pKS108 (P199L-PomA). Plasmid pKS109 (P199L-P199L) was constructed by the insertion of a 0.8-kb SphI fragment of pKS108 into the corresponding site of pKS107. pKS111 carrying the His6-PomA P199L gene was created by insertion of a 0.6-kbDraI–EcoRI fragment of pMK101-P199LKm into the corresponding site of pKS101. Plasmid pKS113 (PomA-D148Y) was constructed by the insertion of a 0.8-kb DraI fragment of pKS106 into the corresponding site of pYA301-D148Y (35.Kojima S. Asai Y. Atsumi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A 1.0-kbHindIII fragment of pYA301-D148Y was ligated with pKS106 that had been partially digested with HindIII, creating pKS114 (D148Y-PomA). pKS115 (D148Y-D148Y) was constructed by the insertion of a 0.8-kb SphI fragment of pKS114 into the corresponding site of pKS113. All inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were harvested at late logarithmic phase and resuspended in an equal volume of TMN medium containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 50 mm NaCl, 250 mm KCl. The cell culture was diluted 100-fold into TMN medium containing various concentrations of NaCl, and then motility of the cells was observed at room temperature under a dark field microscope and recorded on video recorder. Swimming speed was determined as described (36.Atsumi T. Maekawa Y. Yamada T. Kawagishi I. Imae Y. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5024-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The average swimming speed was obtained by measuring at least 20 swimming tracks. Cells of NMB190 expressing His6-tagged PomA derivative were cultured at 30 °C under strong aeration in VPG medium, harvested, washed with buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgSO4, 10% (w/v) sucrose), and resuspended (0.2 g, wet weight/ml) in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgSO4, 30 μg/ml DNase I, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Membrane vesicles were prepared by subjecting the suspension to a single passage through a French press (5501-M Ohtake Works) at 4000 p.s.i. at 4 °C. Undisrupted cells were removed by low speed centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the membrane fraction was recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 2 h. The membrane pellet was suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% (w/v) glycerol) containing 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 2.5% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside. The suspension was stirred for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The clarified extract was mixed with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (QIAGEN) prewashed with the same buffer, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle mixing, and then packed into the column. The loaded resin was washed with buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 1.25% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside. Elution was conducted with buffer A, containing 500 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 1.25% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside. The Ni2+-NTA-purified material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Our previous studies suggested that the native PomA protein alone forms a stable dimer in detergent extract (32.Sato K. Homma M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5718-5722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The possibility that the dimerization of PomA subunits may be required for torque generation was approached by constructing a series of tandem dimer PomA proteins. The construction was performed by linking two pomA open reading frames in frame with 22 residues as a linker (Fig.1 A). The resulting plasmid encodes a 528-residue polypeptide (PomA-PomA) with an N-terminal subunit continuous with a C-terminal subunit. As shown in Fig.1 B, NMB190 (ΔpomA) cells expressing the tandem PomA gained the ability to swarm on a soft agar plate. Compared with wild-type monomeric PomA, tandem PomA slightly reduced the swarming ability. This is also shown in Fig. 6 B, where NMB190 cells with tandem PomA had significantly reduced swimming speed compared with cells expressing wild-type monomeric PomA. Since the C terminus of Salmonella MotA, the PomA homolog, has been shown to be important for function (37.Muramoto K. Macnab R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1191-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), diminished swarm ability may be due to restricted flexibility around the C terminus of the N-terminal half of tandem PomA. To demonstrate that swarming was due to the activity of full-length tandem PomA and not to monomeric PomA resulting from partial translation or proteolytic cleavage of the PomA fusion, an immunoblotting was carried out with membranes from NMB190 expressing the tandem fusion protein. As shown in Fig.2 B, tandem PomA migrates around 50 kDa, as do SDS-resistant dimeric aggregates of monomer PomA (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) that we have observed routinely (38.Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No other immunoreactive species is observed on the immunoblots compared with wild-type endogenous PomA (lanes 7–9), particularly around 25 kDa, where monomeric PomA migrates. The immunoreactive materials at slightly larger than the monomer size (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 6) are the nonspecific degradation products during membrane preparation.Figure 6Sensitivity to phenamil of PomA dimers. A, swimming speeds were measured in TMN medium in the presence or the absence of 50 μm phenamil as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Cells of NMB190 (ΔpomA) expressing PomA-D148Y (squares), D148Y-PomA (circles), or D148Y-D148Y (triangles) were collected at late logarithmic phase and suspended in TMN medium (pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl). The cell suspension was diluted to 100-fold into TMN medium containing various concentrations of NaCl. Filled and open symbols indicate speeds in the absence or the presence of 50 μmphenamil, respectively. Cells of NMB190 (ΔpomA) expressing PomA-PomA (crosses) in the presence of 50 μm phenamil are also indicated.

As a measure of function, the ability of PomA dimer and mutant dimers to swarm in a soft agar plate was assayed in V. alginolyticus NMB190 (ΔpomA). Fig.3 A shows the swarm abilities conferred by PomA dimer (PomA-PomA) and dimers containing mutation P199L. Previous mutational studies have shown that a conserved proline residue in PomA (Pro199 in the protein from V. alginolyticus and Pro222 in E. coli MotA), which is important for function, since mutations of this residue completely prevent flagellar rotation and showed strong negative dominance (34.Kojima S. Kuroda M. Kawagishi I. Homma M. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When this inactivating mutation was introduced into the N-terminal (P199L-PomA) or the C-terminal (PomA-P199L) half of the dimer, swarm activity was completely diminished. PomA dimer with the mutation in both halves (P199L-P199L) was also completely inactive (Fig. 3 A). Under the dark field microscope (39.Muramoto K. Kawagishi I. Kudo S. Magariyama Y. Imae Y. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), no flagellar rotation was observed with cells producing P199L-containing dimers (data not shown). We also investigated for dominant-negative effects of the mutant PomA dimers. The plasmids encoding PomA dimer or mutant dimers were introduced into wild-type cells, VIO5 (PomA+), and the transformants were inoculated on a soft agar plate. As shown in Fig.3 B, all PomA dimers containing the P199L mutation in either half of the dimer reduced the swarming ability of VIO5 (PomA+) cells, whereas PomA homodimer resulted in no significant reduction in swarm size compared with wild-type cells. These results suggest that PomA dimers with the P199L mutation compete with the wild-type PomA for occupying the functional site of the torque-generating unit. Taking the results together, it is highly possible that PomA dimers are inserted in the membrane at the functional site. Furthermore, the inactivation of half of the dimer interferes with the function of the other half, implying that the two halves of the dimer function together. Our previous studies showed that PomA and PomB functionally interact with each other (38.Yorimitsu T. Sato K. Asai Y. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5103-5106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether PomA dimers have the ability to interact with PomB, a co-elution assay was performed (Fig.4 A). Membrane fractions of NMB190 (ΔpomA) expressing various PomA dimers were prepared, solubilized with β-octyl glucoside, and passed through a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. The column was washed, bound protein was eluted with buffer containing imidazole, and the eluate was analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against PomA and PomB (Fig.4 A). Although only His6-PomA dimer is overexpressed in the cells, the protein complex contains only endogenous PomB, which should therefore reflect the native interaction between PomA and PomB. PomB co-eluted with PomA dimer (PomA-PomA;lane 1), whereas no PomB band was observed with PomA dimers containing the P199L mutation in either or both halves (P199L-PomA, PomA-P199L, or P199L-P199L; lanes 2–4). Although Pro222 of E. coli MotA has been proposed to function as the regulator for the conformational changes of the MotA-MotB complex (40.Braun T.F. Poulson S. Gully J.B. Empey J.C. Van Way S.M. Putnam A. Blair D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3542-3551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its specific role still remains unclear. To examine the interaction between monomeric PomA P199L and PomB, a His6 tag was attached to the N terminus of PomA and P199L mutant monomer, and the co-elution assay was performed as above (Fig.4 B). When the eluates were analyzed by immunoblotting, PomB was found to have co-isolated with wild-type His6-PomA (lane 6), but no detectable PomB was co-sedimented with His6-P199L (lane 7). The results described above suggest that as well as the Pro199 of PomA being essential for PomA-PomB interaction, probably affecting the C-terminal tail of PomA, both halves of the PomA dimer contribute to form the functional PomA-PomB complex. We further extended this approach to investigate the relationship between torque generation and sodium conductance. Our previous studies had shown that the substitution of Asp148by Tyr (D148Y) in PomA results in resistance to phenamil, a specific inhibitor of the PomA-PomB sodium channel (35.Kojima S. Asai Y. Atsumi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we have used this mutant to determine whether sodium conductance of both halves of the PomA dimer are required for torque generation. D148Y-containing mutant dimers were expressed as a 50-kDa protein, and no degradation products were observed (data not shown). Introduction of this mutation into either or both halves of the dimer reduced swarm activity (Fig.5 A). This is consistent with our previous observation that mutation at Asp148 results in impaired motility (35.Kojima S. Asai Y. Atsumi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 50 μm phenamil, which completely blocks sodium conductance of the PomA-PomB channel (35.Kojima S. Asai Y. Atsumi T. Kawagishi I. Homma M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1537-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), completely inhibited motility driven by tandem PomA (PomA-PomA) (Fig.5 B). In contrast, NMB190 cells expressing tandem PomA with D148Y mutations in both halves (D148Y-D148Y) showed phenamil resistance. Interestingly, PomA heterodimers with either the N-terminal or the C-terminal half containing the D148Y mutation (PomA-D148Y or D148Y-PomA) retained activity in the presence of phenamil. To further examine the effect of sodium channel blockage on torque generation, the swimming speeds of cells harboring mutant PomA were measured in the presence or the absence of phenamil (Fig.6 A). In the absence of phenamil, NMB190 cells expressing tandem PomA with both halves containing the D148Y mutation had swimming speed reduced to about 80% compared with those expressing PomA-D148Y or D148Y-PomA. This is consistent with the control experiment shown in Fig. 6 B, that the D148Y mutation significantly reduced the swimming speed compared with cells expressing wild-type monomeric PomA. When 50 μm phenamil was added to the cells expressing the PomA dimer with either or both halves of subunits containing D148Y mutations, all of the mutants showed similar motility. This suggests that both subunits of the dimer contribute to the phenamil binding. The results might also indicate that the individual halves of the dimer do not function independently but function together to conduct sodium ions. We demonstrate here that an engineered fusion protein containing two PomA molecules can insert into the membrane and exhibit torque generation activity. Tandem PomA dimer provides a unique model system that permits coupled synthesis of two PomA molecules, with the advantage that both halves of the dimer are present at the identical level. A dimer containing wild-type PomA and mutant P199L was constructed, and the effect of the ability to rotate flagella was assessed. Inactivation of either half of the dimer caused complete loss of activity, indicating that both halves of the dimer are essential for torque generation. If the two halves of the dimer functioned independently, inactivation of either half would be expected to result in ∼50% decrease in activity. In other words, the two halves of the PomA dimer appear to function together. To examine the possibility that incorrect membrane insertion of either half of the dimer might occur, negative dominance was tested. Strong dominant negative effects were observed with both P199L-PomA and PomA-P199L. Although P199L-containing PomA dimers cannot bind to PomB (Fig. 4 A), this result is quite reasonable, because it might be still able to interact with MotX and/or MotY, which are also essential for the rotation of the sodium-driven motor. If so, the mutant PomA dimers could interfere with MotX and/or MotY function or sequester them away from the functional site. It is not clear that the wild-type PomA in the hetero-fused dimer folds like it would by itself or in the homo-fused dimer. Limited protease sensitivity of the dimer-expressed inverted membrane vesicles revealed that there were no differences of digestion pattern between wild-type fused dimer and mutant-containing dimer (data not shown), although further investigations are required. Can we exclude the possibility that a PomA dimer containing one wild-type PomA (P199L-PomA or PomA-P199L) might support rotation when this wild-type half of the mixed dimer is active, while other dimers impede rotation because the inactive (P199L) subunit is incorporated? This possibility is excluded for the following reason. If some of the active (wild-type) subunits of the P199L-bearing PomA dimers are incorporated into their correct sites in the motor to form a functional unit, those active subunits should form a PomA-PomB complex. However, we have shown here that all of the P199L-containing dimers cannot interact with endogenous PomB in Fig. 4 A, which indicates that there are no such species as functional PomA-PomB complexes. Taken together, the results provide support for the contention that PomA is functional as an even number of subunits, either a dimer or a multimer of dimers. The Pro199 residue of PomA is highly conserved in MotA homologs and is thought not to have a direct role in ion translocation but rather a structural role (34.Kojima S. Kuroda M. Kawagishi I.

Pro222 in E. coli MotA was investigated by intensive mutagenesis, leading to the conclusion that it might function to mediate conformational changes that couple the events occurring on the membrane and cytoplasmic domains during energy conversion (40.Braun T.F. Poulson S. Gully J.B. Empey J.C. Van Way S.M. Putnam A. Blair D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3542-3551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Zhou J. Blair D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We showed here that Pro199 of PomA also plays a critical role for PomA-PomB interaction. Monomeric PomA with the mutation P199L showed reduced ability to interact with PomB. It is noteworthy that this was also observed with PomA dimer containing the mutation in either half of the dimer. Suppose that PomA is functional as a monomer, and each molecule interacts with PomB. It is difficult then to imagine how the introduction of single P199L mutation into one half of the dimer could result in complete loss of PomA-PomB interaction. Function as a dimer is consistent with our previous estimate that the molar ratio of isolated functional PomA-PomB complex is 2 PomA:1 PomB (32.Sato K. Homma M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5718-5722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that both subunits in PomA dimer contribute to the PomA-PomB interaction. One more approach was used to investigate the functional impact of PomA dimer. Tandem PomA was constructed containing wild-type PomA and D148Y mutated PomA, and the effect of phenamil on torque generation was measured. The results indicate that the introduction of D148Y mutation to one half of the dimer results in no significant decrease in both swarm activity and swimming speed compared with dimer where both halves carry the phenamil-resistant mutation, suggesting the possibility that the individual halves of the dimer do not conduct sodium ions by themselves. Although it is not clear how many phenamils bind to this dimer molecule, it is highly probable that both halves of the PomA dimer function together to conduct sodium ions, and so both subunits cooperatively form a phenamil binding site. Some integral membrane permeases such as the ribose transporter RbsC (42.Park Y. Cho Y. Ahn T. Park C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) form homodimers for their function. The FhuB, the ferric hydroxamate transporter component, functions as a single polypeptide containing two homologous repeats and is still active when those repeats are separated (43.Koster W. Braun V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 223: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of PomA may be an analogous process. In the absence of high resolution images of the torque-generating unit, subunit stoichiometry can be tentatively assessed using biochemical methods. The results described above provide a framework for the subunit stoichiometry of the torque-generating unit, but a definitive answer will require further experimental documentation. We thank Drs. Robert M. Macnab and Ikuro Kawagishi for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2022723787,"To elucidate mechanisms of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced proliferation of a number of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, we examined the role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in TNF-α signaling in Mo7e and Hut-78 cells. TNF-α-dependent p38 MAPK activation was detected in both Mo7e and Hut-78 cells and was blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580. Ablation of p38 MAPK activity by SB203580 abrogated TNF-α-induced Mo7e cell proliferation and TNF-α-dependent autocrine growth of Hut-78. As we have shown previously that activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is also required for TNF-α-induced Mo7e cell proliferation, the involvement of p38 MAPK in NF-κB activation was assessed. SB203580 did not affect TNF-α-signaled nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB, and inhibition of NF-κB function did not affect TNF-α-induced p38 MAPK activation, indicating that these events are not dependent on each other. However, SB203580 depressed the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes, as monitored by a κB-driven reporter gene. Our findings demonstrate that activation of both p38 MAPK and NF-κB plays a critical role in TNF-α-mediated survival and proliferation of human leukemia and lymphoma cells, and p38 MAPK acts at least in part by facilitating the transcriptional activation function of NF-κB.

Blood. 1989; 73: 1242-1246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which TNF-α signals leukemia and lymphoma cell proliferation remain unclear. TNF-α activates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in many cell lines. NF-κB is a heterodimer of p65 and p50 subunits, both of which are members of the NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors, which also includes c-Rel, Rel B, and p52 (14.Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. Oncogene. 1997; 272: 14899-14907Google Scholar). In response to TNF-α and other signals, IκBα, a protein that sequesters NF-κB in the cytosol, is phosphorylated and degraded through an ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. As a result, NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and promotes the expression of target genes. Increasing evidence shows that activation of NF-κB is involved in cell activation and proliferation. We previously reported that NF-κB activation is essential for TNF-α-induced Mo7e cell survival and proliferation (15.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X. Zuckerman K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13877-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), because inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-κB specifically blocked TNF-α-induced cell proliferation, but had no effect on granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor- (GM-CSF) or IL-3-induced Mo7e cell proliferation, in which there is no NF-κB activation. On the other hand, several lines of evidence also indicate that activated NF-κB may participate in apoptosis (16.Qin Z.H. Wang Y. Nakai M. Chase T.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17.Bessho R. Matsubara K. Kubota M. Kuwakado K. Hirota H. Wakazono Y. Lin Y.W. Okuda A. Kawai M. Nishikomori R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1883-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). TNF-α is also a potent activator of p38 MAPK. To date, there are at least three different known subtypes of MAP kinases: the p42 and p44 MAPKs, which are also termed as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK); the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases; and p38 MAPK (18.Kyriakis J.M.

Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Mammalian p38 MAPK was originally identified in murine pre-B cells transfected with the lipopolysaccharide complex receptor CD14 and in macrophages in which p38 MAPK was activated in response to a lipopolysaccharide. Like ERKs and c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p38 MAPK requires phosphorylation of a closely spaced tyrosine and threonine for activation. However, p38 MAPK is distinguished by the sequence TGY in its activation domain, which differs from the TEY sequence found in ERKs, and the TPY sequence in c-Jun N-terminal kinase and MAP kinase homologues. p38 MAPK is activated by a wide spectrum of stimuli, such as physical and chemical stresses, lipopolysaccharide, and cytokines. Despite rapid progress in the elucidation of the structural elements of the p38 MAPK pathway, the physiological consequences of its stimulation by stress agents largely remain to be defined. A variety of evidence suggests that p38 MAPK plays a key role in regulating anti-apoptotic and inflammatory responses (21.Rausch O. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4096-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22.Craxton A. Shu G. Graves J.D. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J.

In addition, inhibition of p38 MAPK has been found to prevent interleukin-6 and GM-CSF mRNA synthesis, indicating that p38 MAPK may regulate transcriptional events (24.Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S.

Some other studies indicated that p38 has been implicated in the activation of transcription factors, such as ATF-2, ELK-1, c-Fos, c-Jun, CHOP, MAX, and NF-κB. Activation of p38 MAPK was reported to have anti-apoptotic effects in some cell lines and to play a role in cell proliferation in other systems (21.Rausch O. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4096-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22.Craxton A. Shu G. Graves J.D. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, several studies have shown that activation of p38 MAPK plays a role in apoptosis in the PC12 neuronal cell line and mouse CD8+ T cells (27.Merritt C. Enslen H. Diehl N. Conze D. Davis R.J. Rincon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). Although our previous studies have established the necessity of NF-κB activity for the TNF-α-mediated growth and survival of human leukemic cell lines (15.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X. Zuckerman K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13877-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), TNF-α initiated proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways upstream or independent of NF-κB activation have yet to be described. In this study, we investigated the activation and role of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in TNF-α-treated Mo7e and other human leukemia or lymphoma cell lines. Our data show that TNF-α activates p38 MAPK and that this activity is required for TNF-α-supported survival and proliferation of human leukemia and lymphoma cells. In addition, we found that abrogation of p38 activity markedly repressed TNF-α-induced expression of a κB-driven reporter gene without affecting the nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Our findings demonstrate that p38 MAPK plays an essential role in the TNF-α-mediated proliferation and survival of human leukemic cells and acts at least in part by promoting the expression of the κB-driven genes. Recombinant human TNF-α, recombinant human GM-CSF, goat anti-type I TNF receptor agonistic antibody, and goat anti-type II TNF receptor agonistic antibody were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Polyclonal anti-total p38 antibody was purchased from Sigma. SN50, a peptide inhibiting nuclear translocation of TNF-α-activated NF-κB, was synthesized following the procedure as reported previously (15.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X. Zuckerman K.S. J.

In experiments to detect effects of cytokines, Mo7e cells were prepared by washing three times with serum-free medium and were starved for 18 h in medium without cytokine (3.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar). HEL cells were cultured in serum-free medium with 1 × Nutridoma HU (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 18 h before cytokine treatments. To determine the effect of TNF-α on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]TdR incorporation in freshly prepared cells. The assays were performed in triplicate, using a total of 4 × 105 Mo7e or Hut-78 cells or 2 × 105 HEL cells (fewer HEL cells were used because of their shorter doubling time). Mo7e cells in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and HEL cells in medium with 1x Nutridoma HU were cultured for 72 h in the presence or absence of TNF-α or other cytokines. Cells were then labeled with 4 μCi/ml of [3H]TdR for an additional 4 h. The radioactivity incorporated into DNA (cpm) was determined by a liquid scintillation counter according to a previously described protocol (3.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar). All assays for [3H]TdR incorporation were repeated at least three times. Some of our data from [3H]TdR incorporation assays also were compared with those obtained from the nonradioactive Cell Proliferation Wst-1 kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Both methods yielded consistent results. To determine cell growth, cell numbers were counted manually in a hemacytometer, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. SN50, a peptide that blocks the nuclear translocation of activated NF-κB (15.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X. Zuckerman K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13877-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29.Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. Oncogene. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Google Scholar), contains membrane-permeable signal sequences of Kaposi's fibroblast growth factor and the nuclear translocation motif (VQRKRQKLMP) of human NF-κB p50. A mutant SN50 (SN50mt) contains membrane-permeable signal sequences of Kaposi's fibroblast growth factor and a nonfunctional mutant nuclear translocation motif of human NF-κB p50 (29.Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. Oncogene. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Google Scholar). Both SN50 and SN50mt were synthesized commercially (Genemed Synthesis, South San Francisco, CA). The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the molecular weight of the purified peptides was verified by mass spectrometry analysis. To track the intracellular localization of the membrane-permeable peptides in Mo7e cells, SN50 was labeled with FITC. The synthesized peptides were dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 100 μg/μl and mixed directly with culture medium (1:500–1000) before use. To investigate the effect of inhibition of p38 MAPK or ERK on cell proliferation and on other signaling molecules including NF-κB and JAK/STAT5, SB203580 or PD098059 was used to incubate with cells in the absence or presence of cytokines. For the detection of unphosphorylated or phosphorylated p38 MAPK, p44/p42 MAPK, or IκBα, cells treated with or without cytokines were boiled in SDS buffer. Total cellular proteins (30 μg) were loaded into each lane and subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with the anti-total (unphosphorylated and phosphorylated) or anti-phospho-p44/p42, -p38, or -IκBα antibodies (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Anti-phospho-p38 MAPK reacts only with p38 MAPK that is activated by dual phosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182. Preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed according to methods described previously (15.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X. Zuckerman K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13877-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34.Liu R.Y. Corry P.M. Lee Y.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2209-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the NF-κB-binding oligonucleotide used as a radioactive DNA probe was 5′-CGACAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGC-3′. Equal amounts of nuclear proteins (5–10 μg) for each sample were incubated with 1 ng of32P-labeled probe. The DNA binding reaction was performed at room temperature in a volume of 25 μl, which contained binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1.8 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA), 1 ng of 3′-labeled probe, and 5–10 μg of nuclear proteins. After incubation for 15 min, the DNA-protein complexes and the unbound probe were separated electrophoretically on 6% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× buffer (44.5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 44.5 mm boric acid). The gels were fixed and dried, and the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography at −70 °C with Kodak X-OMAT film and a DuPont Cranex lightning-plus intensifying screen. A FACScan flow cytometer in the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility was used to examine Mo7e cell cycle status, intracellular localization of SN50 peptides, and apoptosis. Mo7e cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml FITC-labeled SN50 peptide for various periods or with various amounts of FITC-SN50 for 30 min to investigate the intercellular incorporation of the peptides. The status of apoptosis was analyzed by incubating cells with FITC-labeled Annexin V and propidium iodide, following the manufacturer's suggested procedure. To examine the role of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the expression of κB-driven genes, a reporting system pNF-κB (SEAP, the secreted alkaline phosphatase) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which carries a secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box) and tandem repeats of the κB site, was transfected into Mo7e cells. Mo7e cells (5 × 106) were plated in 60-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 106cells/ml. The following day, the cells were transfected with 8 μg of κB/phosphatase plasmid by the liposome method (GenPORTER, Gene Therapy System, San Diego, CA). The transfected cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 5 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF. After 24 h, the cells were washed three times with serum-free medium and were starved for 18 h in medium without cytokine. On the next day, the transfectants were divided into three groups and treated without TNF-α, with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 1–6 h, or with 50 μmSB203580 for 2 h, followed by 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 1–6 h. At each time point, 250 μl of supernatant was collected and used for determination of SEAP activity. The activity of SEAP was determined with a PNPP Phosphatase Substrate Kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The relative SEAP activity was calculated by dividing the reading at 405 nm from each treated group by that of the untreated cells. The activity of SEAP in supernatant also was determined by dot-blotting proteins onto nitrocellulose, and the reaction of SEAP and its substrate was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Lumi-Phos WB, Pierce) following the manufacturer's suggested procedure. We have shown previously that p44/p42 MAPK is not activated by TNF-α in Mo7e cells (3.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Mitchell S. Chen Q. Wu J. Zuckerman K.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2217-2223PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiments described here, we examined the effects of TNF-α on the activation of p38, using an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated and thus activated p38. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was not detected in Mo7e or HEL human leukemic cell lines in the absence of TNF-α but was induced significantly upon exposure of the cells to TNF-α (Fig.1 a). In Mo7e cells treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was maximal at 30–60 min and declined thereafter (Fig. 1 a, Mo7e). In Mo7e cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) treated with various doses of TNF-α, the maximal level of p38 MAPK phosphorylation was reached by treating cells with 1–5 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min, and higher TNF-α concentrations failed to further increase levels of p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1 b). The level of total (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) p38 MAPK was unaffected by TNF-α (Fig. 1). We reported previously that GM-CSF and IL-3 induced significant p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation but did not activate NF-κB in Mo7e cells (15.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X. Zuckerman K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13877-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Incubation of Mo7e cells with 10 ng/ml GM-CSF (Fig.1 c) or IL-3 (data not shown) for 5–60 min also failed to induce p38 MAPK phosphorylation. We then investigated activation of p38 MAPK in the human lymphoma Hut-78 cell line. The Hut-78 cell line was chosen because it constitutively expresses activated NF-κB as a result of TNF-α autocrine stimulation (9.Giri D.K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14008-14014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 10.O'Connell M.A. Cleere R. Long A. O'Neill L.A. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7399-7404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When we utilized antiphosphorylated p38 MAPK antibody to determine p38 phosphorylation status in Hut-78 cells, the results from Western blotting show that p38 MAPK was constitutively activated in Hut-78 cells without any cytokine exposure (Fig.2, lane 1). Treating cells with 1–20 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min did not have any further effect on constitutively activated p38 MAPK (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4). GM-CSF, IL-6, or TPO also did not significantly enhance or inhibit the constitutive p38 MAPK phosphorylation (data not shown). However, incubation of Hut-78 cells with anti-TNF-α neutralizing antibody reduced the level of constitutively phosphorylated p38 MAPK in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, lanes 5–6), indicating that the activation of p38 MAPK in Hut-78 cells is via TNF-α autocrine stimulation. Because our previous and present studies indicated that treating cells with TNF-α not only activated NF-κB (15.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X. Zuckerman K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13877-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but also induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Figs. 1 and 2), we designed experiments to examine the relationship of these events. NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with IκBα in the basal state and becomes active after exposure of cells to TNF-α. To investigate whether TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation was required for activation of p38 MAPK, SN50 was used to investigate the effect of blockage of NF-κB nuclear translocation on p38 MAPK phosphorylation. The results showed that preincubation of Mo7e cells with various amounts of SN50 for 2 h inhibited TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 a, lanes 3–5 and also see our previous report (15.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X. Zuckerman K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13877-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) but had no effect on TNF-α-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3 b, lanes 3–5) or on the level of total p38 MAPK (data not shown). In experiments to investigate the effect of inhibition of p38 MAPK activation on the NF-κB signaling pathway, the pharmacological compound SB203580 was used to inhibit p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In agreement with other reports (21.Rausch O. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4096-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22.Craxton A. Shu G. Graves J.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), we found that SB203580 significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation in Mo7e cells (Fig. 4 a) or the constitutively activated p38 MAPK in Hut-78 cells (data not shown). In experiments to investigate the effect of SB203580-induced blockage of p38 phosphorylation on TNF-α-induced nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB, antibody to the NF-κB p65 subunit was used to assess the subcellular location of NF-κB. p65 was not detectable in the nuclei of untreated Mo7e cells (Fig. 4 b,lane 1), whereas marked accumulation of nuclear p65 was apparent in cells treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min (Fig.4 b, lane 2). Preincubation of Mo7e cells with 1–50 μm SB203580 for 2 h did not affect the TNF-α-induced nuclear accumulation of p65 (Fig. 4 b,lanes 3–5). As assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, DNA-binding activity of NF-κB was observed in the nuclear extracts of TNF-α-treated, but not untreated Mo7e cells (Fig. 4 c,lanes 1 and 2), and the induction of this activity by TNF-α was unaffected by pretreatment of cells with SB203580 (Fig. 4 c, lanes 3–5). In a separate experiment, we found that treating Mo7e cells with the same amounts of SB203580 as used above had no effect on TNF-α-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (data not shown). There are several members of the MAPK family, including ERK, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases. It is unclear whether there is overlap and cross-talk among these signaling pathways. The pharmacological compound PD098059 has been reported to have the capacity to inhibit p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation via specific inhibition of MEK1/2 activation. In our study, PD098059 was used to examine the effect on p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Treating Mo7e cells with PD098059 inhibited GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 a, lanes 3–6). However, treating Mo7e cells with various amounts of PD098059 had no effect on TNF-α-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig.5 b). On the other hand, incubation of cells with SB203580 did not show significant effects on GM-CSF- or IL-3-induced activation of p44/p42 MAPK (Fig. 5 c) or JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathways (data not shown). Mo7e cells grow in a growth factor-dependent manner and stop growing and eventually undergo apoptotic death in medium without stimulatory cytokines. However, treatment of cells with TNF-α supports continuous cell growth. SB203580 was used to examine the effect of inhibition of p38 MAP"
https://openalex.org/W1551378859,"Since the realization that the tips of scanning probe microscopes can interact with atoms at surfaces, there has been much interest in the possibility of building or modifying nanostructures or molecules directly from single atoms1. Individual large molecules can be positioned on surfaces2,3,4, and atoms can be transferred controllably between the sample and probe tip5,6. The most complex structures7,8,9,10,11 are produced at cryogenic temperatures by sliding atoms across a surface to chosen sites. But there are problems in manipulating atoms laterally at higher temperatures—atoms that are sufficiently well bound to a surface to be stable at higher temperatures require a stronger tip interaction to be moved. This situation differs significantly from the idealized weakly interacting tips12,13 of scanning tunnelling or atomic force microscopes. Here we demonstrate that precise positioning of atoms on a copper surface is possible at room temperature. The triggering mechanism for the atomic motion unexpectedly depends on the tunnelling current density, rather than the electric field or proximity of tip and surface."

Previous studies based on transient expression assays have shown that the transmembrane domains of both glycoproteins are sufficient to localize reporter proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and that other localization signals may be contained in the ectodomain of E1 protein. To identify such signals we generated chimeric proteins between E1 and two reporter proteins, the human CD8 glycoprotein and the human alkaline phosphatase, and analyzed their subcellular localization in stable as well as transient transfectants. Our results showed that (i) an independent localization determinant for the endoplasmic reticulum is present in the juxtamembrane region of the ectodomain of E1 protein and (ii) the localization dictated by this determinant is either due to direct retention or to a recycling mechanism from the intermediate compartment/cis-Golgi complex region, which is clearly different from those previously described for other retrieval signals. These results show for the first time in mammalian cells that the localization in the endoplasmic reticulum of transmembrane protein can be determined by specific targeting signals acting in the lumen of the compartment.

It is classified in the Flaviviridae family because of its similarity in genomic organization to flavivirus and pestivirus. The genome, a single positive-strand RNA, is translated into a polyprotein of about 3,000 amino acid residues, which is processed by host and viral proteases to generate at least 10 polypeptides (reviewed in Ref. 1Clarke B. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2397-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Little is known on HCV replication and assembly because the virus does not infect laboratory animals and tissue-cultured cells. Only recently Lohmannet al. (2Lohmann V. Körner F. Koch J.-O. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar) succeeded in designing a self-replicating subgenomic viral RNA, and to date biogenesis of HCV proteins has been studied only by cell-free transcription/translation and transfection assays. These experiments show that co-translational cleavages in the N-terminal region of HCV nascent chain release the two putative envelope viral glycoproteins, E1 and E2 (3Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Fields' Virology. 1. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1996: 931-959Google Scholar). E1 and E2 are intrinsic membrane proteins with an N-terminal ectodomain that is heavilyN-glycosylated and a C-terminal hydrophobic TMD, whose precise length has not been established. When expressed in tissue culture cells, E1 and E2 interact with each other and with resident chaperones forming two types of complexes: heterogeneous aggregates containing E1 and E2, possibly associated by intermolecular disulfide bonds, as well as calreticulin and calnexin and a non-covalent heterodimer presumably representing the correct folding state that precedes the formation of the viral envelope (4Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.S. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lanford R.E. Notvall L. Chavez D. White R. Frenzel G. Simonsen C. Kim J.

Virol. 1993; 67: 6753-6771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Independently of their oligomeric status, E1 and E2 localize predominantly in the ER and are not transported to the cell surface (4Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.S. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ralston R. Thudium K. Berger K. Kuo C. Gervase B. Hall J. Selby M. Kuo G. Houghton M. Choo Q.-L. J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This localization suggests that HCV budding occurs entirely on intracellular membranes, thus helping HCV to minimize the host immune surveillance and determine persistent infection. Mutational analysis in transfected cells allowed the identification of two independent ER retention signals in the TMDs of E1 and E2 glycoproteins; replacement of the TMD of human CD4 protein with the C-terminal hydrophobic region of E1 or E2 resulted in the ER localization of the chimeric protein (9Cocquerel L. Duvet S. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Cacan R. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cocquerel L. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J.

However, removal of the E1 TMD or its substitution with the TMD and the cytosolic domain of CD8 still resulted in localization in the ER (9Cocquerel L. Duvet S. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Cacan R. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Michalak J.P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Conversely, E2 deleted of the TMD or with a different TMD was secreted or located on the plasma membrane, respectively (10Cocquerel L. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Michalak J.P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that other determinant(s) for ER localization is contained in the lumenal portion of E1 protein. On this line, E1 deleted of the TMD and of the juxtamembrane portion of the ectodomain was secreted (12Michalak J.P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the native, correctly folded configuration of E1 and E2 glycoproteins is still unknown; thus, evaluating whether ER localization of recombinant forms of these proteins is determined by a specific signal or by misfolding is a constant problem. To overcome this problem, we decided to search for localization signals in E1 glycoprotein by fusing part of it to the human glycoprotein CD8 or to the human alkaline phosphatase (AP) (13Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene. 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). CD8 is a class I transmembrane protein that is quickly transported to the cell surface and has been extensively used as a reporter protein to study localization signals (14Littman D.R. Thomas Y.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9940-9947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been established that sugar modifications mark transport in different compartments of the secretory pathway. Finally, in contrast to HCV E1, folding of CD8 can be monitored by using conformation-sensitive antibodies and by the formation of disulfide-linked homodimers. Human placental AP is a glycoprotein anchored to the cell surface via a phosphatidylinositol-glycan moiety (20Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1987; 48: 179-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Low M.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have shown that the catalytic domain of this enzyme retains its activity when fused to different types of TMDs (22Feehan C. Darlak K. Kahn J. Walcheck B. Spatola A.F.

Thus, the use of this protein as reporter offers the possibility of very easily testing the folding state of the chimeric proteins by measuring its enzymatic activity. We have constructed several chimeric proteins between these two reporter proteins and the C-terminal region of E1 protein and expressed them either stably in rat thyroid cells (FRT) or transiently in human hepatoma cells (HuH-7). Analysis of the intracellular localization of these chimeras indicated the presence of a new localization determinant in the viral glycoprotein. All culture reagents were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.

PCR amplification was performed according to the procedure of Barnes (25Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) to minimize the possibility of unwanted second-site mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by inserting the mutations in the PCR primers. The expression vector (plasmid CD8) was a plasmid containing the human CD8a cDNA downstream of the promoter and the enhancer from the Friend murine leukemia virus (26Migliaccio G. Zurzolo C. Nitsch L. Obici S. Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Pascale M.C. Leone A. Bonatti S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 291-296PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was mutagenized in order to contain a SphI site and aClaI site between amino acids 160 and 161 of CD8 protein, where all HCV or SV fragments were cloned. Plasmid CD8-E199–192 contains HCV sequence from nucleotide 1200 to nucleotide 1568 of the HCV BK strain (27Takamizawa A. Mori C. Fuki I. Manabe S. Murakami S. Fujita J. Onishi E. Andoh T. Yoshida I. Okayama H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) corresponding to residues 99–192 of E1 protein. All the other HCV sequences were amplified from plasmid CD8-E199–192. Plasmid CD8-E199–155contains HCV fragment encoding residues 155–192 of E1 protein, followed by a stop codon. HCV cDNA fragments contained in the plasmids CD8-E199–154, CD8-E199–148, and CD8-E199–142 encode, respectively, residues 99–154, 99–148, and 99–142 of the E1 protein. Plasmid CD8-SV differs from CD8-E199–142 in that the HCV fragment was substituted with a Sindbis virus sequence derived from plasmid pSP1900 (28Migliaccio G. Pascale M.C. Leone A. Bonatti S. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and coding for residues 360–403 of the SV E1 protein. Plasmid CD8-E199–142M is identical to plasmid CD8-E199–142 but contains mutations of HCV nucleotides ATGATGATG, coding for methionines 131–133, into AGCAGCAGC, coding for three serines. Plasmids expressing the AP chimeric proteins were prepared from the plasmids expressing correspondent CD8 chimeras by substituting the CD8 ectodomain sequence with AP sequence in two steps. First, plasmids CD8, CD8-SV, CD8-E199–142, and CD8-E199–142M were digested with BglII (unique site in the promoter region) and SpHI to remove only the CD8 ectodomain. Then they were ligated with a fragment BglII/SpHI amplified by PCR from promoter region in plasmid CD8 and contained a mutagenized unique site for HindIII. These intermediate plasmids were again digested with HindIII and SphI and ligated to the soluble AP cDNA fragment HindIII/SphI derived by PCR from the plasmid pBC12/RSV/SEAP in which the stop codon in position 1529–31 of cDNA sequence was removed (13Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene. 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Parental FRT cells were cultured as described previously (19Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Migliaccio G. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9940-9947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stably transfected with Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Stable transformants were obtained by co-transfecting cells with recombinant plasmids and the plasmid PSV2neo, selected in the presence of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and screened by indirect immunofluorescence. HuH-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by using FuGENETM6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 36 h after transfection, cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and made permeable with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were labeled with the appropriate antibodies and with fluorescein and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. To separately stain the cell surface and the intracellular membranes, after fixation cells were incubated with a specific polyclonal antibody, then permeabilized and incubated with a specific monoclonal antibody. Coverslips were mounted in Moviol and viewed by epifluorescence on a Zeiss axiomat photomicroscope with a 100× planar objective. Stably transfected cells were allowed to grow to subconfluency and then were manipulated for [35S]cysteine, [3H]GlcN, or [3H]Man labeling, as performed previously (19Pascale M.C. Malagolini N.

Cells were lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide; total extracts were passed several times through a syringe needle, and aliquots were then used for immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting as detailed previously (28Migliaccio G. Pascale M.C. Leone A. Bonatti S. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Bonatti S. Migliaccio G. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12590-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation with the conformation-sensitive antibodies, OKT8 and G10-1, cells were lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide. To calculate the half-life times, the amounts of protein were determined by scanning densitometry of the film developed after autoradiography. Mean values of four experiments were considered. Treatment with Endo H and neuraminidase were performed as indicated in the manufacturer's instructions. All analysis were performed on CD8-derived proteins immunoprecipitated after 16 h of labeling with [3H]GlcN or [3H]Man and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Areas of polyacrylamide gels corresponding to bands visualized by fluorography were excised and digested overnight with Pronase at 60 °C. The glycopeptides isolated by Bio-Gel P-4 filtration (400 mesh) column (1 × 75 cm) were analyzed for the radioactive amino-sugar composition as described previously (19Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Migliaccio G. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9940-9947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).N-Glycans generated by Endo H treatment were isolated by Bio-Gel P-4 filtration and analyzed by HPLC as described (30Serafini-Cessi F. Malagolini N. Hoops T.C. Rindler M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were lysed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.8, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, Triton X-100 0.5%. Aliquots of cell lysates were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity as described previously (31Cullen B.R. Malim M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The increase in light absorption at 405 nm was measured after 20 min of incubation with the specific substratep-nitrophenyl phosphate. The amounts of alkaline phosphatase chimeras were determined as arbitrary units by scanning densitometry of the Western blot film using the NIH Image program. The specific activities were calculated dividing the absorbance units for the protein amount measured. It was previously reported that E1 with the C-terminal 72 residues deleted was efficiently secreted (12Michalak J.P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); thus we focused on this portion of the protein and fused it to the C terminus of the CD8 ectodomain (Fig.1 A). For cloning convenience, our initial construct (CD8-E199–192) contained the 94 C-terminal residues of E1, encompassing the juxtamembrane portion of the ectodomain and the entire transmembrane domain. We examined the intracellular distribution of CD8-E199–192by indirect immunofluorescence analysis of stably transfected FRT cells (Fig. 2). To unequivocally assess the subcellular localization of wild type and chimeric CD8 protein, we regularly decorated transfected cells before and after permeabilization with a polyclonal and a monoclonal anti-CD8 antibody, respectively. In this way the polyclonal antibody recognized only the protein present on the cell surface, whereas the monoclonal antibody labeled the protein present on all cellular membranes. Unlike wild type CD8 (Fig. 2,a–b) that was localized primarily on the cell surface, CD8-E199–192 could not be detected on the plasma membrane and was only found on intracellular membranes (Fig. 2,c–d). Double labeling experiments of permeabilized cells with antibodies reacting with antigens localized in specific subcellular compartments showed that the chimeric protein co-localized with the SSRα protein, an ER resident protein (Fig. 2,e–f) but not with mannosidase II, a medial-Golgi marker (data not shown). Therefore, the C-terminal region 99–192 of E1 protein prevents the progress of the reporter in the secretory pathway and determines localization in the ER. To gain independent evidence of the intracellular distribution of CD8-E199–192, we analyzed its glycosylation. CD8-E199–192 could be modified by the addition of bothN- and O-linked sugars; two sites for N-glycosylation are contained in the 56 lumenal amino acids of E1 (positions 114 and 134 of the protein; see Fig. 1 B), but a recent study revealed that only the one in position 114 is utilized (32Meunier J.-C. Fournillier A. Choukhi A. Cahour A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. Wychowski C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The CD8 ectodomain is usually modified by the addition of 7–8 O-linked glycans, whereas the N-glycosylation site present in the N-terminal region is usually not modified. We first evaluated in pulse-chase experiments the Endo H and neuraminidase sensitivity of CD8-E199–192. Endo H digests N-glycans of high mannose type, and resistance to Endo H digestion indicates that a glycoprotein has moved from the ER to the medial- and trans-Golgi, where high mannose chains are converted to complex type chains. Neuraminidase removes sialic acid residues from both N- and O-glycans. These residues are added in the trans-/trans-Golgi network; thus, sensitivity to neuraminidase indicates passage of a glycoprotein through these compartments. In agreement with previous studies (19Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Migliaccio G. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9940-9947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wild type CD8 was almost completely or completely converted into a mature, neuraminidase-sensitive form after 1 or 4 h of chase (Fig.3). As expected, CD8 was always resistant to Endo H digestion. CD8-E199–192 was mostly present as a 33-kDa band that did not show any modification in its electrophoretic mobility over time. At all time points analyzed, this protein was completely sensitive to Endo H and resistant to neuraminidase digestion, indicating the absence of complex type N-glycans and sialic acid residues, respectively. These modifications suggested an incomplete maturation and a premedial-Golgi location of CD8-E199–192 at steady state. To define more precisely the intracellular distribution of CD8-E199–192, we characterized its carbohydrate chains by gel filtration and HPLC. Fig. 4 shows that the [3H]GlcN-labeled Pronase glycopeptides from CD8-E199–192 contained GlcNAc but not GalNAc, indicating the presence of N-glycans and the absence of O-glycans (Fig. 4, panel a). In addition, the gel filtration of [3H]Man-labeled glycopeptides revealed that they were entirely Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 4, panel b), and HPLC analysis of oligosaccharides generated by Endo H showed the presence of two major species Man8GlcNAc and Man9GlcNAc (Fig. 4, panel c). These results suggested that the N-glycans were modified only by the ER glucosidases I and II and partially by the ER mannosidase (33Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that CD8-E199–192 does not receive Golgi complex modifications because it is modified at the N-glycans only by ER resident enzymes and does not carryO-glycans. Next we analyzed the subcellular localization of a chimeric protein containing the CD8 ectodomain fused to the hydrophobic tail of E1 (Fig. 1 A, CD8-E1155–192). Immunofluorescence analysis of stable transfectants expressing CD8-E1155–192 showed also that this chimeric protein was not expressed on the cell surface but was localized intracellularly (Fig. 5,a–b), in close association with the ER membrane as indicated by co-localization with the ER marker protein calnexin (Fig.5, c–d). The level of expression of CD8-E1155–192 in the stably transfected FRT cells was low, as reported for the chimeric form of CD4 containing the TMD of E2 (10Cocquerel L. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, we could not perform a biochemical analysis to study the glycan processing and the maturation of the protein. A possible explanation for this finding is that the TMD of E1 protein has a toxic effect on the cells. Interestingly, rapid cell lysis, probably due to permeability changes of the inner membrane, has been recently documented in prokaryotic cells expressing this region (34Ciccaglione A.R. Marcantonio C. Costantino A. Equestre M. Geraci A. Rapicetta M. Virology. 1998; 250: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results were entirely consistent with the previously described identification of an ER retention signal in the TMD domain of E1 (9Cocquerel L. Duvet S. Meunier J.C. Pillez A. Cacan R. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2641-2649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the presence of additional ER localization signal(s) in the lumenal portion of E1 protein, we prepared three additional constructs containing amino acids 99–154, 99–148, and 99–142 of E1 inserted between the ectodomain and the TMD of CD8 (see Fig. 1 A). By immunofluorescence analysis of transiently transfected cells, we observed that chimeric proteins encoded by these three constructs were also localized intracellularly and could not be detected on the cell surface (data not shown). Thus, we focused on the construct containing the shortest fragment (Fig. 1 A, CD8-E199–142) and analyzed its intracellular localization in stably transfected cells in comparison to an ER marker protein (Fig.6). The immunofluorescence results showed that CD8-E199–142 displayed the same subcellular localization observed for CD8-E199–192 and CD8-E1155–192, thus indicating that the 44 lumenal amino acids of E1, independently of the transmembrane domain, determine localization of CD8 protein in the ER. Then we analyzed glycosylation of CD8-E199–142. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that CD8-E199–142 was present mostly as a 34-kDa band, completely sensitive to Endo H and resistant to neuraminidase, which did not change electrophoretic mobility during the chase (Fig.7 A); a faster migrating band, which displayed a similar sensitivity to glycosidases, appeared in variable amounts in different experiments. This molecular form was not recognized by an antibody against the CD8 tail (data not shown) and could be due to an endoproteolytic cleavage(s) of unknown nature, resulting in the removal of the C-terminal tail. The analysis by gel filtration of the [3H]GlcN-labeled glycan moiety confirmed the data obtained with CD8-E199–192 (Fig.7 B). Also CD8-E199–142 did not contain GalNAc but only N-glycans of complex type, indicating the absence of Golgi-enzyme modifications. Protein misfolding in the lumen of the ER prevents export toward the Golgi complex (35Helenius A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that CD8-E199–142 was retained in the ER by quality control mechanisms recognizing misfolded proteins, we performed different experiments. First, we analyzed the folding status of this chimeric protein by using two different conformation-sensitive antibodies, OKT8 and G10-1, and by assessing the formation of disulfide-linked homodimers (18Pascale M.C. Erra M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25196-25201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since both antibodies recognized human CD8 in"

https://openalex.org/W2019953245,"The formation and evolution of young low-mass stars are characterized by important processes of mass loss and accretion occurring in the innermost regions of their placentary circumstellar disks. Because of the large obscuration of these disks at optical and infrared wavelengths in the early protostellar stages (class 0 sources), they were previously detected only at radio wavelengths using interferometric techniques. We have detected with the Infrared Space Observatory the mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission associated with the class 0 protostar VLA1 in the HH1-HH2 region located in the Orion nebula. The emission arises in three wavelength windows (at 5. 3, 6.6, and 7.5 micrometers) where the absorption due to ices and silicates has a local minimum that exposes the central part of the young protostellar system to mid-IR investigations. The mid-IR emission arises from a central source with a diameter of 4 astronomical units at an averaged temperature of approximately 700 K, deeply embedded in a dense region with a visual extinction of 80 to 100 magnitudes."
