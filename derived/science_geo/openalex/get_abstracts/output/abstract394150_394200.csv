https://openalex.org/W1986602268,"FGF21 is a novel metabolic regulator involved in the control of glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and ketogenesis. The liver has been considered the main site of production and release of FGF21 into the blood. Here, we show that, after thermogenic activation, brown adipose tissue becomes a source of systemic FGF21. This is due to a powerful cAMP-mediated pathway of regulation of FGF21 gene transcription. Norepinephrine, acting via β-adrenergic, cAMP-mediated, mechanisms and subsequent activation of protein kinase A and p38 MAPK, induces FGF21 gene transcription and also FGF21 release in brown adipocytes. ATF2 binding to the FGF21 gene promoter mediates cAMP-dependent induction of FGF21 gene transcription. FGF21 release by brown fat in vivo was assessed directly by analyzing arteriovenous differences in FGF21 concentration across interscapular brown fat, in combination with blood flow to brown adipose tissue and assessment of FGF21 half-life. This analysis demonstrates that exposure of rats to cold induced a marked release of FGF21 by brown fat in vivo, in association with a reduction in systemic FGF21 half-life. The present findings lead to the recognition of a novel pathway of regulation the FGF21 gene and an endocrine role of brown fat, as a source of FGF21 that may be especially relevant in conditions of activation of thermogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2076452392,"Aneuploidy, an incorrect chromosome number, is a hallmark of cancer. Compounds that cause lethality in aneuploid, but not euploid, cells could therefore provide new cancer therapies. We have identified the energy stress-inducing agent AICAR, the protein folding inhibitor 17-AAG, and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine as exhibiting this property. AICAR induces p53-mediated apoptosis in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) trisomic for chromosome 1, 13, 16, or 19. AICAR and 17-AAG, especially when combined, also show efficacy against aneuploid human cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that compounds that interfere with pathways that are essential for the survival of aneuploid cells could serve as a new treatment strategy against a broad spectrum of human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2056571985,"Accurate and complete analysis of genome variation in large populations will be required to understand the role of genome variation in complex disease. We present an analytical framework for characterizing genome deletion polymorphism in populations using sequence data that are distributed across hundreds or thousands of genomes. Our approach uses population-level concepts to reinterpret the technical features of sequence data that often reflect structural variation. In the 1000 Genomes Project pilot, this approach identified deletion polymorphism across 168 genomes (sequenced at 4 × average coverage) with sensitivity and specificity unmatched by other algorithms. We also describe a way to determine the allelic state or genotype of each deletion polymorphism in each genome; the 1000 Genomes Project used this approach to type 13,826 deletion polymorphisms (48-995,664 bp) at high accuracy in populations. These methods offer a way to relate genome structural polymorphism to complex disease in populations."
https://openalex.org/W1966157599,"To date, the only known role of the spliced form of X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1s) in metabolic processes has been its ability to act as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes that increase the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding capacity, thereby improving insulin sensitivity. Here we show that XBP-1s interacts with the Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor and directs it toward proteasome-mediated degradation. Given this new insight, we tested modest hepatic overexpression of XBP-1s in vivo in mouse models of insulin deficiency or insulin resistance and found it improved serum glucose concentrations, even without improving insulin signaling or ER folding capacity. The notion that XBP-1s can act independently of its role in the ER stress response is further supported by our finding that in the severely insulin resistant ob/ob mouse strain a DNA-binding-defective mutant of XBP-1s, which does not have the ability to increase ER folding capacity, is still capable of reducing serum glucose concentrations and increasing glucose tolerance. Our results thus provide the first evidence to our knowledge that XBP-1s, through its interaction with FoxO1, can bypass hepatic insulin resistance independent of its effects on ER folding capacity, suggesting a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2002784328,"Snail1 and Zeb1 are E-cadherin-transcriptional repressors induced during epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this article we have analyzed the factors controlling Zeb1 expression during EMT. In NMuMG cells treated with TGF-β, Snail1 RNA and protein are induced 1 h after addition of the cytokine preceding Zeb1 up-regulation that requires 6-8 h. Zeb1 gene expression is caused by increased RNA levels but also by enhanced protein stability and is markedly dependent on Snail1 because depletion of this protein prevents Zeb1 protein and RNA up-regulation. In addition to Snail1, depletion of the Twist transcriptional factor retards Zeb1 stimulation by TGF-β or decreases Zeb1 expression in other cellular models indicating that this factor is also required for Zeb1 expression. Accordingly, Snail1 and Twist cooperate in the induction of Zeb1: co-transfection of both cDNAs is required for the maximal expression of ZEB1 mRNA. Unexpectedly, the expression of Snail1 and Twist shows a mutual dependence although to a different extent; whereas Twist depletion retards Snail1 up-regulation by TGF-β, Snail1 is necessary for the rapid increase in Twist protein and later up-regulation of Twist1 mRNA induced by the cytokine. Besides this effect on Twist, Snail1 also induces the nuclear translocation of Ets1, another factor required for Zeb1 expression. Both Twist and Ets1 bind to the ZEB1 promoter although to different elements: whereas Ets1 interacts with the proximal promoter, Twist does it with a 700-bp sequence upstream of the transcription start site. These results indicate that Snail1 controls Zeb1 expression at multiple levels and acts cooperatively with Twist in the ZEB1 gene transcription induction."
https://openalex.org/W1989644272,"Geneviève Almouzni and colleagues report that SUMOylation promotes de novo targeting of HP1α to pericentric heterochromatin in mouse. They identify long nuclear non-coding transcripts at major satellite repeats and show that they specifically associate with SUMO-modified HP1 proteins. HP1 enrichment at pericentric heterochromatin is considered important for centromere function. Although HP1 binding to H3K9me3 can explain its accumulation at pericentric heterochromatin, how it is initially targeted there remains unclear. Here, in mouse cells, we reveal the presence of long nuclear noncoding transcripts corresponding to major satellite repeats at the periphery of pericentric heterochromatin. Furthermore, we find that major transcripts in the forward orientation specifically associate with SUMO-modified HP1 proteins. We identified this modification as SUMO-1 and mapped it in the hinge domain of HP1α. Notably, the hinge domain and its SUMOylation proved critical to promote the initial targeting of HP1α to pericentric domains using de novo localization assays, whereas they are dispensable for maintenance of HP1 domains. We propose that SUMO-HP1, through a specific association with major forward transcript, is guided at the pericentric heterochromatin domain to seed further HP1 localization."
https://openalex.org/W1971179664,"Our experiences can blind us. Once we have learned to solve problems by one method, we often have difficulties in generating solutions involving a different kind of insight. Yet there is evidence that people with brain lesions are sometimes more resistant to this so-called mental set effect. This inspired us to investigate whether the mental set effect can be reduced by non-invasive brain stimulation. 60 healthy right-handed participants were asked to take an insight problem solving task while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the anterior temporal lobes (ATL). Only 20% of participants solved an insight problem with sham stimulation (control), whereas 3 times as many participants did so (p = 0.011) with cathodal stimulation (decreased excitability) of the left ATL together with anodal stimulation (increased excitability) of the right ATL. We found hemispheric differences in that a stimulation montage involving the opposite polarities did not facilitate performance. Our findings are consistent with the theory that inhibition to the left ATL can lead to a cognitive style that is less influenced by mental templates and that the right ATL may be associated with insight or novel meaning. Further studies including neurophysiological imaging are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms leading to the enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W1983437695,"There is increasing evidence to suggest that splicing decisions are largely made when the nascent RNA is still associated with chromatin. Here we demonstrate that activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) influences splice site selection. Using splicing-sensitive microarrays, we identified ∼700 genes whose splicing was altered after HDAC inhibition. We provided evidence that HDAC inhibition induced histone H4 acetylation and increased RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) processivity along an alternatively spliced element. In addition, HDAC inhibition reduced co-transcriptional association of the splicing regulator SRp40 with the target fibronectin exon. We further showed that the depletion of HDAC1 had similar effect on fibronectin alternative splicing as global HDAC inhibition. Importantly, this effect was reversed upon expression of mouse HDAC1 but not a catalytically inactive mutant. These results provide a molecular insight into a complex modulation of splicing by HDACs and chromatin modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2036952012,"The TrkH/TrkG/KtrB proteins mediate K(+) uptake in bacteria and probably evolved from simple K(+) channels by multiple gene duplications or fusions. Here we present the crystal structure of a TrkH from Vibrio parahaemolyticus. TrkH is a homodimer, and each protomer contains an ion permeation pathway. A selectivity filter, similar in architecture to those of K(+) channels but significantly shorter, is lined by backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms. Functional studies showed that TrkH is selective for permeation of K(+) and Rb(+) over smaller ions such as Na(+) or Li(+). Immediately intracellular to the selectivity filter are an intramembrane loop and an arginine residue, both highly conserved, which constrict the permeation pathway. Substituting the arginine with an alanine significantly increases the rate of K(+) flux. These results reveal the molecular basis of K(+) selectivity and suggest a novel gating mechanism for this large and important family of membrane transport proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2063340261,"Suppressor of fused (Sufu) is an essential negative regulator of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway, but little is known about how Sufu itself is normally regulated. Here, we report that Sufu is phosphorylated at Ser-342 and Ser-346 by GSK3β and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), respectively, and phosphorylation at this dual site stabilizes Sufu against Shh signaling-induced degradation. We further show that localization of Sufu in the primary cilium is induced by Shh signaling and is required for the turnover of both phosphorylated and total Sufu. Perturbing Sufu phosphorylation with PKA inhibitors or replacing Ser-346 with alanine reduced the stay and replacing Ser-342 and Ser-346 with aspartic acid prolonged the stay of Sufu in the cilia. Finally, ciliary localization of Gli2/3 also required Smo and was similarly influenced by perturbations of PKA activity or mutations at the dual Sufu phosphorylation site. Thus, Shh likely induced trafficking of phospho-Sufu into the primary cilium in a complex with Gli2/3, and dephosphorylation triggered a retrograde export, allowing Sufu to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system."
https://openalex.org/W2041381266,"Activating mutations in the Kras gene are commonly found in some but not all epithelial cancers. In order to understand the susceptibility of different epithelial tissues to Kras-induced tumorigenesis, we introduced one of the most common Kras mutations, KrasG12D, broadly in epithelial tissues. We used a mouse model in which the G12D mutation is placed in the endogenous Kras locus controlled by inducible, Cre-mediated recombination in tissues expressing cytokeratin 19 including the oral cavity, GI tract, lungs, and ducts of the liver, kidney, and the pancreas. Introduction of the KrasG12D mutation in adult mouse tissues led to neoplastic changes in some but not all of these tissues. Notably, many hyperplasias, metaplasias and adenomas were observed in the oral cavity, stomach, colon and lungs, suggesting that exposure to products of the outside environment promotes KrasG12D-initiated tumorigenesis. However, environmental exposure did not consistently correlate with tumor formation, such as in the small intestine, suggesting that there are also intrinsic differences in susceptibility to Kras activation. The pancreas developed small numbers of mucinous metaplasias with characteristics of early stage pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs), supporting the hypothesis that pancreatic ducts have the potential to give rise pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2037009121,"Several mammalian proteins involved in chromatin and DNA modification contain CXXC zinc finger domains. We compared the structure and function of the CXXC domains in the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 and the methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet1. Sequence alignment showed that both CXXC domains have a very similar framework but differ in the central tip region. Based on the known structure of a similar MLL1 domain we developed homology models and designed expression constructs for the isolated CXXC domains of Dnmt1 and Tet1 accordingly. We show that the CXXC domain of Tet1 has no DNA binding activity and is dispensable for catalytic activity in vivo. In contrast, the CXXC domain of Dnmt1 selectively binds DNA substrates containing unmethylated CpG sites. Surprisingly, a Dnmt1 mutant construct lacking the CXXC domain formed covalent complexes with cytosine bases both in vitro and in vivo and rescued DNA methylation patterns in dnmt1−/− embryonic stem cells (ESCs) just as efficiently as wild type Dnmt1. Interestingly, neither wild type nor ΔCXXC Dnmt1 re-methylated imprinted CpG sites of the H19a promoter in dnmt1−/− ESCs, arguing against a role of the CXXC domain in restraining Dnmt1 methyltransferase activity on unmethylated CpG sites."

https://openalex.org/W2092510037,"Recent studies implicate a role for WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide-interacting 1 (WIPI1) in the biogenesis of melanosomes, cell type-specific lysosome-related organelles. In this study, we determined that WIPI1, an ATG18 homologue that is shown to localize to both autophagosomes and early endosomes, inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) signaling, leading to increased transcription of melanogenic enzymes and the formation of mature melanosomes. WIPI1 suppressed the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) activity, resulting in glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibition, β-Catenin stabilization, and increased transcription of microphthalmia transcription factor and its target genes. WIPI1-depleted cells accumulated stage I melanosomes but lacked stage III-IV melanosomes. Inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin treatment resulted in the accumulation of stage IV melanosomes but not autophagosomes, whereas starvation resulted in the formation of autophagosomes but not melanin accumulation. Taken together, our studies define a distinct role for WIPI1 and TORC1 signaling in controlling the transcription of melanogenic enzymes and melanosome maturation, a process that is distinct from starvation-induced autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2065265074,"We have investigated the role of human endogenous retroviruses in multiple sclerosis by analyzing the DNA of patients and controls in 4 cohorts for associations between multiple sclerosis and polymorphisms near viral restriction genes or near endogenous retroviral loci with one or more intact or almost-intact genes. We found that SNPs in the gene TRIM5 were inversely correlated with disease. Conversely, SNPs around one retroviral locus, HERV-Fc1, showed a highly significant association with disease. The latter association was limited to a narrow region that contains no other known genes. We conclude that HERV-Fc1 and TRIM5 play a role in the etiology of multiple sclerosis. If these results are confirmed, they point to new modes of treatment for multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2151102828,"The Henipavirus genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid that recruits the polymerase complex via the phosphoprotein (P). In a previous study, we reported that in henipaviruses, the N-terminal domain of the phosphoprotein and the C-terminal domain of the nucleoprotein (NTAIL) are both intrinsically disordered. Here we show that Henipavirus NTAIL domains are also disordered in the context of full-length nucleoproteins. We also report the cloning, purification, and characterization of the C-terminal X domains (PXD) of Henipavirus phosphoproteins. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we show that NTAIL and PXD form a 1:1 stoichiometric complex that is stable under NaCl concentrations as high as 1 m and has a KD in the μm range. Using far-UV circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that PXD triggers an increase in the α-helical content of NTAIL. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we show that PXD has no impact on the chemical environment of a Trp residue introduced at position 527 of the Henipavirus NTAIL domain, thus arguing for the lack of stable contacts between the C termini of NTAIL and PXD. Finally, we present a tentative structural model of the NTAIL-PXD interaction in which a short, order-prone region of NTAIL (α-MoRE; amino acids 473–493) adopts an α-helical conformation and is embedded between helices α2 and α3 of PXD, leading to a relatively small interface dominated by hydrophobic contacts. The present results provide the first detailed experimental characterization of the N-P interaction in henipaviruses and designate the NTAIL-PXD interaction as a valuable target for rational antiviral approaches.

Nipah virus (NiV), the second known member of the genus Henipavirus, came to light as the etiologic agent of an outbreak of respiratory and central nervous system disease in pigs and humans in Malaysia in 1998 through 1999. The initial NiV outbreak in Malaysia resulted in 265 human cases of encephalitis, including 105 deaths. The virus reemerged in Bangladesh in 2001, and outbreaks of encephalitis have occurred in that country almost every year since, with a case fatality rate approaching 75% (see (1Eaton B.T. Mackenzie J.S. Wang L.F. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 5th Ed. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2007: 1587-1600Google Scholar) and references cited therein). Although the genome of HeV and NiV shares the same overall organization of members of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily, a few distinctive properties, including their much larger size, led to the creation of the Henipavirus genus to accommodate these newly emerged zoonotic viruses (2Wang L.F. Yu M. Hansson E. Pritchard L.I. Shiell B. Michalski W.P. Eaton B.T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9972-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Currently this genus contains two virus species and a number of strains isolated from humans, bats, horses, and pigs over a wide geographic area and during a period of 10 years. Notably, henipaviruses have recently also been found outside of Australia and Asia, thus extending the number of endemic regions of one of the most pathogenic virus genera known in humans (3Drexler J.F. Corman V.M. Gloza-Rausch F. Seebens A. Annan A. Ipsen A. Kruppa T. Müller M.A. Kalko E.K. Adu-Sarkodie Y. Oppong S. Drosten C. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of humans, the wide host range, and interspecies transmission, together with the absence of therapeutic agents, led to the classification of HeV and NiV as biosecurity level 4 (BSL4) pathogens (4Eaton B.T. Broder C.C. Middleton D. Wang L.F. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). As in all Mononegavirales members, the negative-strand, non-segmented RNA genome of Henipavirus is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid that has the characteristic herringbone-like structure typically observed in other Paramyxoviridae members (5Karlin D.

This helical nucleocapsid, rather than naked RNA, is the substrate used by the polymerase complex during both transcription and replication. Minigenome replicon studies showed that in henipaviruses the nucleoprotein, the phosphoprotein (P) and the large protein (L) proteins are necessary and sufficient to sustain replication of viral RNA (11Halpin K. Bankamp B. Harcourt B.H. Bellini W.J. Rota P.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By analogy with other Paramyxoviridae members, the polymerase complex is assumed to consist of the L protein and the P protein, with this latter serving as a tether for the recruitment of L onto the nucleocapsid template. As in all Mononegavirales members, Henipavirus N and P proteins have been shown to interact with each other being able to form both homologous and heterologous N-P complexes (12Chan Y.P. Koh C.L. Lam S.K. Wang L.F. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 1675-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies by Omi-Furutani et al. (13Omi-Furutani M. Yoneda M. Fujita K. Ikeda F. Kai C. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 9793-9799Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) allowed NiV N and P proteins to be visualized in live cells and unveiled their co-localization in the cytoplasm. The genome organization of Henipavirus resembles that of the Respirovirus and Morbillivirus genera. The extra length of the Henipavirus genome arises mainly from additional unique, long untranslated sequences at the 3′-end of five of the six genes. Despite the much larger genome size of henipaviruses, the genome length is divisible by 6, and reverse genetics studies have confirmed that NiV obeys the “rule of six” (i.e. the genome length must be a multiple of 6 to replicate efficiently) (11Halpin K. Bankamp B. Harcourt B.H. Bellini W.J. Rota P.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Overall, the proteins of henipaviruses share the same features as cognate proteins in the Paramyxovirinae subfamily. The Henipavirus P protein however is significantly larger, with a larger P N-terminal domain accounting for the extra length (14Habchi J. Mamelli L. Darbon H. Longhi S. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). So far, structural and molecular information on Henipavirus proteins is scarce. Indeed high-resolution structural data are limited to their surface proteins, where crystallographic studies led to the determination of the three-dimensional structure of Henipavirus fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins (15Lou Z.

Wang L.F. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 1675-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and from our recently published studies (14Habchi J. Mamelli L. Darbon H. Longhi S. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Although Chan et al. (12Chan Y.P. Koh C.L. Lam S.K. Wang L.F. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 1675-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) reported the bacterial expression of Henipavirus N and P proteins and performed interaction studies by protein-blotting protein-overlay assays that led to the mapping of the reciprocal N-P binding sites, those studies did not embrace any biochemical characterization of the proteins. On the other hand, in our previous studies, by combining computational and experimental approaches, we deciphered the modular organization of Henipavirus N and P proteins and showed that the C-terminal region of N (NTAIL; amino acids 400–532) and the N-terminal region of P (amino acids 1–404/406) belong to the family of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), although they both contain short, order-prone segments (14Habchi J. Mamelli L. Darbon H. Longhi S. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The occurrence of some residual transient secondary and/or tertiary structure within the NTAIL and the N-terminal disordered domain of P led to their classification within the premolten globules (PMG) subfamily within the family of IDPs (19Dunker A.K.

J. 2010; 99: 1676-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we have previously speculated that the C-terminal X domain of the Henipavirus P protein (PXD) may constitute a possible partner of Henipavirus NTAIL, with the MoREs of this latter being involved in partner recognition (14Habchi J. Mamelli L. Darbon H. Longhi S. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the bacterial expression, purification, and characterization of PXD from both HeV and NiV and show that they both are structured and have a predominant α-helical content. We also show that the X domains of Henipavirus P proteins bind to the intrinsically disordered NTAIL domain of the nucleoprotein, thereby providing a means to tether P onto the nucleocapsid template. We provide evidence for the disordered nature of NTAIL domains bseng also in the context of the full-length N proteins, and show that binding to PXD triggers α-helical folding of NTAIL. The present studies, beyond confirming the predicted modular organization of Henipavirus P proteins, provide the first detailed experimental characterization of the N-P interaction and highlight the importance of disorder and induced folding in molecular recognition by Paramyxoviridae proteins. The Henipavirus N and PXD constructs, encoding full-length N (residues 1–532) and residues 660–709 (NiV) or 657–707 (HeV) of P, with a hexahistidine tag fused to their C termini, were obtained by PCR using either Pfx (Stratagene) or Phusion (Finnzymes) polymerase and synthetic N and P genes (GenScript), optimized for the expression in Escherichia coli, as templates. Primers (Operon) were designed to introduce a hexahistidine tag encoding sequence at the 3′-end of the DNA fragments, as well as an AttB1 and AttB2 sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The rationale for the choice of the tag position was to avoid purification of truncated forms arising from possible abortive translation. After digestion with DpnI (New England Biolabs) to remove the methylated DNA template and purification (PCR purification kit, Qiagen), the PCR products were cloned into the pDest14 vector (Invitrogen) using the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). The Henipavirus pDest14/NTAILHN constructs encoding residues 400–532 of N with a hexahistidine tag fused to their N termini have been described (14Habchi J. Mamelli L. Darbon H. Longhi S. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The NiV and HeV NTAIL F527W constructs, encoding N-terminally hexahistidine tagged NTAIL bearing a F527W substitution, were obtained by PCR using pDest14/NTAILHN (encoding for either NiV or HeV NTAIL, respectively) as template, Turbo-Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), and a pair of complementary mutagenic primers of 39 nucleotides in length (Operon). After digestion with DpnI to remove the methylated DNA template, the amplified PCR product was used to transform E. coli. Selection and amplification of DNA constructs was carried out using CaCl2-competent E. coli TAM1 cells (Active Motif). The sequence of the coding region of all expression plasmids was verified by sequencing (GATC Biotech) and found to conform to expectations. Expression of Henipavirus N and NTAIL constructs was carried out as described previously (14Habchi J. Mamelli L. Darbon H. Longhi S. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The expression of PXD constructs was carried out by growing the E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS strain (Novagen) in 2YT medium (Triptone 16 g/liter, yeast extract 10 g/liter and NaCl 5 g/liter). Isotopically labeled (15N) NTAIL samples were prepared by growing transformed Rosetta pLysS (Stratagene) cells in a 3-liter fermenter (MiniFors) at 37 °C with minimal batch medium (56Xu B. Jahic M. Enfors S.O. Biotechnol. Prog. 1999; 15: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and supplemented with 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter), and glucose (2 g/liter). A 300-ml preculture grown overnight to saturation in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol was harvested, washed in minimal batch medium, and inoculated into the fermenter. When A600 nm was between 0.8 and 1.0, protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were grown overnight at 37 °C. The induced cells were harvested, washed, and collected by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min). The resulting pellets were frozen at −20 °C. All recombinant proteins were purified using the protocol already described for Henipavirus wt NTAIL proteins (14Habchi J. Mamelli L. Darbon H. Longhi S. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11684Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cellular pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes (v/w) of buffer A (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm PMSF) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 μg/ml DNase I, 20 mm MgSO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (either one tablet (Roche Applied Science)/50 ml of bacterial lysate or 1 ml (Sigma)/25 ml of bacterial lysate depending on whether standard or isotopically labeled proteins were purified, respectively). After a 20-min incubation with gentle agitation, the cells were disrupted by sonication (using a 750W sonicator and four cycles of 30 s each at 45% power output). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. Starting from a 1-liter culture, the clarified supernatant was incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking with 2 ml of chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin preloaded with Ni2+ ions (GE Healthcare) equilibrated previously in buffer A. The resin was washed with buffer A supplemented with 20 mm imidazole, and the recombinant protein was eluted in buffer A supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of the desired protein product. The fractions containing the recombinant protein were combined and then loaded onto either a Superdex 200 HR 16/60 column (N and NTAIL proteins; GE Healthcare) or a Superdex 75 HR 16/60 column (PXD proteins). In the case of isotopically labeled NTAIL samples, a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added (1 μl/ml of protein solution) prior to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The elution buffer for NTAIL and PXD proteins was either 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, or 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, in both cases supplemented with 200 mm NaCl. N proteins were eluted in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, and 300 mm NaCl. Note that in the case of Henipavirus wt NTAIL proteins, the elution from the SEC column was followed by monitoring the absorbance at 254 nm instead of 280 nm because of the lack of Trp and Tyr residues. The proteins were concentrated using a Centricon Plus-20 (molecular cutoff of 3,000 Da for PXD, 5,000 Da for NTAIL, and of 10,000 Da for N) (Millipore). A protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added (1 μl/ml of protein solution) to concentrated 15N-labeled samples before storage. All proteins were stored at −20 °C either in the absence (NTAIL) or presence of glycerol (10% for PXD and 20% for N). Dialysis D-tubes (molecular cutoff of 3,500 Da) (Novagen) were used to exchange the buffer and adjust it to the ensuing analyses. All purification steps, except for gel filtrations, were carried out at 4 °C. The apparent molecular mass of proteins eluted from preparative SEC columns was deduced from a calibration carried out with low molecular weight calibration kits (GE Healthcare). The hydrodynamic radius of a protein (Stokes radius (RS)) can be deduced from its apparent molecular mass (as seen by SEC) (57Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13288-13298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The theoretical Stokes radii (in Å) of a natively folded (RSNF), fully unfolded, random coil state in urea (RSU), and natively unfolded PMG (RSPMG) protein with a theoretical molecular mass (MMtheo) (in daltons) were calculated according to Uversky (34Uversky V.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) as follows.log(RSNF)=0.369*log(MMtheo)−0.254(Eq.1) log(RSU)=0.521*log(MMtheo)−0.649(Eq.2) log(RSPMG)=0.403*log(MMtheo)−0.239(Eq.3) Protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), because estimations based on the theoretical absorption coefficients at 280 nm, as obtained using the program ProtParam at the ExPASy server, were found not to be fully reliable. The presence of RNA in Henipavirus N samples was assessed as it follows. The theoretical ratio of absorptions at 260 versus 280 nm of a sample composed by 95% protein and 5% nucleic acid is 1.06, whereas it is 0.57 for a nucleic acid-free protein sample (58Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratoty Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). In the nucleocapsid, because each N monomer (59 kDa) binds six ribonucleotides (330*6 = 1980 Da) (11Halpin K. Bankamp B. Harcourt B.H. Bellini W.J. Rota P.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), N represents 96% of the total nucleocapsid mass. Accordingly, the A260/A280 ratio of N samples containing RNA is expected to be close to 1.06 (see also Ref. 5Karlin D. Longhi S. Canard B. Virology. 2002; 302: 420-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Analytical SEC was carried out on a high-pressure liquid chromatography system (Alliance 2695, Waters) using silica-based columns (Shodex). A 15-ml KW-802.5 column was used for the characterization of PXD and NTAIL proteins as well as for monitoring complex formation between NTAIL and PXD. Proteins were eluted with a 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl buffer at a flow of 0.5 ml/min. Separation was performed at room temperature. Typically, 30 μl of a protein solution in the 0.3–1.5 mm concentration range was injected. Detection was performed using a triple-angle light-scattering detector (MiniDAWNTM TREOS, Wyatt Technology), a quasi-elastic light-scattering instrument (DynaproTM, Wyatt Technology), and a differential refractometer (Optilab® rEX, Wyatt Technology). Molecular mass and RS determinations were performed by the ASTRA V software (Wyatt Technology) using a dn/dc value of 0.185 ml/g. The column was calibrated with proteins of known Stokes radii and molecular masses. Proteolysis of purified N proteins (each at 16 μm) was performed in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8, at room temperature with trypsin (Promega Corp.). The final enzyme:substrate molar ratio was 1:400. The extent of proteolysis was evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis of 10-μl aliquots that were removed from the reaction mixture over a time course (0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 60 min), added to 10 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min to inactivate the protease. Mass analysis of all Henipavirus proteins was performed using an Autoflex II TOF/TOF. Spectra were acquired in the linear mode. Samples (0.7 μl containing 15 pmol) were mixed with an equal volume of sinapinic acid matrix solution, spotted on the target,"

Although many Pak substrates, including elements of MAPK signaling cascades, have been identified, it is likely that additional substrates remain to be discovered. Identification of such substrates, and determination of the consequences of their phosphorylation, is essential for a better understanding of class I Pak activity. To identify novel class I Pak substrates, we used recombinant Pak2 to screen high density protein microarrays. This approach identified the atypical MAPK Erk3 as a potential Pak2 substrate. Solution-based in vitro kinase assays using recombinant Erk3 confirmed the protein microarray results, and phospho-specific antisera identified serine 189, within the Erk3 activation loop, as a site directly phosphorylated by Pak2 in vitro. Erk3 protein is known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and we showed that selective inhibition of class I Pak kinase activity in cells promoted increased nuclear accumulation of Erk3. Pak inhibition in cells additionally reduced the extent of Ser189 phosphorylation and inhibited the formation of Erk3-Prak complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2172127263,"Pelagic ecosystems support a significant and vital component of the ocean's productivity and biodiversity. They are also heavily exploited and, as a result, are the focus of numerous spatial planning initiatives. Over the past decade, there has been increasing enthusiasm for protected areas as a tool for pelagic conservation, however, few have been implemented. Here we demonstrate an approach to plan protected areas that address the physical and biological dynamics typical of the pelagic realm. Specifically, we provide an example of an approach to planning protected areas that integrates pelagic and benthic conservation in the southern Benguela and Agulhas Bank ecosystems off South Africa. Our aim was to represent species of importance to fisheries and species of conservation concern within protected areas. In addition to representation, we ensured that protected areas were designed to consider pelagic dynamics, characterized from time-series data on key oceanographic processes, together with data on the abundance of small pelagic fishes. We found that, to have the highest likelihood of reaching conservation targets, protected area selection should be based on time-specific data rather than data averaged across time. More generally, we argue that innovative methods are needed to conserve ephemeral and dynamic pelagic biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2043615362,"Honeybee silk is composed of four fibrous proteins that, unlike other silks, are readily synthesized at full-length and high yield. The four silk genes have been conserved for over 150 million years in all investigated bee, ant and hornet species, implying a distinct functional role for each protein. However, the amino acid composition and molecular architecture of the proteins are similar, suggesting functional redundancy. In this study we compare materials generated from a single honeybee silk protein to materials containing all four recombinant proteins or to natural honeybee silk. We analyse solution conformation by dynamic light scattering and circular dichroism, solid state structure by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and fiber tensile properties by stress-strain analysis. The results demonstrate that fibers artificially generated from a single recombinant silk protein can reproduce the structural and mechanical properties of the natural silk. The importance of the four protein complex found in natural silk may lie in biological silk storage or hierarchical self-assembly. The finding that the functional properties of the mature material can be achieved with a single protein greatly simplifies the route to production for artificial honeybee silk."
https://openalex.org/W2079344264,"The aspartic protease cathepsin-D (cath-D) is overexpressed by human epithelial breast cancer cells and is closely correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. The adipocyte is one of the most prominent cell types in the tumor-microenvironment of breast cancer, and clinical studies have shown that obesity increases the incidence of breast cancer. Here, we provide the first evidence that cath-D expression is up-regulated in adipose tissue from obese human beings, as well as in adipocytes from the obese C57BI6/J mouse. Cath-D expression is also increased during human and mouse adipocyte differentiation. We show that cath-D silencing in 3T3-F442A murine preadipocytes leads to lipid-depleted cells after adipogenesis induction, and inhibits of the expression of PPARγ, HSL and aP2 adipocyte differentiation markers. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the key role of cath-D in the control of adipogenesis, and suggest that cath-D may be a novel target in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2102254820,"We report the assembly of the 14,054 bp near complete sequencing of the mitochondrial genome of the legume pod borer (LPB), Maruca vitrata (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), which we subsequently used to estimate divergence and relationships within the lepidopteran lineage. The arrangement and orientation of the 13 protein-coding, 2 rRNA, and 19 tRNA genes sequenced was typical of insect mitochondrial DNA sequences described to date. The sequence contained a high A+T content of 80.1% and a bias for the use of codons with A or T nucleotides in the 3rd position. Transcript mapping with midgut and salivary gland ESTs for mitochondrial genome annotation showed that translation from protein-coding genes initiates and terminates at standard mitochondrial codons, except for the coxI gene, which may start from an arginine CGA codon. The genomic copy of coxII terminates at a T nucleotide, and a proposed polyadenylation mechanism for completion of the TAA stop codon was confirmed by comparisons to EST data. EST contig data further showed that mature M. vitrata mitochondrial transcripts are monocistronic, except for bicistronic transcripts for overlapping genes nd4/nd4L and nd6/cytb, and a tricistronic transcript for atp8/atp6/coxIII. This processing of polycistronic mitochondrial transcripts adheres to the tRNA punctuated cleavage mechanism, whereby mature transcripts are cleaved only at intervening tRNA gene sequences. In contrast, the tricistronic atp8/atp6/coxIII in Drosophila is present as separate atp8/atp6 and coxIII transcripts despite the lack of an intervening tRNA. Our results indicate that mitochondrial processing mechanisms vary between arthropod species, and that it is crucial to use transcriptional information to obtain full annotation of mitochondrial genomes."

To carry out this function, SecA contains regions specific for binding signal peptides on preproteins, the SecB chaperone and SecYEG (for review, see Ref. 5Papanikou E. Karamanou S. Economou A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Once preproteins are bound to the SecA·SecYEG complex, they are translocated by ATP-driven conformational cycles of the SecA nanomotor that have been previously referred to as the SecA membrane insertion/de-insertion cycle based on evidence suggesting that portions of SecA may penetrate transmembrane regions of SecYEG (6Matsumoto G.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although SecA and SecYE proteins are sufficient to catalyze protein translocation, the presence of SecG protein significantly stimulates both in vivo and in vitro protein translocation, particularly at low temperatures (10Nishiyama K.

SecG has been shown to enhance the SecA membrane insertion/de-insertion cycle through its coupled topology inversion, although this latter proposal has been challenged by the normal translocation behavior of a topologically fixed form of SecG (12Nishiyama K.

Although significant progress has been made recently in defining those regions of SecA that are responsible for SecB and signal peptide recognition, elucidation of those regions of SecA that are responsible for SecYEG binding and activation has remained a more difficult task (17Patel C.N.

Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 782-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A variety of different approaches have been taken to elucidate regions of SecA and SecYEG that are important for complex formation as well as activation. SecY forms the bulk of the translocon channel complex, and it is composed of 10 transmembrane (TM1-TM10), 2The abbreviations used are: TM1-TM10, first through tenth transmembrane domain of SecY; pBPA, p-benzoyl-phenylalanine; C1-C6, first through sixth cytoplasmic domains of SecY; CTL, carboxyl-terminal linker domain of SecA; HSD, helical scaffold domain of SecA; HWD, helical wing domain of SecA; NBD-I, nucleotide binding domain I of SecA; NBD-II, nucleotide binding domain II of SecA; P1-P5, first through fifth periplasmic domain of SecY; PPXD, preprotein cross-linking domain of SecA. six cytoplasmic (C1-C6), and five periplasmic domains (P1-P5) (2Van den Berg B.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although initial genetic studies revealed that C5 and C6 are important for the SecA-activation function of SecY, single amino acid substitutions within these regions or even a small deletion within C6 had no effect on SecA binding (6Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Taura T. Yoshihisa T. Ito K.

Similar results were found for substitution mutations at the highly conserved Arg-357 residue within C5 as well as Glu-176 within TM4 (24van der Sluis E.O. Nouwen N. Koch J. de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Tampé R. Driessen A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By contrast, alterations within TM10 or TM7 (Ile-408 to Asn or Ile-278 to Cys, respectively) that resulted in signal sequence suppressor phenotypes did give rise to an increased affinity of SecA for SecY (25van der Wolk J.P.

Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar), it seems more plausible that this latter result is due to an altered SecY conformation that imparts an increased SecA affinity. Peptide affinity blotting and peptide library-scanning approaches have also been utilized to map regions of SecYEG that specifically bind to SecA (24van der Sluis E.O. Nouwen N.

Microbiol. 2008; 70: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that the initial interaction of SecA with SecYEG occurs largely through cytoplasmically exposed regions, as five of six cytoplasmic domains of SecY (all except C3) as well as the sole cytoplasmic domain of SecE were implicated in SecA binding (29Karamanou S. Bariami V. Papanikou E. Kalodimos C.G. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additional studies employing alanine mutagenesis showed that multiple substitutions within C1, C2, or C6 of SecY resulted in a decreased affinity for SecA. Furthermore, the identification of SecA-binding peptides within transmembrane and even periplasmic domains of SecY (TM3, P3, TM4, TM5, TM8, and TM9), SecE (TM2), or SecG (TM2) was interpreted as supporting previous studies that identified portions of SecA that insert into the membrane during its ATP-driven protein translocation cycle (7Economou A.

However, given the artificial nature of this approach as well as major differences in the number of SecY-binding peptides identified by different laboratories (e.g. compare Refs. 24van der Sluis E.O.

Microbiol. 2008; 70: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), these results should be interpreted with caution until more physiological studies can be completed. Given the limitations inherent in genetic or biochemical approaches that employ mutant systems or purified complexes, respectively, in vivo cross-linking approaches offer an attractive alternative by which to study native systems. Recently a site-directed in vivo photocross-linking approach was developed by Schultz and co-workers (for review, see Ref. 34Wang L. Xie J. Schultz P.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 225-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) that allows for detailed protein-protein interaction maps to be constructed. For this purpose p-benzoylphenylalanine, a photo-reactive phenylalanine derivative (35Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe Jr., H.R. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10695-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is incorporated at engineered amber codons within a plasmid-borne target gene utilizing the appropriate cloned Methanococcus jannaschii amber suppressor tRNA and tRNA synthetase genes. The benzophenone group of pBPA reacts with nearby C-H bonds upon excitation at 350–365 nm to produce covalent cross-links between interacting partner proteins. This approach has been utilized previously to map SecA-interacting regions within the cytoplasmic domains of SecY. Of 53 residues tested within SecY, SecA-specific photocross-links were detected within C2, C4, C5, and C6 (36Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16159-16164Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study we have continued to utilize this powerful in vivo approach to define SecA regions that interact with SecY or SecG proteins. Our results show that distinct domains on two halves of the SecA molecule interact with two corresponding SecY partners as well as with the central cytoplasmic domain of SecG protein that contains the TLF motif (37Bost S. Belin D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our data also support the in vivo relevance of the recently published Thermotoga maritima SecA·SecYEG crystal structure that visualized SecYEG interaction for only the carboxyl-terminal half of SecA (38Zimmer J. Nam Y. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2008; 455: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). pBPA1 was purchased from Bachem, whereas LB (Miller) broth and agar were obtained from EMD Chemicals and Difco, respectively. Most other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or a comparable supplier and were reagent quality or better. Plasmid mutations were made by the QuikChange (Stratagene) method utilizing oligonucleotide primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) designed on the Agilent website, and mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis (University of Pennsylvania DNA Sequence Facility). Escherichia coli BLR(λDE3) [F−ompT hsdS (rB− mB−) gal dcm Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn10 (TetR)] was obtained from Stratagene. pSup-pBpARS-6TRN is a p15A chloramphenicol resistant plasmid encoding the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii amber suppressor tRNA/tRNA synthetase system that allows for the efficient incorporation of pBPA into amber codons and was obtained from Peter Schultz (Scripps) (39Ryu Y. Schultz P.G. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding an amino-terminal myc-tagged SecY or carboxyl-terminal myc-tagged SecG, pCDFT7secYmycEG or pCDFT7secEGmyc, respectively, are CloDF13 streptomycin-resistant plasmids that are compatible with both colE1- and p15A-derived plasmids, and they were constructed as follows. To PCR amplify the secYEG genes from pET610 (40van der Does C. de Keyzer J. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 86-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and attach an myc tag onto the 5′ end of secY, forward and reverse primers, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGGAAGAACAGAAACTCATCTCCGAAGAGGACCTGGCTAAACAACCGGGATTAGATTTTCAAAGTGCCAAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGTTCGGGATATCGCTGGTC-3′, respectively, were used in a PCR reaction. The appropriate PCR fragment was gel-purified using the QIAquick (Qiagen) method, digested with NdeI and XhoI (New England Biolabs), and the secYmycEG DNA fragment was cloned into a pCDFDuet-1 vector (Novagen) that had been similarly digested and gel-purified. After ligation, transformation, and purification, the resulting plasmid, pCDFT7secYmycEG, was verified both by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequence analysis. pCDFT7secYEGmyc was constructed from pT7CDFT7secYmycEG by first deleting the secY myc tag and then by adding an myc tag onto the 3′ end of secG utilizing QuikChange and appropriate oligonucleotide primers. The secA and secG amber mutations were constructed in pT7secA-his (colE1, ampicillin resistant) (41Jilaveanu L.B. Zito C.R. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and pCDFT7secYEGmyc, respectively. In addition, initial studies to set up photocross-linking controls employed a secY amber mutation at codon 434, which was constructed in pET610. For photocross-linking studies with secA amber alleles, BLR(λDE3) derivatives containing three plasmids, pT7secA-his with appropriate amber alleles, pCDFT7secYmycEG, and pSup-pBpARS-6TRN, were constructed by transformation. For comparable studies with secG amber alleles, BLR(λDE3) derivatives containing three plasmids, pCDFT7secYEGmyc with appropriate amber alleles, pT7secA-his, and pSup-pBpARS-6TRN were constructed similarly. Strains were grown at 37 °C in 200 ml of LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and pBPA (1 mm) to an A600 between 0.4 and 0.6, when isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and growth was continued for an additional 2 h. The culture was chilled on ice, and all subsequent steps were done on ice or at 4 °C unless specified otherwise. Based on A600 readings, equivalent numbers of cells were sedimented at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl), and resuspended in 48 ml of PBS. 24 ml samples were transferred to 100 mm × 15-mm polystyrene Petri dishes and irradiated at 365 nm for 15 min on a bed of ice using a Rayonet 2000 UV cross-linker (Southern New England Ultraviolet Co.). Treated and control samples were sedimented at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and suspended in 6 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml RNase, 100 μg/ml DNase, 4 mg/ml lysozyme, and 10× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P2714). Cells were disrupted by one or two passages through the French press (Aminco) at 8000 lb/in2, and unbroken cells were removed by 2 repeated sedimentations at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Membranes were isolated by sedimentation at 240,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of 0.2 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing, and resedimented as above. The final carbonate-treated membrane pellet was solubilized in 0.2 ml of 5% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C with occasional mixing for 2 h, when insoluble material was removed by sedimentation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The concentration of total membrane protein was determined spectrophotometrically at A280, and all samples were adjusted to have an equivalent concentration of total membrane protein. An equal volume of sample buffer (2% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) was added to the final sample, and 100-μl aliquots were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. To better separate high molecular weight complexes, 20-cm long SDS-PAGE gels were run at 50–60 V for 16 or 17 h, and the upper portion of the gel was collected for further analysis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (VWR) by electroblotting (Bio-Rad Criterion blotter) at 100 V for 1 h, and membranes were blocked by overnight incubation in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl supplemented with 10% nonfat dry milk. SecA·SecY cross-linked complexes were detected by Western blotting using SecA antisera (TANA Laboratories) or a rabbit polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse monoclonal antibody (Genescript) against c-Myc as primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes) or anti-mouse (Genescript) secondary antibody was then employed, and immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) and imaged using a Syngene Gelbox system. Initial optimizing of the photocross-linking reaction or screening of our secA amber collection was done using a smaller scale method. In this case 25-ml cultures were prepared, washed cells were resuspended in a 6 ml volume, and only 1-ml samples were subjected to photocross-linking for 3 min. After photocross-linking, cells were broken in a cup horn sonicator (Heat Systems Ultrasonics) at the highest setting using one or more bursts of 60 s each at 0 °C, and total membranes were isolated and analyzed similarly as described above. The LIGPLOT program that also contained the DIMPLOT program was obtained from Roman Laskowski (European Bioinformatics Group), and it was utilized to identify interacting residues of SecA and SecG proteins utilizing the T. maritima SecA·SecYEG structure (38Zimmer J. Nam Y. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2008; 455: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The program was set up in the directory path as an executable file, and a modified version of the PDB file (3DIN) containing only the SecA and SecG coordinates was made and saved in the same directory. The program was run in the command prompt as dimplot file.pdb B E (where the last two letters designate the chains in the PDB file of the two proteins). The output was given in a postscript format designating all interacting residues between the two proteins. To generate front-to-front and back-to-back models of SecA bound to a SecYEG dimer, a combination of PyMOL, DSviewerpro, and Coot were utilized. In both cases a second copy of SecYEG was manually docked onto the original SecA·SecYEG structure in either front-to-front or back-to-back orientations to form a mirror image with the corresponding SecYEG partner. In the latter case the third transmembrane helixes of the two SecE molecules were brought into proper proximity with one another (42Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K. Driessen A.J. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To define regions of SecA that interact with SecY, we utilized a site-directed in vivo photocross-linking approach whereby the photoreactive amino acid pBPA was incorporated into SecA at selected amber codons throughout the gene. To maximize our chances of locating regions of SecA·SecY interaction, we relied on our prior study where cysteine scanning and sulfhydryl accessibility approaches were combined to construct an in vivo membrane topology map of SecA (33Jilaveanu L.B. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4661-4668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because productive labeling in this latter case appears to have utilized the protein-conducting channel in order for the sulfhydryl-labeling reagent to gain access to SecA (i.e. the sulfhydryl reagent utilized is ordinarily membrane impermeable), we reasoned that many of these periplasm-accessible SecA residues that are within fluid contact of the channel should also be proximal to SecY. As such, they should serve as an ideal starting place for positioning amber codons within secA. Furthermore, because the 26 SecA cysteine residues that we have now converted to amber codons are reasonably dispersed throughout the secA gene, this approach also provides good coverage of the different SecA regions. We constructed strains with three compatible plasmids for this study. First, we constructed secA amber alleles in pT7secA-his, where secA expression is regulated by the T7 promotor, and SecA protein is synthesized with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag that has been shown previously not to affect its function (see “Experimental Procedures”) (41Jilaveanu L.B. Zito C.R. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Second, we constructed a c-Myc-tagged version of SecY, pCDFT7secYmycEG, as, our anti-SecY peptide antibody was of low affinity and did not allow for good detection of the SecY cross-linked species, whereas our SecA antisera often visualized multiple SecA cross-linked species (data not shown). This latter result is not surprising given the size and complexity of SecA protein and its potential for interacting with multiple partners both of cytoplasmic as well as membrane origin. The combination of these two plasmids, pT7secA-his and pCDFT7secYmycEG, overproduced the SecA·SecYEG complex severalfold, and the overproduced complex has been shown to be functional by a number of criteria (see e.g. Ref. 43Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20106-20111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Finally we utilized pSup-pBpARS-6TRN encoding the highly expressed M. jannaschii amber suppressor tRNA and tRNA synthetase genes that is needed for efficient incorporation of pBPA at amber codons (39Ryu Y. Schultz P.G. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To check for specific and efficient incorporation of pBPA at amber codons, a representative strain carrying a secA amber mutation at codon 59, secA59(Am), was grown in the presence or absence of pBPA, and SecA protein production was monitored by Western blotting. No SecA protein was detected when cells were grown in the absence of pBPA, whereas full-length SecA was detected upon inclusion of pBPA and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in the media (Fig. 1). This result indicates that pBPA incorporation into plasmid-derived, full-length SecA occurred with reasonable efficiency. We next turned to optimizing the photocross-linking step. For this purpose we utilized a Rayonet RPR-100 photoreactor, as this long wavelength UV source has a narrow spectrum at the appropriate wavelength and a consistent spectral intensity over a large surface area (44Farrell I.S. Toroney R. Hazen J.L. Mehl R.A. Chin J.W. Nature Methods. 2005; 2: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This precaution minimizes the photo-damage of proteins that occurs at shorter wavelengths of UV light, and it promotes more consistent cross-linking efficiencies when processing multiple samples within the reaction chamber. We then utilized the secY434(Am) mutant as a photocross-linking calibration standard, as this position within SecY has been shown previously to promote efficient photocross-linking with SecA (36Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16159-16164Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The secY434(Am) mutant was subjected to a time course of UV irradiation and analyzed by Western blotting utilizing SecA antisera. Similar to the previous study, we detected a prominent UV-dependent band of an appropriate size for the SecA·SecY complex (supplemental Fig. S1). Because the intensity of this band was already maximal after 15 min of UV exposure, we utilized this dosage for the remainder of our study. Reliable screening of our secA amber mutant collection by photocross-linking required us to not only use our three-plasmid expression system for specific detection of the relevant SecA·SecY cross-linked complex, but also we found it necessary to utilize subcellular fractionation of UV-irradiated cells to specifically enrich for integral membrane proteins. The addition of this step to our procedure enhanced its sensitivity for detection of less efficient cross-linking for certain of our mutants (shown below). Furthermore, the fractionation procedure eliminates cytoplasmic and peripheral membrane-associated SecA complexes, which could complicate the analysis. Thus, we were able to avoid resorting to immunoprecipitation or affinity purification procedures, as these latter methods can complicate comparisons due to a high degree of variability in sample recovery. Results from our optimized system are shown in Fig. 2 for the secA59(Am) mutant. A UV-dependent SecA59-SecY band was visualized with both SecA and c-Myc antibodies (Fig. 2, panel A, lanes 3 and 4, and panel B, lanes 1 and 2, respectively), and no such species was detected if the secA gene lacked an amber codon (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) or if the strain lacked the c-Myc-tagged copy of secY (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4).

We examined the role of MKP-2 in the regulation of MAP kinase phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and survival responses in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from a novel MKP-2 (DUSP-4) deletion mouse. We show that serum and PDGF induced ERK-dependent MKP-2 expression in wild type MEFs but not in MKP-2−/− MEFs. PDGF stimulation of sustained ERK phosphorylation was enhanced in MKP-2−/− MEFs, whereas anisomycin-induced JNK was only marginally increased. However, marked effects upon cell growth parameters were observed. Cellular proliferation rates were significantly reduced in MKP-2−/− MEFs and associated with a significant increase in cell doubling time. Infection with adenoviral MKP-2 reversed the decrease in proliferation. Cell cycle analysis revealed a block in G2/M phase transition associated with cyclin B accumulation and enhanced cdc2 phosphorylation. MEFs from MKP-2−/− mice also showed enhanced apoptosis when stimulated with anisomycin correlated with increased caspase-3 cleavage and γH2AX phosphorylation. Increased apoptosis was reversed by adenoviral MKP-2 infection and correlated with selective inhibition of JNK signaling.

IntroductionThe amplitude and duration of MAP kinase signaling within a specific subcellular compartment are key features in the integration of extracellular stimuli and their effects on cellular (1Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Three main MAP kinase groups, the ERKs, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases, are involved in regulating functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation in response to growth factors, peptide hormones, stress, and infection (2Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3439) Google Scholar). Perturbations in MAP kinase signaling are features of several different types of diseases including several types of cancers (3Dhillon A.S. Hagan S. Rath O. Kolch W. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar), diabetes (4Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Görgün C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). They share a common C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal non-catalytic domain containing the MAP kinase interaction motif (8Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Each isoform has unique yet overlapping features including substrate specificity, subcellular distribution, and factors regulating induction. For example, MKP-1 is a nuclear DUSP of the type 1 class and selective for all three major MAP kinases in vitro, whereas MKP-3, a type II DUSP, is a cytosolic phosphatase selective solely for ERK over the other kinases (7Keyse S.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Due to effects upon MAP kinase signaling, pertubations in the MKPs have been implicated principally in cancer (9Arnoldussen Y.J. Saatcioglu F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2009; 309: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, more recently, a role has been established in inflammation (10Lang R. Hammer M. Mages J. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7497-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and some cardiovascular disorders (11Wu J.J. Roth R.J. Anderson E.J. Hong E.G. Lee M.K. Choi C.S. Neufer P.D. Shulman G.I.

This DUSP (DUSP-4) is a member of the type 1 family and has been shown to be induced in response to a number of stimuli including phorbol esters and growth hormones (12Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H.

Finn S.G. Fuller S.J. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity for ERK and JNK was originally demonstrated in vitro (16Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); however, selective inhibition of JNK has been implicated in cellular studies (17Cadalbert L. Sloss C.M. Cameron P. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Robinson C.J. Sloss C.M. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although MKP-2 has been recently regarded as a surrogate for the more well described MKP-1, recent cellular studies demonstrate a role in protection against apoptosis (17Cadalbert L. Sloss C.M. Cameron P. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and in senescence (19Tresini M. Lorenzini A. Torres C. Cristofalo V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4136-4151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, there is still a lack of information describing the function of DUSP-4 in different cell types, in particular regarding substrate selectivity in vivo.We have recently developed a DUSP-4 deletion mouse model and demonstrated a novel immunological phenotype in vivo (20Al-Mutairi M.S. Cadalbert L.C. McGachy H.A. Shweash M. Schroeder J. Kurnik M. Sloss C.M. Bryant C.E. Alexander J. Plevin R. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001192Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using embryonic fibroblasts from DUSP-4 deletion mice, we now examine the effect of deletion upon MAP kinase signaling and growth parameters. We find that despite very moderate increases in ERK and JNK activity, MKP-2 deletion has profound effects upon cellular proliferation. In particular, we identify a role for MKP-2 in G2/M phase transition and demonstrate that MKP-2 plays a role in cell survival in response to the apoptotic stimulus anisomycin. These data demonstrate that MKP-2 is a non-redundant DUSP and has overlapping but distinct functions relative to the prototypic DUSP, MKP-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDUSP-4 deletion mice were generated in collaboration with Geno-way and have been genetically characterized previously (20Al-Mutairi M.S. Cadalbert L.C. McGachy H.A. Shweash M. Schroeder J. Kurnik M. Sloss C.M. Bryant C.E. Alexander J. Plevin R. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001192Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Adenoviral MKP-2 was generated by Vector Biolabs and used previously (21Cadalbert L.C. Sloss C.M. Cunningham M.R. Al-Mutairi M. McIntire A. Shipley J. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All reagents were from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK) unless otherwise stated. Antibodies were purchased as follows. Rabbit polyclonal anti-JNK-1 (S-18, full length), anti-ERK-2 (K-23), and cyclin B1 antibodies were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-JNK1/2, p-cdc-2, and caspase-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-phospho-p38 was purchased from BIOSOURCE (Nivelles, Belgium). Anti-phospho-γH2AX was purchased from Millipore. HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, UK). HRP-conjugated anti-mouse and conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (Luton, Bedfordshire, UK). Phycoerythrin-annexin V apoptosis detection kit was purchased from BD Biosciences. All other materials used were of the highest commercial grade available and were obtained from Sigma and Invitrogen (Paisley, UK).Cell CultureMouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from MKP-2−/− or MKP-2+/+ mice (backcross 5) at 13.5-day post-coitum mice in compliance with British Home Office regulations. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. All experiments were performed within three passages. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were prepared from the ventricles of adult mice (8–10 weeks old) from C57Bl/6 MKP-2+/+ and MKP-2−/− (weighing between 20 and 30 g) as described previously (22Meszaros J.G. Gonzalez A.M. Endo-Mochizuki Y. Villegas S. Villarreal F. Brunton L.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C154-C162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 4–5 days, subconfluent cultures were passaged by trypsinization and replated into 12-well plates. Passage 1 cells were used in all experiments. In all experiments, DMEM containing 20% FBS was washed out, and the cells were equilibrated in serum-free DMEM overnight before agonist stimulation. The purity of fibroblast cultures was established by immunofluorescence staining using anti-smooth muscle α actin antibody. Bone marrow mouse macrophages were cultured as outlined previously (20Al-Mutairi M.S. Cadalbert L.C. McGachy H.A. Shweash M. Schroeder J. Kurnik M. Sloss C.M. Bryant C.E. Alexander J. Plevin R. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001192Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).G1 SynchronizationMEFs were grown in 3.5-cm dishes in DMEM containing 10% FCS, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin to 40% confluency. Thymidine was added to a final concentration of 2 mm in the medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 19 h. After the incubation, cells were washed with PBS three times, and fresh media were added without thymidine and incubated for 9 h at 37 °C. Then thymidine was added again to a final of 2 mm and incubated for another 16 h. Cells were washed with PBS three times, and fresh media were added. Cells were harvested at different time points, and the cell cycle profile was analyzed by Western blotting.Cell Cycle AnalysisCell cycle profiles were analyzed by staining intracellular DNA with propidium iodide followed by flow cytometry using the BD FACSDiva software, BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK. MEFs were trypsinized and washed with PBS and prepared at 1 × 106 in Eppendorf tubes. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol (dropwise while vortexing to ensure proper fixation of cells and prevent clumping) at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and then RNase A (50 μg/ml) was added to ensure only DNA staining. Finally, cells were stained with propidium iodide at 50 μg/ml.Proliferation AssaysConfluent MEFs or CFs were detached with trypsin-EDTA, seeded on a coverslip into 24-well plates (5000 cells/well) in 10% FCS-DMEM, and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h and then stimulated for 24, 48, or 72 h with 10% FCS. Cultures were washed with PBS and stained with hematoxylin. The number of cells was determined by counting in 10 random fields per each coverslip.Infection of MEFs with MKP-2 AdenovirusMKP-2 adenovirus was generated as outlined previously (21Cadalbert L.C. Sloss C.M. Cunningham M.R. Al-Mutairi M. McIntire A. Shipley J. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) Cells were seeded on coverslips into 12- or 24-well plates and grown to ∼50% confluency. The cell number was determined using a hemocytometer. MKP-2 adenovirus (100–300 pfu/cell) was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h in normal growth medium, and then serum-starved for 24 h before stimulation for 24, 48, or 72 h with 10% FCS.Western BlottingCells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (63 mm Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 2 mm Na4P2O7, 5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm DTT, 0.007% (w/v) bromphenol blue). The lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated with phospho-specific antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (21Cadalbert L.C. Sloss C.M. Cunningham M.R. Al-Mutairi M. McIntire A. Shipley J. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Flow Cytometry Assay of ApoptosisCells were infected for 24 h and then stimulated for a further 24 h prior to analysis. Cells were trypsinized and then pelleted at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 500 μl of 1× annexin binding buffer (10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). Phycoerythrin-annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D were added to the cells according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the samples were read in the FACScan flow cytometer using the FACS Diva software (FACScan, BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed using the FACSDiva (BD Biosciences) and RCS Express (De Novo Software) software. A total of 10,000 events were measured per sample. Gating was determined using phycoerythrin-annexin V FL-2 and 7-aminoactinomycin D FL-3 standards attached to beads (BD Biosciences), and preliminary experiments were conducted using paraformaldehyde and serum deprivation to define apoptotic and necrotic populations as outlined by the manufacturer's instructions.Data AnalysisEach figure represents one of at least four separate experiments. Western blots were scanned on an Epson perfection 1640SU scanner using Adobe Photoshop 5.0.2 software. For gels, densitometry measurement was performed using the Scion Image program. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's post test (*, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001).RESULTSMice deficient for DUSP-4 have been genetically characterized elsewhere (20Al-Mutairi M.S. Cadalbert L.C. McGachy H.A. Shweash M. Schroeder J. Kurnik M. Sloss C.M. Bryant C.E. Alexander J. Plevin R. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001192Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, to confirm MKP-2 deletion, quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild type or DUSP-4 deletion mice were stimulated with FCS over a period of 24 h (Fig. 1). In wild type MEFs, induction of MKP-2 was marked, reaching a peak between 2 and 4 h before returning toward basal values by 24 h (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, there was no increase in MKP-2 in stimulated MEFs from the DUSP-4 KO mice (Fig. 1, A and B). A number of other agents also increased MKP-2 expression including PDGF and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in wild type but not in DUSP-4 deletion mice. 4A. Lawan, S. Currie, and R. Plevin, unpublished observations.To ensure that MKP-2 protein expression was regulated in the normal manner in MKP-2+/+ fibroblasts, we preincubated cells with different MAP kinase inhibitors prior to stimulation (Fig. 2). Specifically, preincubation with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, UO126, substantially and significantly reduced MKP-2 expression (Fig. 2, A and B). However, the JNK and p38 inhibitors, SP600125 (Fig. 2, A and C) and SB203580 (Fig. 2, A and D), did not decrease MKP-2 induction. These data suggest that, by and large, an ERK-dependent mechanism of induction for MKP-2 exists in the fibroblast model.FIGURE 2ERK mediates induction of MKP-2 in wild type MEFs. Confluent MEFs were quiescent for 24 h in serum-free medium, and vehicle (−) or MAPK inhibitors (+) were added 1 h prior to stimulation with 10% FCS for the times indicated. In A, cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MKP-2 and p38 antibodies (loading control) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each blot is representative of three others. In B–D, gels were quantified using densitometry, and each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least four experiments. **, p < 0.01 when compared with vehicle control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next sought to determine whether the kinetics of ERK activation could therefore be modified in the absence of MKP-2 (Fig. 3). PDGF stimulated a rapid and sustained increase in ERK activation, which was maximal between 5 and 10 min and continued for up to 24 h albeit at lower levels of phosphorylation. We found that over the early time period, ERK activation was not altered in MKP-2−/− MEFs (Fig. 3, A and C). However, an extended time course revealed a small but significant potentiation between 2 and 24 h (Fig. 3, B and D).FIGURE 3Enhanced PDGF-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in MKP-2−/− MEFs. Confluent MEFs were rendered quiescent for 24 h in serum-free medium. Cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml PDGF for up to 120 min (A) or up to 24 h (B). Cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using phospho-ERK, -ERK1/2, and -MKP-2 antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each blot is representative of three others.

Anisomycin induced a strong and sustained phosphorylation of both JNK and p38 MAP kinase. MKP-2−/− deletion gave a very small but significant increase in the magnitude of JNK phosphorylation but had no effect upon the duration of the time course (Fig. 4A). Similarly, p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation was slightly but significantly increased at a single time point (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Anisomycin-induced JNK and p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation in MKP-2−/− MEFs. Confluent MEFs were quiescent for 24 h in serum-free medium prior to stimulation with anisomycin (5 μm) for the times indicated. In A, cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MKP-2, p-JNK1/2, p-p38, JNK1/2, and p38 antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In B and C, gels were quantified using densitometry, and each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least four experiments. *, p < 0.05 versus wild type MEFs.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of DUSP-4 deletion on the proliferative capacity of MEFs. In the absence of MKP-2 protein, serum-stimulated proliferation assessed over 72 h was significantly slowed when compared with wild type (Fig. 5, A and B). This was also manifest over a shorter time frame (Fig. 5C) and is reflected in an extended lag phase prior to exponential growth and a 2-fold increase in doubling time in MKP-2−/− MEFs (doubling time in days; MKP-2+/+ = 3.67 ± 1.25, MKP-2−/− = 8.00 ± 1.768). We then used Adv-MKP-2 in gain-of-function studies. Infection of either wild type or MKP-2−/− MEFs with adenoviral (Adv) MKP-2 at 300 pfu (Fig. 5D) gave ∼95% infection. Under these conditions, the inhibition of proliferative responses in MKP-2−/− MEFs was effectively reversed, and in fact, rates of proliferation increased above growth rates for wild type MEFs (Fig. 5, E and F).FIGURE 5MKP-2 is required for MEF proliferation. Subconfluent quiescent MEFs from either WT or MKP-2−/− were stimulated with 10% FCS for the times indicated, and proliferation was measured by cell counting at 24-h intervals over 72 h (A and B) or at 1–2-h intervals over 21 h (C) as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” In D, wild type and MKP-2−/− MEFs were infected with increasing multiplicity of infection of Adv-MKP-2 for 24 h. In E and F, cells infected with 300 pfu of Adv-MKP-2 were stimulated with 10% FCS, and cell numbers were counted over 72 h. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least four experiments. ***, p < 0.05 when compared with wild type MEFs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To explain these differences in proliferation, we examined a number of cellular growth parameters linked to cell survival (Fig. 6). Using propidium iodide staining, we observed a decrease in the number of cells in G1 phase and an increase in the number of cell that accumulated at G2/M phase (Fig. 6A). In cells blocked in G1 using thymidine, we found an increased number in sub-G1, indicative of increased apoptotic cells (Fig. 6B). When we examined both cyclin B1 expression and the related cdc-2 phosphorylation, both these parameters were found to increase prematurely in MKP-2−/− MEFs in comparison with MKP-2+/+ cells (Fig. 6C), indicative of retention in G2/M phase. Furthermore, when cells were incubated with topotecan to cause G2/M phase block (23Ohneseit P.A. Prager D. Kehlbach R. Rodemann H.P. Radiother. Oncol. 2005; 75: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and then subsequently washed, p-cdc-2 levels remained higher over 24 and 48 h, again indicative of greater accumulation in G2/M phase for MKP-2−/− MEFs (Fig. 6D).FIGURE 6Delayed G2/M phase transition in MKP-2-deficient fibroblasts. Subconfluent quiescent fibroblasts were stimulated with FCS for 24 h and assessed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining (A) or blocked with thymidine (B). In C, quiescent cells were assessed for cyclin B and cdc2 phosphorylation following FCS stimulation as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” In F, cells were incubated with topotecan (1 μm), washed, and then assayed for p-cdc-2 at 24 and 48 h. Each experiment is representative of at least three others.

For CFs, the deficit in proliferation rates was similar to that observed for MEFs, and the cell number was over 50% less when compared with wild type cells (Fig. 7A). Cells in G2/M phase were also increased in MKP-2−/− MEFs but to a lesser extent than MEFs (Fig. 7B). A similar difference was observed for continuously growing macrophages; however, when these cells where rendered quiescent prior to restimulation with FCS, as carried out for both MEFs and CFs, the cells failed to grow at all and subsequently died (Fig. 7C). For these cells, only a marginal stage-specific effect was observed (Fig. 7D).FIGURE 7MKP-2 is also required for cardiac fibroblast and macrophage proliferation. Subconfluent quiescent CFs and macrophages from either WT or MKP-2−/− were stimulated with 10% FCS for the times indicated, and proliferation was measured by cell counting over 72 h (A and C) as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Subconfluent quiescent CFs and macrophages were stimulated with FCS for 24 h and assessed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining (B and D).

Baseline apoptosis in quiescent fibroblasts was similar in both WT and KO. Anisomycin exposure increased apoptosis from 10 to 40% in MKP-2+/+ MEFs, and this was increased significantly in MKP-2−/− MEFs to ∼50% at 12 h (Fig. 8A). This effect correlated with increased caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 8, B and D) and phosphorylation of γH2AX (Fig. 8, C and E). Ultraviolet, electromagnetic radiation subtype C (UVC)-induced apoptosis was also significantly increased in MKP-2−/− MEFs.4FIGURE 8Increased rates of apoptosis in MKP-2-deficient MEFs. In A, cells were stimulated with anisomycin (5 μm) for 8 and 12 h and assessed for apoptosis by annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D staining as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of at least four experiments. In B and C, cells were stimulated for 4 and 6 h, and lysates were assessed for cleaved caspase 3 and γH2AX phosphorylation. Each gel is representative of four experiments.

Following infection, anisomycin-induced JNK was substantially reduced in both MKP-2+/+ and MKP-2−/− MEFs. However, no effect was observed in ERK or p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 9B). This correlated with an effective reversal of increased caspase-3 and γH2AX phosphorylation, which was more pronounced in the MKP-2−/− MEFs (Fig. 9, C–E). Adv-MKP-2 also reversed the increased apoptosis in response to anisomycin in MKP-2−/− MEFs but was not effective in wild type cultures (Fig. 9F). Furthermore, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 was also found to reverse increased apoptosis in MKP-2−/− MEF (not shown).FIGURE 9JNK inhibition reverses anisomycin-induced apoptosis in MKP-2−/− MEFs.

https://openalex.org/W2060421182,"Chemoprevention presents a major strategy for the medical management of colorectal cancer. Most drugs used for colorectal cancer therapy induce DNA-alkylation damage, which is primarily repaired by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Thus, blockade of BER pathway is an attractive option to inhibit the spread of colorectal cancer. Using an in silico approach, we performed a structure-based screen by docking small-molecules onto DNA polymerase β (Pol-β) and identified a potent anti-Pol-β compound, NSC-124854. Our goal was to examine whether NSC-124854 could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of DNA-alkylating agent, Temozolomide (TMZ), by blocking BER. First, we determined the specificity of NSC-124854 for Pol-β by examining in vitro activities of APE1, Fen1, DNA ligase I, and Pol-β-directed single nucleotide (SN)- and long-patch (LP)-BER. Second, we investigated the effect of NSC-124854 on the efficacy of TMZ to inhibit the growth of mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient and MMR-proficient colon cancer cell lines using in vitro clonogenic assays. Third, we explored the effect of NSC-124854 on TMZ-induced in vivo tumor growth inhibition of MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient colonic xenografts implanted in female homozygous SCID mice. Our data showed that NSC-124854 has high specificity to Pol-β and blocked Pol-β-directed SN- and LP-BER activities in in vitro reconstituted system. Furthermore, NSC-124854 effectively induced the sensitivity of TMZ to MMR-deficient and MMR-proficient colon cancer cells both in vitro cell culture and in vivo xenograft models. Our findings suggest a potential novel strategy for the development of highly specific structure-based inhibitor for the prevention of colonic tumor progression."

We demonstrate that Scm3 is able to mediate the assembly of Cse4 nucleosomes in vitro, but not H3 nucleosomes, as measured by a supercoiling assay. Localization of Cse4 to centromeres and the assembly activity depend on an evolutionarily conserved core motif in Scm3, but localization of the CBF3 subunit Ndc10 to centromeres does not depend on this motif.

We propose that Scm3 plays an active role in centromeric nucleosome assembly. The centromere is a cis-acting chromosomal region that provides all living cells with the ability to transfer their genetic material faithfully during mitotic and meiotic cell divisions. The centromere is the location for the assembly of the kinetochore, a multiprotein complex that enables the attachment of chromosomes to the spindle microtubule and ensures the equal segregation of chromosomes to the daughter cells. The budding yeast kinetochore is composed of more than 65 proteins, many of which are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man (1McAinsh A.D. Tytell J.D. Sorger P.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The inner kinetochore or DNA-binding layer is comprised of several proteins, including Mif2, the CBF3 complex (Ndc10, Cep3, Skp1, and Ctf13), a centromeric histone H3 variant Cse4, and Scm3, all of which are essential for kinetochore function (3Brown M.T.

The CBF3 complex binds specifically to the budding yeast centromere sequence. Budding yeast centromeres consist of ∼125 bp divided into three DNA elements: CDE I (14 bp), CDE II (87–88 bp), and CDE III (11 bp) (9Ng R. Carbon J. Mol. Cell.

Although the sequence composition of centromeres is highly variable among organisms, centromeres in all eukaryotes are universally marked by the presence of a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, termed CENP-A in humans, Cse4 in budding yeast, and CID in Drosophila melanogaster (13Henikoff S. Ahmad K. Malik H.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1098-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). The centromere targeting domain (CATD), consisting of loop 1 and helix 2 of the histone fold domain, is required for centromere loading of centromeric histone variants (14Black B.E. Foltz D.R.

Canonical nucleosomes, the basic module of chromatin, consist of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of four core (H3/H4/H2A/H2B) histones (16Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). At the centromeric nucleosome, Cse4 replaces canonical H3 (4Meluh P.B. Yang P. Glowczewski L. Koshland D.

Stoler S. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6130-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), raising the question of how Cse4 is specifically targeted to the centromere sequence. Histones are often associated with specific chaperones/nucleosome assembly factors that assist their interaction with DNA, both deposition and removal. Nucleosome assembly factors can be defined as factors that associate with histones and stimulate a reaction involving histone transfer. Some histone variants have specific chaperones that play an important function in their deposition (21De Koning L. Corpet A. Haber J.E. Almouzni G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). For instance, Chz1 is a histone chaperone that has preference for H2AZ and can deliver H2AZ for SWR1-dependent histone replacement (22Luk E. Vu N.D. Patteson K. Mizuguchi G. Wu W.H. Ranjan A. Backus J. Sen S. Lewis M. Bai Y. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 357-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Nucleosome assembly factors also play an important role in assembly of histone H3.1 and H3.3, in a replication-dependent and -independent manner, respectively, thereby differentially marking the active and inactive regions of the genome (23Ray-Gallet D. Quivy J.P. Scamps C. Martini E.M. Lipinski M. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 24Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G.

It is unknown whether there is a specific assembly factor involved in Cse4 deposition at centromeres. One candidate for a Cse4-specific assembly factor is Scm3 (Suppressor of Chromosome Missegregation 3). Scm3 and its orthologs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Scm3sp) and humans (HJURP) are required for localization of the centromeric histone variant at centromeres (6Camahort R. Li B. Florens L.

Cell. 2009; 137: 472-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In addition to its role at the centromere sequence, Scm3 is required to deposit Cse4 at the stable partitioning locus within the 2-μ plasmid (27Huang C.C. Hajra S. Ghosh S.K. Jayaram M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1030-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). HJURP has been shown to facilitate the association of CENP-A/H4 tetramers with DNA in vitro (28Shuaib M. Ouararhni K. Dimitrov S. Hamiche A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1349-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, Scm3 has been shown to bind to both Cse4 and Ndc10 and is required for their efficient localization to centromeres, leading to the hypothesis that Scm3 serves as a molecular link between a centromere-specific DNA binding complex (CBF3) and the centromeric histone variant (6Camahort R. Li B. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 853-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Herein, we provide evidence that Scm3 is more than a simple adapter and possesses unique nucleosome assembly activity. The assembly activity depends on an evolutionarily conserved core motif shared with Scm3sp and HJURP. The assembly activity is specific for Cse4 but independent of DNA sequence. Furthermore, assembly activity depends on the CATD of Cse4. We conclude Scm3 plays an active role in the assembly of centromeric nucleosomes. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1 and were constructed in the W303 background. Whole cell extracts were obtained by beadbeating in the presence of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors).

PCR of ChIP DNA was quantified for biological replicates by comparing immunoprecipitates and total chromatin. FACS analysis was performed to confirm cell cycle arrest on cells fixed in 70% ethanol. Cells were washed with FACS buffer (50 mm sodium citrate), treated with RNase, stained with Sytox Green (1 mm final), and analyzed by using a Cyan cytometer (Dako Cytomation). Yeast recombinant histones (H3, H4, H2A, H2B, and Cse4) were individually expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies as described previously (30Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J.

His6-Scm3 and its lethal mutants were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal-affinity agarose and standard His tag protein purification protocols (31Sambrook J. Russell D.W.

For constructing the H3/Cse4 hybrid, the region from Ala76 through Ile113 of H3 was replaced by the corresponding region containing the loop 1 and α2 helix of Cse4 (Thr166 through Leu206) based on previous studies (15Black B.E.

Purified canonical or Cse4 containing octamers (H3 or Cse4/H2A/H2B/H4) or Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex and His6-Scm3 or lethal mutants were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of topoisomerase I with 8.3 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.65 mm MgCl2, 1.7% glycerol, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 33 mm KCl, 0.33 mm DTT, and 0.02 mg/ml BSA. Plasmid DNA was deproteinized and purified by standard methods, and then topoisomers were resolved in agarose gels. Recombinant topoisomerase I was a kind gift from S. Venkatesh, Stowers Institute. Two plasmid were used: (i) pG5E4-5S containing five repeats of 5S flanking each side of an E4 core promoter downstream of five Gal4-binding sites (gift from the Workman laboratory, Stowers Institute) and (ii) pCEN1-10X containing 10 tandem repeats of the centromere 1 sequence. Scm3 is a relatively small protein (∼25 kDa) containing several motifs (Fig. 1A). At the N terminus from amino acids 13–24, there is a putative leucine nuclear export sequence (NES) (7Stoler S. Rogers K. Weitze S. Morey L. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Baker R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). There are two short patches of basic residues, similar to bipartite nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) found at positions 54–59 and 148–153 (35Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 36Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). At its center, Scm3 has an evolutionarily conserved core motif. This motif resembles a coiled-coil domain in that it has repeating heptad units with hydrophobic residues occupying the fourth position and polar residues in the first position (37Parry D.A. Fraser R.D. Squire J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 163: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 38Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 58 amino acids are acid-rich (40% Asp + Glu). To identify essential motifs, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis for each of these motifs and tested the mutant proteins for function using a plasmid shuffle assay (Fig. 1B). Deletion of either the C-terminal 25 amino acids (Scm3-Δ25C) or the bipartite NLS (Scm3-ΔNLS) did not result in a loss of growth. In contrast, mutations in evolutionarily conserved residues in the central motif or deletion of the N-terminal 25 amino acids (Scm3-Δ25N) were lethal. To define further the essential portion of the N-terminal region, we deleted residues 2–12, 13–24 (which contains the NES motif), or mutated the leucines in the NES motif. All of these mutations were lethal, suggesting that the NES as well as the amino acids upstream are essential, consistent with previous mutational analysis of Scm3 (7Stoler S. Rogers K. Weitze S. Morey L. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Baker R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We conclude that Scm3 has two essential motifs, the N-terminal 25 amino acids and the conserved core motif. Scm3 physically associates with Cse4 and Ndc10 (6Camahort R. Li B. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 853-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Stoler S. Rogers K. Weitze S. Morey L. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Baker R.E. Proc.

Cell. 2007; 129: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We tested the proficiency of the lethal mutants for interactions with Cse4 and Ndc10 in vivo. For this study we have used a Gal-SCM3 conditional allele (pGal1–10-3HA-SCM3) so that we can shut off the wild-type chromosomal copy of Scm3 by switching to glucose medium for 2 h. This switch eliminates Scm3 as measured by Western blotting (6Camahort R. Li B. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 853-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mutant versions of Scm3 are FLAG-tagged on a plasmid under the control of the endogenous promoter. Results shown in Fig. 2 reveal that point mutations (I110H, I111H) in the conserved motif of Scm3 disrupt the interaction with Cse4 whereas deletion of the N terminus of Scm3 (Scm3-Δ25N) does not disrupt this interaction (Fig. 2A). However, all of the lethal mutants interact with Ndc10 (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the conserved motif is important for interaction with Cse4. By using a similar strategy as above, we tested whether Cse4 is present at the centromere in these lethal mutants by ChIP/qPCR (Fig. 3). Interestingly Cse4 is present at CEN1 with the Scm3-Δ25N protein, but in the case of Scm3-I110H, Cse4 is not localized to the centromere (Fig. 3, A and B). Although Scm3-Δ25N can interact with Ndc10 and Cse4 and can apparently localize Cse4, this mutation is still lethal. Although the conserved motif appears to be essential for localization of Cse4 at centromeres, the essential function of the N terminus is not clear at present. Cse4 appears to load at centromeres during S phase (39Bloom K. Sharma S. Dokholyan N.V. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: R276-R278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Pearson C.G. Yeh E. Gardner M. Odde D. Salmon E.D. Bloom K. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1962-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Without Cse4, the kinetochore will be defective, leading to a spindle checkpoint arrest (6Camahort R. Li B. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 853-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 41Espelin C.W. Kaplan K.B. Sorger P.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1383-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In previous work we showed that when Scm3 was depleted in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, the spindle check point was not activated. In contrast, if Scm3 was depleted in S phase or G2/M, the spindle checkpoint is activated (6Camahort R. Li B. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Washburn M.P. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 853-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Because Scm3 cannot be depleted in G2/M without activating the checkpoint, Scm3 function appears to be required even after centromeric chromatin is formed. We performed the same type of point-of-execution experiments with the Scm3 lethal mutants, to determine whether one motif was more critical for checkpoint signaling. We conducted arrest-deplete-release experiments. Cells were grown in galactose medium and synchronized in the G1, S, and G2/M phase of the cell cycle with α factor, hydroxyurea, and nocodazole, respectively. At this point, wild-type Scm3 either continued to be expressed (galactose) or was depleted by transfer of cells to glucose-containing medium (glucose). Then cells were released into the cell cycle. Cultures were monitored by flow cytometry. When we deplete wild-type Scm3 and express the mutant proteins at G1 phase, there is a decrease in cells with 4 n DNA content compared with the total absence of Scm3 (supplemental Fig. 1A). In the Scm3-null background we could visualize a population of cells containing 4 n DNA content compared with the two lethal mutants. We have also visualized DNA by DAPI staining to verify the presence of multiple DNA masses in a single cell (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the spindle checkpoint is activated more efficiently in the scm3 lethal mutants compared with the null background. When wild-type Scm3 was depleted in early S or G2/M phase, there were no significant differences between the null case and the two lethal mutants in terms of DNA content (supplemental Fig. 1, B and C). In all cases, cells arrest with 2 n DNA content and are large budded with a single DAPI mass (data not shown), suggesting that the spindle checkpoint is efficiently activated. Next, we tested whether Cse4 and Ndc10 were present at centromeres in G2/M by ChIP/qPCR when Scm3 was depleted in a G1 arrest. Cse4 was not detected at the centromere in the Scm3-I110H background but was present at the centromere in the Scm3-Δ25N background (Fig. 3, C and D). However, Ndc10 was present at centromeres in both the Scm3-I110H and Scm3-Δ25N backgrounds (Fig. 3, E and F), consistent with the result that both of these mutants can interact with Ndc10 (Fig. 2B). Ndc10 is necessary for activation of the spindle checkpoint (42Fraschini R. Beretta A. Lucchini G. Piatti S. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The efficient localization of Ndc10 in the mutants compared with the null is the most likely explanation for the difference in checkpoint activation. Taken together, these results suggest that Scm3 has two distinct functions: (i) Cse4 deposition, which requires the evolutionarily conserved motif, and (ii) recruitment of Ndc10 to activate the spindle assembly checkpoint. The point of execution for each of the two essential motifs cannot be differentiated with respect to Ndc10 recruitment/checkpoint function. It was reported previously that when Scm3 was added to Cse4-containing octamers, H2A/H2B dimers were evicted, and a Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex was formed (33Mizuguchi G. Xiao H. Wisniewski J. Smith M.M. Wu C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We analyzed how recombinant Scm3 lethal mutant proteins behaved with respect to octamer splitting. Interestingly, when each lethal mutant was incubated with Cse4 octamers, the octamers were split into two distinct populations, one that contained Scm3/Cse4/H4 and one that contained Scm3/H2A/H2B as measured by gel filtration chromatography (supplemental Fig. 2, C and D). We did not find any difference between Scm3 lethal mutants with respect to H2A/H2B eviction since both mutants were able to split the octamers. We further tested whether Scm3 is present in a complex with Cse4/H4 or H2A/H2B by pulldowns from the fractions containing the split species. As shown previously (33Mizuguchi G. Xiao H. Wisniewski J. Smith M.M. Wu C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), Scm3 interacts with Cse4/H4, but not H2A/H2B (supplemental Fig. 2F). It was shown previously that recombinant Scm3, Cse4, and histone H4 form a stoichiometric complex with a molecular weight consistent with a hexamer (33Mizuguchi G. Xiao H. Wisniewski J. Smith M.M. Wu C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We tested whether the lethal Scm3 mutants could make a de novo Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex when mixed with recombinant Cse4 and H4. To address this question, wild-type or mutant Scm3 was mixed with Cse4 and H4 in 2 m NaCl. Scm3-WT and Scm3-ΔN25 were able to form a Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex with Cse4 and H4; Scm3-I110H could not (supplemental Fig. 3A). This result is consistent with the inability of the Scm3-I110H protein to co-immunoprecipitate with Cse4. Previously, a Scm3 mutant protein consisting of amino acids 93–143 was shown to be sufficient for Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex formation (33Mizuguchi G. Xiao H. Wisniewski J. Smith M.M. Wu C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Together these results suggest the conserved motif is essential to interact with Cse4. Scm3 is necessary for the localization of Cse4 to centromeres in vivo. We tested whether Scm3 could facilitate the assembly of nucleosomes in vitro. To measure the chromatin assembly activity of Scm3 in vitro, we used a plasmid supercoiling assay in which the wrapping of DNA around the histone core particle induces supercoiling in relaxed, closed, circular DNA. We tested two plasmids (Fig. 4A), one containing 10 copies of a 5 S nucleosome positioning sequence (pG5E4-5S, a gift from the Workman laboratory) and one containing 10 tandem copies of a yeast centromere 1 (CEN1) repeat unit. Following the assembly reaction, DNA was deproteinized, and plasmid topoisomers were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Incubation of purified His6-Scm3 and Cse4 octamers with either pG5E4-5S or pCEN1-10X resulted in the induction of several supercoils compared with controls (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that Scm3 can assemble Cse4 containing chromatin on both plasmids. With both plasmids we observed an increase of supercoils in a dose dependent manner to a certain level, followed by a decrease that may be related to the precipitation of Scm3 at higher concentrations. Nap1, a well studied histone chaperone (43Andrews A.J. Chen X. Zevin A. Stargell L.A. Luger K. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 834-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), was also able to induce supercoils with Cse4 octamers on both plasmids (Fig. 4C). These experiments demonstrate that Scm3 can induce supercoils with Cse4 chromatin irrespective of DNA sequence. Scm3 alone does not mediate the supercoiling reaction (Fig. 4D). Because the conserved motif, but not the N-terminal motif of Scm3, is necessary for localization of Cse4 in vivo, we wanted to address whether these motifs are required for chromatin assembly in vitro. To address this we used purified recombinant Scm3 lethal mutant proteins (Scm3-Δ25N and Scm3-I110H) in chromatin assembly assays. Scm3-Δ25N was able to induce supercoils on both the pG5E4-5S and pCEN1-10X plasmid (Fig. 4E), but Scm3-I110H could not (Fig. 4F). Therefore, the conserved motif is essential for nucleosome assembly. To test the specificity of Scm3 for Cse4, assembly reactions were carried out with H3 octamers. Strikingly, there was no addition of topoisomers when we use canonical octamers on either the CEN plasmid or the 5S plasmid (Fig. 5A). These H3 octamers could be assembled into chromatin using the chaperone Nap1 (Fig. 5B). We next aimed to identify the motif/sequence in Cse4 that is required for Scm3 nucleosome assembly activity. Cse4 has two domains: (i) a divergent N-terminal essential domain and (ii) a highly conserved histone fold domain (44Chen Y. Baker R.E. Keith K.C. Harris K. Stoler S. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7037-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The centromere targeting domain (CATD), consisting of loop 1 and helix 2 of the histone fold domain, is required for centromeric loading of centromeric histone variants (14Black B.E. Foltz D.R. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Woods Jr., V.L. Cleveland D.W. Nature. 2004; 430: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The CATD is a key regulator of Cse4 protein stability (45Ranjitkar P. Press M.O. Yi X. Baker R. MacCoss M.J. Biggins S. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 455-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). HJURP, the human ortholog of Scm3, binds to CENP-A through its CATD domain, and this interaction occurs via the TLTY box of HJURP (28Shuaib M. Ouararhni K. Dimitrov S. Hamiche A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1349-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Scm3 lacks a TLTY motif, which is conserved only in vertebrates (28Shuaib M. Ouararhni K. Dimitrov S. Hamiche A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1349-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To test whether Scm3 nucleosome assembly activity requires the CATD domain of Cse4, we made octamers containing a H3/Cse4 chimeric protein in which H3 contains the Cse4 CATD domain (15Black B.E. Jansen L.E. Maddox P.S. Foltz D.R. Desai A.B. Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 309-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although H3 octamers are not assembled into nucleosomes by Scm3, octamers containing this chimeric H3/Cse4 protein were assembled into nucleosomes (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the CATD domain is sufficient for Scm3 nucleosome assembly activity. The composition of centromeric nucleosomes has been hotly debated (19Camahort R. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Li B. Nakanishi S. Zhu D. Shilatifard A. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 794-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 46Furuyama T. Henikoff S. Cell. 2009; 138: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 47Dalal Y. Wang H. Lindsay S. Henikoff S. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). At present there are three models for the composition of the budding yeast centromeric nucleosome. One model suggests that Cse4 replaces H3 in an octameric nucleosome that contains Cse4, H2A, H2B, and H4 (19Camahort R. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Li B. Nakanishi S. Zhu D. Shilatifard A. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 794-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Octameric nucleosomes containing human CENP-A can be reconstituted in vitro (48Yoda K. Ando S. Morishita S. Houmura K. Hashimoto K. Takeyasu K. Okazaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7266-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 49Sekulic N. Bassett E.A. Rogers D.J. Black B.E. Nature. 2010; 467: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A second model proposes that centromeric nucleosomes contain a single molecule each of CenH3, H2A, H2B, and H4, which forms a tetrameric structure called a “hemisome” (47Dalal Y. Wang H. Lindsay S. Henikoff S. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This hemisomal complex was purified from interphase Drosophila S2 cells by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of CID. Hemisomes appear half as tall as canonical nucleosomes when analyzed by atomic force microscopy and are predicted to contain <120 bp of DNA (47Dalal Y. Wang H. Lindsay S. Henikoff S. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A third model is a “hexameric nucleosome,” composed of two copies each of Scm3, Cse4 and H4 (33Mizuguchi G. Xiao H. Wisniewski J. Smith M.M. Wu C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Given these models, we decided to test whether addition of the Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex (supplemental Fig. 3A) would induce supercoiling in our assembly assay. We did not observe supercoiling on either type of plasmid (Fig. 5D). Recently, Vishnapuu and Greene reported that they reconstituted nucleosomes using the Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex and linear λDNA (50Visnapuu M.L. Greene E.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1056-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but we were not able to replicate this outcome on a circular plasmid. Interestingly, addition of H2A/H2B dimers results in some supercoiling (Fig. 5E) on both plasmids, suggesting H2A/H2B are necessary for the assembly reaction. Although Scm3 is an essential inner kinetochore protein, its precise molecular function has remained poorly understood. Herein, we have shown that Scm3 appears to be a bona fide Cse4-specific chaperone. We further show that the chaperone activity depends on the evolutionarily conserved motif of Scm3 and the CATD of Cse4, but not centromeric DNA sequence. The conserved motif of Scm3 is required for interaction with and deposition of Cse4, but not Ndc10, at centromeres, arguing for two separable functions for Scm3. The deposition of Ndc10, and therefore the ability to activate the spindle assembly checkpoint, depends on Scm3, but not its chaperone function. Furthermore, this result suggests that Ndc10 recruitment and spindle checkpoint activation do not depend on Cse4 deposition at the centromere. The chaperone activity of Scm3 requires the CATD domain of Cse4 and the evolutionarily conserved motif of Scm3. Recently, it has been shown that Psh1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets Cse4 (45Ranjitkar P. Press M.O. Yi X. Baker R. MacCoss M.J. Biggins S. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 455-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 51Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and Scm3 appears to protect Cse4 from Psh1 (51Hewawasam G. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Venkatesh S. Martin-Brown S. Florens L. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 444-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposal, Psh1 requires the CATD domain of Cse4 to target Cse4 (45Ranjitkar P. Press M.O. Yi X. Baker R. MacCoss M.J. Biggins S. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 455-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that Scm3 has an active function in Cse4 protein maintenance and nucleosome assembly that depends on the CATD domain. HJURP, a putative human ortholog of Scm3, also possesses assembly activity for CENP-A/H4 complexes with DNA in vitro (28Shuaib M. Ouararhni K. Dimitrov S. Hamiche A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1349-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). HJURP interacts with CENP-A through its TLTY box, a highly conserved motif across vertebrates (28Shuaib M. Ouararhni K. Dimitrov S. Hamiche A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1349-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, Scm3 lacks a TLTY motif. Instead, Cse4 interaction and assembly activity depend on the evolutionarily conserved core motif of Scm3. One of the proposed structures for centromeric nucleosomes is a hexasome, which does not contain H2A/H2B (33Mizuguchi G. Xiao H. Wisniewski J. Smith M.M. Wu C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 50Visnapuu M.L. Greene E.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1056-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have used a supercoiling assay to test whether the Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex would induce topoisomers. Although the Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex fails to induce supercoiling, addition of H2A/H2B dimers along with Scm3/Cse4/H4 complex did result in supercoiling, suggesting that H2A and H2B are critical for nucleosome formation. The requirement for H2A in vitro is consistent with previous data suggesting that H2A is present in Cse4 nucleosomes (19Camahort R. Shivaraju M. Mattingly M. Li B. Nakanishi S. Zhu D. Shilatifard A. Workman J.L. Gerton J.L. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 794-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and is required for proper centromere function (52Pinto I. Winston F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1598-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, our results are most consistent with models for the centromeric nucleosome that contain H2A and H2B. The assembly of nucleosomes by Scm3 can occur on either centromeric DNA sequences or a canonical nucleosome positioning sequence. Thus, the reactions we have conducted in vitro lack sequence specificity. This result is consistent with a recent report in which it was shown that Scm3 is required to load Cse4 at a noncentromeric sequence, the stable partitioning locus within the 2-μ plasmid (45Ranjitkar P. Press M.O. Yi X. Baker R. MacCoss M.J. Biggins S. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 455-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We speculate that sequence specificity in vivo is achieved by the CBF3 protein complex, which is a sequence specific binding complex found in point centromere-containing organisms. In future studies it will be interesting to determine whether the addition of CBF3 or other components will increase the specificity for the centromere sequence. However, our observations suggest that Scm3 alone cannot provide sufficient DNA sequence specificity to restrict Cse4 nucleosomes to centromeres.

In this study, a combination of both whole-gene error-prone polymerase chain reaction and site-saturation mutagenesis enabled the rapid identification of mutations that improved RmlA activity toward non-native substrates. These mutations have been shown to improve activities over 10-fold for several targeted substrates, including non-native pyrimidine- and purine-based NTPs as well as non-native D- and L-sugars (both α- and β-isomers). This study highlights the first broadly applicable high throughput sugar-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase screen and the first proof of concept for the directed evolution of this enzyme class toward the identification of uniquely permissive RmlA variants."

https://openalex.org/W2060840985,"The spread of infectious disease epidemics is mediated by human travel. Yet human mobility patterns vary substantially between countries and regions. Quantifying the frequency of travel and length of journeys in well-defined population is therefore critical for predicting the likely speed and pattern of spread of emerging infectious diseases, such as a new influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of a large population survey undertaken in 2007 in two areas of China: Shenzhen city in Guangdong province, and Huangshan city in Anhui province. In each area, 10,000 randomly selected individuals were interviewed, and data on regular and occasional journeys collected. Travel behaviour was examined as a function of age, sex, economic status and home location. Women and children were generally found to travel shorter distances than men. Travel patterns in the economically developed Shenzhen region are shown to resemble those in developed and economically advanced middle income countries with a significant fraction of the population commuting over distances in excess of 50 km. Conversely, in the less developed rural region of Anhui, travel was much more local, with very few journeys over 30 km. Travel patterns in both populations were well-fitted by a gravity model with a lognormal kernel function. The results provide the first quantitative information on human travel patterns in modern China, and suggest that a pandemic emerging in a less developed area of rural China might spread geographically sufficiently slowly for containment to be feasible, while spatial spread in the more economically developed areas might be expected to be much more rapid, making containment more difficult."
https://openalex.org/W2076186299,"Background Although increased levels of plasminogen activators have been found in psoriatic lesions, the role of plasmin converted from plasminogen by plasminogen activators in pathogenesis of psoriasis has not been investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we examined the contribution of plasmin to amplification of inflammation in patients with psoriasis. We found that plasminogen was diminished, but that the amount and activity of its converted product plasmin were markedly increased in psoriasis. Moreover, annexin II, a receptor for plasmin was dramatically increased in both dermis and epidermis in psoriasis. Plasmin at sites of inflammation was pro-inflammatory, eliciting production of inflammatory factors, including CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), that was mediated by the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and that had an essential role in the recruitment and activation of pathogenic C-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CCR6)+ T cells. Moreover, intradermal injection of plasmin or plasmin together with recombinant monocyte/macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) resulted in induction of psoriasiform skin inflammation around the injection sites with several aspects of human psoriasis in mice. Conclusions/Significance Plasmin converted from plasminogen by plasminogen activators plays an essential role in amplification of psoriasiform skin inflammation in mice, and targeting plasmin receptor - annexin II - may harbor therapeutic potential for the treatment of human psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W1980641376,"Protein dynamics are crucial for realizing the catalytic power of enzymes, but how enzymes have evolved to achieve catalysis is unknown. The light-activated enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes sequential hydride and proton transfers in the photoexcited and ground states, respectively, and is an excellent system for relating the effects of motions to catalysis. Here, we have used the temperature dependence of isotope effects and solvent viscosity measurements to analyze the dynamics coupled to the hydride and proton transfer steps in three cyanobacterial PORs and a related plant enzyme. We have related the dynamic profiles of each enzyme to their evolutionary origin. Motions coupled to light-driven hydride transfer are conserved across all POR enzymes, but those linked to thermally activated proton transfer are variable. Cyanobacterial PORs require complex and solvent-coupled dynamic networks to optimize the proton donor-acceptor distance, but evolutionary pressures appear to have minimized such networks in plant PORs. POR from Gloeobacter violaceus has features of both the cyanobacterial and plant enzymes, suggesting that the dynamic properties have been optimized during the evolution of POR. We infer that the differing trajectories in optimizing a catalytic structure are related to the stringency of the chemistry catalyzed and define a functional adaptation in which active site chemistry is protected from the dynamic effects of distal mutations that might otherwise impact negatively on enzyme catalysis."

Interestingly, we found that growth suppression induced by HDAC inhibitors is attenuated by ectopic expression of DEC1 in a ΔNp63-dependent manner. In addition, we showed that ectopic expression of DEC1 inhibits, whereas knockdown of DEC1 promotes, keratinocyte differentiation via modulating ΔNp63 expression. Finally, we showed that DEC1 cooperates with HDAC inhibitors to further decrease keratinocyte differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2037257963,"Global biodiversity loss has prompted research on the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Few studies have examined how plant diversity impacts belowground processes; even fewer have examined how varying resource levels can influence the effect of plant diversity on microbial activity. In a field experiment in a restored wetland, we examined the role of plant trait diversity (or functional diversity, (FD)) and its interactions with natural levels of variability of soil properties, on a microbial process, denitrification potential (DNP). We demonstrated that FD significantly affected microbial DNP through its interactions with soil conditions; increasing FD led to increased DNP but mainly at higher levels of soil resources. Our results suggest that the effect of species diversity on ecosystem functioning may depend on environmental factors such as resource availability. Future biodiversity experiments should examine how natural levels of environmental variability impact the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2078223692,"The nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors plays a central role in the regulation of cellular responses to chemical challenge. Nuclear receptors are activated by a wide range of both endogenous and exogenous chemicals, and their target genes include those involved in the metabolism and transport of the activating chemical. Such target gene activation, thus, acts to remove the stimulating xenobiotic or to maintain homeostatic levels of endogenous chemicals. Given the dual nature of this system it is important to understand how these two roles are balanced, such that xenobiotics are efficiently removed while not impacting negatively on homeostasis of endogenous chemicals. Using DNA microarray technology we have examined the transcriptome response of primary rat hepatocytes to two nuclear receptor ligands: Pregnenalone-16α-carbonitrile (PCN), a xenobiotic PXR agonist, and lithocholic acid, an endogenous mixed PXR/VDR/FXR agonist. We demonstrate that despite differences in the profile of activated nuclear receptors, transcriptome responses for these two ligands are broadly similar at lower concentrations, indicating a conserved general response. However, as concentrations of stimulating ligand rises, the transcriptome responses diverge, reflecting a need for specific responses to the two stimulating chemicals. Finally, we demonstrate a novel feed-back loop for PXR, whereby ligand-activation of PXR suppresses transcription of the PXR gene, acting to attenuate PXR protein expression levels at higher ligand concentrations. Through in silico simulation we demonstrate that this feed-back loop is an important factor to prevent hyperexpression of PXR target genes such as CYP3A and confirm these findings in vitro. This novel insight into the regulation of the PXR-mediated regulatory signal networks provides a potential mechanistic rationale for the robustness in steroid homeostasis within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2010081254,"The effects of parasites and pathogens on host behaviors may be particularly important in predator-prey contexts, since few animal behaviors are more crucial for ensuring immediate survival than the avoidance of lethal predators in nature. We examined the effects of an emerging fungal pathogen of amphibians, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, on anti-predator behaviors of tadpoles of four frog species. We also investigated whether amphibian predators consumed infected prey, and whether B. dendrobatidis caused differences in predation rates among prey in laboratory feeding trials. We found differences in anti-predator behaviors among larvae of four amphibian species, and show that infected tadpoles of one species (Anaxyrus boreas) were more active and sought refuge more frequently when exposed to predator chemical cues. Salamander predators consumed infected and uninfected tadpoles of three other prey species at similar rates in feeding trials, and predation risk among prey was unaffected by B. dendrobatidis. Collectively, our results show that even sub-lethal exposure to B. dendrobatidis can alter fundamental anti-predator behaviors in some amphibian prey species, and suggest the unexplored possibility that indiscriminate predation between infected and uninfected prey (i.e., non-selective predation) could increase the prevalence of this widely distributed pathogen in amphibian populations. Because one of the most prominent types of predators in many amphibian systems is salamanders, and because salamanders are susceptible to B. dendrobatidis, our work suggests the importance of considering host susceptibility and behavioral changes that could arise from infection in both predators and prey."

Using rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy volunteers, we investigated the neural correlates of automatic processes induced by subliminal stimuli. We demonstrated that the automatic activation of motor programs elicited unconsciously in the medial premotor cortex was normally restricted to specific contexts set by the environment, but can occur below the threshold of awareness even when no movement was executed. This novel finding expands our view on brain mechanisms underlying unconscious motor control and provides new evidence that activation of the motor preparation system and consciousness are not obligatory linked."
https://openalex.org/W2016712285,"Background Coronary artery calcification (CAC) has been proposed to be the underlying mechanism of the increased risk of coronary heart disease with reductions in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Since renal function diminishes with aging we examined the association between GFR and CAC in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based study of elderly individuals. Methods The study was performed in 1703 subjects without a history of coronary heart disease. GFR was estimated using the modification of diet in renal disease equation. We used analysis of covariance to test for mean differences in CAC between GFR tertiles. Results The mean CAC scores in the middle and lowest GFR tertile did not significantly differ from the mean CAC score in the highest GFR tertile (geometric mean CAC score 4.1 and 4.3 vs 4.2). In a multivariable model the mean CAC score did also not differ between the GFR tertiles. As the interaction term between age and GFR was significant (P = 0.037), we divided the population in two age categories based on median age of 70 years. Below 70 years, the mean CAC scores did not differ between the GFR tertiles. Above median age, mean CAC score in the lowest GFR tertile was significantly higher than the mean CAC score in the highest tertile in a multivariable model (CAC 4.9 vs 4.5, p = 0.010). Conclusion In this population-based study we observed that the association between CAC and GFR is modified by age. In participants at least 70 years of age, a decrease in GFR was associated with increased CAC."
https://openalex.org/W2038611448,"Several lines of evidence suggest that the prototypical amphipathic transcriptional activators Gal4, Gcn4, and VP16 interact with the key coactivator Med15 (Gal11) during transcription initiation despite little sequence homology. Recent cross-linking data further reveal that at least two of the activators utilize the same binding surface within Med15 for transcriptional activation. To determine whether these three activators use a shared binding mechanism for Med15 recruitment, we characterized the thermodynamics and kinetics of Med15·activator·DNA complex formation by fluorescence titration and stopped-flow techniques. Combination of each activator·DNA complex with Med15 produced biphasic time courses. This is consistent with a minimum two-step binding mechanism composed of a bimolecular association step limited by diffusion, followed by a conformational change in the Med15·activator·DNA complex. Furthermore, the equilibrium constant for the conformational change (K(2)) correlates with the ability of an activator to stimulate transcription. VP16, the most potent of the activators, has the largest K(2) value, whereas Gcn4, the least potent, has the smallest value. This correlation is consistent with a model in which transcriptional activation is regulated at least in part by the rearrangement of the Med15·activator·DNA ternary complex. These results are the first detailed kinetic characterization of the transcriptional activation machinery and provide a framework for the future design of potent transcriptional activators."
https://openalex.org/W2076395508,"Most viruses express during infection products that prevent or neutralize the effect of the host dsRNA activated protein kinase (PKR). Translation of Sindbis virus (SINV) mRNA escapes to PKR activation and eIF2 phosphorylation in infected cells by a mechanism that requires a stem loop structure in viral 26S mRNA termed DLP to initiate translation in the absence of functional eIF2. Unlike the rest of viruses tested, we found that Alphavirus infection allowed a strong PKR activation and eIF2α phosphorylation in vitro and in infected animals so that the presence of DLP structure in mRNA was critical for translation and replication of SINV. Interestingly, infection of MEFs with some viruses that express PKR inhibitors prevented eIF2α phosphorylation after superinfection with SINV, suggesting that viral anti-PKR mechanisms could be exchangeable. Thus, translation of SINV mutant lacking the DLP structure (ΔDLP) in 26S mRNA was partially rescued in cells expressing vaccinia virus (VV) E3 protein, a known inhibitor of PKR. This case of heterotypic complementation among evolutionary distant viruses confirmed experimentally a remarkable case of convergent evolution in viral anti-PKR mechanisms. Our data reinforce the critical role of PKR in regulating virus-host interaction and reveal the versatility of viruses to find different solutions to solve the same conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2029295729,"BAD (Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death) belongs to the proapoptotic BH3-only subfamily of Bcl-2 proteins. Physiological activity of BAD is highly controlled by phosphorylation. To further analyze the regulation of BAD function, we investigated the role of recently identified phosphorylation sites on BAD-mediated apoptosis. We found that in contrast to the N-terminal phosphorylation sites, the serines 124 and 134 act in an antiapoptotic manner because the replacement by alanine led to enhanced cell death. Our results further indicate that RAF kinases represent, besides PAK1, BAD serine 134 phosphorylating kinases. Importantly, in the presence of wild type BAD, co-expression of survival kinases, such as RAF and PAK1, leads to a strongly increased proliferation, whereas substitution of serine 134 by alanine abolishes this process. Furthermore, we identified BAD serine 134 to be strongly involved in survival signaling of B-RAF-V600E-containing tumor cells and found that phosphorylation of BAD at this residue is critical for efficient proliferation in these cells. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the regulation of BAD function by phosphorylation and its role in cancer signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2014583973,"Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) is a tumor suppressor gene product involved in colon cancer. APC is a large multidomain molecule of 2843 amino acid residues and connects cell-cell adhesion, the F-actin/microtubule cytoskeleton and the nucleus. Here we show that Cdc42 interacts directly with the first three armadillo repeats of APC by yeast two-hybrid screens. We confirm the Cdc42-APC interaction using pulldown assays in vitro and FRET assays in vivo. Interestingly, Cdc42 interacts with APC at leading edge sites where F-actin is enriched. In contrast, Cdc42 interacts with the truncated mutant APC1–1638 in cellular puncta associated with the golgi-lysozome pathway in transfected CHO cells. In HCT116 and SW480 cells, Cdc42 induces the relocalization of endogenous APC and the mutant APC1–1338 to the plasma membrane and cellular puncta, respectively. Taken together, these data indicate that the Cdc42-APC interaction induces localization of both APC and mutant APC and may thus play a direct role in the functions of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2106194846,"The Arabidopsis genome contains a large number of gene pairs that encode sense and antisense transcripts with overlapping 3' regions, indicative for a potential role of natural antisense transcription in regulating sense gene expression or transcript processing. When we mapped poly(A) transcripts of three plant gene pairs with long overlapping antisense transcripts, we identified an unusual transcript composition for two of the three gene pairs. Both genes pairs encoded a class of long sense transcripts and a class of short sense transcripts that terminate within the same polyadenylation region as the antisense transcripts encoded by the opposite strand. We find that the presence of the short sense transcript was not dependent on the expression of an antisense transcript. This argues against the assumption that the common termination region for sense and antisense poly(A) transcripts is the result of antisense-specific regulation. We speculate that for some genes evolution may have especially favoured alternative polyadenylation events that shorten transcript length for gene pairs with overlapping sense/antisense transcription, if this reduces the likelihood for dsRNA formation and transcript degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2050100436,"Successful immune-mediated regression of solid tumors is difficult because of the small number of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that were traffic to the tumor site. Here, the targeting of tumor-specific infiltrating CTLs was dependent on a fusion protein consisting of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) with the D227A mutation. EGF-SEA strongly restrained the growth of murine solid sarcoma 180 (S180) tumors (control versus EGF-SEA, mean tumor weight: 1.013 versus 0.197 g, difference = 0.816 g). In mice treated with EGF-SEA, CD4+, CD8+ and SEA-reactive T lymphocytes were enriched around the EGFR expressing tumor cells. The EGF receptors were potentially phosphorylated by EGF-SEA stimulation and the fusion protein promoted T cells to release the tumoricidal cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Intratumoral CTLs secreted cytolytic pore-forming perforins and granzyme B proteins near the surface of carcinomas, causing the death of many tumor cells. We additionally show that labeled EGF-SEA was directly targeted to the tumor tissue after intravenous (i.v.) injection. The findings demonstrate that antibody-like EGF-SEA plays an important role in arresting CTLs in the solid tumor site and has therapeutic potential as a tumor-targeting agent."

https://openalex.org/W2084602169,"Telomeres are specialized chromatin structures at the end of chromosomes. Telomere dysfunction can lead to chromosomal abnormalities, DNA damage responses, and even cancer. In mammalian cells, a six-protein complex (telosome/shelterin) is assembled on the telomeres through the interactions between various domain structures of the six telomere proteins (POT1, TPP1, TIN2, TRF1, TRF2 and RAP1), and functions in telomere maintenance and protection. Within the telosome, TPP1 interacts directly with POT1 and TIN2 and help to mediate telosome assembly. Mechanisms of telomere regulation have been extensively studied in a variety of model organisms. For example, the physiological roles of telomere-targeted proteins have been assessed in mice through homozygous inactivation. In these cases, early embryonic lethality has prevented further studies of these proteins in embryogenesis and development. As a model system, zebrafish offers unique advantages such as genetic similarities with human, rapid developmental cycles, and ease of manipulation of its embryos. In this report, we detailed the identification of zebrafish homologues of TPP1, POT1, and TIN2, and showed that the domain structures and interactions of these telosome components appeared intact in zebrafish. Importantly, knocking down TPP1 led to multiple abnormalities in zebrafish embryogenesis, including neural death, heart malformation, and caudal defect. And these embryos displayed extensive apoptosis. These results underline the importance of TPP1 in zebrafish embryogenesis, and highlight the feasibility and advantages of investigating the signaling pathways and physiological function of telomere proteins in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2123741053,"Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of working memory content on temporal attention in a rapid serial visual presentation attentional blink paradigm. It was shown that categorical similarity between working memory content and the target stimuli pertaining to the attentional task (both digits) increased attentional blink magnitude compared to a condition in which this similarity was absent (colors and digits, respectively). This effect was only observed when the items in working memory were not presented as conjunctions of the involved categories (i.e., colored digits). This suggested that storage and retrieval from working memory was at least preferentially conjunctive in this case. It was furthermore shown that the content of working memory enhanced the identification rate of the second target, by means of repetition priming, when inter-target lag was short and the attentional blink was in effect. The results are incompatible with theories of temporal attention that assume working memory has no causal role in the attentional blink and support theories that do."
