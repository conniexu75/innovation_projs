https://openalex.org/W2120503144,"CRISPR/Cas systems constitute a widespread class of immunity systems that protect bacteria and archaea against phages and plasmids, and commonly use repeat/spacer-derived short crRNAs to silence foreign nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner. Although the maturation of crRNAs represents a key event in CRISPR activation, the responsible endoribonucleases (CasE, Cas6, Csy4) are missing in many CRISPR/Cas subtypes. Here, differential RNA sequencing of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes uncovered tracrRNA, a trans-encoded small RNA with 24-nucleotide complementarity to the repeat regions of crRNA precursor transcripts. We show that tracrRNA directs the maturation of crRNAs by the activities of the widely conserved endogenous RNase III and the CRISPR-associated Csn1 protein; all these components are essential to protect S. pyogenes against prophage-derived DNA. Our study reveals a novel pathway of small guide RNA maturation and the first example of a host factor (RNase III) required for bacterial RNA-mediated immunity against invaders."

https://openalex.org/W2168657969,"Doping of semiconductors by impurity atoms enabled their widespread technological application in micro and opto-electronics. For colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, an emerging family of materials where size, composition and shape-control offer widely tunable optical and electronic properties, doping has proven elusive. This arises both from the synthetic challenge of how to introduce single impurities and from a lack of fundamental understanding of this heavily doped limit under strong quantum confinement. We develop a method to dope semiconductor nanocrystals with metal impurities providing control of the band gap and Fermi energy. A combination of optical measurements, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and theory revealed the emergence of a confined impurity band and band-tailing. Successful control of doping and its understanding provide n- and p-doped semiconductor nanocrystals which greatly enhance the potential application of such materials in solar cells, thin-film transistors, and optoelectronic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2032195857,"SHARPIN is a ubiquitin-binding and ubiquitin-like-domain-containing protein which, when mutated in mice, results in immune system disorders and multi-organ inflammation. Here we report that SHARPIN functions as a novel component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) and that the absence of SHARPIN causes dysregulation of NF-κB and apoptotic signalling pathways, explaining the severe phenotypes displayed by chronic proliferative dermatitis (cpdm) in SHARPIN-deficient mice. Upon binding to the LUBAC subunit HOIP (also known as RNF31), SHARPIN stimulates the formation of linear ubiquitin chains in vitro and in vivo. Coexpression of SHARPIN and HOIP promotes linear ubiquitination of NEMO (also known as IKBKG), an adaptor of the IκB kinases (IKKs) and subsequent activation of NF-κB signalling, whereas SHARPIN deficiency in mice causes an impaired activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB in B cells, macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This effect is further enhanced upon concurrent downregulation of HOIL-1L (also known as RBCK1), another HOIP-binding component of LUBAC. In addition, SHARPIN deficiency leads to rapid cell death upon tumour-necrosis factor α (TNF-α) stimulation via FADD- and caspase-8-dependent pathways. SHARPIN thus activates NF-κB and inhibits apoptosis via distinct pathways in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2108910145,"NASA's Kepler mission has been remarkably productive in its primary role, that of discovering and characterizing extrasolar planets. It does this indirectly, by monitoring the brightness of many thousands of main sequence stars in search of periodic fluctuations caused by planets crossing the face of the stars. But the high-precision photometry involved is also ideal for studying the stars themselves. Bedding et al. have used Kepler data to probe the internal structure of red giants. Their detailed measurements of the gravity modes in the cores of these stars allow them to distinguish between those burning hydrogen in a shell around a relatively inactive core and those burning helium in the core. Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion. However, it is difficult to distinguish between the two groups. Asteroseismology offers a way forward. This study reports observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants using high precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft. It is found that the stars fall into two clear groups, making it possible to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars and those that are also burning helium. Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell1,2. Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion3. Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other processes4. Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their natural oscillation frequencies5. Here we report observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants6 that permit a distinction between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing mostly ∼50 seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period spacing ∼100 to 300 seconds)."
https://openalex.org/W2027600417,"The recently discovered three dimensional or bulk topological insulators are expected to exhibit exotic quantum phenomena. It is believed that a trivial insulator can be twisted into a topological state by modulating the spin-orbit interaction or the crystal lattice via odd number of band inversions, driving the system through a topological quantum phase transition. By directly measuring the topological invariants (for the method to directly measure Fu-Kane {$\nu_0$}, see Hsieh \textit{et.al.,} Science 323, 919 (2009) at http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5916/919.abstract) we report the observation of a phase transition in a tunable spin-orbit system BiTl(S{1-d}Se{d})2 (which is an analog of the most studied topological insulator Bi2Se3, see Xia \textit{et.al.,} Nature Phys. 5, 398 (2009) at http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v5/n6/full/nphys1294.html and Spin-Momentum locking at http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7259/full/nature08234.html) where the topological insulator state formation is visualized for the first time. In the topological state, vortex-like polarization states are observed to exhibit 3D vectorial textures, which collectively feature a chirality transition of its topological spin-textures as the spin-momentum locked (Z2 topologically ordered) electrons on the surface go through the zero carrier density point. Such phase transition and texture chirality inversion can be the physical basis for observing \textit{fractional charge} (e/2) and other related fractional topological phenomena."

https://openalex.org/W2058938835,"After an infection, cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors proliferate and become effector cells by recognizing foreign peptides in the groove of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Professional APCs specialized for T-cell activation acquire viral antigen either by becoming infected themselves (direct presentation) or by phagocytosis of infected cells, followed by transfer of antigen to the cytosol, processing and MHC class I loading in a process referred to as cross-presentation. An alternative way, referred to as 'cross-dressing', by which an uninfected APC could present antigen was postulated to be by the transfer of preformed peptide-MHC complexes from the surface of an infected cell to the APC without the need of further processing. Here we show that this mechanism exists and boosts the antiviral response of mouse memory CD8(+) T cells. A number of publications have demonstrated sharing of peptide-loaded MHC molecules in vitro. Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that cross-dressing APCs do not acquire peptide-MHC complexes in the form of exosomes released by donor cells. Rather, the APCs and donor cells have to contact each other for the transfer to occur. After a viral infection, we could isolate cross-dressed APCs able to present viral antigen in vitro. Furthermore, using the diphtheria toxin system to selectively eliminate APCs that could only acquire viral peptide-MHC complexes by cross-dressing, we show that such presentation can promote the expansion of resting memory T cells. Notably, naive T cells were excluded from taking part in the response. Cross-dressing is a mechanism of antigen presentation used by dendritic cells that may have a significant role in activating previously primed CD8(+) T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2072602203,"C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) are two of the most commonly used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience research. However, the only currently available mouse genome is based entirely on the B6 strain sequence. Subsequently, oligonucleotide microarray probes are based solely on this B6 reference sequence, making their application for gene expression profiling comparisons across mouse strains dubious due to their allelic sequence differences, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the RNA-Seq application provides a clear alternative to oligonucleotide arrays for detecting differential gene expression without the problems inherent to hybridization-based technologies. Using RNA-Seq, an average of 22 million short sequencing reads were generated per sample for 21 samples (10 B6 and 11 D2), and these reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome, allowing 16,183 Ensembl genes to be queried in striatum for both strains. To determine differential expression, 'digital mRNA counting' is applied based on reads that map to exons. The current study compares RNA-Seq (Illumina GA IIx) with two microarray platforms (Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 and Affymetrix MOE 430 2.0) to detect differential striatal gene expression between the B6 and D2 inbred mouse strains. We show that by using stringent data processing requirements differential expression as determined by RNA-Seq is concordant with both the Affymetrix and Illumina platforms in more instances than it is concordant with only a single platform, and that instances of discordance with respect to direction of fold change were rare. Finally, we show that additional information is gained from RNA-Seq compared to hybridization-based techniques as RNA-Seq detects more genes than either microarray platform. The majority of genes differentially expressed in RNA-Seq were only detected as present in RNA-Seq, which is important for studies with smaller effect sizes where the sensitivity of hybridization-based techniques could bias interpretation."

https://openalex.org/W2162889000,"Gene expression is regulated by a number of interrelated posttranslational modifications of histones, including citrullination. For example, peptidylarginine deminase 4 (PAD4) converts peptidyl arginine to citrulline in histone H3 and can repress gene expression. However, regulation of gene expression through citrullination of non-histone proteins is less well defined. Herein, we identify a tumor suppressor protein, inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4), as a novel non-histone substrate of PAD4. ING4 is known to bind p53 via its nuclear localization signal (NLS) region and to enhance transcriptional activity of p53. We show that PAD4 preferentially citrullinates ING4 in the same NLS region and thereby disrupts the interaction between ING4 and p53. A citrulline-mimicking Arg-NLS-Gln ING4 mutant, which has all Arg residues in the NLS mutated to Gln, loses its affinity for p53, can no longer promote p53 acetylation, and results in repression of downstream p21 expression. In addition, we found that citrullination leads to increased susceptibility of ING4 to degradation, likely impacting p53-independent pathways as well. These findings elucidate an interaction between posttranslational citrullination, acetylation, and methylation and highlight an unusual mechanism whereby citrullination of a non-histone protein impacts gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2007823563,"Pyrrolysine, the latest addition to the ranks of the genetically encoded amino acids, is found in methanogenic archaea and bacteria, in which it is a necessary component of the enzymes involved in the formation of methane from methylamines. Its biosynthetic pathway remains poorly characterized. Joseph Krzycki and colleagues now show that lysine is the sole precursor for the pyrrolysine synthesis system of Methanosarcina sp. Archaea. The radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine protein PylB converts lysine to 3-methylornithine, which then undergoes a PylC-catalysed condensation with a second lysine to generate a product that is oxidized by PylD to generate pyrrolysine. The authors suggest that synthetic analogues of intermediates in this pathway may provide useful pyrrolysine derivatives that could be incorporated into tailored recombinant proteins. Pyrrolysine is the twenty-second naturally occurring amino acid, and it is required for the formation of methane from methylamines. Pyrrolysine is the last remaining natural amino acid with a poorly characterized biosynthetic pathway. Here it is shown that the radical SAM protein PylB converts lysine to 3-methylornithine, which then undergoes a PylC-catalysed condensation with another lysine to generate a product that is oxidized by PylD to generate pyrrolysine. Pyrrolysine, the twenty-second amino acid found to be encoded in the natural genetic code1,2,3,4, is necessary for all of the known pathways by which methane is formed from methylamines5,6. Pyrrolysine comprises a methylated pyrroline carboxylate in amide linkage to the ε-amino group of l-lysine2,7,8. In certain Archaea, three methyltransferases initiate methanogenesis from the various methylamines9,10,11, and these enzymes are encoded by genes with an in-frame amber codon12,13 that is translated as pyrrolysine2,7,8. Escherichia coli that has been transformed with the pylTSBCD genes from methanogenic Archaea can incorporate endogenously biosynthesized pyrrolysine into proteins14. The decoding of UAG as pyrrolysine requires pylT1,6, which produces tRNAPyl (also called tRNACUA), and pylS1, which encodes a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase4,15,16. The pylB, pylC and pylD genes1 are each required for tRNA-independent pyrrolysine synthesis14. Pyrrolysine is the last remaining genetically encoded amino acid with an unknown biosynthetic pathway. Here we provide genetic and mass spectrometric evidence for a pylBCD-dependent pathway in which pyrrolysine arises from two lysines. We show that a newly uncovered UAG-encoded amino acid, desmethylpyrrolysine, is made from lysine and exogenous d-ornithine in a pylC-dependent process followed by a pylD-dependent process, but it is not further converted to pyrrolysine. These results indicate that the radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) protein PylB mediates a lysine mutase reaction that produces 3-methylornithine, which is then ligated to a second molecule of lysine by PylC before oxidation by PylD results in pyrrolysine. The discovery of lysine as the sole precursor to pyrrolysine will further inform discussions of the evolution of the genetic code and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, intermediates of the pathway may provide new avenues by which the pyl system can be exploited to produce recombinant proteins with useful modified residues."

https://openalex.org/W2066890674,"NG2 cells, the fourth type of glia in the mammalian CNS, receive synaptic input from neurons. The function of this innervation is unknown yet. Postsynaptic changes in intracellular Ca2+-concentration ([Ca2+]i) might be a possible consequence. We employed transgenic mice with fluorescently labeled NG2 cells to address this issue. To identify Ca2+-signaling pathways we combined patch-clamp recordings, Ca2+-imaging, mRNA-transcript analysis and focal pressure-application of various substances to identified NG2-cells in acute hippocampal slices. We show that activation of voltage-gated Ca2+-channels, Ca2+-permeable AMPA-receptors, and group I metabotropic glutamate-receptors provoke [Ca2+]i-elevations in NG2 cells. The Ca2+-influx is amplified by Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release. Minimal electrical stimulation of presynaptic neurons caused postsynaptic currents but no somatic [Ca2+]i elevations, suggesting that [Ca2+]i elevations in NG2 cells might be restricted to their processes. Local Ca2+-signaling might provoke transmitter release or changes in cell motility. To identify structural prerequisites for such a scenario, we used electron microscopy, immunostaining, mRNA-transcript analysis, and time lapse imaging. We found that NG2 cells form symmetric and asymmetric synapses with presynaptic neurons and show immunoreactivity for vesicular glutamate transporter 1. The processes are actin-based, contain ezrin but not glial filaments, microtubules or endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NG2 cell processes in situ are highly motile. Our findings demonstrate that gray matter NG2 cells are endowed with the cellular machinery for two-way communication with neighboring cells."

https://openalex.org/W1997866496,"Previous studies have suggested that the BH3 domain of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Noxa only interacts with the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and A1 but not Bcl-2. In view of the similarity of the BH3 binding domains of these anti-apoptotic proteins as well as recent evidence that studies of isolated BH3 domains can potentially underestimate the binding between full-length Bcl-2 family members, we examined the interaction of full-length human Noxa with anti-apoptotic human Bcl-2 family members. Surface plasmon resonance using bacterially expressed proteins demonstrated that Noxa binds with mean dissociation constants (K(D)) of 3.4 nm for Mcl-1, 70 nm for Bcl-x(L), and 250 nm for wild type human Bcl-2, demonstrating selectivity but not absolute specificity of Noxa for Mcl-1. Further analysis showed that the Noxa/Bcl-2 interaction reflected binding between the Noxa BH3 domain and the Bcl-2 BH3 binding groove. Analysis of proteins expressed in vivo demonstrated that Noxa and Bcl-2 can be pulled down together from a variety of cells. Moreover, when compared with wild type Bcl-2, certain lymphoma-derived Bcl-2 mutants bound Noxa up to 20-fold more tightly in vitro, pulled down more Noxa from cells, and protected cells against killing by transfected Noxa to a greater extent. When killing by bortezomib (an agent whose cytotoxicity in Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells is dependent on Noxa) was examined, apoptosis was enhanced by the Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) antagonist ABT-737 or by Bcl-2 down-regulation and diminished by Bcl-2 overexpression. Collectively, these observations not only establish the ability of Noxa and Bcl-2 to interact but also identify Bcl-2 overexpression as a potential mechanism of bortezomib resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1969165259,"Anaplerosis, the net synthesis in mitochondria of citric acid cycle intermediates, and cataplerosis, their export to the cytosol, have been shown to be important for insulin secretion in rodent beta cells. However, human islets may be different. We observed that the enzyme activity, protein level, and relative mRNA level of the key anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC) were 80-90% lower in human pancreatic islets compared with islets of rats and mice and the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 832/13. Activity and protein of ATP citrate lyase, which uses anaplerotic products in the cytosol, were 60-75% lower in human islets than in rodent islets or the cell line. In line with the lower PC, the percentage of glucose-derived pyruvate that entered mitochondrial metabolism via carboxylation in human islets was only 20-30% that in rat islets. This suggests human islets depend less on pyruvate carboxylation than rodent models that were used to establish the role of PC in insulin secretion. Human islets possessed high levels of succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase, an enzyme that forms acetoacetate in the mitochondria, and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, which uses acetoacetate to form acyl-CoAs in the cytosol. Glucose-stimulated human islets released insulin similarly to rat islets but formed much more acetoacetate. β-Hydroxybutyrate augmented insulin secretion in human islets. This information supports previous data that indicate beta cells can use a pathway involving succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid-CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase to synthesize and use acetoacetate and suggests human islets may use this pathway more than PC and citrate to form cytosolic acyl-CoAs."
https://openalex.org/W2079769807,"Mutant p53 is not only deficient in tumor suppression but also acquires additional activity, called gain of function. Mutant p53 gain of function is recapitulated in knock-in mice that carry one null allele and one mutant allele of the p53 gene. These knock-in mice develop aggressive tumors compared with p53-null mice. Recently, we and others showed that tumor cells carrying a mutant p53 are addicted to the mutant for cell survival and resistance to DNA damage. To further define mutant p53 gain of function, we used the MCF-10A three-dimensional model of mammary morphogenesis. MCF-10A cells in three-dimensional culture undergo a series of morphological changes and form polarized and growth-arrested spheroids with hollow lumen, which resembles normal glandular architectures in vivo. Here, we found that endogenous wild-type p53 in MCF-10A cells was not required for acinus formation, but knockdown of endogenous wild-type p53 (p53-KD) led to partial clearance of cells in the lumen due to decreased apoptosis. Consistent with this, p53-KD altered expression patterns of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, the cytoskeletal marker β-catenin, and the extracellular matrix protein laminin V. We also found that ectopic expression of the mutant G245S led to a phenotype similar to p53-KD, whereas a combination of ectopic expression of siRNA-resistant G245S with p53-KD led to a less cleared lumen. In contrast, ectopic expression of mutant R248W, R175H, and R273H disrupted normal acinus architectures with filled lumen and led to formation of irregular and multiacinus structures regardless of p53-KD.

Furthermore, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) markers, Snail, Slug, and Twist, were highly induced by mutant p53 and/or p53-KD.

https://openalex.org/W2048486660,"In 2007, the A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) seasonal influenza virus strain acquired the oseltamivir-resistance mutation H275Y in its neuraminidase (NA) gene. Although previous studies had demonstrated that this mutation impaired the replication capacity of the influenza virus in vitro and in vivo, the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H275Y oseltamivir-resistant mutant completely out-competed the wild-type (WT) strain and was, in the 2008–2009 influenza season, the primary A/H1N1 circulating strain. Using a combination of plaque and viral yield assays, and a simple mathematical model, approximate values were extracted for two basic viral kinetics parameters of the in vitro infection. In the ST6GalI-MDCK cell line, the latent infection period (i.e., the time for a newly infected cell to start releasing virions) was found to be 1–3 h for the WT strain and more than 7 h for the H275Y mutant. The infecting time (i.e., the time for a single infectious cell to cause the infection of another one) was between 30 and 80 min for the WT, and less than 5 min for the H275Y mutant. Single-cycle viral yield experiments have provided qualitative confirmation of these findings. These results, though preliminary, suggest that the increased fitness success of the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H275Y mutant may be due to increased infectivity compensating for an impaired or delayed viral release, and are consistent with recent evidence for the mechanistic origins of fitness reduction and recovery in NA expression. The method applied here can reconcile seemingly contradictory results from the plaque and yield assays as two complementary views of replication kinetics, with both required to fully capture a strain's fitness."

The biosynthetic gene cluster for pyridomycin has been cloned and identified from Streptomyces pyridomyceticus NRRL B-2517. Sequence analysis of a 42.5-kb DNA region revealed 26 putative open reading frames, including two nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes and a polyketide synthase gene. A special feature is the presence of a polyketide synthase-type ketoreductase domain embedded in an NRPS. Furthermore, we showed that PyrA functioned as an NRPS adenylation domain that activates 3-hydroxypicolinic acid and transfers it to a discrete peptidyl carrier protein, PyrU, which functions as a loading module that initiates pyridomycin biosynthesis in vivo and in vitro. PyrA could also activate other aromatic acids, generating three pyridomycin analogues in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2092591811,"Background Phylogenetic relationships within Gastrotricha are poorly known. Attempts to shed light on this subject using morphological traits have led to hypotheses lacking satisfactory statistical support; it seemed therefore that a different approach was needed. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper we attempt to elucidate the relationships within the taxonomically vast family Thaumastodermatidae (Macrodasyida) using molecular sequence data. The study includes representatives of all the extant genera of the family and for the first time uses a multi-gene approach to infer evolutionary liaisons within Gastrotricha. The final data set comprises sequences of three genes (18S, 28S rDNA and COI mtDNA) from 41 species, including 29 thaumastodermatids, 11 non-thaumastodermatid macrodasyidans and a single chaetonotidan. Molecular data was analyzed as a combined set of 3 genes and as individual genes, using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Two different outgroups were used: Xenotrichula intermedia (Chaetonotida) and members of the putative basal Dactylopodola (Macrodasyida). Thaumastodermatidae and all other sampled macrodasyidan families were found monophyletic except for Cephalodasyidae. Within Thaumastodermatidae Diplodasyinae and Thaumastodermatinae are monophyletic and so are most genera. Oregodasys turns out to be the most basal group within Thaumastodermatinae in analyses of the concatenated data set as well as in analyses of the nuclear genes. Thaumastoderma appears as the sister taxon to the remaining species. Surprisingly, Tetranchyroderma is non-monophyletic in our analyses as one group of species clusters with Ptychostomella while another appears as the sister group of Pseudostomella. Conclusions/Significance Results in general agree with the current classification; however, a revision of the more derived thaumastodermatid taxa seems necessary. We also found that the ostensible COI sequences from several species do not conform to the general invertebrate or any other published mitochondrial genetic code; they may be mitochondrially derived nuclear genes (numts), or one or more modifications of the mitochondrial genetic code within Gastrotricha."

We sought to increase accuracy by using novel modeling strategies, including multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and grammatical evolution of neural networks (GENN), in addition to the traditional logistic regression approach. Furthermore, we rigorously designed and tested our models in three distinct datasets: a Vanderbilt-Miami (VM) clinic-based case-control dataset, a VM family dataset, and the population-based Age-related Maculopathy Ancillary (ARMA) Study cohort. Using a consensus approach to combine the results from logistic regression and GENN models, our algorithm was successful in differentiating between high- and low-risk groups (sensitivity 77.0%, specificity 74.1%). In the ARMA cohort, the positive and negative predictive values were 63.3% and 70.7%, respectively. We expect that future efforts to refine this algorithm by increasing the sample size available for model building, including novel susceptibility factors as they are discovered, and by calibrating the model for diverse populations will improve accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2072046735,"Occupational exposure to nickel compounds has been associated with lung and nasal cancers. We have previously shown that exposure of the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells to NiCl(2) for 24 hr significantly increased global levels of trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3), a transcriptional activating mark that maps to the promoters of transcribed genes. To further understand the potential epigenetic mechanism(s) underlying nickel carcinogenesis, we performed genome-wide mapping of H3K4me3 by chromatin immunoprecipitation and direct genome sequencing (ChIP-seq) and correlated with transcriptome genome-wide mapping of RNA transcripts by massive parallel sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq). The effect of NiCl(2) treatment on H3K4me3 peaks within 5,000 bp of transcription start sites (TSSs) on a set of genes highly induced by nickel in both A549 cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed. Nickel exposure increased the level of H3K4 trimethylation in both the promoters and coding regions of several genes including CA9 and NDRG1 that were increased in expression in A549 cells. We have also compared the extent of the H3K4 trimethylation in the absence and presence of formaldehyde crosslinking and observed that crosslinking of chromatin was required to observe H3K4 trimethylation in the coding regions immediately downstream of TSSs of some nickel-induced genes including ADM and IGFBP3. This is the first genome-wide mapping of trimethylated H3K4 in the promoter and coding regions of genes induced after exposure to NiCl(2). This study may provide insights into the epigenetic mechanism(s) underlying the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2013572270,"Protein Domain Co-occurrence Network (DCN) is a biological network that has not been fully-studied. We analyzed the properties of the DCNs of H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and 15 plant genomes. These DCNs have the hallmark features of scale-free networks. We investigated the possibility of using DCNs to predict protein and domain functions. Based on our experiment conducted on 66 randomly selected proteins, the best of top 3 predictions made by our DCN-based aggregated neighbor-counting method achieved a semantic similarity score of 0.81 to the actual Gene Ontology terms of the proteins. Moreover, the top 3 predictions using neighbor-counting, χ(2), and a SVM-based method achieved an accuracy of 66%, 59%, and 61%, respectively, when used to predict specific Gene Ontology terms of human target domains. These predictions on average had a semantic similarity score of 0.82, 0.80, and 0.79 to the actual Gene Ontology terms, respectively. We also used DCNs to predict whether a domain is an enzyme domain, and our SVM-based and neighbor-inference method correctly classified 79% and 77% of the target domains, respectively. When using DCNs to classify a target domain into one of the six enzyme classes, we found that, as long as there is one EC number available in the neighboring domains, our SVM-based and neighboring-counting method correctly classified 92.4% and 91.9% of the target domains, respectively. Furthermore, we benchmarked the performance of using DCNs to infer species phylogenies on six different combinations of 398 single-chromosome prokaryotic genomes. The phylogenetic tree of 54 prokaryotic taxa generated by our DCNs-alignment-based method achieved a 93.45% similarity score compared to the Bergey's taxonomy. In summary, our studies show that genome-wide DCNs contain rich information that can be effectively used to decipher protein function and reveal the evolutionary relationship among species."
https://openalex.org/W2046597315,"Terminally differentiated/non-dividing macrophages contain extremely low cellular dNTP concentrations (20-40 nm), compared with activated CD4(+) T cells (2-5 μm). However, our LC-MS/MS study revealed that the non-canonical dUTP concentration (2.9 μm) is ∼60 times higher than TTP in macrophages, whereas the concentrations of dUTP and TTP in dividing human primary lymphocytes are very similar. Specifically, we evaluated the contribution of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to proviral DNA uracilation under the physiological conditions found in HIV-1 target cells. Indeed, biochemical simulation of HIV-1 reverse transcription demonstrates that HIV-1 RT efficiently incorporates dUTP in the macrophage nucleotide pools but not in the T cell nucleotide pools. Measurement of both pre-steady state and steady state kinetic parameters of dUTP incorporation reveals minimal selectivity of HIV-1 RT for TTP over dUTP, implying that the cellular dUTP/TTP ratio determines the frequency of HIV-1 RT-mediated dUTP incorporation. The RT of another lentivirus, simian immunodeficiency virus, also displays efficient dUTP incorporation in the dNTP/dUTP pools found in macrophages but not in T cells. Finally, 2',3'-dideoxyuridine was inhibitory to HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesis in macrophages but not in T cells. The data presented demonstrates that the non-canonical dUTP was abundant relative to TTP, and efficiently incorporated during HIV-1 reverse transcription, particularly in non-dividing macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2019275411,"Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are toxic because they bind to 28S rRNA and depurinate a specific adenine residue from the α-sarcin/ricin loop (SRL), thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Shiga-like toxins (Stx1 and Stx2), produced by Escherichia coli, are RIPs that cause outbreaks of foodborne diseases with significant morbidity and mortality. Ricin, produced by the castor bean plant, is another RIP lethal to mammals. Currently, no US Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccines nor therapeutics exist to protect against ricin, Shiga-like toxins, or other RIPs. Development of effective small-molecule RIP inhibitors as therapeutics is challenging because strong electrostatic interactions at the RIP•SRL interface make drug-like molecules ineffective in competing with the rRNA for binding to RIPs. Herein, we report small molecules that show up to 20% cell protection against ricin or Stx2 at a drug concentration of 300 nM. These molecules were discovered using the doorstop approach, a new approach to protein•polynucleotide inhibitors that identifies small molecules as doorstops to prevent an active-site residue of an RIP (e.g., Tyr80 of ricin or Tyr77 of Stx2) from adopting an active conformation thereby blocking the function of the protein rather than contenders in the competition for binding to the RIP. This work offers promising leads for developing RIP therapeutics. The results suggest that the doorstop approach might also be applicable in the development of other protein•polynucleotide inhibitors as antiviral agents such as inhibitors of the Z-DNA binding proteins in poxviruses. This work also calls for careful chemical and biological characterization of drug leads obtained from chemical screens to avoid the identification of irrelevant chemical structures and to avoid the interference caused by direct interactions between the chemicals being screened and the luciferase reporter used in screening assays."

https://openalex.org/W2026974303,"Jupiter's main ring shows vertical corrugations reminiscent of those recently detected in the rings of Saturn. The Galileo spacecraft imaged a pair of superimposed ripple patterns in 1996 and again in 2000. These patterns behave as two independent spirals, each winding up at a rate defined by Jupiter's gravity field. The dominant pattern originated between July and October 1994, when the entire ring was tilted by about 2 kilometers. We associate this with the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts of July 1994. New Horizons images still show this pattern 13 years later and suggest that subsequent events may also have tilted the ring. Impacts by comets or their dust streams are regular occurrences in planetary rings, altering them in ways that remain detectable decades later."

https://openalex.org/W2122312952,"Replication-competent adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vectors promise to be more efficient gene delivery vehicles than their replication-deficient counterparts, and chimeric Ad5 vectors that are capable of targeting CD46 are more effective than Ad5 vectors with native fibers. Although several strategies have been used to improve gene transduction and oncolysis, either by modifying their tropism or enhancing their replication capacity, some tumor cells are still relatively refractory to infection by chimeric Ad5. The oncolytic effects of the vectors are apparent in certain tumors but not in others. Here, we report the biological and oncolytic profiles of a replication-competent adenovirus 11p vector (RCAd11pGFP) in colon carcinoma cells. CD46 was abundantly expressed in all cells studied; however, the transduction efficiency of RCAd11pGFP varied. RCAd11pGFP efficiently transduced HT-29, HCT-8, and LS174T cells, but it transduced T84 cells, derived from a colon cancer metastasis in the lung, less efficiently. Interestingly, RCAd11p replicated more rapidly in the T84 cells than in HCT-8 and LS174T cells and as rapidly as in HT-29 cells. Cell toxicity and proliferation assays indicated that RCAd11pGFP had the highest cell-killing activities in HT29 and T84 cells, the latter of which also expressed the highest levels of glycoproteins of the carcinoma embryonic antigen (CEA) family. In vivo experiments showed significant growth inhibition of T84 and HT-29 tumors in xenograft mice treated with either RCAd11pGFP or Ad11pwt compared to untreated controls. Thus, RCAd11pGFP has a potent cytotoxic effect on colon carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1993678766,"Acinetobacter calcoaceticus PHEA-2 utilizes phenol as its sole carbon and energy source and has a multi-component phenol hydroxylase-encoding gene operon (mphKLMNOP) for phenol degradation. Two additional genes, mphR and mphX, were found upstream and downstream of mphKLMNOP, respectively. The mphR gene encodes a XylR/DmpR-type regulator-like protein and is transcribed in the opposite direction to mphKLMNOP. The mphX gene is transcribed in the same direction as mphKLMNOP and encodes a protein with 293 amino acid residues showing weak identity with some unknown proteins encoded in the meta-cleavage pathway gene clusters for aromatic compound degradation. Disruption of mphR by homologous recombination resulted in the loss of phenol degradation while disruption of mphX caused significantly faster phenol degradation than in the wild type strain. Transcriptional assays for mphK, mphR, and mphX revealed that mphR activated mphKLMNOP transcription in the presence of phenol, but mphX partially repressed this activation. Gel mobility-shift assay demonstrated a direct interaction of MphR with the mphK promoter region. These results indicate the involvement of a novel repressor protein MphX in transcriptional regulation of phenol hydroxylase genes caused by a XylR/DmpR-type regulator MphR."
https://openalex.org/W1986647163,"HDL is a negative risk factor for atherosclerosis because of its multiple atheroprotective functions. Inflammation converts HDL particles from anti-atherogenic to pro-atherogenic, and this transformation is associated with changes in HDL structure and composition. Apolipoprotein M (apoM) has been recently shown to play a role in the maturation of HDL in plasma and to protect from atherosclerosis. ApoM gene is expressed primarily in the liver and kidney and is down-regulated by pro-inflammatory signals. We now show that the human apoM promoter harbors a dual specificity regulatory element in the proximal region that binds hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) and members of the AP-1 family of pro-inflammatory transcription factors (c-Jun and JunB). Overexpression of c-Jun or JunB repressed both the basal and the HNF-1-mediated transactivation of the human apoM promoter. Treatment of HepG2 cells with potent inflammation-inducing phorbol esters or overexpression of PKCα was associated with a marked inhibition of apoM gene expression in a c-Jun/JunB-dependent manner. We provide evidence for a novel mechanism of inflammation-induced transcriptional repression that is based on the competition between HNF-1 and Jun proteins for binding to the same regulatory region. A similar mechanism accounts for the down-regulation of the liver-specific apolipoprotein A-II gene by Jun factors. Our studies provide novel insights on the mechanisms that control the expression of liver-specific apolipoprotein genes during inflammation and could affect the maturation and the functionality of HDL particles."
https://openalex.org/W2061399364,"We demonstrated previously that human FEN1 endonuclease, an enzyme involved in excising single-stranded DNA flaps that arise during Okazaki fragment processing and base excision repair, cleaves model flap substrates assembled into nucleosomes.

We find that orienting the flap substrate toward the histone octamer does not significantly alter the rotational orientation of two different nucleosome positioning sequences on the surface of the histone octamer but does cause minor perturbation of nucleosome structure. Surprisingly, flaps oriented toward the nucleosome surface are accessible to FEN1 cleavage in nucleosomes containing the Xenopus 5S positioning sequence. In contrast, neither flaps oriented toward nor away from the nucleosome surface are cleaved by the enzyme in nucleosomes containing the high-affinity 601 nucleosome positioning sequence.

Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) 2The abbreviations used are: FEN1flap endonuclease 1ntnucleotide(s)APB4-azidophenacyl bromide. plays critical roles in both DNA replication and repair. During processing of Okazaki fragments, FEN1 specifically recognizes a 5′-unannealed flap formed by the displacement synthesis activity of DNA polymerase δ. FEN1 binds and cleaves the phosphodiester backbone at the base of the flap, leaving a ligatable nick (1Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Leuk. Res. 1998; 22: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 2Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The significant role of FEN1 in DNA synthesis is highlighted by genetic studies demonstrating that RNase H is not essential for eliminating the RNA initiator (3Qiu J. Qian Y. Chen V. Guan M.X. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17893-17900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and that homozygous deletion of FEN1 results in a complete inactivation of DNA synthesis in mouse blastocysts (4Larsen E.

FEN1 is also involved in the penultimate step of a long patch base excision repair pathway where the enzyme removes a flap containing the damaged base that was generated by DNA polymerase β displacement synthesis. In vivo studies have shown that deletion of both copies of the FEN1 gene results in hypersensitivity of cells to methylating agents and hydrogen peroxide (5Matsuzaki Y. Adachi N. Koyama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3273-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and a FEN1 null mutation has been found to render Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe sensitive to UV radiation (2Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 589-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Further, mice with FEN1 haploinsufficiency show a mild predisposition phenotype which, in combination with a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene, leads to rapid tumor progression and genomic instability. In addition, deletion of both copies of the FEN1 gene results in early embryonic lethality (6Kucherlapati M. Yang K. Kuraguchi M. Zhao J. Lia M. Heyer J. Kane M.F. Fan K. Russell R. Brown A.M. Kneitz B. Edelmann W. Kolodner R.D. Lipkin M. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9924-9929Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Finally, blastocysts with both copies of the FEN1 gene deleted and exposed to γ radiation have been observed to undergo extensive apoptosis (4Larsen E. Gran C. Saether B.E. Seeberg E. Klungland A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5346-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), likely because of the essential role of FEN1 in the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage in vivo. A number of in vitro studies have addressed the kinetics and mechanism of FEN1 activity on DNA substrates. FEN1 specifically recognizes single-stranded flaps emanating from double-stranded replication and repair intermediates. Cleavage of the flap has been proposed to require threading of the single-stranded flap through a clamp-like structure in the protein (7Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 8Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) because FEN1 is unable to cleave flaps containing a region of double-stranded DNA (9Robins P. Pappin D.J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28535-28538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or flaps tagged with biotin/streptavidin (8Murante R.S. Rust L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A model whereby FEN1 threads the flap strand from its 5′ end is further supported from the crystal structure of Pyrococcus furiosus FEN1, which contains a clamp-like structure (7Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). FEN1 cleavage occurs primarily one nucleotide past the base of the 5′ flap structure and involves a one-nucleotide 3′ flap, leaving behind a simple nick that can be converted to a continuous strand by DNA ligase (10Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14379-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cleavage results in the release of intact 5′ flaps, ruling out an exonucleolytic mechanism whereby the enzyme digests the flap one nucleotide at a time from the 5′end until it reaches the junction (11Bornarth C.J. Ranalli T.A. Henricksen L.A. Wahl A.F. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). While the activity of FEN1 on naked DNA substrates has been thoroughly investigated, much less is known regarding the details of how FEN1 processes chromatin substrates. Eukaryotic DNA is present as chromatin and gets replicated in conjunction with the DNA during S-phase. Indeed, evidence suggests that at least some immature Okazaki fragments are already associated with histones immediately after passage of the replication fork (12Cusick M.E. Lee K.S. DePamphilis M.L. Wassarman P.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3873-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Clearly, histone-DNA interactions pose a challenge for the enzymes involved in replication and repair. It has been shown that the enzymes involved in nucleotide excision repair, which results in replacement of a 25- to 30-nt stretch of DNA on the damaged strand, require ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activities to gain access to the underlying DNA substrate (13Gong F. Fahy D. Liu H. Wang W. Smerdon M.J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Gong F. Fahy D. Smerdon M.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, base excision repair targets base damage that causes relatively small distortions in helical structure and results in replacement of only one (small patch) or two to 11 (large patch) nucleotide regions (15Peterson C.L. Côté J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 602-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that the enzymes involved in this pathway do not always depend upon the ATP-dependent remodeling machinery to carry out their repair functions. Indeed, studies indicate that numerous DNA glycosylases and AP endonuclease 1 can efficiently process their targets when buried within nucleosomes (16Prasad A. Wallace S.S. Pederson D.S. Mol. Cell.

Likewise, DNA ligase I and FEN1 can cleave flap substrates assembled into nucleosomes, where a 5-nucleotide non-complementary flap was placed near the dyad and oriented away from the histone octamer (22Chafin D.R.

The robust activity of FEN1 previously detected on nucleosome substrates suggests that cleavage occurs without significant disruption of histone-DNA interactions (23Huggins C.F. Chafin D.R. Aoyagi S.

However, in this work, the flap was oriented maximally away from the core histone surface. In this study, we tested whether rotational orientation or DNA sequence affect FEN1 activity toward flaps in nucleosomes. We find that human FEN1 can recognize and efficiently process flaps oriented toward the histone octamer in nucleosomes reconstituted with the Xenopus 5 S rDNA nucleosome positioning element and that such flaps cause minor structural perturbations, which may facilitate access of the flap to FEN1 in these nucleosomes. However, flaps within nucleosomes containing the high-affinity 601 DNA sequence were completely resistant to FEN1 cleavage regardless of orientation. Thus, our data suggest that flaps within such high-affinity nucleosome binding sequences will require ATP-dependent remodeling activity for completion of base excision repair. Flap-containing FEN1 substrates were constructed using synthetic DNA sequences, including the nucleosome positioning elements derived from a Xenopus borealis somatic-type 5S ribosomal gene (23Huggins C.F.

Briefly, for both “flap-in” and “flap-out” 5 S templates (Fig. 1A), a 154-nt bottom strand was prepared by phosphorylating an 80-nt oligo (80-mer) with ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and ligating to a 74-nt oligo (74-mer) after annealing both to a 40-nt splicer (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). The resulting 154-nt product was gel-purified (23Huggins C.F. Chafin D.R. Aoyagi S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Hayes J.J. Mol.

For the flap-out substrates, a 57-mer was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase as described (23Huggins C.F. Chafin D.R. Aoyagi S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Hayes J.J. Mol.

The resulting 92-mer was PAGE-purified and annealed with a 66-mer and the 154-nt bottom strand to generate the double-stranded flap-out substrate. The final product was purified by native 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1× Tris borate-EDTA). The 5 S flap-in substrate was constructed by ligating the labeled 57-mer with a 41-mer after annealing to a 40-nt splint (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). The resulting 97-mer was PAGE-purified and annealed with a 61-mer and the 154-nt bottom strand. The final product was PAGE-purified as described above (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). A fraction of the flap-out and flap-in naked DNA substrates were treated with EcoRV to cleave 44 base pairs off the downstream end to be used as an internal naked DNA control in the FEN1 reactions with nucleosomes. Substrates prepared for structural probing experiments were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase as indicated in the figure legends. Flap substrates based on the 601 nucleosome positioning element were constructed in a similar manner. A 151-nt bottom strand was formed by ligating a 70-mer and an 81-mer after annealing to a 40-nt splint (Fig. 7A and supplemental Fig. S2). The flap-out substrate was formed by ligating a labeled 39-mer and a 42-mer followed by annealing with a 76-mer and the bottom strand 151-mer. The flap-in substrate was in turn constructed by ligating the labeled 39-mer with a 48-mer followed by annealing with a 70-mer and the bottom strand 151-mer. A fraction of the flap-out and flap-in 601 substrates were treated with MspI to construct a shorter naked DNA substrate to be used as the control in FEN1 reactions. The four core histones (Xenopus) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (23Huggins C.F. Chafin D.R. Aoyagi S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Hayes J.J. Mol.

Equimolar amounts of the core histones were mixed with annealed flap substrates (∼2 × 105 cpm) and 5 μg of calf thymus DNA in 1× TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing 2 m NaCl in 200 μl total volume. The nucleosomes were reconstituted using salt gradient dialysis and were purified using sucrose gradient fractionation as described (21Cole H.A. Tabor-Godwin J.M. Hayes J.J. J. Biol.

For footprinting studies, substrates radiolabeled at the 5′ ends of the bottom or top strands were reconstituted and sucrose gradient purified. Sucrose was removed by spin column microfiltration (Millipore, YM-5 unit) with five 400-μl (1× TE) washes. Naked DNA and purified nucleosomes in TE were then treated with hydroxyl radicals as described (23Huggins C.F. Chafin D.R. Aoyagi S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and analyzed by 6% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and analyzed by phosphorimagery. Alternatively, flap-out and flap-in nucleosomes were treated with hydroxyl radicals directly after reconstitution, followed by the separation of naked DNA and nucleosome components on preparative 0.7% agarose gels (0.5× Tris borate-EDTA). DNA was isolated from each band, and cleavage patterns were analyzed on sequencing gels as described above. Purified human FEN1 was a kind gift from Dr. Bob Bambara. Approximately 15 pmol (15,000 cpm) of sucrose gradient-purified nucleosome and truncated naked DNA substrates were treated with 1 pmol of FEN1 (1 μl) and 20 μl of aliquots removed at the times indicated in the figure legends. Aliquots were treated with 10× stop buffer (120 mm EDTA, 1.2% w/v SDS) and analyzed as described (23Huggins C.F. Chafin D.R. Aoyagi S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In an alternative method, 100 fmol of reconstituted nucleosome substrates (without sucrose gradient purification) were treated with 2 pmol FEN1 for 10 min, 10 μl of stop buffer lacking SDS was added, and the nucleosome and naked DNA fractions were separated on preparative 0.7% agarose nucleoprotein gels (0.5× Tris borate-EDTA). The DNA was isolated from respective bands, and cleavage was analyzed on a sequencing gel as described above. H2A A45C/H2B dimers were prepared and subsequently modified with the cross-linking agent, 4-azidophenacyl bromide (APB) as described (25Yang Z. Zheng C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7930-7938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were reconstituted as described above with modified and unmodified dimers, irradiated at 365 nm for 40 s, and the cross-linked DNA was separated from non-cross-linked on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25Yang Z. Zheng C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7930-7938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DNA purified from the polyacrylamide gel was treated with piperidine, precipitated, and loaded onto 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel to determine sites of cross-linking within the DNA. Sucrose gradient-purified flap-out and flap-in nucleosomes and naked DNA were treated with 1 μl of ExoIII (100 units, New England Biolabs). Aliquots were collected at 2, 5, and 10 min and the reactions stopped by addition of 1/10th volume of stop buffer (120 mm EDTA, 1.2% w/v SDS). The DNA was precipitated by standard methods, and cleavage products were analyzed by sequencing gel electrophoresis as described above. In previous work, we demonstrated that human FEN1 can efficiently cleave a conventional DNA flap substrate when assembled into a nucleosome and oriented away from the core histone octamer, based on the preferred rotational positioning of the DNA sequence (22Chafin D.R. Vitolo J.M. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Hayes J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5492-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Huggins C.F. Chafin D.R. Aoyagi S. Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To test whether DNA fragments containing a flap oriented in a direction opposite to the predicted rotational orientation of the DNA can be assembled into canonical nucleosomes and, if so, whether such structures are accessible to FEN1, we constructed DNA templates for nucleosome reconstitution based on the well characterized Xenopus 5S nucleosome positioning sequence (26Rhodes D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3473-3482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21352-21358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These contained a double-flap configuration, with a complementary 1-nt 3′ flap and a non-complementary 5-nt 5′ flap, likely to be the physiologically substrate of FEN1 (10Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14379-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although flaps generated during replication and repair in vivo would have a sequence complementary to the underlying DNA template, we employed a non-complementary 5′ flap to prevent formation of alternative structures (10Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14379-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were reconstituted in which the flap was predicted to be oriented away (flap-out) or toward (flap-in) the histone octamer, based on the known rotational preference of 5 S DNA (see Fig. 1A) (27Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21352-21358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Flap-containing nucleosomes and non-flap controls exhibited similar patterns of migration through agarose nucleoprotein gels, suggesting that the presence of the flaps had little or no effect on the overall structure or integrity of the nucleosome (Fig. 1B). In addition, the fraction of the radio-labeled DNA fragments assembled into nucleosomes when reconstituted with an excess of unlabeled competitor DNA fragments indicates that the histone octamer binds with similar affinity, regardless of presence of the flap or the predicted orientation with respect to the histone surface. The homogeneity of the nucleosomes assembled with flap-out and flap-in substrates was further examined by running samples on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, which separate nucleosomes based on translational position (Fig. 1C). We find that irrespective of the orientation of the flap, nucleosomes migrate as distinct bands, indicative of a single or set of closely related translational position(s). Each reconstituted fraction has some residual naked DNA that migrates slightly differently, depending on the orientation of the flap. However, the nucleosomes exhibit nearly identical electrophoretic migration rates, suggesting very similar conformations and translational positions regardless of the presence or position of the flap. Finally, both flap-in and flap-out nucleosomes sediment at equivalent rates through sucrose gradients, consistent with the native gel analyses (Fig. 1D). We further characterized the structure of the 154-bp flap-in and flap-out nucleosomes using hydroxyl radical cleavage. Hydroxyl radical footprinting provides high-resolution information regarding the interaction of the DNA backbone with the core histone octamer surface and thus should report on any change in the rotational positioning of the DNA or alteration of nucleosome structure caused by the differing flap orientations. Flap-containing nucleosomes in which the bottom and top strands were individually radio-labeled at their 5′ ends were sucrose gradient-purified (Fig. 1D) and subjected to hydroxyl radical cleavage after removal of the sucrose. We find that patterns for the bottom strands from the flap-out and flap-in nucleosomes were nearly identical (Fig. 2A). Although the naked templates exhibited a fairly even cleavage profile throughout (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 5), the reconstituted templates exhibited the characteristic wave-like pattern (lanes 7 and 9) because of the alternate association of the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA helix with the surface of the core histone octamer (27Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21352-21358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the top strands were radio-labeled at the 5′ end of the flap strand (Fig. 2B). Note that the patterns for flap-out and flap-in constructs are offset by 6 bp on these gels because of the different lengths of these constructs (see Fig. 2B, top). These results indicate that the orientation of the flap did not alter the general rotational positioning of the DNA with respect to the histone octamer. An identical result was obtained when nucleosomes were first subjected to hydroxyl radical cleavage and then separated from any non-nucleosomal components on a preparative agarose gel before sequencing gel analysis (data not shown). Interestingly, however, close inspection of the hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns reveals subtle differences between the flap-in and flap-out nucleosome. On the “bottom” strand, the flap-in substrate exhibits more cleavage in regions where the DNA backbone is presumably in contact with the histone proteins compared with the flap-out substrate, especially in regions close to the flap (Fig. 2A, small vertical lines). These differences can also be observed in scans of lanes 7 and 9 in Fig. 2A (supplemental Fig. S3A). This may be due to DNA exhibiting greater motility within the flap-in nucleosomes compared with the flap-out nucleosomes. Likewise, when the radioactive label is placed at the 5′ end of the top (flap) strand, a similar effect is observed (Fig. 2B, top and supplemental Fig. S3B), again suggesting that accommodation of the flap oriented toward the histone octamer increases conformational homogeneity or motility of the DNA on the histone surface. These results suggest that although on average the rotational orientation of the DNA is maintained in the presence of the inward-facing flap, the presence of this flap does cause some increased motility or conformational excursions of the DNA on the histone surface. Exonuclease III (ExoIII) progressively degrades one strand of double-stranded DNA in a 3′ to 5′ fashion, with progress restricted by histone-DNA interactions at the edge of the nucleosome core region (29Aoyagi S. Wade P.A. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30562-30568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We therefore used ExoIII to analyze the translational alignment of the upstream and downstream edges of the histone octamers within flap nucleosomes. Although naked DNA is completely digested by ExoIII, there is a significant portion of both the flap-in and flap-out nucleosome substrates remaining after 10 min of digestion (Fig. 3 and results not shown). Comparison of ExoIII digestion profiles of nucleosomes reconstituted with the flap-in and flap-out substrates reveals subtle differences, despite the fact that the double-stranded DNA sequence is identical in both nucleosomes. For example, digestion of flap-out nucleosomes results in pauses in digestion corresponding to the downstream edge of the core region, at +78, +70, +69, and +59 (label on the top strand) and at the upstream edge at −63, −53, and −44 (label on the bottom strand). However, with the flap-in nucleosomes, the pause at +70 on the top strand is lost, whereas a new pause at +48 is evident. Likewise, pauses on the bottom strand occur at −73, −63, and −54. These data are consistent with a slight difference in conformation or stability of DNA association at the nucleosome edges between the flap-out and flap-in substrates, wherein the top strand is more weakly protected at the downstream edge, consistent with the hydroxyl radical footprinting pattern. Moreover, the cleavage pattern suggests that the edge of the flap-in nucleosome is shifted slightly further upstream compared with that in the flap-out nucleosome. The 154-bp templates used above provide only a few bp of dsDNA beyond that encompassed by the 147-bp nucleosome core region, which greatly restricts the choice of translational positions (25Yang Z. Zheng C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7930-7938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether orientation of the flap can affect nucleosome translational position, we prepared templates that were extended ∼60 bp on the downstream edge of the 154-bp template to provide more opportunity for alternative translational positions, including positions in which the flaps would be located outside of the nucleosome core region. In addition, the extension of the templates increases the ability to resolve alternative translational positions on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Flap-in and flap-out 215-bp templates were prepared containing a radio label at the 5′ end of the top strand oligonucleotide (Fig. 4A). Analysis on translational gels revealed that nucleosomes on either template adopt closely related translational positions, with three apparent positions resolved for the flap-out nucleosomes and two for the flap-in nucleosomes (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). We then performed restriction enzyme cleavage analysis to further characterize translational positioning. Cleavage of these nucleosomes with BamHI, which cuts the top strand at −63, 15 bp from the upstream end of the template, resulted in loss of the topmost bands in each sample (top two in the flap-out and one in the flap-in), whereas the most rapidly migrating bands were retained (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). (Note that the 15-bp radio-labeled cleavage product runs off the gel in this experiment.) This indicates that the translational positions corresponding to the fastest-migrating band in each sample include the BamH1 site, whereas the top bands correspond to positions downstream of this site. Cleavage with BbvI, which cuts the 5 S DNA at position −20, resulted in a loss of i"

Northern blot analysis showed that BmDJ-1 is transcribed as a 756-bp mRNA and has one isoform. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR experiments revealed that the BmDJ-1 was present in the brain, fatbody, Malpighian tubule, ovary and testis but present in only low amounts in the silkgland and hemocyte of day 4 fifth instar larvae. Immunological analysis demonstrated the presence of BmDJ-1 in the brain, midgut, fatbody, Malpighian tubule, testis and ovary from the larvae to the adult. We found that BmDJ-1 has a unique expression pattern through the fifth instar larval to adult developmental stage. We assessed the anti-oxidative function of BmDJ-1 using rotenone (ROT) in day 3 fifth instar larvae. Administration of ROT to day 3 fifth instar larvae, together with exogenous (BmNPV-BmDJ-1 infection for 4 days in advance) BmDJ-1, produced significantly lower 24-h mortality in BmDJ-1 groups than in the control. 2D-PAGE revealed an isoelectric point (pI) shift to an acidic form for BmDJ-1 in BmN4 cells upon ROT stimulus. Among the factors examined for their effects on expression level of BmDJ-1 in the hemolymph, nitric oxide (NO) concentration was identified based on dramatic developmental stage-dependent changes. Administration of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), which is an NO donor, to BmN4 cells produced increased expression of BmDJ-1 compared to the control. These results suggest that BmDJ-1 might control oxidative stress in the cell due to NO and serves as a development modulation factor in B. mori."
