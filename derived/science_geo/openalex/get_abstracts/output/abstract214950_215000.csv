https://openalex.org/W1979469600,"INTRINSIC viscosity of bovine serum albumin has been measured by a number of workers1–6 and values ranging from 3.7 to 4.5 were obtained. All the measurements were made within certain ranges of pH (5–7), ionic strength (0.1–0.2) and temperature (20°–28° C). It has been reported that the intrinsic viscosity of bovine serum albumin does not change within the aforesaid ranges of pH and ionic strength3,4. Naturally the question arises whether the difference in the values of intrinsic viscosity obtained by different authors can be attributed to: (1) the difference in the temperature of the solutions; (2) the difference in the samples, that is, the difference in the heterogeneity factors of the samples (albumin is always found associated with a small fraction of material of higher molecular weight). No experiment has yet been reported which can help in the solution of this problem. The heterogeneity factor of the different samples used by different authors is also unknown."

https://openalex.org/W2041663612,"FROM investigations with the electron microscope, it has been reported that the precursors of collagen fibrils are formed within the cytoplasm of fibrocytes1. It follows that the sites of formation of the fibrils and those of the synthesis of collagen are identical. Hydroxyproline, which is a characteristic acid of collagen protein, originates from proline under the action of L-ascorbic acid2."

https://openalex.org/W2071899863,"IT will not surprise many workers in the B12 field to read that Dr. Heinivaara and Dr. Palva have obtained a remission over a period of 50 days in one case of pernicious anaemia, which was receiving a daily dosage of 60 µg of crystalline B12 (see above). Indeed, in our original work1 we chose this dosage because we knew that, being in the sub-optimal range, it should be sufficient to prevent deterioration during the period of test, and thus be ethically justifiable. To draw firm deductions about the significance of glutamic acid additives, however, from a comparison between the blood responses in two selected cases is too ingenuous. The important finding, of course, during this initial period of treatment on sub-optimal dosage is not the haematological response as assessed by haemoglobin (Hb) or packed cell volume (P.C.V.) readings over 50 days (which vary greatly from patient to patient), but the reticulocyte response, obtained from the same patient, on one form of therapy compared with that on another. This test—the double reticulocyte response test—is not our test as Heinivaara and Palva infer. It was originally described in 1935 by Minot and Castle2, and is still regarded as the most reliable short-term method for the comparison of the therapeutic effect of two haematinics of unknown potency3."
