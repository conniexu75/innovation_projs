https://openalex.org/W2047122678,"Most forms of chemotherapy employ mechanisms involving induction of oxidative stress, a strategy that can be effective due to the elevated oxidative state commonly observed in cancer cells. However, recent studies have shown that relative redox levels in primary tumors can be heterogeneous, suggesting that regimens dependent on differential oxidative state may not be uniformly effective. To investigate this issue in hematological malignancies, we evaluated mechanisms controlling oxidative state in primary specimens derived from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Our studies demonstrate three striking findings. First, the majority of functionally defined leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are characterized by relatively low levels of reactive oxygen species (termed ""ROS-low""). Second, ROS-low LSCs aberrantly overexpress BCL-2. Third, BCL-2 inhibition reduced oxidative phosphorylation and selectively eradicated quiescent LSCs. Based on these findings, we propose a model wherein the unique physiology of ROS-low LSCs provides an opportunity for selective targeting via disruption of BCL-2-dependent oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2132546867,"Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system that often presents with widespread metastatic disease, resulting in survival rates of less than 50%. To determine the spectrum of somatic mutation in high-risk neuroblastoma, we studied 240 affected individuals (cases) using a combination of whole-exome, genome and transcriptome sequencing as part of the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative. Here we report a low median exonic mutation frequency of 0.60 per Mb (0.48 nonsilent) and notably few recurrently mutated genes in these tumors. Genes with significant somatic mutation frequencies included ALK (9.2% of cases), PTPN11 (2.9%), ATRX (2.5%, and an additional 7.1% had focal deletions), MYCN (1.7%, causing a recurrent p.Pro44Leu alteration) and NRAS (0.83%). Rare, potentially pathogenic germline variants were significantly enriched in ALK, CHEK2, PINK1 and BARD1. The relative paucity of recurrent somatic mutations in neuroblastoma challenges current therapeutic strategies that rely on frequently altered oncogenic drivers."
https://openalex.org/W2028934624,"Epigenetic mechanisms integrate genetic and environmental causes of disease, but comprehensive genome-wide analyses of epigenetic modifications have not yet demonstrated robust association with common diseases. Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays on 354 anti-citrullinated protein antibody-associated rheumatoid arthritis cases and 337 controls, we identified two clusters within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region whose differential methylation potentially mediates genetic risk for rheumatoid arthritis. To reduce confounding factors that have hampered previous epigenome-wide studies, we corrected for cellular heterogeneity by estimating and adjusting for cell-type proportions in our blood-derived DNA samples and used mediation analysis to filter out associations likely to be a consequence of disease. Four CpGs also showed an association between genotype and variance of methylation. The associations for both clusters replicated at least one CpG (P < 0.01), with the rest showing suggestive association, in monocyte cell fractions in an independent cohort of 12 cases and 12 controls. Thus, DNA methylation is a potential mediator of genetic risk."

https://openalex.org/W2063662864,"The genetic basis of hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a subtype of ALL characterized by aneuploidy and poor outcome, is unknown. Genomic profiling of 124 hypodiploid ALL cases, including whole-genome and exome sequencing of 40 cases, identified two subtypes that differ in the severity of aneuploidy, transcriptional profiles and submicroscopic genetic alterations. Near-haploid ALL with 24-31 chromosomes harbor alterations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and Ras signaling (71%) and the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF3 (encoding AIOLOS; 13%). In contrast, low-hypodiploid ALL with 32-39 chromosomes are characterized by alterations in TP53 (91.2%) that are commonly present in nontumor cells, IKZF2 (encoding HELIOS; 53%) and RB1 (41%). Both near-haploid and low-hypodiploid leukemic cells show activation of Ras-signaling and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-signaling pathways and are sensitive to PI3K inhibitors, indicating that these drugs should be explored as a new therapeutic strategy for this aggressive form of leukemia."

https://openalex.org/W2154170543,"Meningiomas are the most common primary nervous system tumor. The tumor suppressor NF2 is disrupted in approximately half of all meningiomas, but the complete spectrum of genetic changes remains undefined. We performed whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing on 17 meningiomas and focused sequencing on an additional 48 tumors to identify and validate somatic genetic alterations. Most meningiomas had simple genomes, with fewer mutations, rearrangements and copy-number alterations than reported in other tumors in adults. However, several meningiomas harbored more complex patterns of copy-number changes and rearrangements, including one tumor with chromothripsis. We confirmed focal NF2 inactivation in 43% of tumors and found alterations in epigenetic modifiers in an additional 8% of tumors. A subset of meningiomas lacking NF2 alterations harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 (p.Glu17Lys) and SMO (p.Trp535Leu) and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of activation of these pathways. These mutations were present in therapeutically challenging tumors of the skull base and higher grade. These results begin to define the spectrum of genetic alterations in meningiomas and identify potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2039378889,"Cellular senescence both protects multicellular organisms from cancer and contributes to their ageing. The pre-eminent tumour suppressor p53 has an important role in the induction and maintenance of senescence, but how it carries out this function remains poorly understood. In addition, although increasing evidence supports the idea that metabolic changes underlie many cell-fate decisions and p53-mediated tumour suppression, few connections between metabolic enzymes and senescence have been established. Here we describe a new mechanism by which p53 links these functions. We show that p53 represses the expression of the tricarboxylic-acid-cycle-associated malic enzymes ME1 and ME2 in human and mouse cells. Both malic enzymes are important for NADPH production, lipogenesis and glutamine metabolism, but ME2 has a more profound effect. Through the inhibition of malic enzymes, p53 regulates cell metabolism and proliferation. Downregulation of ME1 and ME2 reciprocally activates p53 through distinct MDM2- and AMP-activated protein kinase-mediated mechanisms in a feed-forward manner, bolstering this pathway and enhancing p53 activation. Downregulation of ME1 and ME2 also modulates the outcome of p53 activation, leading to strong induction of senescence, but not apoptosis, whereas enforced expression of either malic enzyme suppresses senescence. Our findings define physiological functions of malic enzymes, demonstrate a positive-feedback mechanism that sustains p53 activation, and reveal a connection between metabolism and senescence mediated by p53."
https://openalex.org/W2074560222,"A new method facilitates high-throughput sequencing of the repertoire of immunoglobulin heavy-light chain pairs in human B cells. Each B-cell receptor consists of a pair of heavy and light chains. High-throughput sequencing can identify large numbers of heavy- and light-chain variable regions (VH and VL) in a given B-cell repertoire, but information about endogenous pairing of heavy and light chains is lost after bulk lysis of B-cell populations. Here we describe a way to retain this pairing information. In our approach, single B cells (>5 × 104 capacity per experiment) are deposited in a high-density microwell plate (125 pl/well) and lysed in situ. mRNA is then captured on magnetic beads, reverse transcribed and amplified by emulsion VH:VL linkage PCR. The linked transcripts are analyzed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. We validated the fidelity of VH:VL pairs identified by this approach and used the method to sequence the repertoire of three human cell subsets—peripheral blood IgG+ B cells, peripheral plasmablasts isolated after tetanus toxoid immunization and memory B cells isolated after seasonal influenza vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2017364473,"The intestinal microbiota has a critical role in immune system and metabolic homeostasis, but it must be tolerated by the host to avoid inflammatory responses that can damage the epithelial barrier separating the host from the luminal contents. Breakdown of this regulation and the resulting inappropriate immune response to commensals are thought to lead to the development of inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We proposed that the intestinal immune system is instructed by the microbiota to limit responses to luminal antigens. Here we demonstrate in mice that, at steady state, the microbiota inhibits the transport of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria from the lumen to a key immune inductive site, the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). However, in the absence of Myd88 or under conditions of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, non-invasive bacteria were trafficked to the MLNs in a CCR7-dependent manner, and induced both T-cell responses and IgA production. Trafficking was carried out by CX(3)CR1(hi) mononuclear phagocytes, an intestinal-cell population previously reported to be non-migratory. These findings define a central role for commensals in regulating the migration to the MLNs of CX(3)CR1(hi) mononuclear phagocytes endowed with the ability to capture luminal bacteria, thereby compartmentalizing the intestinal immune response to avoid inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2051621182,"Intraspecific variability in social organization is common, yet the underlying causes are rarely known. In the fire ant Solenopsis invicta, the existence of two divergent forms of social organization is under the control of a single Mendelian genomic element marked by two variants of an odorant-binding protein gene. Here we characterize the genomic region responsible for this important social polymorphism, and show that it is part of a pair of heteromorphic chromosomes that have many of the key properties of sex chromosomes. The two variants, hereafter referred to as the social B and social b (SB and Sb) chromosomes, are characterized by a large region of approximately 13 megabases (55% of the chromosome) in which recombination is completely suppressed between SB and Sb. Recombination seems to occur normally between the SB chromosomes but not between Sb chromosomes because Sb/Sb individuals are non-viable. Genomic comparisons revealed limited differentiation between SB and Sb, and the vast majority of the 616 genes identified in the non-recombining region are present in the two variants. The lack of recombination over more than half of the two heteromorphic social chromosomes can be explained by at least one large inversion of around 9 megabases, and this absence of recombination has led to the accumulation of deleterious mutations, including repetitive elements in the non-recombining region of Sb compared with the homologous region of SB. Importantly, most of the genes with demonstrated expression differences between individuals of the two social forms reside in the non-recombining region. These findings highlight how genomic rearrangements can maintain divergent adaptive social phenotypes involving many genes acting together by locally limiting recombination."

https://openalex.org/W2065096062,"Experience from different fields of life sciences suggests that accessible, complete reference maps of the components of the system under study are highly beneficial research tools. Examples of such maps include libraries of the spectroscopic properties of molecules, or databases of drug structures in analytical or forensic chemistry. Such maps, and methods to navigate them, constitute reliable assays to probe any sample for the presence and amount of molecules contained in the map. So far, attempts to generate such maps for any proteome have failed to reach complete proteome coverage. Here we use a strategy based on high-throughput peptide synthesis and mass spectrometry to generate an almost complete reference map (97% of the genome-predicted proteins) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. We generated two versions of this mass-spectrometric map, one supporting discovery-driven (shotgun) and the other supporting hypothesis-driven (targeted) proteomic measurements. Together, the two versions of the map constitute a complete set of proteomic assays to support most studies performed with contemporary proteomic technologies. To show the utility of the maps, we applied them to a protein quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, which requires precise measurement of the same set of peptides over a large number of samples. Protein measurements over 78 S. cerevisiae strains revealed a complex relationship between independent genetic loci, influencing the levels of related proteins. Our results suggest that selective pressure favours the acquisition of sets of polymorphisms that adapt protein levels but also maintain the stoichiometry of functionally related pathway members."
https://openalex.org/W2004618496,"In serum, mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) fluctuate between a naive inner cell mass (ICM)-like state and a primed epiblast-like state, but when cultured with inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 pathways (2i), they are harnessed exclusively in a distinct naive pluropotent state, the ground state, that more faithfully recapitulates the ICM. Understanding the mechanism underlying this naive pluripotent state will be critical for realizing the full potential of ESCs. We show here that PRDM14, a PR-domain-containing transcriptional regulator, ensures naive pluripotency through a dual mechanism: antagonizing activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling by the core pluripotency transcriptional circuitry, and repressing expression of de novo DNA methyltransferases that modify the epigenome to a primed epiblast-like state. PRDM14 exerts these effects by recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) specifically to key targets and repressing their expression."
https://openalex.org/W2023778684,"Arlotta and Rouaux show that expression of the transcription factor Fezf2 in vivo is sufficient to redirect post-mitotic callosal projection neurons from one particular layer of the brain to corticofugal projection neurons that pertain to a different layer, including a redirection of their axonal connectivity. Once programmed to acquire a specific identity and function, cells rarely change in vivo1. Neurons of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) in particular are a classic example of a stable, terminally differentiated cell type. With the exception of the adult neurogenic niches, where a limited set of neuronal subtypes continue to be generated throughout life2,3, CNS neurons are born only during embryonic and early postnatal development. Once generated, neurons become permanently post-mitotic and do not change their identity for the lifespan of the organism. Here, we have investigated whether excitatory neurons of the neocortex can be instructed to directly reprogram their identity post-mitotically from one subtype into another, in vivo. We show that embryonic and early postnatal callosal projection neurons of layer II/III can be post-mitotically lineage reprogrammed into layer-V/VI corticofugal projection neurons following expression of the transcription factor encoded by Fezf2. Reprogrammed callosal neurons acquire molecular properties of corticofugal projection neurons and change their axonal connectivity from interhemispheric, intracortical projections to corticofugal projections directed below the cortex. The data indicate that during a window of post-mitotic development neurons can change their identity, acquiring critical features of alternative neuronal lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2170558420,"Previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA (miRNA) expression is altered in human cancer. However, the molecular mechanism underlying these changes in miRNA expression remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic modification of miR-124 genes and the potential function of miR-124 in pancreatic cancer. Using pyrosequencing analysis, we found that miR-124 genes (including miR-124-1, miR-124-2 and miR-124-3) are highly methylated in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with in non-cancerous tissues. Hypermethylation mediated the silencing of miR-124, which was a frequent event in pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Furthermore, miR-124 downregulation was significantly associated with worse survival of PDAC patients. Functional studies showed that miR-124 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, we characterized Rac1 as a direct target of miR-124, and miR-124 interacted with the 3'-untranslated region of Rac1, which we showed to be a putative tumor promoter in pancreatic cancer. Thus, the miR-124-mediated downregulation of Rac1 led to the inactivation of the MKK4-JNK-c-Jun pathway. Therefore, our study demonstrates that miR-124 is a tumor suppressor miRNA that is epigenetically silenced in pancreatic cancer. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified molecular mechanism involved in the progression and metastasis of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2044818544,"Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are innate immune effector molecules that are thought to confer antiviral defence through disruption of protein-protein interactions in the host translation-initiation machinery. However, it was recently discovered that IFITs can directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5'-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an amino-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single-stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double-stranded viral PPP-RNA, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, also known as DDX58). Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a non-sequence-specific manner and requires a 5'-overhang of approximately three nucleotides. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 was found to cause a defect in the antiviral response by human embryonic kidney cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA, and lend insight into their downstream effector function."
https://openalex.org/W2088406510,"During retinal vascular development there is simultaneous regression of the hyaloid vasculature and formation of the retinal vasculature; here it is demonstrated that regression of developing vasculature is light dependent and acts via the photoreceptor melanopsin. In the developing eye, as the retinal vasculature forms the blood vessels supplying the transparent hyaloid membrane surrounding the vitreous body regress. This process is clinically important as excessive vascular growth is a major cause of blindness in premature infants. Surprisingly, this study reports that light is involved in this major change in tissue architecture. Richard Lang and colleagues find that light stimulates regression of developing hyaloid vasculature in mice, acting through the photoreceptor melanopsin. In the absence of either light or melanopsin, vascular endothelial growth factor A is upregulated and abnormal retinal angiogenesis results. Whether the same processes are involved in human eye development remains to be determined. Vascular patterning is critical for organ function. In the eye, there is simultaneous regression of embryonic hyaloid vasculature1 (important to clear the optical path) and formation of the retinal vasculature2 (important for the high metabolic demands of retinal neurons). These events occur postnatally in the mouse. Here we have identified a light-response pathway that regulates both processes. We show that when mice are mutated in the gene (Opn4) for the atypical opsin melanopsin3,4,5, or are dark-reared from late gestation, the hyaloid vessels are persistent at 8 days post-partum and the retinal vasculature overgrows. We provide evidence that these vascular anomalies are explained by a light-response pathway that suppresses retinal neuron number, limits hypoxia and, as a consequence, holds local expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in check. We also show that the light response for this pathway occurs in late gestation at about embryonic day 16 and requires the photopigment in the fetus and not the mother. Measurements show that visceral cavity photon flux is probably sufficient to activate melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells in the mouse fetus. These data thus show that light—the stimulus for function of the mature eye—is also critical in preparing the eye for vision by regulating retinal neuron number and initiating a series of events that ultimately pattern the ocular blood vessels."
https://openalex.org/W1992682414,"The non-canonical NF-κB pathway forms a major arm of NF-κB signalling that mediates important biological functions, including lymphoid organogenesis, B-lymphocyte function, and cell growth and survival. Activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway involves degradation of an inhibitory protein, TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), but how this signalling event is controlled is still unknown. Here we have identified the deubiquitinase OTUD7B as a pivotal regulator of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. OTUD7B deficiency in mice has no appreciable effect on canonical NF-κB activation but causes hyperactivation of non-canonical NF-κB. In response to non-canonical NF-κB stimuli, OTUD7B binds and deubiquitinates TRAF3, thereby inhibiting TRAF3 proteolysis and preventing aberrant non-canonical NF-κB activation. Consequently, the OTUD7B deficiency results in B-cell hyper-responsiveness to antigens, lymphoid follicular hyperplasia in the intestinal mucosa, and elevated host-defence ability against an intestinal bacterial pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. These findings establish OTUD7B as a crucial regulator of signal-induced non-canonical NF-κB activation and indicate a mechanism of immune regulation that involves OTUD7B-mediated deubiquitination and stabilization of TRAF3."
https://openalex.org/W2079228567,"Hair bundles of the inner ear have a specialized structure and protein composition that underlies their sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. Using mass spectrometry, we identified and quantified >1,100 proteins, present from a few to 400,000 copies per stereocilium, from purified chick bundles; 336 of these were significantly enriched in bundles. Bundle proteins that we detected have been shown to regulate cytoskeleton structure and dynamics, energy metabolism, phospholipid synthesis and cell signaling. Three-dimensional imaging using electron tomography allowed us to count the number of actin-actin cross-linkers and actin-membrane connectors; these values compared well to those obtained from mass spectrometry. Network analysis revealed several hub proteins, including RDX (radixin) and SLC9A3R2 (NHERF2), which interact with many bundle proteins and may perform functions essential for bundle structure and function. The quantitative mass spectrometry of bundle proteins reported here establishes a framework for future characterization of dynamic processes that shape bundle structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2054103222,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) play a pivotal role in the resistance of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and its progression to blast crisis (BC), in part, through the alternative splicing of self-renewal and survival genes. To elucidate splice-isoform regulators of human BC LSC maintenance, we performed whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, splice-isoform-specific quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), nanoproteomics, stromal coculture, and BC LSC xenotransplantation analyses. Cumulatively, these studies show that the alternative splicing of multiple prosurvival BCL2 family genes promotes malignant transformation of myeloid progenitors into BC LSCS that are quiescent in the marrow niche and that contribute to therapeutic resistance. Notably, sabutoclax, a pan-BCL2 inhibitor, renders marrow-niche-resident BC LSCs sensitive to TKIs at doses that spare normal progenitors. These findings underscore the importance of alternative BCL2 family splice-isoform expression in BC LSC maintenance and suggest that the combinatorial inhibition of prosurvival BCL2 family proteins and BCR-ABL may eliminate dormant LSCs and obviate resistance."

Yet, many healthy people have cells possessing mutant Ras without apparent harm, and in animal models mutant Ras causes transformation only after upregulation of Ras activity. Here, we demonstrate that oncogenic K-Ras is not constitutively active but can be readily activated by upstream stimulants to lead to prolonged strong Ras activity. These data indicate that in addition to targeting K-Ras downstream effectors, interventions to reduce K-Ras activation may have important cancer-preventive value, especially in patients with oncogenic Ras mutations. As other small G proteins are regulated in a similar manner, this concept is likely to apply broadly to the entire Ras family of molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2049876223,"In this study, we demonstrate that constitutive activation of Raf-1 oncogenic signaling induces stabilization and accumulation of Aurora-A mitotic kinase that ultimately drives the transition from an epithelial to a highly invasive mesenchymal phenotype in estrogen receptor α-positive (ERα(+)) breast cancer cells. The transition from an epithelial- to a mesenchymal-like phenotype was characterized by reduced expression of ERα, HER-2/Neu overexpression and loss of CD24 surface receptor (CD24(-/low)). Importantly, expression of key epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and upregulation of the stemness gene SOX2 was linked to acquisition of stem cell-like properties such as the ability to form mammospheres in vitro and tumor self-renewal in vivo. Moreover, aberrant Aurora-A kinase activity induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD5, indicating a novel interplay between Aurora-A and SMAD5 signaling pathways in the development of EMT, stemness and ultimately tumor progression. Importantly, pharmacological and molecular inhibition of Aurora-A kinase activity restored a CD24(+) epithelial phenotype that was coupled to ERα expression, downregulation of HER-2/Neu, inhibition of EMT and impaired self-renewal ability, resulting in the suppression of distant metastases. Taken together, our findings show for the first time the causal role of Aurora-A kinase in the activation of EMT pathway responsible for the development of distant metastases in ERα(+) breast cancer cells. Moreover, this study has important translational implications because it highlights the mitotic kinase Aurora-A as a novel promising therapeutic target to selectively eliminate highly invasive cancer cells and improve the disease-free and overall survival of ERα(+) breast cancer patients resistant to conventional endocrine therapy."

Coculture of peripheral blood lymphocytes with human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected fibroblasts results in the expansion of CD94-NKG2C+ NK cells (8Gumá M. Budt M. Sáez A. Brckalo T. Hengel H. Angulo A. López-Botet M. Expansion of CD94/NKG2C+ NK cells in response to human cytomegalovirus-infected fibroblasts.Blood. 2006; 107: 3624-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Moreover, individuals who are seropositive for CMV have increased numbers of NKG2C+ cells, suggesting a degree of interplay between CMV and the expression of the CD94-NKG2 receptors. Human CMV belongs to the β-herpesviridae family of herpes viruses and establishes a lifelong persistent infection (9Söderberg-Nauclér C. Fish K.N. Nelson J.A. Reactivation of latent human cytomegalovirus by allogeneic stimulation of blood cells from healthy donors.Cell. 1997; 91: 119-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). To escape recognition by CD8+ T cells, CMV encodes several proteins such as US2, US3, US6, and US11 that interfere with antigen presentation and the expression of MHC-I molecules (10Yewdell J.W. Hill A.B. Viral interference with antigen presentation.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although the expression of such proteins may augment NK cell recognition of infected cells as a result of the loss of ligands for inhibitory receptors, a number of other CMV encoded proteins that may inhibit NK cell responses. For example, UL18 can act as a ligand for LILRB1, whereas other proteins such as UL16 can impair the expression of ligands for activating NK receptors (11Wilkinson G.W. Tomasec P. Stanton R.J. Armstrong M. Prod'homme V. Aicheler R. McSharry B.P. Rickards C.R. Cochrane D. Llewellyn-Lacey S. Wang E.C. Griffin C.A. Davison A.J. Modulation of natural killer cells by human cytomegalovirus.J. Clin. Virol. 2008; 41: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Human CMV also appears to specifically manipulate the interaction between HLA-E and CD94-NKG2 receptors via expression of the UL40 glycoprotein. Residues 15–23 of UL40 in the laboratory strain AD169 are identical to residues 3–11 of most HLA-C allotypes (12Tomasec P. Braud V.M. Rickards C. Powell M.B. McSharry B.P. Gadola S. Cerundolo V. Borysiewicz L.K. McMichael A.J. Wilkinson G.W.

Martinozzi S. Grzeschik M. Hengel H. Ellwart J.W. Pla M. Weiss E.H. Cutting edge: the human cytomegalovirus UL40 gene product contains a ligand for HLA-E and prevents NK cell-mediated lysis.J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5019-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and, when expressed in the context of UL40, can bind HLA-E in a TAP-independent manner. Importantly, fibroblasts infected with UL40-deleted viruses show enhanced killing compared with wild-type viruses, indicating UL40 is active in productive viral infections (14Wang E.C. McSharry B. Retiere C. Tomasec P. Williams S. Borysiewicz L.K. Braud V.M. Wilkinson G.W. UL40-mediated NK evasion during productive infection with human cytomegalovirus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7570-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, UL40 can provide a peptide that can bind HLA-E even when other CMV-encoded immunoevasins are active, promoting the inhibitory interaction between HLA-E and CD94-NKG2A. Biochemical and functional studies have shown that the sequence of the peptide bound to HLA-E impacts on the interaction with CD94-NKG2 receptors (15Kaiser B.K. Barahmand-Pour F. Paulsene W.

Structural and biochemical data demonstrated that the side chains of P5 and P8 directly contacted CD94-NKG2A, and changes to these residues can directly affect binding to the CD94-NKG2 receptors (17Sullivan L.C.

Given the central role of peptide in the interaction between HLA-E and CD94-NKG2 receptors, variation in residues 15–23 of UL40 may modulate recognition of HLA-E by CD94-NKG2 receptors and hence the capacity of NK cells to recognize CMV-infected cells (15Kaiser B.K.

Earlier studies identified some variation in UL40 sequences in the region encoding the HLA-E-binding peptide in laboratory strains of CMV (12Tomasec P. Braud V.M. Rickards C. Powell M.B.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 2926-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Studies on clinical isolates of CMV isolated from kidney and lung transplant recipients also identified a number of distinct UL40 sequences, but the capacity of these variant peptides to bind HLA-E or to impact on recognition of HLA-E by CD94-NKG2 receptors was not assessed (22Garrigue I.

In addition, Magri et al. (24Magri G. Muntasell A. Romo N. Sáez-Borderías A. Pende D. Geraghty D.E. Hengel H. Angulo A. Moretta A. López-Botet M. NKp46 and DNAM-1 NK-cell receptors drive the response to human cytomegalovirus-infected myeloid dendritic cells overcoming viral immune evasion strategies.Blood. 2011; 117: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) identified a UL40 isolate containing a substitution at the P2 anchor residue of the HLA-E-binding epitope, resulting in markedly reduced HLA-E surface expression. However, it is not clear whether this mutation may be the result of passage in vitro. Another recent study (25Prod'homme V. Tomasec P. Cunningham C. Lemberg M.K. Stanton R.J. McSharry B.P. Wang E.C. Cuff S. Martoglio B. Davison A.J. Braud V.M. Wilkinson G.W. Human cytomegalovirus UL40 signal peptide regulates cell surface expression of the NK cell ligands HLA-E and gpUL18.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) identified a clinical strain of CMV in which the HLA-E epitope from UL40 is missing P1, also leading to reduced HLA-E surface expression. Therefore, it appears that variation in UL40 can impact on HLA-E surface expression; however, its impact on recognition by CD94-NKG2A and CD94-NKG2C remains largely unknown. Here, we examined the extent of polymorphism in the UL40 gene in a clinical cohort of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, and we assessed the capacity of such polymorphisms to impact HLA-E binding, the affinity of the interaction between HLA-E and CD94-NKG2A and -NKG2C, and activation of NK cell clones expressing either CD94-NKG2A or -NKG2C. The data showed that the predominant UL40 species encoded a peptide identical to that present in most HLA-C allotypes (VMAPRTLIL) that bind HLA-E and interact with both CD94-NKG2A and -NKG2C with high affinity. However, other isolates encoded peptides that bind HLA-E but failed to interact with either activating or inhibitory CD94-NKG2 receptors or alternatively bound with a lower affinity but that preferentially signaled through CD94-NKG2A. Our observations highlight the complex association between CMV and the immune system and suggest a novel mechanism by which the virus can modulate the affinity of the interaction between CD94-NKG2 receptors and HLA-E to favor its escape from immunosurveillance. A total of 152 HSCT patients that had undergone stem cell transplantation for a range of hematological malignancies were recruited from the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Adelaide, the Royal Melbourne and The Alfred Hospitals in Melbourne, and Westmead Hospital in Sydney over the period 2002–2007. Of these patients, 44 were identified as having CMV viremia as assessed by PCR and had plasma samples available (Table 1). Ethics approval was gained from all participating institutions, and written informed consent to the study was obtained from all donors and recipients.TABLE 1Patient demographicsPre-transplant conditioningMyeloablative (n = 19)Reduced intensity (n = 13)Mean age at transplant (range)41 (21–55 years)55 (43–64 years)Recipient sex14 female, 5 male4 female, 9 maleDiseaseAcute lymphoid leukemia2Acute myeloid leukemia97Chronic lymphoid leukemia1Chronic myeloid leukemia21Multiple myeloma11Non-Hodgkin lymphoma32Severe aplastic anemia11Myelofibrosis1Conditioning regimenBusulfan plus cyclophosphamide8Cyclophosphamide plus TBI9Etoposide plus TBI1Fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide4Fludarabine plus melphalan8Melphalan1V16 plus TBI1ImmunosuppressionCyclosporine A/tacromilus plus methotrexate178Cyclosporin A plus MMF2Cyclosporin A22Unknown1 Open table in a new tab DNA was extracted from plasma samples corresponding closest to the date of reactivation using QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Primers to amplify the UL40 gene were designed using the sequences for human herpesvirus 5 strain AD169 (GenBankTM accession number NC_001347) and wild-type strain Merlin (NC_006273), which were 5′-GGCTCTGTCTCGTCGTCATT and 3′-CGACACCGATCGATTTTCTT (Geneworks, Australia). PCR was performed with a DNA concentration typically in the range of 2–5 ng/μl using 4 units of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase Low DNA (Applied Biosystems, CA) (5 units/μl) with the following cycling parameters: one cycle of 94 °C for 12 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s and a final extension of 72 °C for 7 min. Multiple independent PCRs were performed for each sample, and the PCR products were cloned into pGEM®-T Easy Vector System (Promega). A consensus sequence from each patient was derived using ChromasPro version 1.5 (Technelysium Pty. Ltd., Queensland, Australia) in most cases using multiple sequences from independent PCR products. These sequences were deposited in GenBankTM with accession numbers JQ060965 to JQ060996. They were aligned against the human herpes virus 5 AD169 strain using the ClustalW function within BioEdit software version 7.0.5 (Tom Hall, Ibis Therapeutics, Carlsbad, CA). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the DNA-Dist function of the program to produce an unrooted neighbor joining tree using a distance matrix, with a Kimura two-parameter algorithm. This was then viewed in TreeView version 1.6.6 (26Page R.D. TreeView: an application to display phylogenetic trees on personal computers.Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Production of recombinant HLA-E and CD94-NKG2 was performed essentially as described previously (17Sullivan L.C. Clements C.S. Beddoe T. Johnson D. Hoare H.L. Lin J. Huyton T. Hopkins E.J. Reid H.H. Wilce M.C. Kabat J. Borrego F. Coligan J.E. Rossjohn J. Brooks A.G.

The proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS, purified from inclusion bodies, and refolded by dilution. CD94 was expressed from vectors that contained a sequence allowing for an in-frame fusion with a peptide that facilitated enzymatic biotinylation. CD94-NKG2 complexes were concentrated using a stirred cell (Amicon, Beverly Hills, MA), subjected to size exclusion chromatography, and then further purified using a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare). HLA-E/peptide was refolded with human β2m and chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to the UL40 variants (Genscript). HLA-E/peptide complexes were purified by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. All samples were again re-purified by size exclusion within 24 h prior to analysis by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR experiments were performed using a ProteOn XPR36 instrument (Bio-Rad) at 25 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl (HBS), and 0.05% Tween (HBS-T). Streptavidin was diluted into 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0), and 500 RU was immobilized to three flow cells of a GLC sensorchip by amine coupling. N-terminally biotinylated CD94-NKG2A and CD94-NKG2C (∼300 RU) were coupled to two flow cells of a ProteOn GLC streptavidin sensorchip. A separate flow cell containing immobilized streptavidin without recombinant CD94-NKG2 protein served as the control channel. Recombinant HLA-E was again subjected to size exclusion chromatography immediately before injection over the test and control surfaces at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Results from at least two independent experiments were analyzed. After subtraction of data from the control cells, the interactions were analyzed with ProteOn Manager software (version 2.1) and Prism (GraphPad), and KD values were derived from the equilibrium fit option of the software packages. NK cells from healthy donors were isolated using the RosetteSep method (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Only those populations displaying >95% of CD56+ CD3− NK cells were selected. Purified NK cells were then cultured on irradiated feeder cells in the presence of 2 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml recombinant interleukin-2 (proleukin; Chiron, Emeryville, CA) to obtain, after limiting dilution, clonal NK cells. Proliferating NK cell clones used for further analysis were selected on the basis of the expression of CD94-NKG2A and CD94-NKG2C receptors, as determined by flow cytometric analysis with the mAbs Z270 (27Carretero M.

RMA-S-HLA-E transfectants were cultured overnight at 37 °C in the absence or presence of peptide after which the cells were stained with the anti-HLA class I mAb A6.136 or isotype control and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine cell surface levels of HLA-E. NK cell clones derived from different donors were tested for cytolytic activity via 51Cr-release assays as described (29Poggi A. Biassoni R. Pella N. Paolieri F. Bellomo R. Bertolini A. Moretta L. Mingari M.C. In vitro expansion of CD3/TCR- human thymocyte populations that selectively lack CD3 delta gene expression: a phenotypic and functional analysis.J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of anti-CD94 mAb Y9 (IgM, 10 μg/ml). Target cells used in these experiments were RMAS-HLA-E (described above) and the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 transfected with HLA-E*0103 (HLA-E-K562, kindly provided by E. H. Weiss). Both cell lines were incubated overnight at 37 °C, either alone or in the presence of the synthetic peptides (200 μm). Peptides were kept throughout the assay to ensure higher levels of HLA-E expression. Previous studies had identified variations in CMV UL40 sequences isolated from renal and lung transplant recipients but had not assessed the impact of these polymorphisms on peptide binding to HLA-E or NK cell activation (22Garrigue I. Corte M.F. Magnin N. Couzi L. Capdepont S. Rio C. Merville P. Dechanet-Merville J. Fleury H. Lafon M.E.

UL40 human cytomegalovirus variability evolution patterns over time in renal transplant recipients.Transplantation. 2008; 86: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because hematopoietic cells are both critical for the control of CMV and are thought to be a major reservoir of latent virus, we assessed the extent of UL40 polymorphism in the context of hematological malignancy and the significance of such polymorphisms for NK cell function. From a cohort of 152 patients who received HSC transplants for a variety of hematological malignancies, 99 patients were CMV-seropositive prior to transplantation. Of these, 46 patients had evidence of CMV infection or reactivation as defined by the presence of viral DNA in plasma samples. With the exception of one patient who was CMV-seronegative but who received a transplant from a seropositive donor, all patients were CMV-seropositive. Plasma was obtained from 44 of these patients, and cDNA encoding UL40 was amplified by PCR from the plasma of 32 recipients, then cloned, and sequenced. Of these 32 patients, 16 had acute myeloid leukemia, and five had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, although there were no more than three patients with other malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia, acute or chronic lymphoid leukemia, and multiple myeloma. There was significant variability in pre-transplant conditioning with some patients receiving a myeloablative regimen involving total body irradiation, whereas others had reduced intensity conditioning in the absence of irradiation (Table 1). CMV prophylaxis was varied, either being delivered routinely to patients throughout the first 100 days post-transplant or alternatively only upon detection of viral DNA in the plasma as revealed in weekly testing. During the course of monitoring, eight patients had a second or third episode of CMV viremia. In all cases, sequencing of UL40 cDNA amplified from later time points in these patients revealed identical sequences to those found in the initial reactivation. At the amino acid level, 28 different sequences were identified. Strikingly, the greatest variability in these sequences was found in the region that encoded potential HLA-E-binding peptides (residues 15–23 in the laboratory strain AD169) (Fig. 1, highlighted in black). Notably residue 22 that corresponds to P8, a residue critical for the interaction with CD94-NKG2A, was the most variable, having a Kabat-Wu value of 8, which, although not high compared with values for germ line-encoded complementarity determining regions (CDR) regions of the T cell receptor or Ig genes, is nevertheless comparable with that associated with polymorphisms observed in residues lining the peptide binding pockets of MHC molecules (30Miyasaka T.

Here, we probe the molecular details of the interaction between PrPC and Aβ and discover that substoichiometric amounts of PrPC, as little as 1/20, relative to Aβ will strongly inhibit amyloid fibril formation. This effect is specific to the unstructured N-terminal domain of PrPC. Electron microscopy indicates PrPC is able to trap Aβ in an oligomeric form. Unlike fibers, this oligomeric Aβ contains antiparallel β sheet and binds to a oligomer specific conformational antibody. Our NMR studies show that a specific region of PrPC, notably residues 95–113, binds to Aβ oligomers, but only once Aβ misfolds. The ability of PrPC to trap and concentrate Aβ in an oligomeric form and disassemble mature fibers suggests a mechanism by which PrPC might confer Aβ toxicity in AD, as oligomers are thought to be the toxic form of Aβ. Identification of a specific recognition site on PrPC that traps Aβ in an oligomeric form is potentially a therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.—Younan, N. D., Sarell, C.

Overexpression of AURKA is common in cancer, resulting in acquisition of alternate non-mitotic functions. In the current study, we identified a novel role for AURKA in regulating ovarian cancer cell dissemination and evaluated the efficacy of an AURKA-selective small molecule inhibitor, alisertib (MLN8237), as a single agent and combined with paclitaxel using an orthotopic xenograft model of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Ovarian carcinoma cell lines were used to evaluate the effects of AURKA inhibition and overexpression on migration and adhesion. Pharmacological or RNA interference-mediated inhibition of AURKA significantly reduced ovarian carcinoma cell migration and adhesion and the activation-associated phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal regulatory protein SRC at tyrosine 416 (pSRC(Y416)). Conversely, enforced expression of AURKA resulted in increased migration, adhesion and activation of SRC in cultured cells. In vivo tumor growth and dissemination were inhibited by alisertib treatment as a single agent. Moreover, combination of alisertib with paclitaxel, an agent commonly used in treatment of EOC, resulted in more potent inhibition of tumor growth and dissemination compared with either drug alone. Taken together, these findings support a role for AURKA in EOC dissemination by regulating migration and adhesion. They also point to the potential utility of combining AURKA inhibitors with taxanes as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EOC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2143101243,"Many unicellular tubes such as capillaries form lumens intracellularly, a process that is not well understood. Here we show that the cortical membrane organizer ERM-1 is required to expand the intracellular apical/lumenal membrane and its actin undercoat during single-cell Caenorhabditis elegans excretory canal morphogenesis. We characterize AQP-8, identified in an ERM-1-overexpression (ERM-1[++]) suppressor screen, as a canalicular aquaporin that interacts with ERM-1 in lumen extension in a mercury-sensitive manner, implicating water-channel activity. AQP-8 is transiently recruited to the lumen by ERM-1, co-localizing in peri-lumenal cuffs interspaced along expanding canals. An ERM-1[++]-mediated increase in the number of lumen-associated canaliculi is reversed by AQP-8 depletion. We propose that the ERM-1/AQP-8 interaction propels lumen extension by translumenal flux, suggesting a direct morphogenetic effect of water-channel-regulated fluid pressure. Gobel and colleagues show that the cortical protein ERM-1 drives expansion of the unicellular tube that constitutes the Caenorhabditis elegans excretory canal by recruiting membrane and cytoskeletal components, and the water channel aquaporin, to the apical side of the tube."

By demonstrating the expression of the free fatty acid receptor G-coupled protein receptor 40 (GPR40) in bone cells, we hypothesized that this receptor may play a role in mediating the effects of fatty acids on bone remodeling. Using micro-CT analysis, we showed that GPR40(-/-) mice exhibit osteoporotic features suggesting a positive role of GPR40 on bone density. In primary cultures of bone marrow, we showed that GW9508, a GRP40 agonist, abolished bone-resorbing cell differentiation. This alteration of the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation occurred via the inhibition of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway as demonstrated by decrease in gene reporter activity, inhibitor of κB kinase (IKKα/β) activation, inhibitor of κB (IkBα) phosphorylation, and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) expression. The GPR40-dependent effect of GW9508 was confirmed using shRNA interference in osteoclast precursors and GPR40(-/-) primary cell cultures. In addition, in vivo administration of GW9508 counteracted ovariectomy-induced bone loss in wild-type but not GPR40(-/-) mice, enlightening the obligatory role of the GPR40 receptor. Then, in a context of growing prevalence of metabolic and age-related bone disorders, our results demonstrate for the first time in translational approaches that GPR40 is a relevant target for the design of new nutritional and therapeutic strategies to counter bone complications."
https://openalex.org/W2027756065,"Recent studies suggest that Peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1), in addition to its known H2O2-scavenging function, mediates cell signaling through redox-specific protein–protein interactions. Our data illustrate how Prdx1 specifically coordinates p38MAPK-induced signaling through regulating p38MAPKα phosphatases in an H2O2 dose-dependent manner. MAPK phosphatases (MKP-1 and/or MKP-5), which are known to dephosphorylate and deactivate the senescence-inducing MAPK p38α, belong to a group of redox-sensitive phosphatases (protein tyrosine phosphatases) characterized by a low pKa cysteine in their active sites. We found that Prdx1 bound to both MKP-1 and MKP-5, but dissociated from MKP-1 when the Prdx1 peroxidatic cysteine Cys52 was over-oxidized to sulfonic acid, which in turn resulted in MKP-1 oxidation-induced oligomerization and inactivity toward p38MAPKα. Conversely, over-oxidation of Prdx1-Cys52 was enhancing in the Prdx1:MKP-5 complex with increasing amounts of H2O2 concentrations and correlated with a protection from oxidation-induced oligomerization and inactivation of MKP-5 so that activation toward p38MAPK was maintained. Further examination of this Prdx1-specific mechanism in a model of reactive oxygen species-induced senescence of human breast epithelial cells revealed the specific activation of MKP-5, resulting in decreased p38MAPKα activity. Taken together, our data suggest that Prdx1 orchestrates redox signaling in an H2O2 dose-dependent manner through the oxidation status of its peroxidatic cysteine Cys52."
https://openalex.org/W2060024396,"Glutathionylation has emerged as a key modification required for controlling protein function in response to changes in cell redox status. Recently, we showed that the glutathionylation state of uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) modulates the leak of protons back into the mitochondrial matrix, thus controlling reactive oxygen species production. However, whether or not UCP3 glutathionylation is mediated enzymatically has remained unknown because previous work relied on the use of pharmacological agents, such as diamide, to alter the UCP3 glutathionylation state. Here, we demonstrate that glutaredoxin-2 (Grx2), a matrix oxidoreductase, is required to glutathionylate and inhibit UCP3. Analysis of bioenergetics in skeletal muscle mitochondria revealed that knock-out of Grx2 (Grx2−/−) increased proton leak in a UCP3-dependent manner. These effects were reversed using diamide, a glutathionylation catalyst. Importantly, the increased leak did not compromise coupled respiration. Knockdown of Grx2 augmented proton leak-dependent respiration in primary myotubes from wild type mice, an effect that was absent in UCP3−/− cells. These results confirm that Grx2 deactivates UCP3 by glutathionylation. To our knowledge, this is the first enzyme identified to regulate UCP3 by glutathionylation and is the first study on the role of Grx2 in the regulation of energy metabolism.

Oxidative phosphorylation relies on the potential of various redox pairs and the establishment of a protonmotive force across the mitochondrial inner membrane (1Mitchell P. Coupling of phosphorylation to electron and hydrogen transfer by a chemi-osmotic type of mechanism.Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). Aerobic ATP production is not perfectly coupled to respiration because protons are able to bypass ATP synthase and “leak” back into the matrix. Proton leaks are biologically important, playing different roles in different tissues (e.g. proton leak through uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) is required for brown adipose thermogenesis) (2Himms-Hagen J. Harper M.E. Biochemical aspects of the uncoupling proteins: view from the chair.Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1999; 23: S30-S32Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Uncoupling proteins homologous to UCP1 (i.e. UCP2–5) have been identified in various other tissues and cell types (3Mailloux R.J. Harper M.E.

The rate of ROS production is highly dependent on the polarity of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Thus, even a small decrease in protonmotive force can have a profound impact on ROS production (13Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. High protonic potential actuates a mechanism of production of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria.FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). To this end, leak through UCP3 in skeletal muscle mitochondria could significantly decrease mitochondrial ROS emission (14Bevilacqua L. Ramsey J.J. Hagopian K. Weindruch R. Harper M.E.

Metab. 2005; 289: E429-E438Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, several mechanisms have been described for how UCP3 limits mitochondrial ROS. The prevailing hypothesis is that UCP3 controls ROS by inducing the mild leak of protons back into the mitochondrial matrix (15Mailloux R.J. Harper M.E.

However, other studies have shown that UCP3 functions as a lipid hydroperoxide transporter or calcium uniporter (17Lombardi A. Busiello R.A. Napolitano L. Cioffi F. Moreno M. de Lange P. Silvestri E.

Thus, the mechanism through which UCP3 regulates cell ROS remains enthusiastically debated. In an effort to provide further clarity on this issue, our group recently explored potential redox regulatory mechanisms involved in controlling UCP3 and UCP2 function (15Mailloux R.J. Harper M.E. Mitochondrial proticity and ROS signaling: lessons from the uncoupling proteins.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2012; 23: 451-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). By manipulating the redox environment, we showed that covalent attachment of glutathione to UCP3 and UCP2 inhibits proton leak and that the inhibition is reversed by small increases in mitochondrial ROS (21Mailloux R.J.

These changes in UCP3 glutathionylation status are rapid, indicating that this regulation is required to acutely control ROS production by mitochondria. Moreover, the ROS-mediated deglutathionylation of UCP3 does not even occur when ROS are in millimolar concentrations in vitro. However, ROS are able to deglutathionylate UCP3 in the presence of a cell environment (22Mailloux R.J. Seifert E.L. Bouillaud F. Aguer C. Collins S. Harper M.E.

ROS-induced deglutathionylation has been shown to occur for both actin and succinate dehydrogenase (27Wang J. Boja E.S. Tan W. Tekle E. Fales H.M. English S. Mieyal J.J. Chock P.B.

Chem. 2007; 282: 32640-32654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It would appear that UCP3 is regulated in a similar fashion. Glutathionylation is a redox-sensitive protein modification involving the formation of a disulfide bridge between glutathione and an available protein thiol (29Gallogly M.M. Mieyal J.J. Mechanisms of reversible protein glutathionylation in redox signaling and oxidative stress.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2007; 7: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). It is well established that glutathionylation reactions can proceed nonenzymatically, and a number of different mechanisms for protein glutathionylation (or deglutathionylation) have been proposed (30Mieyal J.J. Gallogly M.M. Qanungo S. Sabens E.A. Shelton M.D. Molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of reversible protein S-glutathionylation.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1941-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Enzymatically catalyzed glutathionylation reactions were first described by Mannervik and Axelsson (31Mannervik B. Axelsson K. Role of cytoplasmic thiol transferase in cellular regulation by thiol-disulphide interchange.Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) who showed that a cytoplasmic thiol transferase was required to reactivate rat liver pyruvate kinase that had earlier been inactivated with glutathione disulfide. This cytoplasmic thiol transferase was later identified as glutaredoxin, an oxidoreductase that is now well documented to mediate glutathionylation reactions (32Papov V.V. Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biemann K. The primary structure and properties of thiol transferase (glutaredoxin) from human red blood cells.Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent work has established that mitochondria contain glutaredoxin-2 (Grx2), a mitochondrial matrix homolog of cytosolic Grx1 that catalyzes (de)glutathionylation reactions (33Gallogly M.M. Starke D.W. Leonberg A.K. Ospina S.M. Mieyal J.J. Kinetic and mechanistic characterization and versatile catalytic properties of mammalian glutaredoxin 2: implications for intracellular roles.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11144-11157Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Few targets for Grx2 have been identified; however, Grx2 has been found to have both glutathionylase and deglutathionylase activities. In this study, we set out to determine whether Grx2 is required to control UCP3 function. We used the newly generated germ line Grx2 knock-out (Grx2−/−) mouse to determine whether Grx2 can modulate leak through UCP3 (34Wu H. Lin L. Giblin F. Ho Y.S. Lou M.F. Glutaredoxin 2 knockout increases sensitivity to oxidative stress in mouse lens epithelial cells.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 51: 2108-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We found that UCP3 was less glutathionylated and more active in skeletal muscle mitochondria from Grx2−/− mice. Knockdown of Grx2 in primary myotubes increased leak, an effect that was absent in myotubes from UCP3−/− mice. These experiments were performed in parallel with liver mitochondrial preparations, which lack uncoupling proteins. Collectively, our findings indicate that the matrix oxidoreductase Grx2 is required to deactivate proton leak through UCP3. These findings have important implications for an improved understanding of the regulation of proton leak reactions and the control of mitochondrial ROS emission. Studies involved C57BL6 wild type (WT) and Grx2 whole body knock-out (Grx2−/−) mice (on C57BL6 genetic background) and C57Bl6J WT and UCP3 whole body knock-out (UCP3−/−; on C57BLJ6 background) mice. They were fed a standard diet (44.2% carbohydrate, 6.2% fat, 18.6% crude protein; diet T.2018; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) ad libitum. All experiments were performed according to the principles and guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care, and the study was approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Ottawa. Mice were genotyped for the presence or absence of Grx2 and UCP3 prior to experimentation and myoblast purification. All experiments were performed on male mice between 9 and 12 weeks of age. Mice were housed individually in a customized Oxymax open circuit indirect calorimeter chambers (Columbus Instruments) and given free access to food and water. Mice were supplied with air at 0.5 liters/min, maintained at room temperature (22–23 °C), and subjected to a standard light-dark cycle (light 6:00–18:00 and dark 18:00–6:00). Mouse activity was measured by counting the number of laser beam breaks (x and y axis). All measurements were conducted over a 24-h period. Concentrations of O2 and CO2 were measured in each chamber for 60 s every 4 min with a sample line-purge time of 2 min. The respiratory exchange ratio was calculated as VCO2/VO2. Mouse activity was calculated as total number of laser beam breaks (x axis plus y axis) during both light and dark cycles. WT and Grx2−/− mice underwent an overnight fast and were weighed and then sacrificed the following morning. Following serum collection, the weights of gonadal white adipose tissue, interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), gastrocnemius muscle, heart, kidneys, and liver were determined. Serum was flash-frozen for later analysis of circulating glucose (Sigma glucose oxidase kit), free fatty acids (Biovision), and triglycerides (Biovision). All assays were conducted according to the manufacturers' instructions. Serum was also used for HPLC analysis of GSH and GSSG content. Prior to HPLC, serum was diluted 10-fold. Skeletal muscle and liver mitochondria were isolated as described previously (11Mailloux R.J. Dumouchel T. Aguer C. deKemp R. Beanlands R. Harper M.E.

All buffers were supplemented with 10 mm pyruvate and 2 mm malate or 10 mm succinate and filtered prior to use. All steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. For muscle mitochondria, forelimb, hindlimb, and pectoral muscle were extracted and placed immediately in basic medium (BM: 140 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0). Muscle was then cleaned of connective tissue and fat, weighed, and then placed in fresh BM. The muscle was minced on a Teflon board and placed in homogenization medium (BM + 1 mm ATP, 1 unit of subtilisin A, 1% w/v defatted BSA). Tissue was homogenized using a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder and then centrifuged at 800 × g for 9 min to remove any undisrupted tissue. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 9 min. The pellet was resuspended in ∼1 ml of BM and incubated on ice for 5 min for myofibrillar repolymerization. Following the removal of the myofibers by centrifugation at 800 × g for 9 min, the supernatant was centrifuged again at 12,000 × g to generate a mitochondrial pellet. Livers were washed in liver medium (LM: 70 mm sucrose, 220 mm mannitol, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm HEPES, 1% w/v defatted BSA, pH 7.2) and then cut into small pieces. Following three more washes in LM, the pieces were minced on a Teflon plate, placed in fresh LM, and homogenized as described above. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 800 × g for 9 min to remove undisrupted tissue. The supernatant was then collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 9 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in ∼2 ml of LM. Prior to resuspension, the inside of the centrifugation tube was wiped to remove any fat. The volume was then brought to 30 ml with LM, and the resuspended mitochondria were incubated on ice for 10 min. The suspension was then centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 9 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in BSA-free LM. For all experiments, mitochondria were kept on ice no longer than 2 h. If mitochondria were not being used for activity assays or bioenergetic determinations, they were treated immediately with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, an alkylating agent that prevents spontaneous modification of reactive cysteine residues, final concentration of 25 mm). Mitochondrial protein content was determined using the Bradford assay. Isolated mitochondria were studied in the Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences; North Billerica, MA) using a method adapted from Ref. 35Rogers G.W. Brand M.D. Petrosyan S.

Mitochondria were diluted to 0.2 mg/ml in BSA-free BM or LM, and 50 μl of suspension (10 μg of mitochondria) was then loaded into Seahorse tissue culture (TC) plate wells. TC plates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to attach mitochondria to the plastic. Mitochondria adhere well to the surface due to the chemical properties of the plastic (35Rogers G.W.

Following the centrifugation, 350 μl of reaction buffer (LM containing 10 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% w/v defatted BSA) was added to each well giving a final volume of 400 μl. Following a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, plates were loaded into the XF24 Analyzer for bioenergetic analyses. Assay conditions were optimized as recommended previously (35Rogers G.W. Brand M.D. Petrosyan S. Ashok D. Elorza A.A. Ferrick D.A. Murphy A.N. High throughput microplate respiratory measurements using minimal quantities of isolated mitochondria.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e21746Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). For bioenergetic determinations, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was first determined under state 2 conditions (presence of substrate only, 10 mm pyruvate, and 2 mm malate or 10 mm succinate). ADP (0.1 mm), oligomycin (2.5 μg/ml; ATP synthase inhibitor), FCCP (8 μm; chemical uncoupler), and antimycin A (4 μm; complex III inhibitor) were then sequentially injected to test state 3, state 4 (proton leak-dependent respiration), maximal respiration, and respiration independent of the respiratory chain, respectively. When succinate was used as a substrate, rotenone (1 μm) was included in the reaction medium to prevent reverse electron transfer and ROS genesis by complex I. To test the contribution of ANT to proton leak-dependent respiration, following measurement of state 3 respiration, mitochondria were sequentially treated with oligomycin, carboxyatractyloside (5 μm; inhibits leak through ANT (36Bevilacqua L.

Absence of uncoupling protein-3 leads to greater activation of an adenine nucleotide translocase-mediated proton conductance in skeletal muscle mitochondria from calorie-restricted mice.Biochim.

For all measurements of OCR, the measurement interval was 3 min, which included a 1-min mix, and a 2-min measure. All respiration values were corrected by subtracting OCR values independent of aerobic respiration (antimycin A OCR). Note that OCR values were also corrected for background OCR using Seahorse XF24 software. To validate our protocol, we compared OCR data for liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria derived from a Clark-type oxygen electrode and the above-described Seahorse method. The Clark-type oxygen electrode was a Hansatech Oxytherm unit (Hansatech; Norfolk, UK). Reaction buffer (same used in Seahorse) was warmed for 5 min in the electrode chamber followed by the addition of mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml final protein concentration). To test mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (RCR), following the establishment of state 2 respiration, mitochondria were titrated with ADP (up to 0.5 mm final concentration). For mitochondrial integrity tests, after the establishment of state 3 respiration, cytochrome c was added incrementally up to a final concentration of 10 μm. Essentially, if cytochrome c elevates respiration, this indicates that mitochondrial outer membrane integrity has been compromised during mitochondrial preparation. For all experiments, antimycin A was added as a control. Seahorse assays were conducted in the same manner. State 2 was measured; ADP was injected up to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to obtain state 3, and antimycin A (4 μm) was injected to determine nonmitochondrial respiration. To determine whether the attachment of mitochondria to TC plates compromised mitochondrial integrity, we first measured state 2, injected ADP (0.1 mm), then titrated in cytoch"
https://openalex.org/W2017141924,"X-ray synchrotron microtomography has revealed the three-dimensional vertebral architecture of Ichthyostega, and other crucial and celebrated early tetrapods; a surprising feature is the relationship between the vertebral elements, with the pleurocentra unexpectedly attached to the succeeding intercentrum, suggesting a ‘reverse’ rhachitomous design. A backbone of interlocking vertebrae is a prerequisite for a tetrapod — a vertebrate living on land. Skeletal details in fossils of the very earliest tetrapods, however, are very hard to make out, as they are often swathed in rocky matrix. This inconvenience has now been overcome by the application of the latest synchrotron microtomography technology to the three best-known early tetrapods — Ichthyostega, Acanthostega and Pederpes. Early tetrapods were presumed to have had 'rhachitomous' vertebrae, with a neural arch and spine above, a single intercentrum front and ventral, and paired pleurocentra to the rear and ventral. Surprisingly, the new scans reveal a 'reverse' rhachitomous design, effectively rewriting the 'textbook' view of vertebral column evolution in the first limbed vertebrates. The construction of the vertebral column has been used as a key anatomical character in defining and diagnosing early tetrapod groups1. Rhachitomous vertebrae2—in which there is a dorsally placed neural arch and spine, an anteroventrally placed intercentrum and paired, posterodorsally placed pleurocentra—have long been considered the ancestral morphology for tetrapods1,3,4,5,6. Nonetheless, very little is known about vertebral anatomy in the earliest stem tetrapods, because most specimens remain trapped in surrounding matrix, obscuring important anatomical features7,8,9. Here we describe the three-dimensional vertebral architecture of the Late Devonian stem tetrapod Ichthyostega using propagation phase-contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography. Our scans reveal a diverse array of new morphological, and associated developmental and functional, characteristics, including a possible posterior-to-anterior vertebral ossification sequence and the first evolutionary appearance of ossified sternal elements. One of the most intriguing features relates to the positional relationships between the vertebral elements, with the pleurocentra being unexpectedly sutured or fused to the intercentra that directly succeed them, indicating a ‘reverse’ rhachitomous design10. Comparison of Ichthyostega with two other stem tetrapods, Acanthostega7 and Pederpes8, shows that reverse rhachitomous vertebrae may be the ancestral condition for limbed vertebrates. This study fundamentally revises our current understanding11 of vertebral column evolution in the earliest tetrapods and raises questions about the presumed vertebral architecture of tetrapodomorph fish12,13 and later, more crownward, tetrapods."
https://openalex.org/W2052828854,"Misfolded proteins present an escalating deleterious challenge to cells over the course of their lifetime. One mechanism the cell possesses to prevent misfolded protein accumulation is their destruction by protein quality control (PQC) degradation systems. In eukaryotes, PQC degradation typically proceeds via multiple ubiquitin-protein ligases that act throughout the cell to ubiquitinate misfolded proteins for proteasome degradation. What the exact feature of misfolding that each PQC ubiquitin-protein ligase recognizes in their substrates remains an open question. Our previous studies of the budding yeast nuclear ubiquitin-protein ligase San1 indicated that it recognizes exposed hydrophobicity within its substrates, with the threshold of hydrophobicity equivalent to that of 5 contiguous hydrophobic residues. Here, we uncover an additional parameter: the nature of the exposed hydrophobicity that confers San1-mediated degradation correlates with significant protein insolubility. San1 particularly targets exposed hydrophobicity that leads to insolubility and aggregation above a certain threshold. Our studies presented here provide additional insight into the details of misfolded nuclear protein recognition and demonstrate that there is selectivity for the type of exposed hydrophobicity.

Our studies presented here provide additional insight into the details of misfolded nuclear protein recognition and demonstrate that there is selectivity for the type of exposed hydrophobicity. The continuous stochastic production of misfolded proteins is a problem faced by all cells. Proteins that have lost their native structures expose hydrophobicity that is normally buried within the core of their structures. The exposed hydrophobicity can lead to protein insolubility and the formation of intracellular aggregates (1Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Aggregate formation and the long term cellular persistence of aggregates are thought to be the underlying causes of many devastating human pathologies including Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (2Wang S.S. Wu J.W. Yamamoto S. Liu H.S. Diseases of protein aggregation and the hunt for potential pharmacological agents.Biotechnol. J. 2008; 3: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Due to the deleterious nature of misfolded proteins, cells have evolved several mechanisms to prevent their accumulation. One central means is the elimination of misfolded proteins via protein quality control (PQC)2 degradation. Eukaryotic PQC degradation is generally mediated by ubiquitin-protein ligases that ubiquitinate misfolded proteins for subsequent proteasome degradation (3Fredrickson E.K. Gardner R.G.

Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that the compartment-specific PQC ligases are, for the most part, not functionally redundant. The lack of functional redundancy suggests that each PQC ubiquitin-protein ligase might recognize a unique feature of misfolding in its substrates. This likely depends upon the specific cellular compartment and the spatial organization of the PQC ligases within that compartment. With this consideration in mind, it remains an open question as to which feature(s) of misfolding an individual PQC ubiquitin-protein ligase targets. If each PQC ligase recognizes exposed hydrophobicity, are the extent of exposed hydrophobicity, the types of hydrophobic residues, and/or the context in which the hydrophobicity is presented different for each PQC ligase? To answer these questions, we require detailed information as to what each individual PQC ubiquitin-protein ligase recognizes in its misfolded substrates. We have been probing this by exploring the features of misfolding recognized by the yeast nuclear PQC ubiquitin-protein ligase San1. Recently, we found that San1 targets exposed hydrophobicity in its substrates, with a minimal window of 5 exposed hydrophobic residues necessary for substrate recognition by San1 (27Fredrickson E.K. Rosenbaum J.C. Locke M.N. Milac T.I. Gardner R.G. Exposed hydrophobicity is a key determinant of nuclear quality control degradation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 2384-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here, we find that San1 prefers particular types of hydrophobic residues within that window, and this preference can be explained by the strength of the residues' ability to cause insolubility and aggregation.

Cells were grown in liquid synthetic medium with 3% raffinose to a culture density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml. Galactose was added (final concentration of 3%), and cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. 4 ml of cells was harvested and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) + PMSF by vortexing 5 min at 4 °C with 100 μl of 0.5-mm acid-washed glass beads. To remove unlysed cells, lysates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of lysate, representing the “total lysate,” was removed and added to 50 μl of SUMEB. Remaining lysate was centrifuged at 12,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 100 μl of supernatant, representing the “soluble fraction,” was added to 100 μl of SUMEB. The pellet, representing the “insoluble fraction,” was resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer plus 100 μl of SUMEB. All samples were incubated at 65 °C for 10 min and then clarified for 5 min by centrifugation at 12,800 × g. Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibodies. The soluble fractions generated from the solubility assays, with or without SDS (final concentration of 2%) added to the loading buffer, were loaded onto 8–16% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Lonza Rockland Inc). Running buffer was 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine. Gels were run at 4 °C. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibodies. Cells (san1Δ DBP5-dsRed) that expressed each GFPNLS-peptide fusion protein were grown at 30 °C in 3% raffinose medium to ∼ 0.5 × 107 cells/ml. Galactose was added (final concentration of 3%), and the cells were incubated for 8 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sucrose for 15 min, washed in wash buffer (1.2 m sorbitol, 0.4 m KPO4), stained with DAPI for 10 min in wash buffer plus 2% Triton X-100, and washed two times in wash buffer. Cells were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope with a 100× objective, filters for GFP (excitation wavelength (450–490 nm), dichroic mirror (495 nm), and emission filter (500–550 nm)), DAPI-stained DNA (excitation wavelength (325–375 nm), dichroic mirror (400 nm), and emission filter (435–485 nm)), and dsRed (excitation wavelength (540–580 nm), dichroic mirror (585 nm), and emission filter (593–668 nm)), and a Photometrics Cool Snap HQ2 cooled CCD camera with NIS-Elements acquisition software. Western blots were scanned using an Epson Perfection V350 Photo scanner at 300 dpi. All images were processed with a Mac iMac or Pro computer (Apple) using Photoshop CS (Adobe). Decay curves for degradation assays and quantification for solubility assays were determined using ImageJ. Previously, we found that San1 recognizes short hydrophobic peptides as degrons when fused to reporter proteins such as GFP possessing a nuclear localization sequence (GFPNLS) or the Gal4 activating domain used in two-hybrid analyses (27Fredrickson E.K. Rosenbaum J.C. Locke M.N. Milac T.I. Gardner R.G. Exposed hydrophobicity is a key determinant of nuclear quality control degradation.Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2011; 41: 93-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although the peptide degrons are not misfolded proteins by themselves, they likely allow San1 recognition of the reporter proteins by mimicking the feature San1 recognizes in a misfolded protein, exposed hydrophobicity. As such, we can use these small peptides in a controlled way to determine the biochemical parameters of the exposed hydrophobicity that leads to San1 targeting. In our previous study exploring the minimal number of contiguous hydrophobic residues in the peptide degrons necessary for San1-mediated degradation, we found ≥5 contiguous hydrophobic residues were required in the peptide for recognition by San1 and ≤4 contiguous hydrophobic residues were insufficient (Ref. 27Fredrickson E.K. Rosenbaum J.C. Locke M.N. Milac T.I. Gardner R.G. Exposed hydrophobicity is a key determinant of nuclear quality control degradation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 2384-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). Intrigued by this sharp delineation, we wanted to understand the biochemical nature of this limit. Because insolubility and aggregate formation are detrimental results of protein misfolding, we examined the in vivo solubility of GFPNLS-peptide fusions containing 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 contiguous hydrophobic residues. We found that the threshold for San1-mediated degradation, ≥5 contiguous hydrophobic residues, correlated with the GFPNLS-peptide fusions becoming highly insoluble (Fig. 1B). The GFPNLS-peptide fusions containing ≤4 contiguous hydrophobic residues were largely soluble (Fig. 1B). The GFPNLS-peptide fusion proteins present in the insoluble fraction are likely part of large inclusions because this fraction represents the cellular debris that pellets at 12,800 × g. Therefore, we also examined whether the GFPNLS-peptide fusions in the soluble fraction formed high molecular mass species typical of aggregates using nondenaturing PAGE (32Lefebvre B.G. Comolli N.K. Gage M.J. Robinson A.S.

Similar to the solubility assays, we found that the GFPNLS-peptide fusions with ≥5 contiguous hydrophobic residues formed mostly higher molecular mass species compared with the GFPNLS-peptide fusions with ≤4 contiguous hydrophobic residues that ran primarily as monomers (Fig. 1C, left). These higher molecular mass species were sensitive to the addition of SDS to the loading buffer (Fig. 1C, right), indicating that they are likely not SDS-insensitive amyloids (34Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. Yeast [PSI+] prion aggregates are formed by small Sup35 polymers fragmented by Hsp104.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Finally, we examined whether the GFPNLS-peptide fusions formed visible cellular inclusions in vivo. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that the GFPNLS-peptide fusions with ≥5 contiguous hydrophobic residues were predominantly nuclear localized and formed a single visible inclusion in the nucleus (Fig. 1D), indicating that they do aggregate in vivo. By contrast, the GFPNLS-peptide fusions with ≤4 contiguous hydrophobic residues showed more uniform localization throughout the cell, although there was some enrichment in the nucleus (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, there was no inclusion formation in cells expressing the ≤4 contiguous hydrophobic residue GFPNLS-peptide fusions (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with their solubility and lack of aggregate formation (Fig. 1, B and C). The difference in overall cellular localization between the GFPNLS-peptide fusions with ≥5 contiguous hydrophobic residues, which primarily localize to the nucleus, and the GFPNLS-peptide fusions with ≤4 contiguous hydrophobic residues, which localize throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, is likely due to the aggregated versus monomeric state of the GFPNLS-peptide fusion in relation to the passive diffusion limit of the yeast nuclear pore. The GFPNLS-peptide fusions are ∼30 kDa in size and thus have a monomeric molecular mass below the passive <40-kDa diffusion limit of the yeast nuclear pore (35Shulga N. Goldfarb D.S. Binding dynamics of structural nucleoporins govern nuclear pore complex permeability and may mediate channel gating.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Shulga N. Mosammaparast N. Wozniak R. Goldfarb D.S. Yeast nucleoporins involved in passive nuclear envelope permeability.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the GFPNLS-peptide fusions with ≥5 contiguous residues share the same monomeric molecular mass as those with ≤4 contiguous residues, the formation of an aggregate with ≥2 molecules in the nucleus would render an aggregate above the size of the nuclear pore passive diffusion limit. Thus, all of the GFPNLS-peptide fusions can be trafficked into the nucleus via classic NLS-dependent import, but the GFPNLS-peptide fusions with ≥5 contiguous hydrophobic residues cannot passively diffuse back into the cytoplasm as can the GFPNLS-peptide fusions with ≤4 contiguous hydrophobic residues. Altogether from the combined solubility, nondenaturing PAGE, and microscopy results, it appears that San1 recognizes exposed hydrophobicity that crosses a particular threshold of insolubility. This threshold coincides with aggregation and inclusion formation in the nucleus. This intriguing result prompted further experiments to dissect the parameters of the hydrophobicity nature of a San1 substrate. Hydrophobicity is a general term that encompasses multiple amino acids. Algorithms have been developed that score amino acid residues either on their hydrophobicity, such as the well known Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy algorithm (37Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. A simple method for displaying the hydropathic character of a protein.J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17199) Google Scholar), or their propensity to occur in protein regions prone to aggregation, such as the AGGRESCAN algorithm (38Conchillo-Solé O. de Groot N.S. Avilés F.X. Vendrell J. Daura X. Ventura S. AGGRESCAN: a server for the prediction and evaluation of “hot spots” of aggregation in polypeptides.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, A and B, we have ranked the different hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity scores for each amino acid residue according to Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy or AGGRESCAN measures. Because 5 contiguous hydrophobic residues are the minimal feature recognized by San1 (Fig. 1), we wanted to examine the ability of homopentameric amino acid stretches to function as San1 degrons. Our initial prediction was that homopentameric stretches of the most hydrophobic residues (Ile, Val, Leu, and Phe) would allow San1-mediated degradation, and there might be variability with homopentameric stretches of lesser hydrophobic residues (Tyr, Trp, Met, and Ala). In actuality, the results differed unexpectedly from our predictions. When we examined the degradation of each hompentameric GFPNLS-peptide fusion, we found three distinct groups. The first group consisted of 5Phe and 5Ile stretches, which were degraded primarily in a San1-dependent manner as we predicted (Fig. 2C). The second group was composed of 5Leu, 5Val, and 5Ala stretches, which were degraded, but in a primarily San1-independent manner (Fig. 2D). This was surprising as we had anticipated that the 5Leu and 5Val stretches, which are highly hydrophobic by both scoring measures (Fig. 2, A and B), would cause San1-mediated degradation similar to the 5Ile and 5Phe stretches. The final group encompassed 5Tyr, 5Met, and 5Trp stretches, which were stable (Fig. 2E). The correlation between San1-mediated degradation and the insolubility of the original GFPNLS-peptide fusions (Fig. 1B) prompted us to examine the insolubility of each homopentameric GFPNLS-peptide fusion. As expected from their San1-mediated degradation, the 5Ile and 5Phe GFPNLS-peptide fusions showed the highest levels of insolubility (Fig. 2C). Also as expected from their complete stability, the 5Tyr, 5Met, and 5Trp GFPNLS-peptide fusions were primarily soluble (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, the 5Leu, 5Val, and 5Ala GFPNLS-peptide fusions showed a range of solubilities from complete or near complete solubility (5Ala and 5Val) to insolubility close to that observed with 5Ile (5Leu) (Fig. 2D). Given the variability in the insolubility of the homopentameric GFPNLS-peptide fusions, we further characterized the fusions using fluorescence microscopy because this parameter separated San1 substrates from nonsubstrates by the propensity for in vivo inclusion formation. As expected from their San1-dependent degradation and large degree of insolubility, the 5Ile and 5Phe GFPNLS-pept"

One such process, angiogenesis, is required for tumor growth and metastasis, and many new cancer therapies are therefore directed against the tumor vasculature. Using an in vitro co-culture endothelial cord formation assay, a surrogate of angiogenesis, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK in growth factor- and tumor-driven angiogenesis using LY2228820 dimesylate treatment and by shRNA gene knockdown. p38 MAPK was activated in endothelial cells upon growth factor stimulation, with inhibition by LY2228820 dimesylate treatment causing a significant decrease in VEGF-, bFGF-, EGF-, and IL-6-induced endothelial cord formation and an even more dramatic decrease in tumor-driven cord formation. In addition to involvement in downstream cytokine signaling, p38 MAPK was important for VEGF, bFGF, EGF, IL-6, and other proangiogenic cytokine secretion in stromal and tumor cells. LY2228820 dimesylate results were substantiated using p38α MAPK-specific shRNA and shRNA against the downstream p38 MAPK effectors MAPKAPK-2 and HSP27. Using in vivo models of functional neoangiogenesis, LY2228820 dimesylate treatment reduced hemoglobin content in a plug assay and decreased VEGF-A-stimulated vascularization in a mouse ear model. Thus, p38α MAPK is implicated in tumor angiogenesis through direct tumoral effects and through reduction of proangiogenic cytokine secretion via the microenvironment."

https://openalex.org/W2044678751,"Understanding tumor-induced angiogenesis is a challenging problem with important consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In this study, we define a novel function for epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP2) in the control of angiogenesis. EMP2 functions as an oncogene in endometrial cancer, and its expression has been linked to decreased survival. Using endometrial cancer xenografts, modulation of EMP2 expression resulted in profound changes to the tumor microvasculature. Under hypoxic conditions, upregulation of EMP2 promoted vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) expression through a HIF-1α-dependent pathway and resulted in successful capillary-like tube formation. In contrast, reduction of EMP2 correlated with reduced HIF-1α and VEGF expression with the net consequence of poorly vascularized tumors in vivo. We have previously shown that targeting of EMP2 using diabodies in endometrial cancer resulted in a reduction of tumor load, and since then we have constructed a fully human EMP2 IgG1. Treatment of endometrial cancer cells with EMP2-IgG1 reduced tumor load with a significant improvement in survival. These results support the role of EMP2 in the control of the tumor microenvironment and confirm the cytotoxic effects observed by EMP2 treatment in vivo."

To gain insight into its mechanism of action, we performed chemogenomic screens in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene-deletion strain collection, identifying edelfosine-resistant mutants. LEM3, AGP2, and DOC1 genes were required for drug uptake. Edelfosine displaced the essential proton pump Pma1p from rafts, inducing its internalization into the vacuole. Additional ATLs, including miltefosine and perifosine, also displaced Pma1p from rafts to the vacuole, suggesting that this process is a major hallmark of ATL cytotoxicity in yeast. Radioactive and synthetic fluorescent edelfosine analogues accumulated in yeast plasma membrane rafts and subsequently the endoplasmic reticulum. Although both edelfosine and Pma1p were initially located at membrane rafts, internalization of the drug toward endoplasmic reticulum and Pma1p to the vacuole followed different routes. Drug internalization was not dependent on endocytosis and was not critical for yeast cytotoxicity. However, mutants affecting endocytosis, vesicle sorting, or trafficking to the vacuole, including the retromer and ESCRT complexes, prevented Pma1p internalization and were edelfosine-resistant. Our data suggest that edelfosine-induced cytotoxicity involves raft reorganization and retromer- and ESCRT-mediated vesicular transport and degradation of essential raft proteins leading to cell death. Cytotoxicity of ATLs is mainly dependent on the changes they induce in plasma membrane raft-located proteins that lead to their internalization and subsequent degradation.

https://openalex.org/W1984475561,"The progression of cancer from localized to invasive disease is requisite for metastasis, and is often characterized by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and alterations in cellular adhesion and migration. Studies have shown that this transition is associated with an upregulation of embryonic stem cell-associated genes, resulting in a dedifferentiated phenotype and poor patient prognosis. Nodal is an embryonic factor that plays a critical role in promoting early invasive events during development. Nodal is silenced as stem cells differentiate; however, it re-emerges in adult life during placentation and mammary gland development, and is aberrantly expressed in many cancers. Here, we show that Nodal overexpression, in poorly invasive breast cancer and choriocarcinoma cells, causes increased invasion and migration in vitro. Furthermore, we show that Nodal overexpression in these epithelial cancer types induces an EMT-like event concomitant with the internalization of E-Cadherin. This ability of Nodal to promote cellular invasion and EMT-like phenomena is dependent upon the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. As Nodal normally signals through SMADs, these findings lend insight into an alternative pathway that is hijacked by this protein in cancer. To evaluate the clinical implications of our results, we show that Nodal inhibition reduces liver tumor burden in a model of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis in vivo, and that Nodal loss-of-function in aggressive breast cancer lines results in a decrease in invasive phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that Nodal is involved in promoting invasion in multiple cellular contexts, and that Nodal inhibition may be useful as a therapeutic target for patients with progressive disease."
https://openalex.org/W2021483451,"Little is known about chromatin mechanisms that regulate tumor-initiating cells that are proposed to be responsible for tumor recurrence and relapse. We have previously shown that Pygopus 2 (Pygo2), a chromatin effector and context-dependent Wnt signaling coactivator, regulates mammary gland development by expanding epithelial stem/progenitor cells. However, the role of Pygo2 in mammary tumorigenesis in vivo remains to be addressed. In this study, we show that epithelia-specific ablation of Pygo2 in MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice results in delayed mammary ductal elongation, but the hyperbranching phenotype, aberrant accumulation of stem/progenitor-like cells, and canonical Wnt signaling output are largely unaffected. Chronic loss of Pygo2 significantly delays mammary tumor onset in MMTV-Wnt1 females, whereas acute deletion of Pygo2 in MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells leads to a significant decrease in their tumor-initiating capability upon transplantation. Finally, we provide evidence supporting a role for Pygo2 in modulating the lineage potential of MMTV-Wnt1 tumor initiating cells. Collectively, our results suggest that Pygo2 acts at a step downstream of mammary stem cell accumulation to facilitate transformation, and that it regulates the tumor initiating capacity and lineage preference of the already transformed mammary cells, in MMTV-Wnt1 mice. These findings offer valuable insights into our understanding of the molecular basis of heterogeneity within breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1979156973,"Overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB2 (also known as HER2) occurs in around 15% of breast cancers and is driven by amplification of the ERBB2 gene. ERBB2 amplification is a marker of poor prognosis, and although anti-ERBB2-targeted therapies have shown significant clinical benefit, de novo and acquired resistance remains an important problem. Genomic profiling has demonstrated that ERBB2+ve breast cancers are distinguished from ER+ve and ‘triple-negative’ breast cancers by harbouring not only the ERBB2 amplification on 17q12, but also a number of co-amplified genes on 17q12 and amplification events on other chromosomes. Some of these genes may have important roles in influencing clinical outcome, and could represent genetic dependencies in ERBB2+ve cancers and therefore potential therapeutic targets. Here, we describe an integrated genomic, gene expression and functional analysis to determine whether the genes present within amplicons are critical for the survival of ERBB2+ve breast tumour cells. We show that only a fraction of the ERBB2-amplified breast tumour lines are truly addicted to the ERBB2 oncogene at the mRNA level and display a heterogeneous set of additional genetic dependencies. These include an addiction to the transcription factor gene TFAP2C when it is amplified and overexpressed, suggesting that TFAP2C represents a genetic dependency in some ERBB2+ve breast cancer cells."

Previously, we identified several molecules, including 14-3-3 proteins, as Syx-interacting partners. In the present study, we show that 14-3-3 isoforms interact with Syx at both its N- and C-terminal regions in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. We identify the protein kinase D-mediated phosphorylation of serine 92 on Syx, and additional phosphorylation at serine 938, as critical sites for 14-3-3 association. Our data indicate that the binding of 14-3-3 proteins inhibits the GEF activity of Syx. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation-deficient, 14-3-3-uncoupled Syx exhibits increased junctional targeting and increased GEF activity, resulting in the strengthening of the circumferential junctional actin ring in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. These findings reveal a novel means of regulating junctional Syx localization and function by phosphorylation-induced 14-3-3 binding and further support the importance of Syx function in maintaining stable cell-cell contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2127386684,"β-Site amyloid precursor protein convertase enzyme 1 (BACE1), a type I transmembrane aspartyl protease required to cleave amyloid precursor protein for releasing a toxic amyloid peptide, also cleaves type I and type III neuregulin-1 (Nrg-1). BACE1 deficiency in mice causes hypomyelination during development and impairs remyelination if injured. In BACE1-null mice, the abolished cleavage of neuregulin-1 by BACE1 is speculated to cause reduced myelin sheath thickness in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system because reduced cleavage of Nrg-1 correlates with reduced Akt phosphorylation, a downstream signaling molecule of the Nrg-1/ErbB pathway. Here we tested specifically whether increasing Akt activity alone in oligodendrocytes would be sufficient to reverse the hypomyelination phenotype in BACE1-null mice. BACE1-null mice were bred with transgenic mice expressing constitutively active Akt (Akt-DD; mutations with D308T and D473S) in oligodendrocytes. Relative to littermate BACE1-null controls, BACE1–/–/Akt-DD mice exhibited enhanced expression of myelin basic protein and promoter of proteolipid protein. The elevated expression of myelin proteins correlated with a thicker myelin sheath in optic nerves; comparison of quantified g ratios with statistic significance was used to confirm this reversion. However, it appeared that myelin sheath thickness in the sciatic nerves was not increased in BACE1–/–/Akt-DD mice, as the g ratio was not significantly different from the control. Hence, increased Akt activity in BACE1-null myelinating cells only compensates for the loss of BACE1 activity in the central nervous system, which is consistent with the observation that overexpression of Akt-DD in Schwann cells did not induce hypermyelination. Our results suggest that signaling activity other than Akt may also contribute to proper myelination in peripheral nerves.—Hu, X., Schlanger, R., He, W., Macklin, W. B., Yan, R.

Unlike differentiated cells, adult stem cells are intrinsically resistant to senescence. It is unclear how adult stem cells in solid organs respond to oncogenic stimulation and whether these cells have a role in tumor initiation. We report here that expression of BRAF(V600E) in human neural crest progenitor cells (hNCPCs) did not induce growth arrest as seen in human melanocytes, but instead, increased their cell proliferation capacity. These cells (hNCPCs(V600E)) acquired anchorage-independent growth ability and were weakly tumorigenic in vivo. Unlike in human melanocytes, BRAF(V600E) expression in hNCPCs did not induce p16(INK4a) expression. BRAF(V600E) induced elevated expression of CDK2, CDK4, MITF and EST1/2 protein in hNCPCs, and also induced melanocytic differentiation of these cells. Furthermore, overexpression of MITF in hNCPCs(V600E) dramatically increased their tumorigenicity and resulted in fully transformed tumor cells. These findings indicate that hNCPCs are susceptible to BRAF(V600E)-induced transformation, and MITF potentiates the oncogenic effect of BRAF(V600E) in these progenitor cells. These results suggest that the hNCPCs are potential targets for BRAF(V600E)-induced melanocytic tumor formation."
