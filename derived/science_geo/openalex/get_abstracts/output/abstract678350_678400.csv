https://openalex.org/W3186114398,"CoronaVac, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, has been approved for emergency use in several countries. However, its immunogenicity in immunocompromised individuals has not been well established. We initiated a prospective phase 4 controlled trial (no. NCT04754698, CoronavRheum) in 910 adults with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) and 182 age- and sex-frequency-matched healthy adults (control group, CG), who received two doses of CoronaVac. The primary outcomes were reduction of ≥15% in both anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion (SC) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) positivity 6 weeks (day 69 (D69)) after the second dose in the ARD group compared with that in the CG. Secondary outcomes were IgG SC and NAb positivity at D28, IgG titers and neutralizing activity at D28 and D69 and vaccine safety. Prespecified endpoints were met, with lower anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG SC (70.4 versus 95.5%, P < 0.001) and NAb positivity (56.3 versus 79.3%, P < 0.001) at D69 in the ARD group than in the CG. Moreover, IgG titers (12.1 versus 29.7, P < 0.001) and median neutralization activity (58.7 versus 64.5%, P = 0.013) were also lower at D69 in patients with ARD. At D28, patients with ARD presented with lower IgG frequency (18.7 versus 34.6%, P < 0.001) and NAb positivity (20.6 versus 36.3%, P < 0.001) than that of the CG. There were no moderate/severe adverse events. These data support the use of CoronaVac in patients with ARD, suggesting reduced but acceptable short-term immunogenicity. The trial is still ongoing to evaluate the long-term effectiveness/immunogenicity. In a large prospective phase 4 trial, vaccination with CoronaVac, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, elicited significantly lower virus-specific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases than in age- and sex-matched healthy control trial participants."
https://openalex.org/W3184003964,"Memory B cell reserves can generate protective antibodies against repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections, but with unknown reach from original infection to antigenically drifted variants. We charted memory B cell receptor-encoded antibodies from 19 COVID-19 convalescent subjects against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and found seven major antibody competition groups against epitopes recurrently targeted across individuals. Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of antibody-S complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated with cross-CoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody signatures. Although emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern escaped binding by many members of the groups associated with the most potent neutralizing activity, some antibodies in each of those groups retained affinity—suggesting that otherwise redundant components of a primary immune response are important for durable protection from evolving pathogens. Our results furnish a global atlas of S-specific memory B cell repertoires and illustrate properties driving viral escape and conferring robustness against emerging variants."

Objective Apply machine learning for the prediction and identification of factors associated with short and long-term mortality in Asian STEMI patients and compare with a conventional risk score. Methods The National Cardiovascular Disease Database for Malaysia registry, of a multi-ethnic, heterogeneous Asian population was used for in-hospital (6299 patients), 30-days (3130 patients), and 1-year (2939 patients) model development. 50 variables were considered. Mortality prediction was analysed using feature selection methods with machine learning algorithms and compared to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score. Invasive management of varying degrees was selected as important variables that improved mortality prediction. Results Model performance using a complete and reduced variable produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 0.73 to 0.90. The best machine learning model for in-hospital, 30 days, and 1-year outperformed TIMI risk score (AUC = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.846–0.910; vs AUC = 0.81, 95% CI:0.772–0.845, AUC = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.870–0.935; vs AUC = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.746–0.838, AUC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.798–0.872; vs AUC = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.715–0.802, p &lt; 0.0001 for all). TIMI score underestimates patients’ risk of mortality. 90% of non-survival patients are classified as high risk (&gt;50%) by machine learning algorithm compared to 10–30% non-survival patients by TIMI. Common predictors identified for short- and long-term mortality were age, heart rate, Killip class, fasting blood glucose, prior primary PCI or pharmaco-invasive therapy and diuretics. The final algorithm was converted into an online tool with a database for continuous data archiving for algorithm validation. Conclusions In a multi-ethnic population, patients with STEMI were better classified using the machine learning method compared to TIMI scoring. Machine learning allows for the identification of distinct factors in individual Asian populations for better mortality prediction. Ongoing continuous testing and validation will allow for better risk stratification and potentially alter management and outcomes in the future."

Objectives To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of Asthma-Guidance and Prediction System (A-GPS), an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted CDS tool, in optimizing asthma management through a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Methods This was a single-center pragmatic RCT with a stratified randomization design conducted for one year in the primary care pediatric practice of the Mayo Clinic, MN. Children (&lt;18 years) diagnosed with asthma receiving care at the study site were enrolled along with their 42 primary care providers. Study subjects were stratified into three strata (based on asthma severity, asthma care status, and asthma diagnosis) and were blinded to the assigned groups. Measurements Intervention was a quarterly A-GPS report to clinicians including relevant clinical information for asthma management from EHRs and machine learning-based prediction for risk of asthma exacerbation (AE). Primary endpoint was the occurrence of AE within 1 year and secondary outcomes included time required for clinicians to review EHRs for asthma management. Main results Out of 555 participants invited to the study, 184 consented for the study and were randomized (90 in intervention and 94 in control group). Median age of 184 participants was 8.5 years. While the proportion of children with AE in both groups decreased from the baseline (P = 0.042), there was no difference in AE frequency between the two groups (12% for the intervention group vs. 15% for the control group, Odds Ratio: 0.82; 95%CI 0.374–1.96; P = 0.626) during the study period. For the secondary end points, A-GPS intervention, however, significantly reduced time for reviewing EHRs for asthma management of each participant (median: 3.5 min, IQR: 2–5), compared to usual care without A-GPS (median: 11.3 min, IQR: 6.3–15); p&lt;0.001). Mean health care costs with 95%CI of children during the trial (compared to before the trial) in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group (-$1,036 [-$2177, $44] for the intervention group vs. +$80 [-$841, $1000] for the control group), though there was no significant difference (p = 0.12). Among those who experienced the first AE during the study period (n = 25), those in the intervention group had timelier follow up by the clinical care team compared to those in the control group but no significant difference was found (HR = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.82–1.45, P = 0.10). There was no difference in the proportion of duration when patients had well-controlled asthma during the study period between the intervention and the control groups. Conclusions While A-GPS-based intervention showed similar reduction in AE events to usual care, it might reduce clinicians’ burden for EHRs review resulting in efficient asthma management. A larger RCT is needed for further studying the findings. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02865967 ."
https://openalex.org/W3183516508,"As a calcium-activated chloride channel regulated by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and membrane potential, TMEM16A has attracted considerable attention and has been proposed as a novel anticancer drug target. We have previously reported that the pocket above the ion conductance pore could be a nonselective inhibitor-binding pocket. However, whether this pocket is druggable remains unexplored. In this study, we performed virtual screening to target the presumed inhibitor-binding pocket and identified a highly effective TMEM16A inhibitor, theaflavin (TF: a tea polyphenol in black tea). Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that theaflavin adopts a ""wedge insertion mode"" to block the ion conduction pore and induces pore closure. Moreover, the binding mode showed that the TF pedestal plays an important role in pore blockade, and R515, R535, T539, K603, E623, and E633 were determined to be most likely to interact directly with the pedestal. Mutagenesis experiment results corroborated the mechanism through which TF binds to this pocket. Combined with the quantitative calculation results, our data indicated that the three hydroxyl groups on the pedestal may be the most crucial pharmacophores for TMEM16A inhibition by TF. Finally, antitumor experiments revealed that TF could target TMEM16A to inhibit the proliferation and migration of LA795 cells, indicating the potential therapeutic effect of TF on the growth of lung adenocarcinoma with high TMEM16A expression. The successful application of drug screening strategies based on this binding pocket highlights new directions for discovering superior modulators and contributes to the development of novel therapeutics for lung adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W3185712148,"We previously developed single App knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) harboring the Swedish and Beyreuther/Iberian mutations with or without the Arctic mutation (AppNL-G-F and AppNL-F mice, respectively). These models showed Aβ pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment in an age-dependent manner. The former model exhibits extensive pathology as early as 6 months, but is unsuitable for investigating Aβ metabolism and clearance because the Arctic mutation renders Aβ resistant to proteolytic degradation and prone to aggregation. In particular, it is inapplicable to preclinical immunotherapy studies due to its discrete affinity for anti-Aβ antibodies. The latter model may take as long as 18 months for the pathology to become prominent, which leaves an unfulfilled need for an Alzheimer's disease animal model that is both swift to show pathology and useful for antibody therapy. We thus utilized mutant Psen1 knock-in mice into which a pathogenic mutation (P117L) had been introduced to generate a new model that exhibits early deposition of wild-type human Aβ by crossbreeding the AppNL-F line with the Psen1P117L/WT line. We show that the effects of the pathogenic mutations in the App and Psen1 genes are additive or synergistic. This new third-generation mouse model showed more cored plaque pathology and neuroinflammation than AppNL-G-F mice and will help accelerate the development of disease-modifying therapies to treat preclinical AD."
https://openalex.org/W3185494889,"Reduced activity of paraoxonase 1 (PON1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated enzyme, has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis. Post-translational modifications of PON1 may represent important mechanisms leading to reduced PON1 activity. Under atherosclerotic conditions, myeloperoxidase (MPO) is known to associate with HDL. MPO generates the oxidants hypochlorous acid and nitrogen dioxide, which can lead to post-translational modification of PON1, including tyrosine modifications that inhibit PON1 activity. Nitrogen dioxide also drives lipid peroxidation, leading to the formation of reactive lipid dicarbonyls such as malondialdehyde and isolevuglandins, which modify HDL and could inhibit PON1 activity. Because isolevuglandins are more reactive than malondialdehyde, we used in vitro models containing HDL, PON1, and MPO to test the hypothesis that IsoLG formation by MPO and its subsequent modification of HDL contributes to MPO-mediated reductions in PON1 activity. Incubation of MPO with HDL led to modification of HDL proteins, including PON1, by IsoLG. Incubation of HDL with IsoLG reduced PON1 lactonase and antiperoxidation activities. IsoLG modification of recombinant PON1 markedly inhibited its activity, while irreversible IsoLG modification of HDL before adding recombinant PON1 only slightly inhibited the ability of HDL to enhance the catalytic activity of recombinant PON1. Together, these studies support the notion that association of MPO with HDL leads to lower PON1 activity in part via IsoLG-mediated modification of PON1, so that IsoLG modification of PON1 could contribute to increased risk for atherosclerosis, and blocking this modification might prove beneficial to reduce atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3186597462,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) ion channel serves as the detector for noxious temperature above 42 °C, pungent chemicals like capsaicin, and acidic extracellular pH. This channel has also been shown to function as an ionotropic cannabinoid receptor. Despite the solving of high-resolution three-dimensional structures of TRPV1, how endocannabinoids such as anandamide and N-arachidonoyl dopamine bind to and activate this channel remains largely unknown. Here we employed a combination of patch-clamp recording, site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular docking techniques to investigate how the endocannabinoids structurally bind to and open the TRPV1 ion channel. We found that these endocannabinoid ligands bind to the vanilloid-binding pocket of TRPV1 in the ""tail-up, head-down"" configuration, similar to capsaicin; however, there is a unique interaction with TRPV1 Y512 residue critical for endocannabinoid activation of TRPV1 channels. These data suggest that a differential structural mechanism is involved in TRPV1 activation by endocannabinoids compared with the classic agonist capsaicin."
https://openalex.org/W3185175540,"This study aimed to evaluate the between-session reliability of single-leg performance and asymmetry variables during unilateral and bilateral countermovement jumps (CMJ). Twenty-three basketball players completed two identical sessions which consisted of four unilateral CMJs (two with each leg) and two bilateral CMJs. Mean and peak values of force, velocity and power, impulse, and jump height were obtained separately for each leg using a dual force platform. All performance variables presented an acceptable reliability (CVrange = 4.05-9.98%) with the exceptions of jump height for the unilateral CMJs and mean power, peak velocity, peak power, and impulse for the left leg during the bilateral CMJ (CV≥11.0%). Nine out of 14 variables were obtained with higher reliability during the unilateral CMJ (CVratio≥1.16), and 4 out of 14 during the bilateral CMJ (CVratio≥1.32). Asymmetry variables always showed an unacceptable reliability (ICCrange = 0.15-0.64) and poor/slight levels of agreement in direction (Kapparange = -0.10 to 0.15) for the unilateral CMJ, while an acceptable reliability (ICCrange = 0.74-0.77) and substantial levels of agreement in direction (Kapparange = 0.65 to 0.74) were generally obtained for the bilateral CMJ. These results suggest that single-leg performance can be obtained with higher reliability during the unilateral CMJ, while the bilateral CMJ provides more consistent measures of inter-limb asymmetries."
https://openalex.org/W3189390544,"Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic threatens human species with mortality rate of roughly 2%. We can hardly predict the time of herd immunity against and end of COVID‐19 with or without success of vaccine. One way to overcome the situation is to define what delineates disease severity and serves as a molecular target. The most successful analogy is found in BCR‐ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia, which is the golden biomarker, and simultaneously, the most effective molecular target. We hypothesize that S100 calcium‐binding protein A8 (S100A8) is one such molecule. The underlying evidence includes accumulating clinical information that S100A8 is upregulated in severe forms of COVID‐19, pathological similarities of the affected lungs between COVID‐19 and S100A8‐induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) model, homeostatic inflammation theory in which S100A8 is an endogenous ligand for endotoxin sensor Toll‐like receptor 4/Myeloid differentiation protein‐2 (TLR4/MD‐2) and mediates hyper‐inflammation even after elimination of endotoxin‐producing extrinsic pathogens, analogous findings between COVID‐19‐associated ARDS and pre‐metastatic lungs such as S100A8 upregulation, pulmonary recruitment of myeloid cells, increased vascular permeability, and activation coagulation cascade. A successful treatment in an animal COVID‐19 model is given with a reagent capable of abrogating interaction between S100A8/S100A9 and TLR4. In this paper, we try to verify our hypothesis that S100A8 governs COVID‐19‐associated ARDS."
https://openalex.org/W3189554186,"Parental reflective functioning (PRF) refers to the parent’s capacity to envision mental states in the infant and in themselves as a parent, and to link such underlying mental process with behavior, which is important for parenting sensitivity and child socio-emotional development. Current findings have linked maternal postpartum depression to impaired reflective skills, imposing a risk on the developing mother–infant relationship, but findings are mixed, and studies have generally used extensive methods for investigating PRF. The present study examined the factor structure and measurement invariance of the Danish version of the 18-item self-report Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ) in a sample of mothers with and without diagnosed postpartum depression. Moreover, the association between PRF and maternal postpartum depression in mothers with and without comorbid symptoms of personality disorder and/or clinical levels of psychological distress was investigated. Participants included 423 mothers of infants aged 1–11 months. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a three-factor structure of the PRFQ; however, item loadings suggested that a 15-item version was a more accurate measure of PRF in mothers of infants. Multi-group factor analysis of the 15-item PRFQ infant version indicated measurement invariance among mothers with and without diagnosed postpartum depression. Multinomial logistic regression showed that impaired PRF was associated with maternal psychopathology, although only for mothers with postpartum depression combined with other symptoms of psychopathology. These results provide new evidence for the assessment of maternal self-reported reflective skills as measured by a modified infant version of the PRFQ, as well as a more nuanced understanding of how variance in symptomatology is associated with impaired PRF in mothers in the postpartum period in differing ways."

https://openalex.org/W3191990903,"Biological phenomena induced by terahertz (THz) irradiation are described in recent reports, but underlying mechanisms, structural and dynamical change of specific molecules are still unclear. In this paper, we performed time-lapse morphological analysis of human cells and found that THz irradiation halts cell division at cytokinesis. At the end of cytokinesis, the contractile ring, which consists of filamentous actin (F-actin), needs to disappear; however, it remained for 1 hour under THz irradiation. Induction of the functional structures of F-actin was also observed in interphase cells. Similar phenomena were also observed under chemical treatment (jasplakinolide), indicating that THz irradiation assists actin polymerization. We previously reported that THz irradiation enhances the polymerization of purified actin in vitro; our current work shows that it increases cytoplasmic F-actin in vivo. Thus, we identified one of the key biomechanisms affected by THz waves."
https://openalex.org/W3185173027,"The coronaviral nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) is essential for viral replication; it is the primary substrate of Nsp12's pseudokinase domain within the viral replication transcription complex, an association that also recruits other components during different stages of RNA reproduction. In the unmodified state, Nsp9 forms an obligate homodimer via an essential GxxxG protein-interaction motif, but its ssRNA-binding mechanism remains unknown. Using structural biological techniques, here we show that a base-mimicking compound identified from a small molecule fragment screen engages Nsp9 via a tetrameric Pi-Pi stacking interaction that induces the formation of a parallel trimer-of-dimers. This oligomerization mechanism allows an interchange of ""latching"" N-termini, the charges of which contribute to a series of electropositive channels that suggests a potential interface for viral RNA. The identified pyrrolo-pyrimidine compound may also serve as a potential starting point for the development of compounds seeking to probe Nsp9's role within SARS-CoV-2 replication."
https://openalex.org/W3185635598,"Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (TRPM4) is a Ca2+-activated nonselective cation channel that mediates membrane depolarization. Although, a current with the hallmarks of a TRPM4-mediated current has been previously reported in pancreatic acinar cells (PACs), the role of TRPM4 in the regulation of acinar cell function has not yet been explored. In the present study, we identify this TRPM4 current and describe its role in context of Ca2+ signaling of PACs using pharmacological tools and TRPM4-deficient mice. We found a significant Ca2+-activated cation current in PACs that was sensitive to the TRPM4 inhibitors 9-phenanthrol and 4-chloro-2-[[2-(2-chlorophenoxy)acetyl]amino]benzoic acid (CBA). We demonstrated that the CBA-sensitive current was responsible for a Ca2+-dependent depolarization of PACs from a resting membrane potential of −44.4 ± 2.9 to −27.7 ± 3 mV. Furthermore, we showed that Ca2+ influx was higher in the TRPM4 KO- and CBA-treated PACs than in control cells. As hormone-induced repetitive Ca2+ transients partially rely on Ca2+ influx in PACs, the role of TRPM4 was also assessed on Ca2+ oscillations elicited by physiologically relevant concentrations of the cholecystokinin analog cerulein. These data show that the amplitude of Ca2+ signals was significantly higher in TRPM4 KO than in control PACs. Our results suggest that PACs are depolarized by TRPM4 currents to an extent that results in a significant reduction of the inward driving force for Ca2+.

Pancreatic acinar cells (PACs) are the major cell types of the exocrine pancreas. They are responsible for secretion of digestive enzymes and primary fluid. Stimulation by endogenous secretagogues, such as acetylcholine and cholecystokinin, causes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation, and consequent Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the IP3 receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channels. The subsequent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) triggers the exocytosis of digestive enzymes (1Streb H. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I.

The trigger for SOCE is the significant depletion of the ER Ca2+ content, and its role is to fuel further Ca2+ release during strong stimulation. Otherwise, either type of Ca2+ entry channels are assembled from different isoforms of the ORAI protein, with possible contribution of transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) channels to SOCE (27Prakriya M.

Following [Ca2+]i elevation, Ca2+ is pumped out from the cytosol by the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) or transferred back to the ER by the sarco-ER Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) (30Tepikin A.V.

Since the spatiotemporal characteristics of Ca2+ signaling fundamentally determine cell behavior and disordered Ca2+ signaling is directly linked to pancreatic pathology, the major challenge of research in this field is to learn more about the regulation of [Ca2+]i and to find new pharmacological targets and compounds to prevent Ca2+ overload (34Gerasimenko J.V. Gryshchenko O. Ferdek P.E. Stapleton E. Hébert T.O.G. Bychkova S. Peng S. Begg M. Gerasimenko O.V. Petersen O.H.

In our efforts to find new effectors of Ca2+ signaling in PACs, we examined whether Ca2+-regulated ion channels from the transient receptor potential family (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 [TRPM4] and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 [TRPM5]) are expressed in PACs and whether they affect Ca2+ signaling. First, we performed a comprehensive quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis using murine pancreas and got a positive result for the TRPM4. TRPM4 is an [Ca2+]i-activated nonselective cation channel mediating a significant amount of depolarizing current in several cell types (36Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. TRPM4 is a Ca2+-activated nonselective cation channel mediating cell membrane depolarization.Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Accordingly, plasma membrane depolarization because of TRPM4 activation was demonstrated to control various physiological processes through the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (in breath pacemaker neurons and cerebral arterioles) or by decreasing capacitative Ca2+ entry by limiting the electrochemical driving force for Ca2+ influx (in mast cells and T-lymphocytes) (37Pace R.W.

TRPM4 regulates calcium oscillations after T cell activation.Science. 2004; 306: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A cation current with the hallmarks of TRPM4 was also reported in PAC by Maruyama and Petersen in 1982 (41Maruyama Y. Petersen O.H. Cholecystokinin activation of single-channel currents is mediated by internal messenger in pancreatic acinar cells.Nature. 1982; 300: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 42Maruyama Y. Petersen O.H. What is the mechanism of the calcium influx to pancreatic acinar cells evoked by secretagogues?.Pflugers Arch. 1983; 396: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, studying the role of the current in PAC function was impeded by the lack of pharmacological and genetic tools at that time. Nevertheless, the cation current was suggested to be responsible for the Ca2+-dependent transepithelial Na+ and water transport required for fluid secretion. Importantly, the fact that the current is controlled by extracellular Ca2 implies that it may serve as a negative feedback regulator of Ca2+ influx. Presuming that the inward cation current was carried by TRPM4, its role in the feedback regulation of Ca2+ influx was tested in this study. In preliminary experiments, RT-qPCR analysis was performed from murine whole pancreas lysates using DNA primer probes designed to recognize the two types of Ca2+-dependent cation channels TRPM4 and TRPM5. Parallel experiments were done using primer pairs against the three isoforms of IP3R, the three isoforms of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) Ca2+ release channel and TRPC3, which served as internal control. The housekeeping gene GAPDH expression was used as reference (Fig. 1). IP3R isoforms showed high and identical expression, whereas RyR expression was relatively low, with RyR1 being the major isoform. These results are in accordance with previous results showing that all IP3R isoforms are equally highly expressed and that RyR has only a complementary role in the Ca2+ signaling of PACs (13Straub S.V.

TRPM4 expression was comparable to IP3R expression and was significantly higher than that of TRPC3, the Ca2+ permeable channel partially responsible for SOCE in PACs (29Kim M.S. Hong J.H. Li Q. Shin D.M. Abramowitz J. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Deletion of TRPC3 in mice reduces store-operated Ca2+ influx and the severity of acute pancreatitis.Gastroenterology. 2009; 137: 1509-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). TRPM5 expression level fell below the detection threshold. As TRPM5 has been shown to be highly expressed in the endocrine pancreas (46Colsoul B. Schraenen A. Lemaire K. Quintens R. Lommel L.V. Segal A. Owsianik G. Talavera K. Voets T. Margolskee R.F. Kokrashvili Z. Gilon P. Nilius B. Schuit F.C. Vennekens R. Loss of high-frequency glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations in pancreatic islets correlates with impaired glucose tolerance in Trpm5-/- mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 5208-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), our negative result also implies that mRNA contamination of our whole pancreas lysate by Langerhans islets did not bias our data. Therefore, we conclude that TRPM4 mRNA is highly expressed in PAC. In the next series of our experiments, functional expression of TRPM4 was tested using the voltage-clamp method in whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. The ionic composition of the extracellular and intracellular solutions was designed specifically for the measurement of nonselective cation currents. To this end, much of Cl− was replaced by glutamate in the recording medium, and Cs+ was added to the intracellular solution in order to prevent Cl− and K+ currents, respectively. Averaged current traces, recorded in course of voltage ramp protocols applied between −60 and +120 mV, are shown in Figure 2, A and B. Under control conditions, a cation current appeared as a small inward background current displaying a slight voltage dependence at positive voltages. When the same cell was treated with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a specific inhibitor of SERCA (47Seidler N.W. Jona I. Vegh M. Martonosi A. Cyclopiazonic acid is a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17816-17823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the current significantly increased. CPA is a common tool used to create elevated [Ca2+]i, as it inhibits Ca2+ reuptake and leaves resting ER Ca2+ leak uncompensated. As a result, CPA treatment raises [Ca2+]i (35Wen L. Voronina S. Javed M.A. Awais M. Szatmary P. Latawiec D. Chvanov M. Collier D. Huang W. Barrett J. Begg M. Stauderman K. Roos J. Grigoryev S.

The reason why we used CPA instead of secretagogue stimulation for this purpose is that CPA increases [Ca2+]i while saving the PIP2 content of the plasma membrane, so it prevents rundown of TRPM4 current during the experiment (48Nilius B. Mahieu F. Prenen J. Janssens A. Owsianik G. Vennekens R. Voets T. The Ca2+-activated cation channel TRPM4 is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). After reaching steady-state current, cells were treated with a solution containing CPA together with the widely used TRPM4 inhibitor 9-phenanthrol (9-ph; 100 μM) (49Ozhathil L.C. Delalande C. Bianchi B. Nemeth G. Kappel S. Thomet U. Ross-Kaschitza D. Simonin C. Rubin M. Gertsch J. Lochner M. Peinelt C. Reymond J.L. Abriel H. Identification of potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of the cation channel TRPM4.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2018; 175: 2504-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which diminished the current (Fig. 2A). Unfortunately, 9-ph is not a fully selective inhibitor of TRPM4 as it is known to suppress also the Ca2+-dependent Cl− current (50Burris S.K. Wang Q. Bulley S. Neeb Z.P. Jaggar J.H. 9-Phenanthrol inhibits recombinant and arterial myocyte TMEM16A channels.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2015; 172: 2459-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This issue makes 9-ph problematic to apply with PACs, as both currents show significant depolarizing capacity in these cells. In order to overcome selectivity problems, a more specific TRMP4 inhibitor, 4-chloro-2-[[2-(2-chlorophenoxy)acetyl]amino]benzoic acid (CBA), was applied. About 10 μM of CBA inhibited the Ca2+-dependent cation current as potently as 100 μM 9-ph (Fig. 2B) (49Ozhathil L.C. Delalande C. Bianchi B. Nemeth G. Kappel S. Thomet U. Ross-Kaschitza D. Simonin C. Rubin M. Gertsch J. Lochner M. Peinelt C. Reymond J.L. Abriel H. Identification of potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of the cation channel TRPM4.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2018; 175: 2504-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) without affecting the Cl− current (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that CBA is an appropriate drug for selectively inhibiting TRPM4 even under the experimental conditions of live-cell Ca2+ imaging, when both cation and anion currents operate simultaneously in PACs.Figure 3CBA does not affect the Cl− current in pancreatic acinar cells.

Olausson J. Meissner M. Bloch W. Mathar I. Philipp S.E. Schmitz F. Weissgerber P. Nilius B. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Increased IgE-dependent mast cell activation and anaphylactic responses in mice lacking the calcium-activated nonselective cation channel TRPM4.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), using the same experimental arrangement. Although, the mean current was somewhat higher comparing to control, it failed to increase during CPA treatment and was not sensitive to CBA either (Fig. 2C). These results strongly suggest that TRPM4 is functionally expressed in WT PACs in significant amounts. In order to determine the impact of TRPM4 current on membrane potential, perforated patch clamp experiments were performed using the current clamp technique. The membrane potential was −44.4 ± 2.9 mV under control conditions, and the membrane slowly depolarized to −27.7 ± 3 mV when 30 μM CPA was applied. The membrane potential returned close to the resting value (−42.9 ± 1.6 mV) when the perfusion solution was supplemented with 10 μM CBA (Fig. 4, A and B). Based on these results, we propose that PAC plasma membrane depolarizes in a Ca2+-dependent manner, involving the activation of TRPM4. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the driving force for Ca2+ influx at these depolarized membrane potentials is low enough to significantly decrease Ca2+ entry. To test this hypothesis, ratiometric Ca2+ imaging was performed in clusters of PACs, which were exposed to long-term stimulation with low dose (10 pM) of cerulein, which is equivalent to a physiological stimulation with cholecystokinin (51Criddle D.N. Booth D.M. Mukherjee R. McLaughlin E. Green G.M. Sutton R. Petersen O.H. Reeve J.R. Cholecystokinin-58 and cholecystokinin-8 exhibit similar actions on calcium signaling, zymogen secretion, and cell fate in murine pancreatic acinar cells.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2009; 297: G1085-G1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Parallel experiments were performed in Ca2+-containing and Ca2+-free solutions (when the source of Ca2+ can be only intracellular) using control and TRPM4 KO cells as well. Continuous application of 10 pM cerulein evoked periodic fluctuation (oscillation) of [Ca2+]i in all groups (Fig. 5, A and B). Ca2+ spikes emerging between 8 and 10 min of cerulein treatment were analyzed because Ca2+ entry was expected to already contribute to the Ca2+ signaling by this time (21Yule D.I. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Acetylcholine and cholecystokinin induce different patterns of oscillating calcium signals in pancreatic acinar cells.Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). While the average amplitude of Ca2+ spikes in control PACs was very similar in Ca2+-containing and Ca2+-free media, the value was markedly higher in Ca2+-containing medium in the case of TRPM4 KO preparations (Fig. 5C; ΔR500–600 s values: CTRL 0 Ca2+: 0.111 ± 0.008; CTRL 2.5 Ca2+: 0.091 ± 0.007; TRPM4 KO 0 Ca2+: 0.087 ± 0.004; and TRPM4 KO 2.5 Ca2+: 0.14 ± 0.011). These data indicate that Ca2+ entry is significant after 8 min cerulein treatment in TRPM4 KO PACs but not in control cells. Importantly, the spike amplitudes in control and TRPM4 KO PACs were essentially the same in Ca2+-free saline solution, suggesting that the Ca2+ content of ER was similar at the end of cerulein treatment in both types of cells.

Checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as promising anti-cancer agents when used in combination with conventional anti-cancer therapies. Recent studies have highlighted a critical role of the Greatwall kinase (microtubule-associated serine/threonine-protein kinase-like (MASTL)) in promoting oncogenic malignancy and resistance to anti-cancer therapies; however, its role in PC remains unknown. Based on a comprehensive investigation involving PC patient samples, murine models of PC progression (Kras;PdxCre-KC and Kras;p53;PdxCre-KPC), and loss and gain of function studies, we report a previously undescribed critical role of MASTL in promoting cancer malignancy and therapy resistance. Mechanistically, MASTL promotes PC by modulating the epidermal growth factor receptor protein stability and, thereupon, kinase signaling. We further demonstrate that combinatorial therapy targeting MASTL promotes the efficacy of the cell-killing effects of Gemcitabine using both genetic and pharmacological inhibitions. Taken together, this study identifies a key role of MASTL in promoting PC progression and its utility as a novel target in promoting sensitivity to the anti-PC therapies."

Objective of the study was to elucidate the effect of carrier material on release characteristics of clopidogrel from liquisolid compacts. Different formulations of liquisolid compacts were developed using microcrystalline cellulose, starch maize, polyvinyl pyrollidone and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as carrier material in three concentrations (40, 30 and 20%, w/w). Liquid vehicle was selected on the basis of solubility of clopidogrel. Colloidal silicondioxide was used as coating material and ratio of carrier to coating material was kept 10. A control formulation comprised of microcrystalline cellulose (diluents), tabletose-80 (diluents), primojel (disintegrant) and magnesium stearate (lubricant) was prepared by direct compression technique and was used for comparison. All the formulations were evaluated at pre and post compression level. Acid solubility profile showed higher solubility in HCl buffer pH2 (296.89±3.49 μg/mL). Mixture of propylene glycol and water (2:1, v/v) was selected as liquid vehicle. Drug content was in the range of 99–101% of the claimed quantity. All the formulations showed better mechanical strength and their friability was within the official limits (&lt;1%). Microcrystalline cellulose and starch maize resulted in faster drug release while polyvinyl pyrollidone and HPMC resulted in sustaining drug release by gel formation. It is concluded from results that both fast release and sustained release of clopidogrel can be achieved by proper selection of carrier material."
https://openalex.org/W3184610186,"Apolipoprotein L-I (APOL1) is a channel-forming effector of innate immunity. The common human APOL1 variant G0 provides protection against infection with certain Trypanosoma and Leishmania parasite species, but it cannot protect against the trypanosomes responsible for human African trypanosomiasis. Human APOL1 variants G1 and G2 protect against human-infective trypanosomes but also confer a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Trypanosome-killing activity is dependent on the ability of APOL1 to insert into membranes at acidic pH and form pH-gated cation channels. We previously mapped the channel's pore-lining region to the C-terminal domain (residues 332-398) and identified a membrane-insertion domain (MID, residues 177-228) that facilitates acidic pH-dependent membrane insertion. In this article, we further investigate structural determinants of cation channel formation by APOL1. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and targeted chemical modification, our data indicate that the C-terminal heptad-repeat sequence (residues 368-395) is a bona fide leucine zipper domain (ZIP) that is required for cation channel formation as well as lysis of trypanosomes and mammalian cells. Using protein-wide cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, coupled with the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we determined that, in the open channel state, both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal ZIP domain are exposed on the intralumenal/extracellular side of the membrane and provide evidence that each APOL1 monomer contributes four transmembrane domains to the open cation channel conformation. Based on these data, we propose an oligomeric topology model in which the open APOL1 cation channel is assembled from the coiled-coil association of C-terminal ZIP domains."
https://openalex.org/W3186668510,"Background Most data on COVID-19 was collected in hospitalized cases. Much less is known about the spectrum of disease in entire populations. In this study, we examine a representative cohort of primarily symptomatic cases in an administrative district in Southern Germany. Methods We contacted all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the administrative district. Consenting participants answered a retrospective survey either via a telephone, electronically or via mail. Clinical and sociodemographic features were compared between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. Additionally, we assessed potential risk factors for hospitalization and time to hospitalization in a series of regression models. Results We included 897 participants in our study, 69% out of 1,305 total cases in the district with a mean age of 47 years (range 2–97), 51% of which were female and 47% had a pre-existing illness. The percentage of asymptomatic, mild, moderate (leading to hospital admission) and critical illness (requiring mechanical ventilation) was 54 patients (6%), 713 (79%), 97 (11%) and 16 (2%), respectively. Seventeen patients (2%) died. The most prevalent symptoms were fatigue (65%), cough (62%) and dysgeusia (60%). The risk factors for hospitalization included older age (OR 1.05 per year increase; 95% CI 1.04–1.07) preexisting lung conditions (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.62–5.88). Female sex was a protective factor (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.33–0.77). Conclusion This representative analysis of primarily symptomatic COVID-19 cases confirms age, male sex and preexisting lung conditions but not cardiovascular disease as risk factors for severe illness. Almost 80% of infection take a mild course, whereas 13% of patients suffer moderate to severe illness. Trial registration German Clinical Trials Register, DRKS00022926.

With the national surveillance data of HFMD in Xinjiang and meteorological parameters in the study area from 2008 to 2016, in GeoDetector Model, we examined the effects of meteorological factors on the incidence of HFMD in Xinjiang, China, tested the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of HFMD risk, and explored the temporal-spatial patterns of HFMD through the spatial autocorrelation analysis. From 2008 to 2016, the HFMD distribution showed a distinct seasonal pattern and HFMD cases typically occurred from May to July and peaked in June in Xinjiang. Relative humidity, precipitation, barometric pressure and temperature had the more significant influences on the incidence of HFMD than other meteorological factors with the explanatory power of 0.30, 0.29, 0.29 and 0.21 (P&lt;0.000). The interaction between any two meteorological factors had a nonlinear enhancement effect on the risk of HFMD. The relative risk in Northern Xinjiang was higher than that in Southern Xinjiang. Global spatial autocorrelation analysis results indicated a fluctuating trend over these years: the positive spatial dependency on the incidence of HFMD in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2015, the negative spatial autocorrelation in 2009 and a random distribution pattern in 2011, 2013 and 2016. Our findings revealed the correlation between meteorological factors and the incidence of HFMD in Xinjiang. The correlation showed obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

A total of 185 mitochondrial COI barcode sequences and 59 partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were obtained from 120 genera, 65 families and 21 orders of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. The collected samples were first identified by examining morphometric characteristics and then assessed by DNA barcoding. The COI and 16S rRNA sequences of fishes and crustaceans were clearly discriminated among genera in their phylogenies. The average Kimura two-parameter (K2P) distances of COI barcode sequences within species, genera, and families of fishes are 1.57±0.06%, 15.16±0.23%, and 17.79±0.02%, respectively, and for 16S rRNA sequences, these values are 1.74±.8%, 0.97±.8%, and 4.29±1.3%, respectively. The minimum and maximum K2P distance based divergences in COI sequences of fishes are 0.19% and 36.27%, respectively. In crustaceans, the K2P distances within genera, families, and orders are 1.4±0.03%, 17.73±0.15%, and 22.81±0.02%, respectively and the minimum and maximum divergences are 0.2% and 33.93%, respectively. Additionally, the present study resolves the misidentification of the mud crab species of the Sundarbans as Scylla olivacea which was previously stated as Scylla serrata . In case of molluscs, values of interspecific divergence ranges from 17.43% to 66.3% in the barcoded species. The present study describes the development of a molecular and morphometric cross-referenced inventory of fish and shellfish of the Sundarbans. This inventory will be useful in future biodiversity studies and in forming future conservation plan."

https://openalex.org/W3186518064,"Endochondral ossification initiates the growth of the majority of the mammalian skeleton and is tightly controlled through gene regulatory networks. The forkhead box transcription factors Foxc1 and Foxc2 regulate aspects of osteoblast function in the formation of the skeleton, but their roles in chondrocytes to control endochondral ossification are less clear. Here, we demonstrate that Foxc1 expression is directly regulated by the activity of SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9, one of the earliest transcription factors to specify the chondrocyte lineage. Moreover, we demonstrate that elevated expression of Foxc1 promotes chondrocyte differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells and loss of Foxc1 function inhibits chondrogenesis in vitro. Using chondrocyte-targeted deletion of Foxc1 and Foxc2 in mice, we reveal a role for these factors in chondrocyte differentiation in vivo. Loss of both Foxc1 and Foxc2 caused a general skeletal dysplasia predominantly affecting the vertebral column. The long bones of the limbs were smaller, mineralization was reduced, and organization of the growth plate was disrupted; in particular, the stacked columnar organization of the proliferative chondrocyte layer was reduced in size and cell proliferation was decreased. Differential gene expression analysis indicated disrupted expression patterns of chondrogenesis and ossification genes throughout the entire process of endochondral ossification in chondrocyte-specific Foxc1/Foxc2 KO embryos. Our results suggest that Foxc1 and Foxc2 are required for normal chondrocyte differentiation and function, as loss of both genes results in disorganization of the growth plate, reduced chondrocyte proliferation, and delays in chondrocyte hypertrophy that prevents ossification of the skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W3188655039,"Human errors are considered to be the main causation factors of high-temperature molten metal accidents in metallurgical enterprises. The complex working environment of high- temperature molten metal in metallurgical enterprises has an important influence on the reliability of human behavior. A review of current human reliability techniques confirms that there is a lack of quantitative analysis of human errors in high-temperature molten metal operating environments. In this paper, a model was proposed to support the human reliability analysis of high-temperature molten metal operation in the metallurgy industry based on cognitive reliability and error analysis method (CREAM), fuzzy logic theory, and Bayesian network (BN). The comprehensive rules of common performance conditions in conventional CREAM approach were provided to evaluate various conditions for high-temperature molten metal operation in the metallurgy industry. This study adopted fuzzy CREAM to consider the uncertainties and used the BN to determine the control mode and calculate human error probability (HEP). The HEP for workers involved in high-temperature melting in steelmaking production process was calculated in a case with 13 operators being engaged in different high-temperature molten metal operations. The human error probability of two operators with different control modes was compared with the calculation result of basic CREAM, and the result showed that the method proposed in this paper is validated. This paper quantified point values of human error probability in high-temperature molten metal operation for the first time, which can be used as input in the risk evaluation of metallurgical industry."
https://openalex.org/W3191089262,"Prolyl hydroxylase (PH) enzymes control the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor known to regulate erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. HIF-PH inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) correct anemia in patients with renal disease and in animal models of anemia and kidney disease. However, the effects of HIF-PHIs on comorbidities associated with kidney disease remain largely unknown. We evaluated the effects of the HIF-PHI FG-2216 in obese ZSF1 (Ob-ZSF1) rats, an established model of kidney failure with metabolic syndrome. Following unilateral nephrectomy (Nx) at 8 weeks of age, rats were treated with 40 mg/kg FG-2216 or vehicle by oral gavage three times per week for up to 18 weeks. FG-2216 corrected blood hemoglobin levels and improved kidney function and histopathology in Nx-Ob-ZSF1 rats by increasing the glomerular filtration rate, decreasing proteinuria, and reducing peritubular fibrosis, tubular damage, glomerulosclerosis and mesangial expansion. FG-2216 increased renal glucose excretion and decreased body weight, fat pad weight, and serum cholesterol in Nx-Ob-ZSF1 rats. Additionally, FG-2216 corrected hypertension, improved diastolic and systolic heart function, and reduced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. In conclusion, the HIF-PHI FG-2216 improved renal and cardiovascular outcomes, and reduced obesity in a rat model of kidney disease with metabolic syndrome. Thus, in addition to correcting anemia, HIF-PHIs may provide renal and cardiac protection to patients suffering from kidney disease with metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3183727399,"The effects of climate change on plant phenological events such as flowering, leaf flush, and leaf fall may be greater in steep river basins than at the horizontal scale of countries and continents. This possibility is due to the effect of temperature on plant phenology and the difference between vertical and horizontal gradients in temperature sensitivities. We calculated the dates of the start (SGS) and end of the growing season (EGS) in a steep river basin located in a mountainous region of central Japan over a century timescale by using a degree-day phenological model based on long-term, continuous, in situ observations. We assessed the generality and representativeness of the modelled SGS and EGS dates by using phenological events, live camera images taken at multiple points in the basin, and satellite observations made at a fine spatial resolution. The sensitivity of the modelled SGS and EGS dates to elevation changed from 3.29 days (100 m)-1 (-5.48 days °C-1) and -2.89 days (100 m)-1 (4.81 days °C-1), respectively, in 1900 to 2.85 days (100 m)-1 (-4.75 days °C-1) and -2.84 day (100 m)-1 (4.73 day °C-1) in 2019. The long-term trend of the sensitivity of the modelled SGS date to elevation was -0.0037 day year-1 per 100 m, but the analogous trend in the case of the modelled EGS date was not significant. Despite the need for further studies to improve the generality and representativeness of the model, the development of degree-day phenology models in multiple, steep river basins will deepen our ecological understanding of the sensitivity of plant phenology to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3186100352,"Choking refers to a blockage of upper airways by food or other objects resulting in interruption of breathing. It is a medical emergency that needs immediate action by anyone near by the victim to save life. Chocking is a major cause of illness and death in the pediatric population under the age of 5 years. Children at this age spent more time in their school and are at high risk during their feeding and playing. Immediate provision of first aid in response to choking by a preschool teacher will help to decrease the risk of developing life-threatening complications, length of hospital stays, the cost of treatment, and death.Institutional-based cross-sectional study design was applied to the study area using pretested, structured, and self-administered questionnaires. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with Knowledge, attitude, and practice of kindergarten teachers towards first aid management of choking.A total of 224 Kindergarten teachers were involved in the study with a response rate of 95%. Only eighty-three (37%) of them were knowledgeable and 97 (43.3%) have faced a choked child in the school compound. Of these, only 42 (43.2%) had provided first aid to the victim. Most of the respondents 95.1% had a positive attitude towards choking first aid and 57.1% of them agreed that choking needs immediate management. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that Kindergarten teachers with the previous first aid training were 2.9 times more knowledgeable than those kindergarten teachers without previous first aid training (AOR: 2.902, 95% CI: 1.612, 5.227).The level of knowledge and skills for providing first aid for choking children among kindergarten teachers is low. There is a need for urgent intervention to train teachers regarding the provision of first aid for choking children."
https://openalex.org/W3187411693,"The Global Digital Exemplar (GDE) Programme was designed to promote the digitisation of hospital services in England. Selected provider organisations that were reasonably digitally-mature were funded with the expectation that they would achieve internationally recognised levels of excellence and act as exemplars ('GDE sites') and share their learning with somewhat less digitally-mature Fast Follower (FF) sites.This paper explores how partnerships between GDE and FF sites have promoted knowledge sharing and learning between organisations.We conducted an independent qualitative longitudinal evaluation of the GDE Programme, collecting data across 36 provider organisations (including acute, mental health and speciality), 12 of which we studied as in-depth ethnographic case studies. We used a combination of semi-structured interviews with programme leads, vendors and national policy leads, non-participant observations of meetings and workshops, and analysed national and local documents. This allowed us to explore both how inter-organisational learning and knowledge sharing was planned, and how it played out in practice. Thematic qualitative analysis, combining findings from diverse data sources, was facilitated by NVivo 11 and drew on sociotechnical systems theory.Formally established GDE and FF partnerships were perceived to enhance learning and accelerate adoption of technologies in most pairings. They were seen to be most successful where they had encouraged, and were supported by, informal knowledge networking, driven by the mutual benefits of information sharing. Informal networking was enhanced where the benefits were maximised (for example where paired sites had implemented the same technological system) and networking costs minimised (for example by geographical proximity, prior links and institutional alignment). Although the intervention anticipated uni-directional learning between exemplar sites and 'followers', in most cases we observed a two-way flow of information, with GDEs also learning from FFs, through informal networking which also extended to other health service providers outside the Programme. The efforts of the GDE Programme to establish a learning ecosystem has enhanced the profile of shared learning within the NHS.Inter-organisational partnerships have produced significant gains for both follower (FF) and exemplar (GDE) sites. Formal linkages were most effective where they had facilitated, and were supported by, informal networking. Informal networking was driven by the mutual benefits of information sharing and was optimised where sites were well aligned in terms of technology, geography and culture. Misalignments that created barriers to networking between organisations in a few cases were attributed to inappropriate choice of partners. Policy makers seeking to promote learning through centrally directed mechanisms need to create a framework that enables networking and informal knowledge transfer, allowing local organisations to develop bottom-up collaboration and exchanges, where they are productive, in an organic manner."
https://openalex.org/W3187590106,"Cardiac fibroblasts (CFBs) support heart function by secreting extracellular matrix (ECM) and paracrine factors, respond to stress associated with injury and disease, and therefore are an increasingly important therapeutic target. We describe how developmental lineage of human pluripotent stem cell-derived CFBs, epicardial (EpiC-FB), and second heart field (SHF-FB) impacts transcriptional and functional properties. Both EpiC-FBs and SHF-FBs exhibited CFB transcriptional programs and improved calcium handling in human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues. We identified differences including in composition of ECM synthesized, secretion of growth and differentiation factors, and myofibroblast activation potential, with EpiC-FBs exhibiting higher stress-induced activation potential akin to myofibroblasts and SHF-FBs demonstrating higher calcification and mineralization potential. These phenotypic differences suggest that EpiC-FBs have utility in modeling fibrotic diseases while SHF-FBs are a promising source of cells for regenerative therapies. This work directly contrasts regional and developmental specificity of CFBs and informs CFB in vitro model selection."
https://openalex.org/W3188675682,"Background Home delivery (HD) without skilled birth attendants (SBAs) are considered crucial risk factors increasing maternal and child mortality rates in Loa PDR. While a few studies in the literature discuss the choice of delivery in remote areas of minority ethnic groups; our work aims to identify factors that indicated their delivery place, at home or in the health facilities. Methods A community-based qualitative study was conducted between February and March 2020. Three types of interviews were implemented, In-depth interviews with 16 women of eight rural villages who delivered in the last 12 months in Xepon District, Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR. Also, three focus group discussions (FGDs) with nine HCPs and key-informant interviews of ten VHVs were managed. Factors affecting the choice of the delivery place were categorized according to the social-ecological model. Results Our sample included five Tri women and two Mangkong women in the HD group, while the FD group included three Tri women, two Mangkong women, one Phoutai woman, two Laolung women and one Vietnamese. Our investigation inside the targeted minority showed that both positive perceptions of home delivery (HD) and low-risk perception minorities were the main reasons for the choice of HD, on the individual level. On the other hand, fear of complication, the experience of stillbirth, and prolonged labour pain during HD were reasons for facility-based delivery (FD). Notably, the women in our minority reported no link between their preference and their language, while the HCPs dated the low knowledge to the language barrier. On the interpersonal level, the FD women had better communication with their families, and better preparation for delivery compared to the HD group. The FD family prepared cash and transportation using their social network. At the community level, the trend of the delivery place had shifted from HD to FD. Improved accessibility and increased knowledge through community health education were the factors of the trend. At the societal (national policy) level, the free delivery policy and limitation of HCPs’ assisted childbirth only in health facilities were the factors of increasing FD, while the absence of other incentives like transportation and food allowance was the factor of remaining of HD. Conclusions Based on the main findings of this study, we urge the enhancement of family communication on birth preparedness and birthplace. Furthermore, our findings support the need to educate mothers, especially those of younger ages, about their best options regarding the place of delivery. We propose implementing secondary services of HD to minimize the emergency risks of HD. We encourage local authorities to be aware of the medical needs of the community especially those of pregnant females and their right for a free delivery policy."

This study aims to report the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory characteristics of the hospitalized patients. Methods The study followed cross-sectional design. In total 1792 individuals were studied. Other than data, a single, stool specimen was subjected to one step rapid visual diagnostic test for Vibrio cholerae . The provisionally diagnosed specimens of cholera cases were inoculated into Cary-Blair Transport Medium; then sent to the laboratory of icddr,b in Dhaka to isolate the colony as well as perform antibiotic susceptibility tests. Data were analyzed by STATA and analyses included descriptive as well as analytic methods. Results Of the total 1792 admissions in 5 DTCs, 729 (41%) were from FDMN settlements; children &lt;5 years contributed the most (n = 981; 55%). Forty percent (n = 716) were aged 15 years and above, and females were predominant (n = 453; 63%). Twenty-eight percent (n = 502) sought treatment within 24h of the onset of diarrhea. FDMN admissions within 24h were low compared to host hospitalization (n = 172, 24% vs. n = 330, 31%; p&lt;0.001). Seventy-two percent (n = 1295) had watery diarrhea; more common among host population than FDMN (n = 802; 75% vs. n = 493; 68%; p&lt;0.001). Forty-four percent admissions (n = 796) had some or severe dehydration, the later was common in FDMN (n = 46; 6% vs. n = 36; 3%, p = 0.005). FDMN often used public taps (n = 263; 36%), deep tube-well (n = 243; 33%), and shallow tube well (n = 188; 26%) as the source of drinking water. Nearly 96% (n = 698) of the admitted FDMN used pit latrines as opposed to 79% (n = 842) from the host community (p&lt;0.001). FDMN children were often malnourished. None of the FDMN reported cholera. Conclusion No diarrhea outbreak was detected, but preparedness for surges and response readiness are warranted in this emergency and crisis setting."
https://openalex.org/W3191700128,"The tendency to be overly confident in one’s future and skills has long been studied. More recently, a correlate of this overconfidence, the tendency to overclaim knowledge, has been in the focus of research. Its antecedents and downstream behavioral consequences are still in question. In a sample of undergraduate students ( N = 168), we tested whether a set of characteristics of the person (e.g., age, gender) and personality traits (i.e., the Dark Triad) is related to overclaiming knowledge. Moreover, we investigated whether overclaiming, in turn, predicts risk preferences. To this end, we asked individuals to rate their confidence in solving a set of different math problems and their familiarity with a set of math concepts. Some of these concepts were nonexistent, thereby allowing participants to overclaim knowledge. Participants then stated their general risk preference and performed three tasks revealing their general, financial, and social risk preferences. We demonstrated the hypothesized relationship between overclaiming and confidence. Furthermore, we observed that the assessed characteristics of the person were not correlated with overclaiming. If anything, height and digit ratio, a phenomenological correlate of hormonal differences during development, tended to be associated with overclaiming. Surprisingly, overclaiming was not at all related to risk preferences or personality traits. This set of results shows the need for relevant theoretical and methodological refinements."
https://openalex.org/W3193099336,"Oncogenic mutations of KRAS are found in the most aggressive human tumors, including colorectal cancer. It has been suggested that oncogenic KRAS phosphorylation at Ser181 modulates its activity and favors cell transformation. Using nonphosphorylatable (S181A), phosphomimetic (S181D), and phospho-/dephosphorylatable (S181) oncogenic KRAS mutants, we analyzed the role of this phosphorylation to the maintenance of tumorigenic properties of colorectal cancer cells. Our data show that the presence of phospho-/dephosphorylatable oncogenic KRAS is required for preserving the epithelial organization of colorectal cancer cells in 3D cultures, and for supporting subcutaneous tumor growth in mice. Interestingly, gene expression differed according to the phosphorylation status of KRAS. In DLD-1 cells, CTNNA1 was only expressed in phospho-/dephosphorylatable oncogenic KRAS-expressing cells, correlating with cell polarization. Moreover, lack of oncogenic KRAS phosphorylation leads to changes in expression of genes related to cell invasion, such as SERPINE1, PRSS1,2,3, and NEO1, and expression of phosphomimetic oncogenic KRAS resulted in diminished expression of genes involved in enterocyte differentiation, such as HNF4G. Finally, the analysis, in a public data set of human colorectal cancer, of the gene expression signatures associated with phosphomimetic and nonphosphorylatable oncogenic KRAS suggests that this post-translational modification regulates tumor progression in patients."
https://openalex.org/W3164364752,"Adolescents take more risks than adults in the real world, but laboratory experiments do not consistently demonstrate this pattern. In the current study, we examine the possibility that age differences in decision making vary as a function of the nature of the task (e.g., how information about risk is learned) and contextual features of choices (e.g., the relative favorability of choice outcomes), due to age differences in psychological constructs and physiological processes related to choice (e.g., weighting of rare probabilities, sensitivity to expected value, sampling, pupil dilation). Adolescents and adults made the same 24 choices between risky and safe options twice: once based on descriptions of each option, and once based on experience gained from sampling the options repeatedly. We systematically varied contextual features of options, facilitating a fine-grained analysis of age differences in response to these features. Eye-tracking and experience-sampling measures allowed tests of age differences in predecisional processes. Results in adolescent and adult participants were similar in several respects, including mean risk-taking rates and eye-gaze patterns. However, adolescents' and adults' choice behavior and process measures varied as a function of decision context. Surprisingly, age differences were most pronounced in description, with only marginal differences in experience. Results suggest that probability weighting, expected-value sensitivity, experience sampling and pupil dilation patterns may change with age. Overall, results are consistent with the notion that adolescents are more prone than adults to take risks when faced with unlikely but costly negative outcomes, and broadly point to complex interactions between multiple psychological constructs that develop across adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W3185413424,"Many H+-pump rhodopsins conserve ""H+ donor"" residues in cytoplasmic (CP) half channels to quickly transport H+ from the CP medium to Schiff bases at the center of these proteins. For conventional H+ pumps, the donors are conserved as Asp or Glu but are replaced by Lys in the minority, such as Exiguobacterium sibiricum rhodopsin (ESR). In dark states, carboxyl donors are protonated, whereas the Lys donor is deprotonated. As a result, carboxyl donors first donate H+ to the Schiff bases and then capture the other H+ from the medium, whereas the Lys donor first captures H+ from the medium and then donates it to the Schiff base. Thus, carboxyl and Lys-type H+ pumps seem to have different mechanisms, which are probably optimized for their respective H+-transfer reactions. Here, we examined these differences via replacement of donor residues. For Asp-type deltarhodopsin (DR), the embedded Lys residue distorted the protein conformation and did not act as the H+ donor. In contrast, for Glu-type proteorhodopsin (PR) and ESR, the embedded residues functioned well as H+ donors. These differences were further examined by focusing on the activation volumes during the H+-transfer reactions. The results revealed essential differences between archaeal H+ pump (DR) and eubacterial H+ pumps PR and ESR. Archaeal DR requires significant hydration of the CP channel for the H+-transfer reactions; however, eubacterial PR and ESR require the swing-like motion of the donor residue rather than hydration. Given this common mechanism, donor residues might be replaceable between eubacterial PR and ESR."
https://openalex.org/W3192286680,"This study assessed the postoperative severity after three different visceral surgical interventions in rats by using objective parameters pertaining to various disciplines. The objective was to evaluate whether the degree of severity increases with the invasiveness of the intervention and whether this is in accordance with the EU Directive 2010/63. 136 adult male WistarHan rats were assigned to three groups: Sham-laparotomy (Sham) [7 days post-surgical survival time]; 50% partial hepatectomy (PH); 70% PH [PH groups with 1, 3, or 7 days post-surgical survival times]. Post-surgical severity assessment was performed via several multimodal assessment tools: I) model-specific score sheet focusing on body weight, general condition, spontaneous behavior, and the animals’ willingness to move as well as on wound healing; II) Open Field tests evaluating the total distance and velocity an animal moved within 10 minutes and its rearing behavior during the test; III) telemetric data analyzing heart rate and blood pressure; and IV) analysis of blood (AST, ALT, and hemogram) and fecal samples (fecal corticosterone metabolites). Significant differences among the experimental groups and models were observed. We demonstrated that the Open Field test can detect significant changes in severity levels. Sham-laparotomy and removal of 50% of the liver mass were associated with comparable severity (mild–moderate); the severity parameters returned to baseline levels within seven days. Removal of 70% of the liver tissue seemed to be associated with a moderate severity grade and entailed a longer recovery period (&gt;7 days) for complete regeneration. We recommend the use of Open Field tests as part of multimodal objective severity assessment."
https://openalex.org/W3192633221,"Background Identifying which octogenarians could benefit most from continuing critical care is challenging. We aimed to see if responses to therapies using the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score on day 4 after unplanned admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) could be associated with short-term mortality. Methods In this prospective observational cohort study, data from 4 ICUs in a University Hospital included SOFA scores on admission and day 4, along with preadmission measurements of frailty, comorbidities, nutritional status and number of medications. Outcome measures included mortality and loss of autonomy on day 90 after admission. Results Eighty-seven critically ill patients aged 80 years or older with preadmission functional independence and no missing SOFA score data on day 4 were studied (primary analyses). The mortality rate on day 90 was 30%. In a univariate Cox model, the SOFA score on day 4 was significantly associated with mortality rate: hazard ratio = 1.18 per one-point increase, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08 to 1.28 (p&lt;0.001). A SOFA score of 6 or more on day 4 could correctly classify 75% of patients who died on day 90, with a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 84%. After adjustment, the SOFA score on day 4, neurological failure on admission and the number of preadmission medications were significantly associated with mortality on day 90, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.91). These findings were confirmed in a sensitivity analysis with 109 patients. Preadmission frailty was the only variable independently associated with loss of autonomy in the 49 surviving patients. Conclusion Measuring SOFA score on day 4 and preadmission frailty could help predict mortality and loss of autonomy on day 90 in octogenarians after their acute admission to the ICU."
https://openalex.org/W3183462721,"Yearly, about 1.5 million people become chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and for the 71 million with chronic HCV infection about 400,000 die from related morbidities, including liver cirrhosis and cancer. Effective treatments exist, but challenges including cost-of-treatment and wide-spread undiagnosed infection, necessitates the development of vaccines. Vaccines should induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against the HCV envelope (E) transmembrane glycoprotein 2, E2, which partly depends on its interaction partner, E1, for folding. Here, we generated three soluble HCV envelope protein antigens with the transmembrane regions deleted (i.e., fused peptide backbones), termed sE1E2 (E1 followed by E2), sE2E1 (E2 followed by E1), and sE21E (E2 followed by inverted E1). The E1 inversion for sE21E positions C-terminal residues of E1 near C-terminal residues of E2, which is in analogy to how they likely interact in native E1/E2 complexes. Probing conformational E2 epitope binding using HCV patient-derived human monoclonal antibodies, we show that sE21E was superior to sE2E1, which was consistently superior to sE1E2. This correlated with improved induction of NAbs by sE21E compared with sE2E1 and especially compared with sE1E2 in female BALB/c mouse immunizations. The deletion of the 27 N-terminal amino acids of E2, termed hypervariable region 1 (HVR1), conferred slight increases in antigenicity for sE2E1 and sE21E, but severely impaired induction of antibodies able to neutralize in vitro viruses retaining HVR1. Finally, comparing sE21E with sE2 in mouse immunizations, we show similar induction of heterologous NAbs. In summary, we find that C-terminal E2 fusion of E1 or 1E is superior to N-terminal fusion, both in terms of antigenicity and the induction of heterologous NAbs. This has relevance when designing HCV E1E2 vaccine antigens."

Our aim was to determine the prognostic value of a newly developed, high-sensitivity troponin I assay (Atellica®, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF < 40%) and HF with mid-range EF (HFmrEF) (LVEF 40%-49%).A total of 520 patients with HFrEF and HFmrEF were enrolled in this study. Two-year all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, and/or left ventricular assist device implantation were defined as the primary endpoints (EP). A logistic regression analysis was used for the identification of predictors and development of multivariable models. The EP occurred in 14% of the patients, and these patients had higher NT-proBNP (1,950 vs. 518 ng/l; p < 0.001) and hs-cTnI (34 vs. 17 ng/l, p < 0.001) levels. C-statistics demonstrated that the optimal cut-off value for the hs-cTnI level was 17 ng/l (AUC 0.658, p < 0.001). Described by the AUC, the discriminatory power of the multivariable model (NYHA > II, NT-proBNP, hs-cTnI and urea) was 0.823 (p < 0.001). Including heart failure hospitalization as the component of the combined secondary endpoint leads to a diminished predictive power of increased hs-cTnI.hs-cTnI levels ≥ 17 ng/l represent an independent increased risk of an adverse prognosis for patients with HFrEF and HFmrEF. Determining a patient's hs-cTnI level adds prognostic value to NT-proBNP and clinical parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3189449259,"Fruit firmness and in particular the individual components of texture and moisture loss, are considered the key quality traits when describing blueberry fruit quality, and whilst these traits are genetically regulated, the mechanisms governing their control are not clearly understood. In this investigation, RNAseq was performed on fruits of two blueberry cultivars with very different storage properties, ‘Bluecrop’ and ‘Legacy’, at harvest, three weeks storage in a non-modified environment at 4 °C and after three weeks storage at 4 °C followed by three days at 21 °C, with the aim of understanding the transcriptional changes that occur during storage in cultivars with very different post-harvest fruit quality. De novo assemblies of the transcriptomes of the two cultivars were performed separately and a total of 39,335 and 41,896 unigenes for ‘Bluecrop’ and ‘Legacy’ respectively were resolved. Differential gene expression analyses were grouped into four cluster profiles based on changes in transcript abundance between harvest and 24 days post-harvest. A total of 290 unigenes were up-regulated in ‘Legacy’ only, 685 were up-regulated in ‘Bluecrop’, 252 were up-regulated in both cultivars and 948 were down-regulated in both cultivars between harvest and 24 days post-harvest. Unigenes showing significant differential expression between harvest and following post-harvest cold-storage were grouped into classes of biological processes including stress responses, cell wall metabolism, wax metabolism, calcium metabolism, cellular components, and biological processes. In total 21 differentially expressed unigenes with a putative role in regulating the response to post-harvest cold-storage in the two cultivars were identified from the de novo transcriptome assemblies performed. The results presented provide a stable foundation from which to perform further analyses with which to functionally validate the candidate genes identified, and to begin to understand the genetic mechanisms controlling changes in firmness in blueberry fruits post-harvest."
https://openalex.org/W3189810817,"This study was aimed at exploring whether latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) contributes to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in a TB endemic setting. We screened 198 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with tuberculin skin test (TST) and studied 61 (median DAS28-ESR = 6.3) who were positive. Whole blood T cell proliferative responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) membrane (MtM) antigens, including the latency-induced protein alpha crystallin (Acr), were determined by flow cytometry using Ki67 expression as the marker for nuclear proliferation. Serum antibody levels were determined by ELISA. Follow-up investigations (at 3-6, 9-12 and 15-18 months after baseline) were performed in 41 patients who were classified empirically as 'high' (HR-T/HR-B) or 'low' (LR-T/LR-B) responders based on their dynamic T cell or antibody responses. Significant correlations were seen between baseline T cell responses to MtM and Acr, and between IgG, IgA and IgM antibody responses to MtM. However, no correlation was seen between T and B cell responses. At all time points during the follow-up, T cell responses to both antigens (except for MtM at one point) were significantly higher in HR-T (n = 25) than LR-T (n = 16) patients. Levels of IgA and IgM (but not IgG) antibodies to MtM were also significantly higher in HR-B (n = 13) than LR-B (n = 28) at all time points. Importantly, HR-T patients exhibited significantly higher baseline and follow-up DAS28 scores than LR-T. Ten (of 61) patients had a history of TB and developed RA 6 years (median) after contracting TB. Three new TB cases (1 from TST-positive and 2 from TST-negative groups) emerged during the follow-up. Our results suggest that persistently elevated T cell responses to Mtb antigens may contribute to disease activity in RA."
https://openalex.org/W3192600626,"Most current clinical vaccines work primarily by inducing the production of neutralizing antibodies against pathogens. Vaccine adjuvants that efficiently induce T cell responses to protein antigens need to be developed. In this study, we developed a new combination adjuvant consisting of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP), D35, and an aluminum salt. Among the various combinations tested, the DOTAP/D35/aluminum salt adjuvant induced strong T cell and antibody responses against the model protein antigen with a single immunization. Adjuvant component and model antigen interaction studies in vitro also revealed that the strong mutual interactions among protein antigens and other components were one of the important factors for this efficient immune induction by the novel combination adjuvant. In addition, in vivo imaging of the antigen distribution suggested that the DOTAP component in the combination adjuvant formulation elicited transient antigen accumulation at the draining lymph nodes, possibly by antigen uptake DC migration. These results indicate the potential of the new combination adjuvant as a promising vaccine adjuvant candidate to treat infectious diseases and cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3185957404,"Abstract Melanomas driven by loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor have a high risk of treatment failure and effective therapies have not been developed. Here we show that loss-of-function mutations of nf1 and pten result in aggressive melanomas in zebrafish, representing the first animal model of NF1-mutant melanomas harboring PTEN loss. MEK or PI3K inhibitors show little activity when given alone due to cross-talk between the pathways, and high toxicity when given together. The mTOR inhibitors, sirolimus, everolimus, and temsirolimus, were the most active single agents tested, potently induced tumor-suppressive autophagy, but not apoptosis. Because addition of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax resulted in compensatory upregulation of MCL1, we established a three-drug combination composed of sirolimus, venetoclax, and the MCL1 inhibitor S63845. This well-tolerated drug combination potently and synergistically induces apoptosis in both zebrafish and human NF1/PTEN-deficient melanoma cells, providing preclinical evidence justifying an early-stage clinical trial in patients with NF1/PTEN-deficient melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3187502254,"How abstract shape is perceived and represented poses crucial unsolved problems in human perception and cognition. Recent findings suggest that the visual system may encode contours as sets of connected constant curvature segments. Here we describe a model for how the visual system might recode a set of boundary points into a constant curvature representation. The model includes two free parameters that relate to the degree to which the visual system encodes shapes with high fidelity vs. the importance of simplicity in shape representations. We conducted two experiments to estimate these parameters empirically. Experiment 1 tested the limits of observers’ ability to discriminate a contour made up of two constant curvature segments from one made up of a single constant curvature segment. Experiment 2 tested observers’ ability to discriminate contours generated from cubic splines (which, mathematically, have no constant curvature segments) from constant curvature approximations of the contours, generated at various levels of precision. Results indicated a clear transition point at which discrimination becomes possible. The results were used to fix the two parameters in our model. In Experiment 3, we tested whether outputs from our parameterized model were predictive of perceptual performance in a shape recognition task. We generated shape pairs that had matched physical similarity but differed in representational similarity (i.e., the number of segments needed to describe the shapes) as assessed by our model. We found that pairs of shapes that were more representationally dissimilar were also easier to discriminate in a forced choice, same/different task. The results of these studies provide evidence for constant curvature shape representation in human visual perception and provide a testable model for how abstract shape descriptions might be encoded."
https://openalex.org/W3188187739,"Background Despite the growing public awareness of the adverse health effects of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) consumption in Mexico, little is known about the population’s intention to reduce SSB consumption and the social value of interventions to accomplish such behavioral change. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the willingness to pay (WTP) for an intervention that reduces soda consumption by half in Mexico. Methods We applied contingent valuation methods in a sample of 471 Mexican adults from a cohort study. We assessed the relative value of benefits by providing incremental information to participants in three scenarios: soda consumption reduction, + health benefits, + social benefits. To estimate factors associated with the WTP, we ran an interval regression. Results 87% of respondents reported they would like to reduce SSB consumption. High soda consumption, intention to reduce soda consumption and higher household income are associated with higher WTP. We found that the WTP increases as additional benefits are provided. The WTP, as a proportion of income, is higher for the lowest income level. Conclusion The average WTP per person may be seen as the minimum amount the country should invest on interventions to reduce soda consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3192059429,"Background Kidney organoids have been broadly obtained from commercially available induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); however, it has been a great challenge to efficiently produce renal organoid models from patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) that recapitulate both embryogenesis and the mechanisms of cystogenesis. Methods Blood erythroid progenitors (EPs) from two ADPKD patients and one healthy donor (HC) was used as a comparative control to normalize the many technical steps for reprogramming EPs and for the organoids generation. EPs were reprogrammed by an episomal vector into iPSCs, which were differentiated into renal tubular organoids and then stimulated by forskolin to induce cysts formation. Results iPSCs derived from EPs exhibited all characteristics of pluripotency and were able to differentiate into all three germ layers. 3D tubular organoids were generated from single cells after 28 days in Matrigel. HC and ADPKD organoids did not spontaneously form cysts, but upon forskolin stimulation, cysts-like structures were observed in the ADPKD organoids but not in the HC-derived organoids. Conclusion The findings of this study showed that kidney organoids were successfully generated from the blood EP cells of ADPKD patients and a healthy control donor. This approach should contribute as a powerful tool for embryonic kidney development model, which is able to recapitulate the very early pathophysiological mechanisms involved in cytogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3192531219,"Online social networks like Twitter and Facebook are among the most popular sites on the Internet. Most online social networks involve some specific features, including reciprocity, transitivity and degree heterogeneity. Such networks are so called scale-free networks and have drawn lots of attention in research. The aim of this paper is to develop a novel methodology for directed network embedding within the latent space model (LSM) framework. It is known, the link probability between two individuals may increase as the features of each become similar, which is referred to as homophily attributes. To this end, penalized pair-specific attributes, acting as a distance measure, are introduced to provide with more powerful interpretation and improve link prediction accuracy, named penalized homophily latent space models (PHLSM). The proposed models also involve in-degree heterogeneity of directed scale-free networks by embedding with the popularity scales. We also introduce LASSO-based PHLSM to produce an accurate and sparse model for high-dimensional covariates. We make Bayesian inference using MCMC algorithms. The finite sample performance of the proposed models is evaluated by three benchmark simulation datasets and two real data examples. Our methods are competitive and interpretable, they outperform existing approaches for fitting directed networks."
https://openalex.org/W3185644951,"Griffiths et al. (2017) analyzed several ponds and lakes from the Cape Herschel region of Ellesmere Island in order to ""…explicitly examine the role of ice cover as the dominant driver of diatom assemblage change…"". I reanalyze their data and suggest that their classification scheme, that they propose is due to differences in ice cover seasonality (""warm"", ""cool"", ""cold"", and ""oasis""), is confounded with other morphological and chemical variables that better explain the differences between the groups. The ""cold"" sites are the deepest (lakes) and differ from the small, shallow ponds that occasionally dry, which would therefore have different diatom assemblages and histories. The ""oasis"" sites are nutrient enriched and probably have more stable water supplies, thereby enabling an aquatic flora providing habitats for diatoms. A key part of their interpretation is that ""warm"" sites have responded more rapidly to recent climate change than ""cold"" or ""cool"" sites, but their chronologies do not allow for such a conclusion. There is no clear difference between ""cool"" and ""warm"" sites, and problems in dating the sequences means inferences about their histories are not supported by data. Their results, which are restricted to the past century, are contradicted by a Holocene sequence from the region."
