https://openalex.org/W1966337818,"The three main types of land reclamation in aboriginal America were irrigation, terracing, and drainage. Of these, drainage techniques have received the least attention, probably because they are no longer important and because the remnants are not conspicuous. Nevertheless, drained-field cultivation was widespread and was practiced in varied environments, including high-land basins, tropical savannas, and temperate flood plains. Sites ranged from seasonally waterlogged or flooded areas to permanent lakes. Ridging, mounding, and ditching were emphasized, rather than diking. Tools were simple, crops varied, and fertilization was accomplished mainly by mulching."
https://openalex.org/W2043148832,"The train of thought pursued in this article has led to the conclusion that the structure of cold water seems likely to consist, for the most part, of hydrogen-bonded, four-coordinated, framework regions, with interstitial monomers occupying some fraction of the cavities the framework encloses. The precise geometry of the framework has not been specified, but some evidence suggests that it is rather regular at low temperatures and becomes more random as the water gets warmer. These conclusions, meager as they are in comparison with what we shall eventually need to know about water, are still ""subject to change without notice."" Such a change would, for instance, be made necessary by the discrediting either of the data or of the interpretations on which the model is based. The discovery of new facts, or of new meanings in old facts, which were clearly in conflict with the model, would also make it necessary to modify, if not to abandon, it. Even this would be progress, however, for it would be another product of the method of drawing upon data from diverse sources and would be a further step toward the progressively more comprehensive model to which this method will lead and the progressively greater confidence we will be able to place in our conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W1990969658,"Thioformaldehyde (H2CS) has been detected and characterized from its microwave spectrum. Preliminary analysis of rotational transitions for the sulfur-32-containing form of H2CS shows this new species to have C2Î½ symmetry with rotational constants (in megahertz) of A = 292,729, B = 17,698, and C = 16,652. The possibility of detection of thioformaldehyde in the interstellar medium is discussed, and a table of transitions expected to be of importance for that detection is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1990679753,"A new group of giant radioactive halos has been found with radii in excess of anything previously discovered. Since alternate explanations for these giant halos are inconclusive at present, the possibility is considered that they originate with unknown alpha radioactivity, either from isomers of known elements or from superheavy elements."
https://openalex.org/W2006580057,Sterolic fractions have been isolated from Recent marine sediments representing two different environments. The fractions were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and thin-layer chromatography. The major sterols in the fractions were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The demonstrated survival of these common plant and animal sterols for several thousand years suggests that these molecules will be useful geochemical indicators.
https://openalex.org/W2041523097,The absorption spectrum of formaldehyde has been measured photo-electrically from 650 to 1850 angstroms. A broad continuum observed at wavelengths shorter than 1570 angstroms will be the major spectral feature contributing to the formaldehyde lifetime in the interstellar radiation field.

https://openalex.org/W2157255584,A search has been made for the 1(10) <-- 1(11) transition of thioformaldehyde in interstellar clouds where formaldehyde is known to exist. Failure to detect this transition indicates that the ratio of thioformaldehyde abundance to that of formaldehyde is probably less than the abundance ratio of sulfur to oxygen.

https://openalex.org/W2053529628,"It is difficult to estimate the area affected by an oil spill at sea, the degree of coverage by oil pollutants within the affected area, and the quantity of pollutants involved. Estimates of volumes and flow rates are based on estimated changes in areal extent of the spill. Uncertainties in measurement of area degrade the accuracy of estimating other parameters. To resolve this problem, available stock components have now been assembled into a system that yields repeatable, economical measurement of the areal extent of oil spills at acceptable levels of accuracy. The system comprises overflights with a thermal infrared imaging system, densitometric color enhancement of the infrared images, and automatic digital planimetry of the areas of specified image densities."
