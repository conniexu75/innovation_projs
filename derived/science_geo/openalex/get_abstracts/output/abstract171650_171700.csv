https://openalex.org/W1993478293,"Event-related fMRI was employed to characterize differences in brain activation between children ages 8–12 and adults related to two forms of cognitive control: interference suppression and response inhibition. Children were more susceptible to interference and less able to inhibit inappropriate responses than were adults. Effective interference suppression in children was associated with prefrontal activation in the opposite hemisphere relative to adults. In contrast, effective response inhibition in children was associated with activation of posterior, but not prefrontal, regions activated by adults. Children failed to activate a region in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex that was recruited for both types of cognitive control by adults. Thus, children exhibited immature prefrontal activation that varied according to the type of cognitive control required."

https://openalex.org/W2165287928,"During development, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons either cross or avoid the midline at the optic chiasm. In Drosophila, the Slit protein regulates midline axon crossing through repulsion. To determine the role of Slit proteins in RGC axon guidance, we disrupted Slit1 and Slit2, two of three known mouse Slit genes. Mice defective in either gene alone exhibited few RGC axon guidance defects, but in double mutant mice a large additional chiasm developed anterior to the true chiasm, many retinal axons projected into the contralateral optic nerve, and some extended ectopically-dorsal and lateral to the chiasm. Our results indicate that Slit proteins repel retinal axons in vivo and cooperate to establish a corridor through which the axons are channeled, thereby helping define the site in the ventral diencephalon where the optic chiasm forms."
https://openalex.org/W2014651004,"We report that Slit proteins, a family of secreted chemorepellents, are crucial for the proper development of several major forebrain tracts. Mice deficient in Slit2 and, even more so, mice deficient in both Slit1 and Slit2 show significant axon guidance errors in a variety of pathways, including corticofugal, callosal, and thalamocortical tracts. Analysis of multiple pathways suggests several generalizations regarding the functions of Slit proteins in the brain, which appear to contribute to (1) the maintenance of dorsal position by prevention of axonal growth into ventral regions, (2) the prevention of axonal extension toward and across the midline, and (3) the channeling of axons toward particular regions."
https://openalex.org/W1996892555,"Previous studies have demonstrated that several splice variants are derived from both the caspase 9 and Bcl-x genes in which the Bcl-x splice variant, Bcl-x(L) and the caspase 9 splice variant, caspase 9b, inhibit apoptosis in contrast to the pro-apoptotic splice variants, Bcl-x(s) and caspase 9. In a recent study, we showed that ceramide induces the dephosphorylation of SR proteins, a family of protein factors that regulate alternative splicing. In this study, the regulation of the alternative processing of pre-mRNA of both caspase 9 and Bcl-x(L) was examined in response to ceramide. Treatment of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells with cell-permeable ceramide, D-e-C6 ceramide, down-regulated the levels of Bcl-x(L) and caspase 9b mRNA and immunoreactive protein with a concomitant increase in the mRNA and immunoreactive protein levels of Bcl-x(s) and caspase 9 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Pretreatment with calyculin A (5 nm), an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) blocked ceramide-induced alternative splicing in contrast to okadaic acid (10 nm), a specific inhibitor of PP2A at this concentrations in cells, demonstrating a PP1-mediated mechanism. A role for endogenous ceramide in regulating the alternative splicing of caspase 9 and Bcl-x was demonstrated using the chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine. Treatment of A549 cells with gemcitabine (1 μm) increased ceramide levels 3-fold via the de novo sphingolipid pathway as determined by pulse labeling experiments and inhibition studies with myriocin (50 nm), a specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase (the first step in de novo synthesis of ceramide). Treatment of A549 cells with gemcitabine down-regulated the levels of Bcl-x(L) and caspase 9b mRNA with a concomitant increase in the mRNA levels of Bcl-x(s) and caspase 9. Again, inhibitors of ceramide synthesis blocked this effect. We also demonstrate that the change in the alternative splicing of caspase 9 and Bcl-x occurred prior to apoptosis following treatment with gemcitabine. Furthermore, doses of D-e-C6 ceramide that induce the alternative splicing of both caspase 9 and Bcl-x-sensitized A549 cells to daunorubicin. These data demonstrate a role for protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and endogenous ceramide generated via the de novopathway in regulating this mechanism. This is the first report on the dynamic regulation of RNA splicing of members of the Bcl-2 and caspase families in response to regulators of apoptosis.

In the case of cancer, interference with this system of programmed cell death can lead to expansion of deleterious cells. Apoptosis is regulated by multiple factors through complex mechanisms (3.Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Intl. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 68: 251-306Google Scholar, 4.Kerr J.F. Winterford C.M. Harmon B.V.

It has become well established that many inducers of apoptosis activate caspases, and that the activation of these proteases is perhaps the point of irreversible commitment to the onset of apoptosis (5.Tewari M.

Furthermore, the Bcl-2 family has also been widely implicated in regulating apoptotic machinery (6.Reed J.C. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N.

Although recognized for metabolic and mitogenic pathways, the importance of alternative splicing in apoptosis and its mechanisms of regulation have been overlooked and largely unstudied. In other lines of investigation, studies have led to the identification of ceramide as a potential inducer and mediator/regulator of apoptosis in response to tumor necrosis factor α and many chemotherapeutic agents (20–31). More recent studies have begun to relate the action of ceramide to Bcl-2 and death caspases (20.Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A.

While searching for direct targets of ceramide, a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP) was identified. To date, two families of protein phosphatases, protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), have been shown to be activated by ceramide in vitro (34.Law B. Rossie S. J. Biol.

With the demonstration of PP1 as a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase, potential PP1 substrates and mechanisms regulated by PP1 became candidate targets for ceramide action. SR proteins, a family of arginine/serine-rich domain containing proteins and specific PP1 substrates, are required for constitutive and alternative pre-mRNA processing (38.Misteli T. Spector D.L.

Therefore, PP1 may play a role in regulating RNA processing in response to stimuli, in particular, it may define a pathway linking ceramide to the regulation of the alternative splicing of apoptosis regulators. In this study, endogenous ceramides produced via the de novosphingolipid pathway are shown to regulate the alternative pre-mRNA processing of caspase 9 and Bcl-x pre-mRNA. Furthermore, this novel and newly defined mechanism is shown to be mediated by protein phosphatase-1. A549 adenocarcinoma cells were grown in a 50% RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) mixture supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 200 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells were maintained at less than 80% confluency under standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). For treatments with D-e-C6 ceramide, A549 cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/35-mm plate in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The sample was then separated into an upper aqueous phase and a lower organic phase by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and the RNA was precipitated by the addition of 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. The precipitant was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and RNA was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% ice-cold ethanol, and the RNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water for storage at −80 °C. For both Bcl-x and caspase 9 analysis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) as the priming agent. After 1 h incubation at 43.5 °C, the reactions were stopped by 70 °C heating for 15 min. Template RNA was then removed using RNase H (Invitrogen). For evaluating Bcl-x splice variant expression, an upstream 5′ primer to Bcl-x (5′-GAGGCAGGCGACGAGTTTGAA-3′) and a 3′ primer (3′-TGGGAGGGTAGAGTGGATGGT-5′) were used. Using these primers, 10% of the reverse transcriptase reaction was amplified for 35 cycles (94 °C, 30s; 58 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min) using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). For evaluating caspase 9 splice variant expression, an upstream 5′ primer to caspase 9 (5′-GCTCTTCCTTTGTTCATCTCC-3′) and a 3′ primer (5′-CATCTGGCTCGGGGTTACTGC-3′) were used. Using these primers, 10% of the reverse transcriptase reaction was amplified for 35 cycles (94 °C, 30s; 58 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min) using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The caspase 9 and caspase 9b riboprobe templates were constructed by cloning the RT-PCR fragments for caspase 9 (724 bp) and caspase 9b (274 bp) into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector. Constructs were verified for orientation and the lack of mutagenesis by DNA sequencing. To produce caspase 9 cRNA, the riboprobe construct for caspase 9 was restriction digested with NciI, and caspase 9 cRNA (32P-labeled) was produced using the BD PharMingen in vitrotranscription system and SP6 RNA polymerase (Sigma). To produce cRNA for caspase 9b, the riboprobe construct for caspase 9b was restriction digested with BamHI, and caspase 9b cRNA (32P-labeled) was produced using the BD PharMingen in vitro transcription system. The Bcl-x(L/s) riboprobe template was part of the hAPO2 multitemplate set from BD PharMingen and labeled following the standard protocol. Total RNA (5 μg) from A549 cells was hybridized to 500,000 cpm of 32P-labeled cRNA probe using the BD PharMingen ribonuclease protection assay system. RNase-protected fragments were produced following the manufacturer's protocol. Protected RNA fragments were resolved on 5% PAGE-7m urea gels (Bio-Rad), dried at 80 °C for 1 h, and autoradiograms produced using Bio-Max film (Kodak). Total protein was extracted by direct lysis with Laemmli buffer. Cells were lysed with 0.1 ml of 2 × Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, and 250 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) after resuspension in 0.1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were boiled for 10 min and either examined directly by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or stored at −20 °C. Total protein lysate (20 μg) was subjected to 6% (PARP), 12% (caspase 9/9b), or 15% (Bcl-x(L/s) SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked in 5% milk, 1 × PBS-T (M-PBS-T) for 2 h. The membrane was incubated with anti-PARP (Santa Cruz), anti-Bcl-x IgG (Santa Cruz (P19)), or anti-caspase 9 IgG (Stressgen) for 2 h in M-PBS-T followed by 3 washes with PBS-T. The membrane was then incubated with a secondary antibody of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody for 45 min followed by 3 washes with PBS-T. Immunoblots were developed using Amersham ECL reagents and Bio-Max film. 2 × 106 A549 cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid (16.7 nm) with simultaneous addition of gemcitabine. After 24 h, lipids were extracted from the radiolabled cells using the Bligh-Dyer method as described (52.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Ceramide levels were measured following TLC analysis and normalized to total lipid phosphate as described (53.Perry D.K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9078-9084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 104 A549 cells were plated into each well of a 96-well plate in a 50-μl volume. After 24 h at standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C), the cells were treated with the appropriate concentration of D-e-C6 ceramide or gemcitabine in a 50-μl volume and returned to the incubator. After the appropriate time, 25 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added and cells were again incubated under standard conditions for 5 h. Cells were then lysed and solubilized by the addition of 100 μl of lysis solution (20% SDS (w/v), 50% dimethyl formamide (v/v), and 0.8% acetic acid). The plate was read at A595. Tests were done in triplicate on at least two separate occasions. The standard deviations and standard error of mean were determined after quantitating a change in the ratio of one alternative splice variant versus another following treatment as compared with untreated and sham control samples. It was determined that a two-way ANOVA at p < 0.05 to be significant. All statistical tests were done with StatView software (SSI Corp.) and Microsoft EXCEL. We have previously reported that SR proteins, a family of factors that regulate alternative splicing, are dephosphorylated in a time- and dose-dependent manner in response to ceramide (49.Chalfant C.E.

Since many apoptosis-regulating factors have alternative splice variants with antagonistic function, ceramide was examined for effects on the pre-mRNA processing of Bcl-x, caspase 9, Bax, and caspase 2. Using an RT-PCR-based assay (Fig. 1, A and B), it was found that overnight treatment of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells with 20 μm D-e-C6 ceramide (sub-IC50dose for a 24-h period in A549 cells) (IC50 = 37 μm) resulted in altering the ratio of the splice variants of Bcl-x and caspase 9 (Fig. 2, A and B), but not Bax or caspase 2 (data not shown). In the case of Bcl-x, there was a decrease in the ratio of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-x(s) from 9.1 to 4.3 (Fig. 2A), and in the case of caspase 9, there was an increase in the ratio of caspase 9/caspase 9b from 6.5 to 22.7 (Fig. 2B).Figure 2The effect of exogenous ceramide on Bcl-x 5′ splice site selection and caspase 9 alternative splicing.A, the effect of exogenous ceramide on Bcl-x 5′ splice site selection.

Using the RPA assay, caspase 9 mRNA was found to be increased ∼9-fold following ceramide treatment with 64.5% decrease in caspase 9b mRNA (Fig. 2B). For Bcl-x, Bcl-x(L) mRNA was found to be decreased 42% and Bcl-x(s) mRNA which was undetectable in control cells was now detectable following ceramide treatment (Fig. 2A). The RPA was normalized to L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs (Fig. 2C). The effects on mRNA levels translated to the protein level as ceramide treatment decreased the immunoreactive protein levels of Bcl-x(L) by 67% with a concomitant 2.5-fold increase in the immunoreactive protein levels of Bcl-x(s) (Fig. 3A). Similarly at the protein level, ceramide induced an increase in the immunoreactive protein levels of caspase 9 and a concomitant decrease in the immunoreactive protein levels of caspase 9b (Fig. 3B). Thus, since ceramide increases one splice variant followed by a decrease in the other splice variant, these data demonstrate that ceramide affects the alternative splicing of caspase 9 and Bcl-x in a manner that promotes apoptosis. The effects of ceramide on the pre-mRNA processing of Bcl-x and caspase 9 were time- and dose-dependent. For caspase 9, an increase in the caspase 9/caspase 9b ratio was noticeable by 12 h, and 5 μm D-e-C6 ceramide induced profound effects on the alternative splicing of caspase 9, increasing the ratio of caspase 9/caspase 9b to 14.6 with a maximal increase of 22.7 at 20 μm after 24 h (Fig. 4,A and B). In contrast, ceramide did not affect the alternative splicing of Bcl-x until after 16 h of ceramide treatment with maximal effects at 36 h (Fig. 4C). Similar to caspase 9, at least 5 μm D-e-C6ceramide was necessary to induce a significant decrease in the ratio of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-x(s) (Fig. 4D). Therefore, the effect of ceramide treatment of the alternative splicing of caspase 9 and Bcl-x is dose- and time-dependent. Previously, the dephosphorylation of SR proteins in response to the generation of endogenous ceramide was found to be dependent on PP1, a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (49.Chalfant C.E.

To establish whether a ceramide-activated protein phosphatase plays a role in regulating the alternative splicing of caspase 9 and Bcl-x, we pretreated A549 cells for 2 h with 5 nm calyculin A, an inhibitor of both PP1 and PP2A-type protein phosphatases. Calyculin A completely blocked the ceramide effects on caspase 9 and Bcl-x alternative splicing (Fig. 5,A and B). To establish whether PP1 or PP2A was the ceramide-responsive protein phosphatase regulating caspase 9 and Bcl-x alternative splicing, A549 cells were pretreated for 2 h with 10 nm okadaic acid, a selective PP2A inhibitor at this dose in cells (49.Chalfant C.E.

Pretreatment with okadaic acid had no effect on either caspase 9 or Bcl-x alternative splicing (Fig. 5,A and B). Calyculin A, but not okadaic acid also inhibited the effect of ceramide on the immunoreactive levels of caspase 9 and Bcl-x. Taken together, these results suggest that PP1 mediates the effects of ceramide on the alternative splicing of both caspase 9 and Bcl-x. Exogenous ceramide treatment has been demonstrated to increase endogenous ceramide via deacylation/reacylation in A549 cells. 2Ogretmen, B., Pettus, B. J., Rossi, M.

A key enzyme in this pathway is CoA-dependent ceramide synthase, and fumonisin B1 is a highly specific fungal inhibitor of this enzyme (57.Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Since the dephosphorylation of SR proteins in response to exogenous ceramide treatment was found to be dependent on endogenous ceramide generated via CoA-dependent ceramide synthase (49.Chalfant C.E.

Pretreatment of A549 cells were for 2 h with 100 μmfumonisin B1, a dose established to block CoA-dependent ceramide synthase in A549 cells, completely inhibited both caspase 9 and Bcl-x alternative splicing in response to ceramide (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, endogenous ceramide generated through the action of the CoA-dependent ceramide synthase is implicated in regulating the alternative splicing of Bcl-x and caspase 9 pre-mRNA.

Detailed kinetic analysis of constitutive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling processes revealed that IκBα enters the nucleus faster than p65. Examination of signaling molecules upstream of NF-κB and IκBα revealed a predominant cytoplasmic localization at steady state. However, after addition of leptomycin B, NIK rapidly accumulated in the nucleus, whereas we could not detect any significant effect on TRAF2 or IKK2. Using various truncation mutants of NIK, we identified a functional nuclear export signal within the COOH-terminal region 795–805, which counteracts the inherent NLS at amino acids 143–149. Prolonged incubation in the presence of LMB also leads to nuclear accumulation of IKK1, which was dependent on a lysine residue at position 44, which is also essential for kinase activity. Investigation of endogenous protein levels by immunofluorescence staining and Western blots verified the results obtained with GFP chimeras. We conclude that NF-κB·IκB complexes and the upstream signaling kinases NIK and IKK1 shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus of nonactivated cells and that this process leads to a basal transcriptional activity of NF-κB.

Their common characteristic is a so-called Rel homology domain of about 300 amino acids, which is responsible both for binding to a consensus DNA sequence and for homo- or heterodimerization. One of the most important distinctions between various family members is the presence of a transactivation domain (e.g. in p65, RelB, or c-Rel), which is absent in the smaller subunits p50 and p52. nuclear factor-κB tumor necrosis factor-α nuclear localization signal IκB kinase nuclear export sequence human umbilical vein endothelial cells green fluorescent protein leptomycin B nuclear factor-κB tumor necrosis factor-α nuclear localization signal IκB kinase nuclear export sequence human umbilical vein endothelial cells green fluorescent protein leptomycin B The most abundant forms of NF-κB are p65/p50 heterodimers and p65/p65 homodimers, while other complexes were reported to have specific roles in certain cell types. In most cases, NF-κB dimers are kept inactive by binding to an inhibitory molecule of the IκB family, with IκBα being the most important one. Other members of this inhibitory family such as IκBβ or IκBε have been shown to differ from IκBα by their constitutive turnover and their signal-induced degradation (1.Siebenlist U. Franzoso G.

Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). An intriguing feature of NF-κB is that it can be activated by a vast variety of distinct stimuli, including not only inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα or interleukin-1, but also physical stress such as UV- or γ-irradiation, reactive oxygen intermediates, as well as virus-derived dsDNAs or RNAs (5.Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 6.Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar). Given its importance in chronic and acute inflammation and its potential as target in a great variety of diseases (7.Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 8.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 9.Wang C.Y.

Invest. 2001; 107: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), much effort was focused on the elucidation of signaling cascades leading to the activation of NF-κB. For the central inflammatory pathway of TNFα-mediated activation, it was shown that binding of the trimeric ligand results in a trimerization of corresponding receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) (11.Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), followed by the association of intracellular adapter proteins to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors. These adapter molecules comprise proteins with death domains such as TRADD (TNFR associated death domain protein), which bind to TNFR1, or proteins with a TRAF (TNFR associated factor) domain, which is also included in the cytoplasmic tail of TNFR2. Members of the latter family such as TRAF1 or TRAF2 can directly bind to TNFR2 or indirectly via TRADD to TNFR1. Since overexpression of TRAF2 activates NF-κB, and mutants lacking the NH2-terminal RING finger domain act as dominant negative inhibitors of this pathway, it is assumed that TRAF2 plays an important role in the signaling from the receptor to downstream kinases. However, studies with cells derived from TRAF2−/− mice indicated that its function can be taken over by other signaling proteins. It has been hypothesized that receptor-induced oligomerization of adapter proteins leads to binding, autophosphorylation, and activation of downstream kinases. Candidate enzymes are certain members of the MAP (mitogen-activated protein) 3 kinase (MAP3K) family. One of these is the NF-κB inducing kinase NIK, which interacts with various members of the TRAF family. Another kinase that has been assumed to be involved in NF-κB activation is MEKK1, which has been shown to interact specifically with TRAF2 via its RING finger domain. However, recent knockout studies suggest that NIK or MEKK1 alone are dispensable for activation of NF-κB by certain stimuli such as interleukin-1 or TNFα (12.Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 13.Yujiri T. Ware M. Widmann C. Oyer R. Russell D. Chan E. Zaitsu Y. Clarke P.

A. 2000; 97: 7272-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), whereas NIK is essential for signaling via the lymphotoxin-β receptor (12.Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). This indicates a receptor- and cell type-specific action of different MAP 3-kinases. Although a great variety of stimuli activate NF-κB, apparently all the respective signaling pathways converge at the level of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex consisting of the kinases IKK1 and -2 and the essential adapter molecule NEMO/IKKγ. The IKKs are activated by phosphorylation at serine residues within the activation loop, and it was postulated that upstream activators might have certain specificity for one or the other kinase, such as NIK for IKK1 (14.Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Upon activation IκB kinases phosphorylate IκB family members at conserved serine residues in the NH2-terminal signal-responsive domain. This signal-induced phosphorylation results in ubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation of the inhibitor by 26 S proteasomes and release of NF-κB. The classical view of the regulation of NF-κB is that it is kept inactive by cytoplasmic retention due to binding to IκB proteins. IκB is thought to mask the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of NF-κB, thereby preventing the interaction of NF-κB with the nuclear import machinery. Moreover, the nonconventional NLS of IκB itself, located within the second ankyrin repeat, appears to be blocked when IκB is bound to NF-κB. Thus, the NLS of NF-κB is unmasked upon degradation of its inhibitor and the transcription factor can be imported into the nucleus, where it binds to specific promoter elements. Besides a number of other genes, NF-κB is also inducing the transcription of DNA encoding its own inhibitor (15.de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). After translation in the cytosol, IκB is imported into the nucleus, where it is assumed to dissociate NF-κB from promoter regions. The newly formed NF-κB·IκB complex is then transported back to the cytosol by the means of a specific nuclear export sequence (NES) of IκB. Whereas a putative NES was originally postulated for the COOH terminus of IκB (16.Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was recently shown that a NH2-terminal NES instead of the postulated COOH-terminal region is responsible for Crm1p-dependent nuclear export of IκB and the bound NF-κB (17.Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 18.Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it was also postulated that NF-κB contains a NES by itself (19.Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7088-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which would allow an IκB-independent nuclear export of this transcription factor. The finding that both molecules apparently contain NLS, as well as NES domains raises the question how the intracellular distribution of these proteins is regulated functionally in the course of activation and de-activation of the signaling pathway, as well as in quiescent cells. Recent reports could demonstrate that both NF-κB and IκB accumulate in the nucleus after addition of the nuclear export blocking agent leptomycin B in the absence of any additional signaling event (17.Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 18.Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence IκB is apparently not able to prevent the nuclear import of NF-κB. This observation implies that the principal inhibitory role of IκBα is not the cytosolic sequestration of the transcription factor, but rather to inhibit binding of NF-κB to specific DNA sequences and to shift its steady state localization to the cytosol. This view of NF-κB and IκB has further important consequences. Since all macromolecular complexes have a certain equilibrium between dissociation and association, the existence of nuclear NF-κB·IκB complexes should also lead to the occurrence of a certain number of NF-κB molecules that are not bound to the inhibitor and therefore free for binding to promoter elements. The dynamic equilibrium between IκB-bound and unbound NF-κB has to be postulated not only for the nuclear, but also for cytosolic complexes. Thus, association and dissociation of NF-κB and IκB in the cytosol would be accompanied by nuclear translocation of both molecules separate from each other and a corresponding binding equilibrium in the nucleus, counteracted by association of NF-κB with specific DNA sequences. The recent report by Carlotti et al. (20.Carlotti F. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41028-41034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) demonstrates that NF-κB and IκB dissociate from each other in the cytosol, followed by separate nuclear import, rather than a nuclear translocation of the whole NF-κB·IκB complexes as suggested based on the x-ray crystallographic data (21.Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 22.Huxford T. Huang D.B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The fact that both NF-κB and IκB accumulate in the nucleus after inhibition of nuclear export prompted us to test whether upstream signaling molecules of the NF-κB pathway shuttle between cytosol and nucleus as well. We observed a rapid nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the NF-κB inducing kinase NIK that was dependent both on an apparent classical NLS in the NH2-terminal region of NIK and a newly defined functional NES in the COOH-terminal domain. Moreover, the IκB kinase 1 (IKK1) was also shown to translocate to the nucleus dependent on a critical lysine residue at position 44. These observations indicate not only that NF-κB and its inhibitor are dynamically shuttling between cytosol and nucleus, but also signaling molecules upstream of NF-κB. Thus, nuclear NF-κB·IκB complexes might be activated by kinases, which exhibit nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, themselves. pEYFP-NIK was generated by subcloning NIK cDNA from the expression vector pcDNA-HA-NIK (23.Natoli G.

YFP-tagged NIK truncation mutants (pEYFP-NIK1–769, pEYFP-NIK1–794, pEYFP-NIK1–805) were generated by amplification of the corresponding cDNAs by PCR using the sense-primer 5′-AAAGAATTCCACCATGGCAGTGATGGAAATG-3′ and the following antisense primers: 5′-AAAGTCGACTTCCTGCTCCGGGACG-3′ (NIK1–769), 5′-AAAGTCGACAATTTGCTCCTGCTCCTC-3′ (NIK1–794) and 5′-AAAGTCGACCAGGGAGAGGCTGTCGA-3′ (NIK1–805), respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEYFP-C1.

The expression vector for pIKK2-EGFP was designed by excising IKK2 cDNA out of the plasmid wt-IKK2-FL described in Ref. 25.Oitzinger W. Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Koshelnick Y.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and related to β-galactosidase activity determined with chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate and colorimetric detection at 570 nm. HUVEC or HeLa cells were transiently transfected with YFP or CFP constructs or both and investigated 1 day after transfection on a Nikon Diaphot TMD microscope using XF104 and XF114 filter sets (Omega Opticals Inc., Brattleboro, VT) specific for YFP and CFP, respectively. Images were taken by means of a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Kappa DX30, Kappa GmbH, Gleichen, Germany) using the manufacturer's software (Kappa Image Base). For nuclear transport studies, leptomycin B (LMB, a gift from Barbara Wolff-Winiski, Novartis Research Institute, Vienna, Austria) was directly added to the serum-containing medium at a concentration of 20 nm. For time-lapse experiments, cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 between single time points. Alternatively, cells were imaged at 37 °C in a CO2-independent medium on a video-enhanced inverted Leica microscope including computerized filter wheels and OpenLabTM Software (Improvision Ltd., United Kingdom) and images were taken at frequent time intervals both with CFP and YFP filter sets. The fluorescence intensities in the cytosol and the nucleus were quantified using NIH Image Software (or the WindowsTM-based equivalent software “ScionImage” provided by Scion Corporation Inc.), the background was subtracted and ratios of cytosolic to nuclear fluorescence were calculated for each individual cell. Mean ratios and standard deviations were determined and the kinetics of nuclear accumulation after addition of LMB were fitted by a single exponential decay algorithm (using Graphpad PrismTM 3.0, Graphpad Software, Inc.). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on Zeiss LSM510 equipment using the 514-nm line of the Ar-laser for excitation of YFP and the 458-nm line for excitation of CFP, combined with appropriate dichroic mirrors and emission band filters to discriminate between CFP and YFP fluorescence. The optical sectioning was set to a thickness of 0.8 μm and images were taken approximately at the center of the nucleus. HeLa cells were incubated for different periods of time in the presence of LMB, followed by preparation of nuclear extracts. In brief, about 3 × 106 cells per sample were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was suspended in 200 μl of CE buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.075% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, including the CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), incubated on ice for 3 min and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosolic extract) was removed and the pellet (nuclei) was washed with 1 ml of CE buffer without Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were pelleted as above, followed by suspending in 70 μl of NE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol and protease inhibitors as in the CE buffer) and incubation on ice for 10 min with frequent mixing. Finally the suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was combined with concentrated SDS-loading buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed using antibodies against IκBα (Clone-C21), p65-NF-κB, IKK1, and IKK2. All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. To investigate the intracellular distribution of various components of the NF-κB signaling pathway in living cells, we generated CFP, GFP, and YFP chimeras of p65-NF-κB, IκBα, TRAF1, TRAF2, NIK, IKK1, and IKK2 for transient or stable transfections and morphological analysis. The advantage of this approach is that two different signaling components expressed as CFP and YFP chimeras, respectively, can be investigated simultaneously in vivowith appropriate filter sets. Furthermore, the cells can be analyzed without any background, which is often observed in immunofluorescence staining. However, for a valid interpretation of the results, it is necessary to confirm that the CFP and YFP fusion proteins are still functional as compared with the wild type protein. We have demonstrated previously that both p65-NF-κB and IκBα are still functional as GFP chimeras and that they are still binding to each other even if both of them are tagged with a CFP, GFP, or YFP moiety (26.Schmid J.A. Birbach A. Hofer-Warbinek R. Pengg M. Burner U. Furtmuller P.G. Binder B.R. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17035-17042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Analysis of other components of the NF-κB signaling cascade by reporter gene analysis using NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter constructs verified that the GFP fusion proteins were functional with activities similar to those of the wild type proteins (Fig. 1). The difference in case of IKK1 is apparently due to the use of different promoters for this construct and its GFP counterpart. Western blot analysis of transfected GFP constructs showed the expected molecular weights and verified the integrity of the expressed GFP chimeras (data not shown). To investigate a potential dynamic distribution of NF-κB and IκBα between cytosol and nucleus, we transfected HUVEC or HeLa cells with equal amounts of YFP-p65 and CFP-IκBα, respectively. After addition of leptomycin B to block Crm1p-dependent nuclear export processes (28.Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), the cells were imaged at different time points with appropriate CFP and YFP filter sets. These experiments could demonstrate a rapid nuclear accumulation of both proteins after inhibition of nuclear export, indicating continuous nucleocytoplasmic shuttling independent from any known NF-κB activating stimulus (Fig. 2). This process did not depend on de novo protein synthesis, as it could not be influenced by addition of cycloheximide and it was also observed in sTable II93 transfectants expressing both CFP-IκBα and YFP-p65 (data not shown). Strikingly, the nuclear accumulation of IκBα appeared to be even faster than that of p65. In many of the cells that have been examined, it was evident that starting from an equal cytoplasmic steady state localization of IκBα and p65, the nuclear IκB concentration increased more rapidly than that of p65. Finally, both proteins reached a nearly complete nuclear localization about 4 h after addition of LMB. To quantify the steady state distribution of YFP-p65 and CFP-tagged IκBα between cytosol and nucleus in living cells, we applied confocal laser scanning microscopy using optical sectioning parameters that eliminate an out-of-focus fluorescence. By that means the cytosolic fluorescence above or below the nucleus cannot contribute to the fluorescence signal measured in the nuclear region. These studies indicated that about 5.6% of transfected NF-κB and about 8.0% of co-transfected IκBα are localized to the nucleus at steady state (Fig. 2C). Analysis of the molecular association of NF-κB and IκBα by FRET microscopy (as described in Ref. 26.Schmid J.A. Birbach A. Hofer-Warbinek R. Pengg M. Burner U. Furtmuller P.G. Binder B.R. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17035-17042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), showed that p65 and IκBα bind to each other not only in the cytosol, but also after LMB-induced nuclear accumulation within the nucleus (Fig. 2D). To calculate the kinetics of the nuclear accumulation of p65 and IκBα, we performed time lapse morphological studies of cells incubated at 37 °C in the presence of LMB. Images of CFP and YFP fluorescence were taken at frequent intervals and the ratio of cytosolic to nuclear fluorescence was calculated for individual cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mean ratio values were fitted with a single exponential decay algorithm indicating a half-time of the cytosol-nucleus redistribution of about 14 min for p65 and of about 7 min for IκBα (Fig. 3). To investigate whether the kinetics of the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is affected by the relative amounts of NF-κB and IκBα, we performed similar studies after transient transfection with either YFP-p65 or CFP-IκBα in excess. After transfection with p65 and IκBα at a ratio of 9:1, many of the cells had already a predominant nuclear localization of p65. However, some of the cells still exhibited a major cytosolic localization of both p65 and IκBα. Morphological analysis of these cells after addition of LMB revealed a striking difference between YFP-p65 and CFP-IκBα in the kinetics of nuclear accumulation. While p65 accumulated in the nucleus already after about 5 to 10 min, the kinetics of the nuclear import of IκBα was significantly slower (Fig. 4A). Conversely, transfection of YFP-p65 and CFP-IκBα at a ratio of 1:9 and selection of cells with predominant cytosolic localization of IκBα resulted in a very fast nuclear accumulation of IκBα alone within 5–10 min, whereas p65 remained mainly cytosolic for much longer times after addition of LMB (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data indicate that p65 and IκBα can enter the nucleus independently of each other and that a dissociation of the p65·IκB complex might be the rate-limiting step in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling process of these proteins. This model is in agreement with a recent report by Carlotti et al. (20.Carlotti F. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41028-41034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) suggesting that a cytoplasmic dissociation of the NF-κB·IκB complex is followed by nuclear import of the single subunits rather than the complex as a whole. A further support for this notion is the observation that an incubation of cells with the cell permeant NLS-pep"

We have previously shown that collagen Q (ColQ) anchors AChE at the neuromuscular junction. We have now cloned the gene PRiMA (proline-rich membrane anchor) encoding the AChE anchor in mammalian brain. We show that PRiMA is able to organize AChE into tetramers and to anchor them at the surface of transfected cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AChE is actually anchored in neural cell membranes through its interaction with PRiMA.

Further processing of the polyprotein (NS3/NA4A, NS4A/NS4B, NS4B/NS5A, and NS5A/NS5B) is controlled by the viral serine proteinase located in the amino-terminal one-third of the NS3 protein in both cis- and trans-active manners with cooperation of NS4A as an effector or cofactor (16.Bouffard P.

However, the role and molecular mechanism of NS5A in viral replication remains uncertain.

GST-NS5A and GST-NS5A 335–447 proteins were expressed in BL21 pLysS (DE3) by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 8 h. Cells were harvested and sonicated in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm DTT and 1% Triton X-100). The supernatants after centrifugation were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GST resin) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and GST-fused protein was allowed to absorb to the beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with buffer A and then with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mmDTT.FLAG-tagged NS5A and NS5A mutants were expressed in BL21 and harvested in buffer A as GST-NS5A. FLAG-tagged proteins were purified by incubating the sonication supernatants with anti-FLAG M2 resin (Kodak Scientific Imaging System), followed by several washes with buffer A and elution with buffer containing the FLAG peptide (0.1 mg of FLAG peptide per ml, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT). The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or silver staining with bovine serum albumin as a standard.E. coli strain BL21 plysS (DE3) transformed with wild or an internal deletion mutant of pYUTHis/NS5A was grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C and then induced with 0.7 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 8 h at 27 °C. The recovered and then washed cell pellet was resuspended in precleared buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100). The suspension was sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was suspended in denaturing binding buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea) with the pH value adjusted to 8.0 by HCl. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 5 min, and the cleared lysate was subjected to affinity binding to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen) preequilibrated with denaturing binding buffer. The resin was washed once with denaturing binding buffer and then washed several times with denaturating buffer mixed with increasing amounts of bridge buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mmTris-HCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 m NaCl, 2% Triton X-100) to renature the protein and then finally washed with bridge buffer. The bound His-NS5A was eluted with native elution buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm imidazole). Eluted solutions were combined and dialyzed against the buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100), and stored at −80 °C in aliquots.GST Pull-down AssayApproximately 1 μg of GST or GST-NS5Bt bacterial recombinant protein immobilized on 10 μl of GST resin was preblocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with 0.2 μg of FLAG-tagged NS5A wild type or mutants in 0.5 ml of PBST buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100) for 3 h on a rotator at room temperature. After washing with PBST, the bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-10% PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) (Kodak Scientific Imaging System).The NS5B binding ability of wild type or mutant His-NS5A was examined by GST pull-down assay. Approximately 1 μg of GST or GST-NS5Bt immobilized to l0 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B was incubated with 0.5–1.0 μg of wild type or internal-deletion mutant His-NS5A in 500 μl of modified GBT buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 8.0), 170 mm KCl, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After extensively washing with GBT buffer, the bound proteins were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. To examine the dose effect of wild type His-NS5A on NS5B binding, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 10 μg of wild type His-NS5A were incubated with prebound GST-NS5Bt.Preparation of Cell Extracts, Coprecipitation with GST Resin, and Western Blot AnalysisTransient transfection of COS1 cells was carried out as reported previously (35.Honda M. Kaneko S. Unoura M. Kobayashi K. Murakami S. Arch. Virol. 1993; 128: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sonicated in PBS lysis buffer (PBS containing 240 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) with 10 μg each of aprotinin and leupeptin per ml. Total cell lysates were diluted 5-fold with PBS lysis buffer and mixed with 10 μl of GST resin, and then incubated for 3 h on a rotator at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, the bound proteins were eluted, fractionated by SDS-10% PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Signal intensities of Western blot analysis were quantified by NIH Image version 1.62 software, and percentages of recovered proteins were calculated. The nitrocellulose membranes used for Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody were reprobed with anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Poly(A)-dependent UMP Incorporation AssayRdRP activity of GST-NS5Bt was examined by the UMP incorporation assay reported previously (23.Yamashita T. Kaneko S. Shirota Y. Qin W. Nomura T. Kobayashi K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15479-15486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). 20 ng (10 nmol) of GST-NS5Bt was incubated at 25 °C for 2 h in the reaction solution (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, 4 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 10 μm UTP, 10 μg/ml poly(A), and 1 μg/ml oligo(U)14. The reaction was stopped by transferring the reaction solution to DE81 filter (Whatman), which was then washed extensively with 0.5 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0) and briefly rinsed with 70% ethanol. The filter-bound radioactivity was measured by a scintillation counter. Varying amounts of wild type or internal deletion mutant His-NS5A were added to the reaction before the addition of the substrate to examine the effect of NS5A on NS5B RdRP activity.RESULTSNS5A Specifically Binds NS5B in VitroTo elucidate whether NS5A interacts with NS5B directly as a component of HCV replicase, we pursued the in vitro interaction study between bacterial recombinant proteins, FLAG-tagged NS5A, and GST-fused NS5Bt using the GST pull-down assay. NS5Bt is a truncated form of NS5B, from which the membrane anchoring the carboxyl-terminal 21 aa had been removed to improve solubility. We have previously shown that NS5Bt retained full RdRP activity (23.Yamashita T. Kaneko S. Shirota Y. Qin W. Nomura T. Kobayashi K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15479-15486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Partially purified FLAG-NS5A wild type (WT) (Fig. 1B, lane 1) was mixed with comparable amounts of GST and GST-NS5Bt proteins (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2, respectively) and pulled down with GST resin as described under “Materials and Methods.” Pulled down proteins were fractionated by SDS-10% PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG (Fig. 1C). FLAG-NS5A was pulled down with GST-NS5Bt (Fig. 1C, lane 2) but not with GST (lane 1), implying the specificity of direct binding of NS5A and NS5B in vitro.Interaction between NS5A and NS5B Proteins in Vivo and Mapping the NS5B Binding Region(s) on NS5AWe determined whether the interaction of NS5A and NS5B occurs in vivo by coprecipitation assay and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, mapping of NS5B binding region(s) on NS5A was carried out using a set of plasmids encoding amino- or carboxyl-terminally and internally truncated NS5A proteins (Fig. 4). COS1 cells were transiently cotransfected with mammalian expression vectors, cFLAG-NS5A and pNKGST-NS5B, and the cell lysates were precipitated with GST resin. Under conditions in which the expression levels of cFLAG-NS5A proteins (input) were adjusted to be identical (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–21) and the precipitated amount of GST-NS5B protein was even (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–21), the precipitation efficiencies of NS5A proteins (output) were uneven (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–21). The full-length NS5A protein (lane 1) and truncated NS5A proteins up to 105 aa at the amino terminus (lanes 2–4) and up to 46 aa at the carboxyl terminus (lanes 8–10) were efficiently brought down. Internal truncations spanning 163–221 (lane 17), 222–236 (lane 16), 237–276 (lane 15), and 335–411 aa (lane 19) also did not have much effect on the interaction. In contrast, neither of the internally truncated NS5A mutants deleted at 105–162 aa (lane 18) nor 277–334 (lane 21) aa was efficiently coprecipitated. These results are summarized in Fig. 4. Although truncations of more than 46 aa at the carboxyl terminus, NS5A 1–397 (lane 11), 1–355 (lane 12), and 1–334 (lane 13) abolished the NS5B interaction, internal deletion of 335–411 (lane 19) aa retained the ability. These results indicate that this region is actually dispensable. In conclusion, both of the discontinuous regions harboring 105–162 and 277–334 aa seem to be indispensable for the NS5B binding.Figure 4Schematic representation of the amino- or carboxyl-terminally and internally truncated NS5A proteins used for coprecipitation and GST pull-down assay and mapping of NS5B binding regions on NS5A. The thin angled lines indicate internally deleted regions.

We targeted three Drosophila genes: lush, white, and dGq(alpha). In each case, target gene expression is dramatically reduced, and the white RNAi phenotype is indistinguishable from a deletion mutant. This technique efficiently targets genes expressed in neurons, a tissue refractory to RNAi in C. elegans.

To investigate the function of caveolin-1 phosphorylation, we modified the Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system to screen for phosphorylation-dependent protein interactions. A cDNA library was screened using the N terminus of caveolin-1 as bait in a yeast strain expressing the catalytic domain of Abl. We identified two proteins in this screen that interact with caveolin-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner: tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). TRAF2 bound to nonphosphorylated caveolin-1, but this association was increased 3-fold by phosphorylation. In contrast, association of Csk with caveolin-1 was completely dependent on phosphorylation of caveolin-1, both for fusion proteins in yeast (>35-fold difference in affinity) and for endogenous proteins in tissue culture cells. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of caveolin-1 leads to Csk translocation into caveolae.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Caveolae are formed at lipid rafts in membranes by their coat proteins, the caveolins (2Minetti C. Sotgia F.

Caveolin-1 gene-deficient mice show loss of caveolae, uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation, and impaired nitric oxide and calcium signaling, indicating that caveolae and caveolin-1 play fundamental roles in organizing multiple signaling pathways (3Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 9: 2449-2452Crossref Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). However, their exact roles in these processes remain unclear.Caveolin-1 acts as a scaffolding protein and binds to signaling molecules through its 20-amino acid scaffolding domain (4Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is also directly involved in signaling cascades as a substrate of both serine and tyrosine kinases. Caveolin-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 by Src, Fyn, and Abl in response to a number of stimuli, including insulin, angiotensin II, osmotic shock, and oxidative stress (5Mastick C.C. Brady M.J.

Res. 2001; 266: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).1 With the exception of sites within the activation loops of kinases themselves, tyrosine phosphorylation is used to bind to protein phosphotyrosine binding domains, particularly SH22 domains (13Zhou S. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This in turn leads to the activation of downstream signaling cascades. Therefore, phosphorylation of caveolin on tyrosine is likely to be an intermediate step in a signaling cascade occurring within caveolae. Caveolin-1 phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 would serve as a docking site for SH2 domain-containing proteins and would recruit proteins into caveolae to activate downstream signaling cascades.To identify proteins that bind to phosphorylated caveolin-1 in an unbiased manner, we screened a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library for proteins that interact with phosphorylated caveolin-1 using a novel yeast dihybrid screen. We found that C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) bound to phosphorylated caveolin in yeast and in mammalian tissue culture cells. A possible role for Csk recruitment to caveolae in response to caveolin-1 phosphorylation is discussed.RESULTSTo identify proteins that bind to phosphorylated caveolin-1, we screened a cDNA library using a novel yeast dihybrid screen. We modified the Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system to perform a phosphotyrosine-dependent dihybrid protein interaction screen (Fig. 1 A). The principle of the phosphotyrosine-dependent dihybrid screen is to introduce a kinase (Abl) into the yeast two-hybrid system to phosphorylate the bait protein (caveolin-1) and then screen for phosphorylation-dependent protein interactions.Caveolin-1 is split into two cytoplasmic domains by a central hydrophobic membrane anchor. The only site of tyrosine phosphorylation on caveolin-1 is tyrosine 14. To mimic the native structure of caveolin-1 and prevent steric hindrance at the phosphorylation site, we expressed the N terminus of caveolin-1 as a fusion protein attached to the N terminus of the Gal4 DBD. Abl was chosen as the kinase because caveolin-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 by c-Abl in cells1 and in vitro (12Mastick C.C. Sanguinetti A.R. Knesek J.H. Mastick G.S. Newcomb L.F. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 266: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of c-Abl with a 5′ nuclear localization signal was integrated into the yeast chromosome. The truncated kinase was used to avoid introduction of an SH2 domain-containing protein into the system (Abl domain structure: SH3, SH2, kinase domain, and tail). The expression of the caveolin-1·Gal4 DBD fusion protein and Abl and the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in the yeast strains were confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of Abl or when tyrosine 14 of caveolin-1 was changed to phenylalanine (Fig.1 C), no phosphocaveolin was detected. The positive and negative controls for the standard yeast two-hybrid screen still behaved as expected after the expression of Abl kinase in the yeast cells (data not shown).A 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library fused to the Gal4 AD was transformed into yeast expressing caveolin-1 and Abl, and transformants were selected for growth on His−/3-amino-1,2,4-triazole plates. After elimination of false positives, self-activators, and duplicates, we identified eight “true positive” proteins that interact with the N terminus of caveolin-1. All but one of these were isolated multiple times. 3The library was screened at approximately 7-fold redundancy, therefore true positive clones are expected to be isolated multiple times. Of these eight proteins, three were known proteins, and five were unknown. The three known proteins were JAB1 (21 isolates), tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) (10 isolates), and Csk (6 isolates). Full-length clones were isolated in all three cases, and at least two independent clones with different inserts were isolated for each one. Of these proteins, only Csk contains a known phosphotyrosine binding domain, an SH2 domain.Based on the initial screen, positive proteins could interact with caveolin-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent or phosphorylation-independent manner. To counterscreen for phosphorylation-dependent interactions, all positive clones were transformed back into yeast that expressed caveolin-1 alone, caveolin-1 and Abl, or caveolin-1/Y14F and Abl (Fig.2). Protein interactions were determined by liquid culture β-galactosidase assays. The liquid culture assays were quantitative and efficiently identified phosphorylation-dependent interactions. Similar results were observed when the protein interactions were determined by selective growth or colony-lift filter β-galactosidase assays (data not shown).Figure 2Phosphorylation-dependent interaction of Csk with caveolin-1 in yeast cells. Csk (A), TRAF2 (B), and JAB1 (C) were transformed into yeast expressing caveolin-1 alone (column 1), caveolin-1 and Abl (column 2), or caveolin-1/Y14F and Abl (column 3). D, full-length c-Abl was used as a control SH2 domain-containing protein. β-Galactosidase expression was determined by quantitative liquid culture assays CLONTECH Yeast Protocols Handbook. After subtracting values of the negative controls (Gal4 AD with caveolin-1·Gal4 DBD), the β-galactosidase units were expressed as a percentage of the standard positive control (p53·Gal4 DBD and SV40 large T-antigen·Gal4 AD).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We found only one protein, Csk, whose interaction with caveolin-1 was completely dependent on phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). Csk activated the expression of reporter genes in cells that expressed both caveolin-1 and Abl but not in cells expressing caveolin-1 alone. The possibility that the catalytic domain of Abl acts as a bridge between Csk and caveolin-1 can be excluded because Csk did not interact with caveolin-1/Y14F despite the presence of Abl. The interaction of Csk with phosphocaveolin is moderate (23% of positive control) but significantly greater (35–45-fold) than the background levels detected with unphosphorylated caveolin-1 or caveolin-1/Y14F. To control for the specificity of the SH2 domain interaction, we also examined the interaction between full-length c-Abl and caveolin-1 in yeast cells (Fig. 2 D). Full-length c-Abl did not show significant interaction with caveolin-1 or phosphocaveolin. This indicates that only specific SH2 domain-containing proteins will interact with a given tyrosine-phosphorylated bait protein in the dihybrid screen.TRAF2 also interacted with caveolin-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). While TRAF2 bound to nonphosphorylated caveolin-1 (50% of positive control), phosphorylation of caveolin-1 increased the binding of TRAF2 to caveolin-1 ∼3-fold. TRAF2 also bound to caveolin-1/Y14F but at a lower affinity (25% of positive control). These data indicate that TRAF2 binding to caveolin-1 is mediated in part through tyrosine 14. The phosphorylation dependence of the interaction is surprising as TRAF2 does not have an identifiable phosphotyrosine binding domain. It has been shown that TRAF2 and caveolin-1 form a constitutive complex in mammalian cells (18Feng X. Gaeta M.L. Madge L.A. Yang J.H. Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8341-8349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the tumor necrosis factor-α receptor redistributes in the membrane and binds to this complex. In contrast to Csk and TRAF2, the proteasome subunit JAB1 interacted with caveolin-1 in a phosphorylation-independent manner (Fig. 2 C; ∼45% of positive control in the three yeast strains).To determine whether full-length caveolin-1 interacts with endogenous Csk, we next examined the interaction of these proteins in tissue culture cells (Fig. 3). The first cell line used was an NIH-3T3 cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive allele of v-Abl, ts-120. Caveolin-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in these cells as determined by both anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phosphocaveolin Western blotting 4Phosphocaveolin and a comigrating phosphotyrosine band coimmunoprecipitate with caveolin-1 fromts-120-expressing cells. Anti-phosphocaveolin blotting shows only bands that comigrate with caveolin-1 even in whole cell lysates. (Ref. 12Mastick C.C. Sanguinetti A.R. Knesek J.H. Mastick G.S. Newcomb L.F. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 266: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; Fig.3 A, upper panel, Lysates). Csk was immunoprecipitated from v-Abl-expressing cells or control cells, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Phosphocaveolin was detected in Csk immunoprecipitates from the v-Abl-expressing cells but not from control cells (Fig. 3 A, upper panel,IP: Csk). No phosphocaveolin was detected in mock immunoprecipitations (Fig. 3 A, upper panel,NS). When a parallel blot was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we found that phosphocaveolin was one of two major phosphoproteins that bind to Csk in the v-Abl-expressing cells (Fig. 3 A, lower panel, filled arrows). The specificity is quite remarkable considering the dramatic induction of total cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in v-Abl-expressing cells (Fig. 3 A, lower panel,Lysates). The less intense 68-kDa phosphoprotein that coimmunoprecipitated with Csk comigrates with paxillin, a multidomain protein that localizes primarily to focal adhesions (Fig.3 A, lower panel, open arrow; data not shown).Figure 3Csk interacts with phosphocaveolin in mammalian cells. A, Csk was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing a temperature-sensitive v-Abl kinase (v-Abl) or control NIH-3T3 cells. Proteins bound to Csk antibody (IP) or control beads (NS) in the original cell lysates (Lys) or in the supernatants (Sup) were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to phosphocaveolin (PY14), Csk, and phosphotyrosine (pTyr). Filled arrows indicate antibody bands.B, Csk was immunoprecipitated from HF cells before (Control) or after induction of oxidative stress (H2O 2, 5 mm, 15 min). Proteins were analyzed by anti-phosphocaveolin Western blotting.C, HF cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing FLAG-tagged caveolin-1 (Cav) or caveolin-1/Y14F (CavY14F). Csk was immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from infected cells before (−) or after (+) induction of oxidative stress. Cell lysates and Csk immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-FLAG or anti-phosphocaveolin Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the interaction between endogenous Csk and caveolin-1 without expression of v-Abl, we immunoprecipitated Csk from HF cells after oxidative stress.1 Caveolin-1 was phosphorylated in cells treated with H2O2, while caveolin-1 phosphorylation was undetectable in control cells (Fig. 3 B, Lysates). After oxidative stress, phosphocaveolin was detected in the Csk immunoprecipitates (Fig.3 B, IP: Csk).While phosphocaveolin was detected in the Csk immunoprecipitates, available antibodies were not sensitive enough to detect unphosphorylated caveolin-1 in these samples. To overcome this limitation, we transiently expressed full-length FLAG epitope-tagged caveolin-1 or caveolin-1/Y14F in HF cells and looked for coimmunoprecipitation of the FLAG tag with Csk before and after oxidative stress. Overexpression of epitope-tagged caveolin-1 in HF cells was sufficient to induce significant phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in the lysates (Fig. 3 C, upper panel,Lysates). However, the phosphorylation was dramatically increased after oxidative stress. Caveolin-1/Y14F was not phosphorylated on any tyrosine residues even after oxidative stress,1 although phosphorylation of endogenous caveolin-1 was detected in the lysates of these cells (Fig. 3 C,filled arrow).In cells overexpressing caveolin-1, phosphocaveolin coimmunoprecipitated with Csk both before and after induction of oxidative stress (Fig. 3 C, upper panel,IP: Csk). No phosphocaveolin was detected in Csk immunoprecipitates from cells expressing caveolin-1/Y14F under either condition. Caveolin-1, as detected by the FLAG epitope tag, could only be detected in Csk immunoprecipitates from cells expressing caveolin-1, not caveolin-1/Y14F, despite equal expression of both constructs (Fig.3 C, lower panel). These data indicate that Csk only binds to caveolin-1 after phosphorylation on tyrosine 14. Consistent with this, phosphocaveolin was enriched in the Csk immunoprecipitates relative to the whole cell lysates from untreated cells. These results support the idea that phosphorylation of caveolin on tyrosine 14 is a mechanism to control the interaction of Csk with caveolin-1.DISCUSSIONWhat is the significance of the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of caveolin-1 and Csk? In cells, Csk negatively regulates the activities of Src family kinases by phosphorylating a conserved inhibitory tyrosine residue (527 in Src). However, the Src family kinases are localized to lipid rafts in the plasma membrane (including caveolae) via covalent lipid modifications, while Csk is not lipid modified and is largely free in the cytosol. The ability of Csk to relocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane requires a functional SH2 domain on Csk but not the tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Src (19Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, Csk must be recruited to its substrates at the plasma membrane via interaction with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Recently it has been shown in brain and cultured lymphocytes that Csk is recruited to lipid rafts in the plasma membrane through an SH2 domain interaction with a transmembrane protein called Cbp that is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine (20Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The binding of Csk to tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbp activates Csk (21Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Our data indicate that caveolin-1 phosphorylation is another mechanism to recruit Csk to the plasma membrane. Csk binds specifically to phosphorylated caveolin-1 (Fig. 3). Caveolin-1 is one of only two phosphotyrosine proteins found to coimmunoprecipitate with Csk in the fibroblast cells used in our study (paxillin is the other). Despite the widespread distribution of Cbp, we did not detect a phosphotyrosine protein of the predicted size of Cbp in Csk immunoprecipitates from NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 3). While caveolin-1 is expressed at very low levels in brain and lymphocytes, it is expressed at high levels in terminally differentiated cells such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and adipocytes. Therefore, caveolin-1 may be the major protein mediating Csk membrane localization in these cells.Disruption of the Csk gene causes unregulated Src family kinase activity, increased phosphorylation of a number of substrate proteins involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, impaired stress fiber formation, and defects in cell-matrix adhesion and cell-cell adhesion (22Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Interestingly a loss of caveolin-1 expression induces a number of these same effects, including increased Src kinase activity and disruption of cell-matrix adhesion (23Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence implicate caveolins in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Disruption of caveolin-3 in mice and in humans leads to limb girdle muscular dystrophy, a disease caused by disruption of complexes between the actin cytoskeleton, the plasma membrane, and the extracellular matrix (2Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco M. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 at the cell surface often aligns along the underlying actin cytoskeleton, possibly through its interaction with filamin (24Stahlhut M. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 261: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphocaveolin is found in stabilized focal contacts in adherent cells (7Ushio-Fukai M. Hilenski L. Santanam N. Becker P. Ma Y. Griendling K. Alexander R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48269-48275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and caveolin-1 is phosphorylated in intact tissues where there are a large number of cell-cell and cell-matrix attachments (data not shown; Ref. 25Aoki T. Nomura R. Fujimoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).The kinases known to phosphorylate caveolin-1, Abl, Src, and Fyn are also associated with focal adhesions. Upon integrin ligation activated Abl transiently associates with the forming focal contact (26Lewis J.M. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), while Src is recruited and inactivated and remains in a stable association with these structures (27Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The inactivation of Src in the focal contacts is due to phosphorylation of its inhibitory Csk site. Src activity is required for the turnover of cell-matrix contacts during cell migration and division in response to extracellular stimuli, not for focal contact formation (28Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 29Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Fyn is also involved in integrin signaling through a complex that requires caveolin-1 expression (8Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar,23Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).Based on these observations we propose the following model. Activation of Abl or Src leads to the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14. This leads to the recruitment of Csk and phosphorylation and inactivation of Src family kinases that are highly enriched in caveolae. Caveolin phosphorylation would induce the formation of preassembled signaling complexes containing inactive Src family kinases at specific sites at the cell membrane that are primed for transient activation in response to extracellular stimuli. The caveolin-1/Csk/Src family kinase signaling complex may be involved in transmitting signals to the actin cytoskeleton (i.e. from integrins or oxidative stress) or transmitting signals from the actin cytoskeleton (i.e. from shear or osmotic stress). Caveolae are small, abundant plasma membrane invaginations that have been implicated in a number of cellular processes (1Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Caveolae are formed at lipid rafts in membranes by their coat proteins, the caveolins (2Minetti C. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Scartezzini P. Broda P. Bado M. Masetti E. Mazzocco M. Egeo A. Donati M.A. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Cordone G. Bricarelli F.D. Lisanti M.P. Zara F. Nat.

Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 9: 2449-2452Crossref Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 gene-deficient mice show loss of caveolae, uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation, and impaired nitric oxide and calcium signaling, indicating that caveolae and caveolin-1 play fundamental roles in organizing multiple signaling pathways (3Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 9: 2449-2452Crossref Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). However, their exact roles in these processes remain unclear. Caveolin-1 acts as a scaffolding protein and binds to signaling molecules through its 20-amino acid scaffolding domain (4Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is also directly involved in signaling cascades as a substrate of both serine and tyrosine kinases. Caveolin-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 by Src, Fyn, and Abl in response to a number of stimuli, including insulin, angiotensin II, osmotic shock, and oxidative stress (5Mastick C.C. Brady M.J.

Res. 2001; 266: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).1 With the exception of sites within the activation loops of kinases themselves, tyrosine phosphorylation is used to bind to protein phosphotyrosine binding domains, particularly SH22 domains (13Zhou S. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This in turn leads to the activation of downstream signaling cascades. Therefore, phosphorylation of caveolin on tyrosine is likely to be an intermediate step in a signaling cascade occurring within caveolae. Caveolin-1 phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 would serve as a docking site for SH2 domain-containing proteins and would recruit proteins into caveolae to activate downstream signaling cascades. To identify proteins that bind to phosphorylated caveolin-1 in an unbiased manner, we screened a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library for proteins that interact with phosphorylated caveolin-1 using a novel yeast dihybrid screen. We found that C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) bound to phosphorylated caveolin in yeast and in mammalian tissue culture cells. A possible role for Csk recruitment to caveolae in response to caveolin-1 phosphorylation is discussed. RESULTSTo identify proteins that bind to phosphorylated caveolin-1, we screened a cDNA library using a novel yeast dihybrid screen. We modified the Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system to perform a phosphotyrosine-dependent dihybrid protein interaction screen (Fig. 1 A). The principle of the phosphotyrosine-dependent dihybrid screen is to introduce a kinase (Abl) into the yeast two-hybrid system to phosphorylate the bait protein (caveolin-1) and then screen for phosphorylation-dependent protein interactions.Caveolin-1 is split into two cytoplasmic domains by a central hydrophobic membrane anchor. The only site of tyrosine phosphorylation on caveolin-1 is tyrosine 14. To mimic the native structure of caveolin-1 and prevent steric hindrance at the phosphorylation site, we expressed th"

We have studied exocytotic membrane fusion and cargo release by simultaneous capacitance measurements and confocal imaging of single secretory vesicles in neuroendocrine cells. Depletion of the readily releasable pool (RRP) correlated with exocytosis of 10%–20% of the docked vesicles. Some remaining vesicles became releasable after recovery of RRP. Expansion of the fusion pore, seen as an increase in luminal pH, occurred after ∼0.3 s, and peptide release was delayed by another 1–10 s. We conclude that (1) RRP refilling involves chemical modification of vesicles already in place, (2) the release of large neuropeptides via the fusion pore is negligible and only proceeds after complete fusion, and (3) sluggish peptidergic transmission reflects the time course of vesicle emptying."

Inappropriate expression of HGF/SF and/or Met has been found in most types of solid tumors and is often associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, constitutional and sporadic activating mutations in Met have been discovered in human papillary renal carcinomas and other cancers, while autocrine and paracrine signaling of this receptor/ligand pair has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Numerous downstream signaling molecules have been implicated in HGF/SF-Met mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis. Stat3 is a downstream signaling molecule activated by HGF/SF-Met signaling, and is reported to contribute to cell transformation induced by a diverse set of oncoproteins. Stat3 is constitutively activated in many primary tumors and tumor cell lines, suggesting that signaling by this molecule may be important for cell transformation. To address whether Stat3 is required for HGF/SF-Met mediated tumorigenesis and metastasis, we introduced a dominant-negative form of Stat3, Stat3beta into the human leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-LMS-1. We found that Stat3beta has no effect on the transformed morphology, proliferation, invasion or branching morphogenesis in vitro. By contrast, expression of Stat3beta affected HGF/SF-Met mediated anchorage-independent colony formation and prevented tumorigenic growth in athymic nu/nu mice. Thus, Met signaling through Stat3 provides an essential function for tumorigenic growth, which is manifested in vitro by loss of anchorage-independent growth."

More recent studies have predicted that agonist-induced activation of rhodopsin and β2-adrenergic receptors (16.Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K.

This model was quite recently modified based on examination of the crystal structure of rhodopsin (20.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar) and extended to include disruption of a strong ionic interaction between residues in H6 and H3 (“H6-H3 interaction model”) (21.Ballesteros J.A.

Shapiro D.A. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2001; 5: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Indeed, the H6-H3 interaction model has recently been supported by mutagenesis and modeling studies of the β2-adrenergic receptor (21.Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29171-29177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In recent studies (6.Shapiro D.A. Kristiansen K. Kroeze W.K. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9.Kristiansen K.R. Kroeze W.K. Willins D.L. Gelber E.I. Savage J.E. Glennon R.A. Roth B.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 735-746PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that the H3-H7 interaction model does not adequately describe agonist-induced 5-HT2A receptor activation. Instead, we have proposed (6.Shapiro D.A. Kristiansen K. Kroeze W.K. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22.Roth B.L. Shoham M. Choudhary M.S. Khan N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that agonists interact with H6 via aromatic residues and that this interaction facilitates H6 motion and subsequent receptor activation. We have also predicted (41.Roth B.L. Shapiro D.A. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2001; 5: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that agonist binding to residues in H6 leads to the disruption of a strong ionic interaction between H3 and H6. In the current study, we test this “H3-H6 interaction model” via a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies. Functional expression via R-SAT (receptor selection and amplification technology) was used to characterize the effects of receptor mutations on basal, agonist-independent receptor activity. Taken together, these results are consistent with a model of 5-HT2A receptor activation in which agonists induce a disruption of a strong ionic interaction between H3 and H6, which is facilitated by agonist-induced movements of H6. We also suggest, based on an examination of aligned amino acids, that this is likely to be a widely used, although not universal, mechanism for agonist-mediated activation of G-protein coupled 5-HT receptors. Where appropriate, amino acid residues have been labeled both by standard amino terminus-based numbering and parenthetically by a numbering scheme introduced in 1995 by Ballesteros and Weinstein (23.Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2480) Google Scholar) in which relative amino acid positions are highlighted. This scheme facilitates the efficient comparison of residues within different GPCRs. With this method, every amino acid identifier starts with the transmembrane helix number and is followed by the position relative to a reference residue (arbitrarily assigned the number 50) among the most conserved amino acids in that transmembrane helix. In the seven-transmembrane (TM) GPCRs, this generalized numbering scheme utilizes Asn-1.50, Asp-2.50, Arg-3.50, Trp-4.50, Pro-5.50, Pro-6.50, and Pro-7.50 as seven reference positions, corresponding in rat 5-HT2A receptors to Asn-92, Asp-120, Arg-173, Trp-200, Pro-246, Pro-338, and Pro-377, respectively. Phe-340, for example, lies two positions positive relative to Pro-338, yielding the identifier (6.52), while one of the key residues studied in this manuscript, Arg-173(3.50) is itself the most highly conserved residue in TM3. Mutant rat 5-HT2A receptors, expressed in either pSVK3 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) or pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were constructed by a PCR-based mutagenesis technique as previously detailed for use in radioligand binding, phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, and confocal microscopic studies (4.Bhatnagar A.

Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A 5-HT2A-specific antibody was used for fluorescent confocal microscopic studies as recently described (4.Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For R-SAT studies, mutations of 5-HT2A receptors were performed as previously detailed (24.Price R.D. Weiner D.M. Chang M.S.S. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44663-44668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by automated, fluorescent sequencing of the entire insert (Cleveland Genomics, Cleveland, OH). Transfections of HEK-293 cells were performed using Fugene-6 as previously described (4.Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol.

For radioligand binding assays, cells were switched 24 h after transfection to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and 24 h later they were switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then harvested 24 h later for radioligand binding assays, which were performed as previously described (4.Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol.

Receptor expression was verified concurrently with binding experiments by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific for the 2A receptor. R-SAT (ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) assays were performed with minor modifications from those previously described (18.Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19.Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Briefly, NIH-3T3 cells were grown in 96-well tissue culture plates to 70–80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/Gln. Cells were transfected for 12–16 h with plasmid DNAs using Superfect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per the manufacturer's protocols. R-SATs were performed with 0.5–50 ng/well receptor and 20 ng/well β-galactosidase plasmid DNA. After overnight transfection, medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% cyto-sf3 (Kemp Biotechnologies, Frederick, MD) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/Gln and varying concentrations of drug. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% ambient CO2 for 4–6 days. Medium was removed from the plates, and β-galactosidase activity was measured by the addition of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% Nonidet P-40 detergent). The resulting colorimetric reaction was measured in a spectrophotometric plate reader (Titertek, Huntsville, AL) at 420 nm. All data were analyzed using the computer programs Excel Fit and Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Significant differences were determined by Student's t test. Energy minimizations and molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the all atomic force field of the AMBER (Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement) 5.0 programs (26.Cornell W.D. Ciaplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M.J. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11588) Google Scholar). Models of wild type and mutant receptors were refined by using 500 steps of steepest descent minimization followed by conjugate gradient energy minimization until convergence with a 0.005 kcal mol−1Å−1 root mean square energy gradient difference between successive minimization steps. A distance-dependent dielectric function (e = rij) and a 10-Å cut-off radius for nonbonded interactions were used. Molecular dynamics simulations in vacuo were performed for 1 ns at 300 K. The temperature was increased to 300 K during the first 30 ps of each simulation. This was followed by an equilibrium period (30–500 ps) and a production run (500–1000 ps). For analysis purposes, structures were collected every 1 ps. The bond lengths involving hydrogens were constrained by using the SHAKE algorithm, allowing an integration step of 0.001 ps. The secondary structure of helices was preserved using distance restraints. These restraints were applied between the backbone oxygen atom of residue i and the HN hydrogen atom of residue i + 4 in H1–H7 and the cytoplasmic helix, excluding prolines and the part of H7 that attain a 3/10 helical conformation (restraints between the backbone oxygen atom of residue i and the HN hydrogen atom of residue i + 3). The ICM (Internal Coordinate Mechanics) 2.8 Pro program (Molsoft L.L.C., La Jolla, CA) was used for all computer graphics visualizations, for Biased Probability Monte Carlo simulations (27.Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), and for calculation of accessible surface area. A model of the rat 5-HT2A receptor was constructed by using computer graphics and molecular mechanics energy calculations. The model included all parts of the amino acid sequence (residue ranges as follows: Leu-71(1.29)–Thr-266(5.70) and Met-312(6.24)–Gln-398(7.71)) with the exception of the amino-terminal segment and most of the carboxyl-terminal and third intracellular loop segments. An initial model comprising the seven transmembrane helices, the short loop between H1 and H2, a putative cytoplasmic helix after H7, and part of the second extracellular loop was built by using the x-ray structure of the inactive state conformation of bovine rhodopsin (20.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5038) Google Scholar) as a template. By using the WHATIF program (28.Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar), amino acid residues in these parts of the bovine rhodopsin structure (chain A) were substituted to their rat 5HT2A receptor counterparts. According to the mutation data in Ref. 6.Shapiro D.A. Kristiansen K. Kroeze W.K. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, the rotational orientation of helix 5 was modified such that the Phe-340(5.44) side chain pointed away from the binding site and the Phe-243(5.47) and Phe-5.48 side chains pointed into the binding site. The loop search feature of the SWISS-PDB VIEWER (version 3.7 beta 2) program (29.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9587) Google Scholar) was used to identify candidate conformations for each of the loops. The extreme N- and C-terminal parts of the long third intracellular loop were built as ideal α-helical extensions of H5 and H6 using the SWISS-PDB VIEWER. The C terminus of helices at Thr-266(5.70) and Gln-398(7.71) was capped by NCH3, whereas the N terminus of helices at Leu-71(1.29) and Met-312(5.24) was capped by COCH3. Model 1 was obtained by energy minimization of this model. Two disulfide bridges, Cys-148(3.25)-Cys-227 (second extracellular loop) and Cys-349–Cys-353 (within the third extracellular loop), were introduced during the energy minimization. Models of the R173(3.50)E/E318(6.30)R, E318(6.30)R, and V328(6.40)A mutants were constructed by substituting amino acids in model 1 of the wild type receptor using ICM. The side chain dihedral angles of residues at or near positions 3.50 and 6.30 in the R173(3.50)E/E318(6.30)R, E318(6.30)R mutants were optimized by 100,000 steps in biased probability Monte Carlo simulations (27.Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) using the ECEPP/3 force field in ICM. The Monte Carlo stack conformation having the lowest potential energy was further refined by energy minimization using AMBER. The resultant energy-minimized models and model 1 of the wild type receptor were used as the starting structure for molecular dynamics simulations. An average conformation was calculated over the last 500 ps of each molecular dynamics trajectory by using the CARNAL program. This conformation was subsequently energy-minimized using AMBER. The resulting models have been designated model 2 of the wild type and mutant receptors. In initial studies, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of 12 residues (Ser-316(6.28)–Val-328(6.40)) at the i3/H6 interface. The residues at positions 6.33–6.37 are assumed to be localized at a mixed hydrophobic-hydrophilic environment at the lipid/water interface as proposed from spin labeling experiments with rhodopsin (30.Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, all of these mutant receptors were expressed as functional receptors as measured by [125I]DOI binding, although some variations in receptor expression were measured. Immunochemical studies also verified receptor expression (not shown). Table I also shows that all mutants retained low micromolar or submicromolar affinities for 5-HT, although most mutants had slightly increased (E318(6.30)A, C322(6.34)A, V324(6.36)A, L325(6.37)A, G326(6.38)A, and I327(6.39)A) or decreased (N317(6.29)A) affinities for 5-HT. Taken together, these results imply that none of the residues is directly involved in ligand binding, since very little change in [125I]DOI binding affinity was detected and that the effects on agonist binding are likely to be allosteric in nature.Table IBinding properties of WT 5-HT2A receptors and mutantsMutantKdDOIBmaxKi 5-HTnmfmol/mgμmWT 2A0.47 ± 0.09173 ± 140.90 ± 0.17S316A0.46 ± 0.05412 ± 211.2 ± 0.06N317A0.43 ± 0.07357 ± 212.1 ± 0.59aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).E318A0.26 ± 0.081137 ± 1360.29 ± 0.05aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).Q319A0.67 ± 0.10491 ± 341.1 ± 0.49K320A3.17 ± 0.89aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).108 ± 101.5 ± 0.32C322A0.87 ± 0.14285 ± 200.38 ± 0.11aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).K323A0.74 ± 0.18180 ± 160.54 ± 0.17V324A0.89 ± 0.17306 ± 240.25 ± 0.10aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).L325A0.90 ± 0.09324 ± 9.70.10 ± 0.01aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).G326A0.52 ± 0.08272 ± 160.29 ± 0.07aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).I327A0.62 ± 0.10219 ± 150.26 ± 0.13aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).V328A0.28 ± 0.02728 ± 360.62 ± 0.37Saturation experiments using [125I]-DOI and competition binding studies using [3H]ketanserin were performed on membrane preparations from HEK 293 cells transiently expressing WT or mutant receptors.

We next examined the ability of these 12 H6 mutants to be activated by 5-HT via measurements of 5-HT-mediated PI hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table II, the various mutant 5-HT receptors were differentially affected by alanine mutagenesis. Four classes of mutations were discovered: 1) mutations that enhanced the potency of 5-HT-stimulated PI hydrolysis (E318(6.30)A, C322(6.34)A, V324(6.36)A, V328(6.40)A); 2) mutations that diminished the potency of 5-HT-stimulated PI hydrolysis (N317(6.29)A, Q319(6.31)A, K320(6.32)A); 3) mutations that reduced the efficacy of 5-HT-stimulated PI hydrolysis (L325(6.37)A); and 4) mutations that had no effect on 5-HT-stimulated PI hydrolysis (S316(6.28)A, K323(6.35)A, G326(6.38)A, I327(6.39)A). Visualization of the locations of these residues in a 5-HT2A receptor model (model 1, Fig. 2a) suggests that where mutation to alanine enhances agonist potency, it probably does so via distinct mechanisms. Among these, Glu-318(6.30) appeared to form an ionic interhelical interaction with Arg-173(3.50), whereas the hydrophobic residues had their side chains directed toward hydrophobic residues in H5 (Cys-322(6.34)) or H7 (Val-324(6.36), Val-328(6.40)).Table IIWT and mutant receptor activation by 5-HTMutantKactVmaxnm% WTWT 2A18.1 ± 1.2101.2 ± 4.1S316A36.8 ± 9.092.0 ± 5.1N317A91.5 ± 20.6aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).91.6 ± 13.0E318A4.0 ± 1.5aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).88.5 ± 14.1Q319A47.0 ± 17.2aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).71.3 ± 6.7K320A137.4 ± 17.5aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).67.8 ± 9.5C322A7.9 ± 0.20aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).87.0 ± 3.6K323A10.4 ± 2.470.2 ± 16.6V324A6.7 ± 1.2aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).94.3 ± 19.3L325A39.0 ± 4.331.3 ± 8.2aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).G326A7.7 ± 1.790.1 ± 11.4I327A22.6 ± 5.177.1 ± 6.8V328A0.54 ± 0.04aSignificantly different from WT (p ≤ 0.05).92.3 ± 11.1PI hydrolysis activation isotherms for serotonin were obtained from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with WT or mutant receptors as described.

https://openalex.org/W2068712091,"To address how the highly stereotyped retinotectal pathway develops in zebrafish, we used fixed-tissue and time-lapse imaging to analyze morphology and behavior of wild-type and mutant retinal growth cones. Wild-type growth cones increase in complexity and pause at the midline. Intriguingly, they make occasional ipsilateral projections and other pathfinding errors, which are always eventually corrected. In the astray/robo2 mutant, growth cones are larger and more complex than wild-type. astray axons make midline errors not seen in wild-type, as well as errors both before and after the midline. astray errors are rarely corrected. The presumed Robo ligands Slit2 and Slit3 are expressed near the pathway in patterns consistent with their mediating pathfinding through Robo2. Thus, Robo2 does not control midline crossing of retinal axons, but rather shapes their pathway, by both preventing and correcting pathfinding errors."
https://openalex.org/W2154740729,"Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) physically interact with a variety of pro-apoptotic proteins and inhibit apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli.

These results demonstrate the feasibility of using SMAC peptides as a way to sensitize IAP-expressing cells to pro-apoptotic stimuli such as chemotherapeutic agents. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a genetically regulated mechanism that plays an important role in development and homeostasis in metazoans (1.Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). Abnormalities in programmed cell death that lead to early cell death or the absence of normal cell death have been linked to a variety of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (2.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar). Currently there are two well characterized apoptotic pathways, one initiated through the engagement of cell surface death receptors by their specific ligands (3.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5127) Google Scholar) and the other triggered by changes in internal cellular integrity (4.Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). Both pathways eventually converge, resulting in activation of caspases, cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases that comprise the effector arm of the apoptotic process (5.Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar).

Members of the IAP family are characterized by one to three tandem baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) motifs, and most of them also possess a carboxyl-terminal RING finger motif (6.Miller L.K.

Human X-chromosome-linked IAP (X-IAP), for example, inhibits active caspases-3 and -7 and Apaf-1-cytochrome c-mediated activation of caspase-9 (22.Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

This inhibitory activity is mediated through distinct BIR domains of X-IAP; the BIR2 domain and preceding linker region inhibit caspases-3 and -7, while BIR3 blocks caspase-9 (24.Deveraux Q.L. Leo E.

Similarly, the anti-apoptotic activity of melanoma IAP, or ML-IAP, is attributed to its lone BIR domain (15.Vucic D. Stennicke H.R. Pisabarro M.T. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Curr.

ML-IAP can bind and inhibit caspase-9 through its BIR domain, and mutations in the BIR reduce both inhibition of caspase-9 and general anti-apoptotic activity (15.Vucic D. Stennicke H.R.

Thus, SMAC, by binding to the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of X-IAP, abrogates inhibition of the caspases-3 and -9 (34.Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the only sequence homology between insect RPR, HID, and GRIM and human SMAC is in the four amino-terminal residues of the active proteins (35.Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A.

In this study we demonstrate that SMAC physically interacts with ML-IAP and abrogates the ability of ML-IAP to inhibit apoptosis. Peptides derived from the amino terminus of active SMAC are also shown to bind ML-IAP and attenuate its anti-apoptotic activity. The specificity of the SMAC-ML-IAP interaction is supported by the finding that single amino acid changes in the amino terminus of active SMAC or the BIR domain of ML-IAP completely abolish their association. Plasmids expressing β-galactosidase, p35, Myc-XIAP, and Myc-ML-IAP, as well as ML-IAP deletions and site-specific mutants, have been described previously (15.Vucic D. Stennicke H.R. Pisabarro M.T.

SMAC cDNA was then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag (Invitrogen). The SMAC55M construct (amino acids 56–239) was also PCR-amplified and similarly subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. Sequences encoding X-IAP BIR3 (amino acid residues 241–356) and ML-IAP BIR (amino acid residues 63–179) were subcloned into pET15b vector (Novagen) for bacterial expression.

Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) transformed with pET-15b-X-IAP-BIR3 or pET-15b-ML-IAP-BIR was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C, pelleted, and resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine) containing 5 mm imidazole. Lysate produced by homogenization and centrifugation was passed through nickel-agarose and Superdex 75 sizing columns, washed, eluted, and dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, 50 μm zinc acetate, and 1 mm sodium azide. Antennapedia (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK-NH2) fusions were constructed using standard solid phase methods utilizing Wang resin with a rink amide linker and Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The peptides were cleaved using a mixture of 1:0.05:0.02 trifluoroacetic acid:triisopropyl silane:ethyl methyl sulfide. The resulting peptides were purified by preparative HPLC and analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The fluorescein-labeled peptides AVPIAQKSEK-5-FAM (SMAC), ATPFQEGLRK-5-FAM (caspase-9), and AVPSPPPASK-5-FAM (HtrA2), and biotin derivatives AVPIAQKSEK-biotin (SMAC), ATPFQEGLRK-biotin (caspase-9), and AVPSPPPASK-biotin (HtrA2) were constructed as COOH-terminal amides using modified Fmoc chemistry with the amino-terminal amino acid N-α-protected with tert-butoxycarbonyl. The labels were attached through N-ε of a lysine attached to the COOH terminus of the nine-residue peptides by selectively removing the N-ε (4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxoxocyclohex-1-ylidene)-3-methylbutyl-protecting group with 2% hydrazine in dimethylacetamide. Coupling with either 5-FAM or biotin was achieved using benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexaphosphate as the condensation reagent. The control peptide biotin-TGWETWVCOOH was made by biotinylating the amino terminus of the peptide. Trifluoroacetic acid cleavage and HPLC purification obtained the labeled peptides. Fluorescence polarization experiments were performed in 96-well plates on the Analyst HT 96–384 (Molecular Devices Corporation). Binding experiments were performed using 1:3 serial dilutions of ML-IAP BIR and X-IAP BIR3 domains starting from 300 μm in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.2), 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. An approximately 1 nmconcentraton of each 5-carboxyfluorescein-tagged probe was added to a set of wells containing the protein dilutions. The Kd values of the probe-protein interactions were calculated using Klotz plots and confirmed by Scatchard analysis. The high resolution crystal structure of SMAC/DIABLO complexed with the BIR3 domain of X-IAP (40.Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) was used to model the NH2-terminal four residues (Ala-Val-Pro-Ile) of SMAC/DIABLO into the binding groove of the previously modeled structure of ML-IAP (15.Vucic D. Stennicke H.R. Pisabarro M.T. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1359-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Both protein structures, X-IAP and ML-IAP, were superimposed by their α carbons (root mean square of Cα = 0.47 Å), and docking of the SMAC peptide was manually performed on the ML-IAP binding site. The ML-IAP·SMAC complex was energy minimized using DISCOVER (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW (44.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar). Apoptosis assays were performed essentially as described previously (15.Vucic D. Stennicke H.R. Pisabarro M.T. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1359-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 42.Pan G. Ni J. Wei Y.F. Yu G. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 277: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). SMAC has been shown to physically associate with several IAP family members, most prominently with X-IAP (31.Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2902) Google Scholar). To determine whether SMAC can bind ML-IAP, we coexpressed SMAC with X-IAP, ML-IAP, or vector control. Upon overexpression, SMAC was processed to its active form whereby the first amino-terminal 55 amino acids are cleaved (Fig. 1A). Association of ML-IAP and X-IAP with active SMAC was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, and the interactions occurred with similar efficiency (Fig. 1A). We investigated the portion of ML-IAP that is responsible for interaction with SMAC using truncation mutants of ML-IAP containing either the BIR or the RING finger domains (Fig. 1B). The BIR domain, like full-length ML-IAP, immunoprecipitated active SMAC but the RING finger domain did not (Fig. 1B). Thus, ML-IAP physically interacts with SMAC through its BIR domain. Sequence comparison of the active forms of human SMAC, HtrA2, and caspases-9 and fly RPR, HID, and GRIM revealed a strong similarity in their amino termini (Fig. 2A) (35.Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Since the four amino-terminal residues (Ala, Val, Pro, Ile) of active SMAC fit into the binding groove on the surface of the X-IAP BIR3 (40.Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L. Wu J.W. Du C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), we investigated whether a similar complex might form between ML-IAP BIR and SMAC peptide. A three-dimensional model based on the reported structure of the SMAC·X-IAP BIR3 complex predicted that SMAC peptide should bind ML-IAP BIR much as it does X-IAP BIR3 (Fig. 2B). To test the validity of our model, we examined whether SMAC, HtrA2, caspase-9, or control peptides could bind the BIR3 domain of X-IAP or the BIR of ML-IAP. SMAC, HtrA2, and caspase-9 peptides efficiently pulled down purified X-IAP BIR3 and ML-IAP BIR, whereas a control peptide did not (Fig. 3A). The binding affinities of these peptides for X-IAP BIR3 and ML-IAP BIR were determined by a fluorescence polarization-based assay (Fig. 3, B and C). SMAC, HtrA2, and caspase-9 peptides exhibited binding affinities in the low micromolar range for X-IAP BIR3 (Fig. 3B) and in the submicromolar range for ML-IAP BIR (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that ML-IAP BIR binds SMAC and other mammalian RPR-like peptides with high affinity and in a manner similar to X-IAP BIR3. Processing of SMAC exposes the four amino-terminal residues that mediate binding to X-IAP and are required for SMAC to block caspase inhibition by X-IAP. We investigated whether this region of SMAC is also required for SMAC to bind ML-IAP and abrogate its anti-cell death activity. Active SMAC was mimicked in coimmunoprecipitation experiments using an amino-terminally truncated form of SMAC (amino acids 56–239) (SMAC55M) (Fig. 4A). Full-length SMAC that was processed to its active form was able to bind ML-IAP or X-IAP (Fig. 4B). In contrast, there was no interaction between SMAC55M and ML-IAP or X-IAP (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these results, SMAC but not SMAC55M was able to abrogate ML-IAP-mediated inhibition of adriamycin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Addition of a single methionine to the amino terminus of active SMAC was therefore sufficient to block its inhibitory effect on ML-IAP. We also tested whether peptides corresponding to the nine residues at the amino terminus of active SMAC would reverse ML-IAP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis. SMAC and M-SMAC peptides, the latter having an additional amino-terminal methionine, were synthesized as fusions with antennapedia peptide. Antennapedia peptides permit chimeric fusions to gain entry into the cell where they can engage their targets (45.Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 84-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Expression of ML-IAP or X-IAP efficiently blocked adriamycin-induced apoptosis, and addition of M-SMAC peptides did not have a significant inhibitory effect on the protective activity of IAPs (Fig. 4D). However, addition of SMAC peptides almost completely negated the ability of ML-IAP and X-IAP to inhibit apoptosis (Fig. 4D). Thus, coexpression of full-length SMAC or addition of SMAC-like peptides abrogates the anti-apoptotic activity of ML-IAP. To better understand the mechanism by which SMAC antagonizes the anti-apoptotic function of ML-IAP, we investigated the effect of SMAC on the ability of ML-IAP to bind caspase-9. When overexpressed, caspase-9 undergoes autocatalytic processing, and it is the processed form that physically interacts with X-IAP (35.Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 46.Ekert P.G. Silke J. Hawkins C.J. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Similarly, ML-IAP coimmunoprecipitated processed caspase-9 but not its zymogen precursor (Fig. 5A). The interaction between ML-IAP and caspase-9 is highly specific, because mutation of aspartate 138 to alanine in the BIR domain of ML-IAP completely abolished the ability of ML-IAP to bind processed caspase-9 (Fig. 5A). Coexpression of caspase-9 and ML-IAP with SMAC prevented ML-IAP from interacting with caspase-9 (Fig. 5B). Instead, SMAC associated with ML-IAP (Fig. 5B), indicating that SMAC binding to ML-IAP disrupts the interaction of ML-IAP with caspase-9. Previously, we demonstrated that mutating aspartates 120 and 138 to alanine in ML-IAP abolishes its anti-apoptotic activity (15.Vucic D. Stennicke H.R. Pisabarro M.T. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1359-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The effect of these mutations on ML-IAP interaction with SMAC was characterized. As an additional control we expressed a double glutamate ML-IAP mutant (E87A,E88A) that possessed equivalent anti-apoptotic activity to wild type ML-IAP. SMAC immunoprecipitated ML-IAP and E87A,E88A ML-IAP, but no interaction was observed between SMAC and the D120A or D138A mutants (Fig. 6A). The same was true in the inverse experiment where ML-IAP and E87A,E88A mutant, but not D138A mutant, immunoprecipitated SMAC (Fig. 6B). To examine the interaction of endogenous SMAC with ML-IAP, we generated stably transfected MCF-7 cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged ML-IAP or the D138A mutant. Consistent with our earlier results (Fig. 6, A and B), endogenous SMAC was coimmunoprecipitated from cells expressing ML-IAP, but not the D138A mutant (Fig. 6C). To determine whether SMAC peptide can bind IAPs expressed in cells, lysates prepared from 293T cells transfected with the X-IAP, ML-IAP, or ML-IAP D138A mutant were incubated with biotinylated SMAC peptide or control peptide. Immunoblotting following peptide precipitation revealed that the SMAC peptide precipitated X-IAP and ML-IAP but not the ML-IAP D138A mutant (Fig. 6D). Therefore, aspartate 138 in the BIR domain of ML-IAP is a critical residue for the binding of SMAC. Inhibition of caspases by IAPs occurs at the core of the apoptotic machinery, and thus regulation of IAPs by SMAC and SMAC-like proteins represents a key control point in deciding cell fate. We have shown that ML-IAP is regulated by SMAC, since SMAC physically associates with ML-IAP and abrogates the anti-apoptotic activity of ML-IAP. Interaction with SMAC is mediated through the BIR domain of ML-IAP and amino-terminal residues of active SMAC. Three-dimensional modeling together with protein binding studies demonstrated that SMAC binds the BIR of ML-IAP with high affinity and in a manner similar to which it binds the X-IAP BIR3 domain. Further highlighting the similarity of these interactions, mutation of residues in ML-IAP BIR that correspond to functionally important amino acids in X-IAP BIR3 (41.Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) interrupted binding to SMAC. Aspartate 138 of ML-IAP is predicted to be in contact with alanine at the amino terminus of active SMAC peptide and, therefore, is critical for the interaction of ML-IAP with SMAC. Previous studies have shown the importance of the amino terminus of active SMAC for binding X-IAP (33.Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Huang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that this short region is important for binding ML-IAP and antagonizing its anti-apoptotic activity. We have also demonstrated that SMAC peptides can specifically bind and inhibit IAPs. SMAC peptide bound purified BIR domains and X-IAP and ML-IAP from cell lysates, and in doing so, nullified IAP's ability to inhibit apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which the functional potential of SMAC or SMAC-like peptides has been explored in a cellular context. Such peptides have obvious therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancer cells that resist conventional cytotoxic therapies. IAPs do contribute to the resistance of cancers to chemotherapeutic agents, since they are widely and, in some cases like ML-IAP, specifically expressed in human malignancies (15.Vucic D.

https://openalex.org/W2130453040,"Angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and blocking this process might be a valid tool for the control of cancer growth. We showed previously that tumor angiogenesis in integrin α1-null mice is reduced compared to that of wild type animals and that over-expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in the α1-null and consequent generation of angiostatin (an inhibitor of endothelial cell growth) from circulating plasminogen was implicated in the mechanism of tumor inhibition. Our findings suggested that secretion of excess MMPs generates inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation, including but not necessarily limited to angiostatin, resulting ultimately in auto-inhibition of angiogenesis. Thus MMP inhibitors used as anti-tumor drugs might in fact cause a paradoxical increase in tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. In order to determine whether MMP-9 expression was directly involved in the regulation of tumor growth, we specifically inhibited or enhanced MMP-9 synthesis in vitro and in vivo, and subsequently analysed primary endothelial cell proliferation and angiostatin synthesis, as well as tumor vascularization and development. We provide evidence that reduction of plasma levels of MMP-9 in either normal or integrin α1-null mice leads to decreased synthesis of angiostatin and consequent increased tumor growth and vascularization. In contrast, specifically enhancing MMP-9 expression in vivo caused a reduction in tumor vascularization. These findings are the opposite to other studies suggesting a pro-tumorigenic role for MMP-9, and may account for some of the recently observed failures of anti MMP therapy in tumor treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1988799648,"Oxidized abasic residues in DNA constitute a major class of radiation and oxidative damage. Free radical attack on the nucleotidyl C-1′ carbon yields 2-deoxyribonolactone (dL) as a significant lesion. Although dL residues are efficiently incised by the main human abasic endonuclease enzyme Ape1, we show here that subsequent excision by human DNA polymerase β is impaired at dL compared with unmodified abasic sites. This inhibition is accompanied by accumulation of a protein-DNA cross-link not observed in reactions of polymerase β with unmodified abasic sites, although a similar form can be trapped by reduction with sodium borohydride. The formation of the stably cross-linked species with dL depends on the polymerase lysine 72 residue, which forms a Schiff base with the C-1 aldehyde during excision of an unmodified abasic site. In the case of a dL residue, attack on the lactone C-1 by lysine 72 proceeds more slowly and evidently produces an amide linkage, which resists further processing. Consequently dL residues may not be readily repaired by ""short-patch"" base excision repair but instead function as suicide substrates in the formation of protein-DNA cross-links that may require alternative modes of repair."
https://openalex.org/W2130286246,"During postnatal development, sympathetic neurons lose their dependence upon NGF for survival but continue to require NGF for soma and process growth and for development of a mature neurotransmitter phenotype. Although c-Ret is expressed in sympathetic neurons during this period, its function in these transitional processes is unclear. The level of Ret phosphorylation markedly increased with postnatal age in SCG neurons in vitro and in vivo. Postnatal Ret phosphorylation did not require either GFLs or GFR(alpha) coreceptors. Instead, NGF promoted age-dependent Ret phosphorylation with delayed kinetics both in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, maximal NGF-dependent trophism of mature sympathetic neurons required Ret, but not GFR(alpha) coreceptors. Therefore, NGF promotes phosphorylation of the heterologous RTK Ret resulting in augmented growth, metabolism, and gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2085949167,"In the Drosophila visual system, photoreceptor neurons (R cells) extend axons towards glial cells located at the posterior edge of the eye disc. In gilgamesh (gish) mutants, glial cells invade anterior regions of the eye disc prior to R cell differentiation and R cell axons extend anteriorly along these cells. gish encodes casein kinase Igamma. gish, sine oculis, eyeless, and hedgehog (hh) act in the posterior region of the eye disc to prevent precocious glial cell migration. Targeted expression of Hh in this region rescues the gish phenotype, though the glial cells do not require the canonical Hh signaling pathway to respond. We propose that the spatiotemporal control of glial cell migration plays a critical role in determining the directionality of R cell axon outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2131792917,"Reductions in activity of SSIII, the major isoform of starch synthase responsible for amylopectin synthesis in the potato tuber, result in fissuring of the starch granules. To discover the causes of the fissuring, and thus to shed light on factors that influence starch granule morphology in general, SSIII antisense lines were compared with lines with reductions in the major granule-bound isoform of starch synthase (GBSS) and lines with reductions in activity of both SSIII and GBSS (SSIII/GBSS antisense lines). This revealed that fissuring resulted from the activity of GBSS in the SSIII antisense background. Control (untransformed) lines and GBSS and SSIII/GBSS antisense lines had unfissured granules. Starch analyses showed that granules from SSIII antisense tubers had a greater number of long glucan chains than did granules from the other lines, in the form of larger amylose molecules and a unique fraction of very long amylopectin chains. These are likely to result from increased flux through GBSS in SSIII antisense tubers, in response to the elevated content of ADP-glucose in these tubers. It is proposed that the long glucan chains disrupt organization of the semi-crystalline parts of the matrix, setting up stresses in the matrix that lead to fissuring.

It is proposed that the long glucan chains disrupt organization of the semi-crystalline parts of the matrix, setting up stresses in the matrix that lead to fissuring. Little is known about the processes that determine the morphology of starch granules, but important clues have been gained from studies of mutant plants with altered granule morphology. Many such plants carry mutations in genes encoding isoforms of starch synthase and starch-branching enzyme responsible for the synthesis of amylopectin, the branched α1,4, α1,6 glucan, which forms the semi-crystalline matrix of the granule. For example, mutations in pea affecting starch-branching enzyme A (at the r locus (1.Bhattacharyya M.K. Smith A.M. Ellis T.H.N. Hedley C. Martin C.

Shannon J.C. Crop Sci. 1976; 16: 298-301Crossref Google Scholar).The altered granule morphology of the mutants presumably results from alterations in the structures and relative amounts of the glucan polymers of which the granule is comprised. Most mutations affecting isoforms of starch synthase and starch branching enzyme affect both of these parameters. The r and rug5 mutations of pea and the amylose-extender mutation of maize affect the proportion of short and long chains in amylopectin, the chain-length distribution within the short-chain population, and the ratio within the granule of amylopectin to amylose, the essentially linear glucan that makes up 20–30% of storage starches (2.Craig J.

However, it is not known which of these changes in granule composition and polymer structure leads to the changes in granule morphology.Transgenic potato plants with reduced activity of isoforms of starch synthase provide a good system for elucidation of the relationship between granule morphology and glucan structure. Plants expressing antisense RNA for granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSS antisense plants), the isoform exclusively responsible for the synthesis of amylose, have much less amylose in the tuber starch but normal granule morphology (10.Kuipers A.G.J. Jacobsen E. Visser R.G.F. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 43-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plants expressing antisense RNA for starch synthase III (SSIII antisense plants), the major isoform responsible for amylopectin synthesis, have a markedly altered chain-length distribution among the short chains of amylopectin and an increased proportion of very long chains (11.Edwards A. Fulton D.C. Hylton C.M. Jobling S.A. Gidley M. Roessner U. Martin C. Smith A.M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 251-261Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 12.Lloyd J.R. Landschütze V. Kossmann J. Biochem. J. 1999; 38: 515-521Crossref Google Scholar). Whereas granules from wild-type and GBSS antisense plants have a smooth, ovoid profile, those from SSIII antisense lines are deeply internally fissured and are frequently multilobed (13.Marshall J. Sidebottom C. Debet M. Martin C. Smith A.M. Edwards A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1121-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the altered granule morphology in SSIII antisense lines could be caused either by the altered chain-length distribution of short chains of amylopectin, or by the increased proportion of very long chains in amylopectin, or by the interaction of amylose molecules within the granule with one or both of these abnormal features of amylopectin.To distinguish between these possibilities, we have generated transgenic lines down-regulated for both SSIII and GBSS simultaneously (SSIII/GBSS antisense lines), and compared the starch of control and SSIII, GBSS, and SSIII/GBSS antisense lines with respect to amylopectin structure, amylose content, and granule morphology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPotato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Desiree and transgenic plants derived from it) were grown from shoots propagated in tissue culture (14.Edwards A. Marshall J. Sidebottom C. Visser R.G.F. Smith A.M. Martin C. Plant J. 1995; 8: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) then transferred to soil-based compost in a greenhouse at a minimum temperature of 12 °C with supplementary lighting in winter. Tubers for enzymes assays, native gel electrophoresis, and starch preparations were used immediately after harvest. Tuber tissue for analysis of starch content was frozen at −20 °C for up to 4 months before use. For a given set of experiments, control and transgenic plants were grown in the same greenhouse at the same time.MethodsConstruction of Antisense Binary VectorThe 2.2-kb NcoI fragment encoding the full-length cDNA of potato GBSS (15.Dry I. Smith A. Edwards A. Bhattacharrya M. Dunn P. Martin C. Plant J. 1992; 2: 193-202PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned, in the antisense orientation, into the NcoI site of pRAT3. pRAT3 contains a 1.1-kb fragment of the potato SSIII cDNA in antisense orientation between the cauliflower mosaic virus double 35S promoter and terminator (13.Marshall J. Sidebottom C. Debet M. Martin C. Smith A.M. Edwards A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1121-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The resulting [promoter]-[SSIII antisense (1 kb)]-[GBSS antisense (2.2 kb)]-[SSIII antisense (0.1 kb)]-[terminator] chimera was excised as a KpnI/XhoI fragment and ligated between the KpnI/SalI sites of plant transformation vector pBIN19 (16.Bevan M.

After thawing, granules were recovered by centrifugation and incubated with occasional stirring at 37 °C for 7 h in 50 mm Mes-KOH (pH 5.6) at 0.3 mg/ml, with 4 units of α-amylase (porcine pancreas) mg−1 starch. Granules were then washed three times by resuspension and centrifugation in acetone at −20 °C, and dried. Dry starch samples were brushed onto the surface of double-sided, carbonated sticky stills attached to SEM stubs (Agar Scientific, Cambridge, UK), coated with gold for 3 min at 15 mA in argon using a Polaran SEM coating unit (Polaran Equipment, Watford, UK), and viewed in a Philips XL30 Field Emission Gun SEM (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).Small-angle X-ray Scatter AnalysisAnalyses were performed according to Refs. 19.Jenkins P.J.

Polymer. 1992; 33: 2628-2635Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar.Analysis of Starch CompositionThe size distribution and relative amounts of amylose and amylopectin in starch and starch fractions were examined by low pressure gel permeation chromatography. Samples of starch (20 mg), amylopectin (15 mg), or amylose (5.2 mg) were suspended in 1 m NaOH (0.4 ml) and diluted with 1 ml of dH2O and boiled for 5 min. After cooling, a further 1 ml of dH2O was added. The resulting solution was loaded onto two 1-m (i.d. 15 mm) Sepharose CL-2B columns connected in series, equilibrated in 10 mm NaOH, and eluted in a descending mode at 0.16 ml/min. Fractions of 6 ml were collected, and samples were mixed with acidified iodine (Lugol's) solution and monitored at 595 nm.Partial Purification of Amylose and AmylopectinAmylose and amylopectin were prepared by butanol precipitation. Starch samples (1.33 g) were suspended in 100 ml of H2O and boiled for 1 h, adjusted to pH 5.9–6.3 with 100 mm phosphate buffer, autoclaved (100 kPa, 1 h), and heated under reflux conditions at 100 °C for 1 h. Butanol (25 ml) was added, and the mixture was refluxed for 1 h then allowed to cool very slowly from boiling point to ambient temperature (over a period of 36–48 h). The amylose precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and the amylopectin-containing supernatant was again subjected to the refluxing procedure described above. The combined amylopectin-containing supernatants and the combined amylose-containing precipitates were lyophilized. Amylopectin was also prepared by gel permeation chromatography, as described above. Fractions from the amylopectin peak were neutralized with 2 m HCl, desalted, and lyophilized.Analysis of Chain-length Distribution of AmylopectinAnalysis of the chain-length distribution of the shorter chains of amylopectin was achieved by using fluorophore-assisted polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (FAGE) of debranched starch using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer (11.Edwards A. Fulton D.C. Hylton C.M. Jobling S.A. Gidley M. Roessner U. Martin C. Smith A.M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 251-261Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Analysis of the chain-length profile across the full range of chain lengths was achieved by HPLC. For routine analysis, amylopectin obtained either by the butanol precipitation method or by gel permeation chromatography, was suspended in boiling water (10 mg/ml) then autoclaved (100 kPa, 30 min). For some analyses amylopectin was instead suspended in 90% (v/v) Me2SO (10 mg/ml) and stirred in a boiling water bath for 15 min before precipitation with four volumes of methanol. The precipitate was redissolved in a one-fifth volume of water. Amylopectin suspensions obtained by either of the above methods were mixed with 1/20 volume of 220 mmsodium acetate (pH 4.8) and 4 × 104 units of isoamylase (Sigma Chemical Co.), incubated at 37 °C for 16 h then autoclaved (100 kPa, 30 min). A sample of 100 μl was immediately loaded onto the HPLC system, which consisted of guard columns and three HPLC columns connected in series (SecurityGuard (4 × 3 mm), Biosep-Sec-S 2000 guard column (75 × 7.8 mm), two Biosep-Sec-S 2000 columns (600 × 7.8 mm) and a Biosep-Sec-S 3000 column (600 × 7.8 mm); all from Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The columns and sample injector were heated to 37 °C. The system was eluted with water at 0.28 ml/min, and 0.56-ml fractions were collected. To a sample (0.28 ml) of each fraction was added 1/20 volume of 220 mmsodium acetate (pH 4.8) and 0.28 units of amyloglucosidase. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight then assayed enzymatically for glucose. Two checks were made on the authenticity of the long chains detected in amylopectin. First, results were compared from samples of amylopectin prepared from the same batch of starch either by gel permeation chromatography or by the butanol precipitation method. Second, results were compared from samples of the same batch of amylopectin prepared either in water or in Me2SO, as described above. Pullulan standards were from Polymer Laboratories Ltd., Church Stretton, Shropshire, UK.Measurement of Sugar Nucleotides, ATP and ADPRapid sampling and extraction of tuber tissue was according to Ref. 22.Merlo L.

The transgenic lines thus produced are referred to as SSIII/GBSS antisense lines. The fragments of the GBSS and SSIII cDNAs used in the construct had both been used previously to obtain plants expressing antisense RNA for either SSIII (11, 13: referred to as SSIII antisense lines) or GBSS (24: referred to as GBSS antisense lines). In subsequent experiments, the SSIII/GBSS lines were compared with three SSIII and three GBSS antisense lines described previously (11.Edwards A. Fulton D.C. Hylton C.M. Jobling S.A. Gidley M.

Of the 35 independent transformants examined, seven had reductions of 80% or more in granule-bound activity relative to a control line, and five of these also had reductions of 50% or more in soluble starch synthase activity. The latter reductions were shown to be specific for the SSIII isoform by native gel electrophoresis of tuber extracts followed by staining for starch synthase activity (Fig. 1A). The intensity of the band representing SSIII was greatly reduced in transgenic plants with low soluble starch synthase activity, but the intensities of bands representing SSII (11.Edwards A. Fulton D.C. Hylton C.M. Jobling S.A. Gidley M. Roessner U. Martin C. Smith A.M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 251-261Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and SSI (25.Kossmann J. Abel G.J.W. Springer F. Lloyd J. Willmitzer L. Planta. 1999; 208: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were unaffected. In two of the plants, soluble and granule-bound starch synthase activities were reduced to levels comparable with those in the most extreme SSIII and GBSS antisense lines characterized previously. These lines (Rot1.1 and Rot1.4) were propagated for further study.Soluble starch synthase activity in the SSIII/GBSS antisense tubers was reduced by 3.4-fold (Rot1.1) and 4.9-fold (Rot 1.4) relative to the control line (Table I), compared with reductions of between 2.5- and 5.5-fold in the SSIII antisense lines (11.Edwards A. Fulton D.C. Hylton C.M. Jobling S.A. Gidley M. Roessner U. Martin C. Smith A.M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 251-261Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13.Marshall J. Sidebottom C. Debet M. Martin C. Smith A.M. Edwards A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1121-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus the reductions in SSIII activity in Rot1.1 and Rot1.4 are comparable with those in the SSIII antisense lines. Granule-bound starch synthase activity was reduced by 8-fold (Rot 1.1) and 14-fold (Rot 1.4) compared with a reduction of 7- to 12-fold at a comparable developmental stage in the most extreme GBSS antisense lines studied previously (lines 5 and 8 (24.Tatge H. Marshall J. Martin C. Edwards E.A. Smith A.M. Plant Cell Env. 1999; 22: 543-550Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). Confirmation that the extent of reduction in GBSS was comparable in the SSIII/GBSS and the most extreme GBSS antisense lines, was obtained by probing blots of granule-bound proteins with an antiserum against GBSS (Fig. 1B).Table IActivities of enzymes of starch synthesisEnzymeControl line (Desiree)SSIII/GBSSAntisense line Rot1.1Antisense line Rot1.4μmolSoluble starch synthase (nmol/min/g FWT)63.6 ± 4.218.7 ± 2.013.1 ± 0.7GBSS (nmol/min/g FWT)114.8 ± 5.114.9 ± 1.58.1 ± 0.6ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (nmol/min/g FWT)651 ± 78795 ± 81551 ± 78Starch-branching enzyme (μmol/min/g FWT)35.5 ± 3.245.9 ± 5.5 (3)35.7 ± 3.4Soluble starch synthase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and starch-branching enzyme were assayed in the soluble fraction of crude extracts of freshly harvested tubers. Starch-branching enzyme was measured by the phosphorylase stimulation assay. Activity is expressed as micromoles of glucose from glucose 1-phosphate incorporated into glucan/min/g fresh weight (FWT). Granule-bound activity (GBSS) was estimated by subtracting soluble starch synthase activity from starch synthase activity in the crude, uncentrifuged homogenate. With the exception of the starch-branching enzyme activity for line Rot1.4, values are means ± S.E. of measurements on five extracts, each from a different tuber, using tubers from at least three plants. The value for starch-branching enzyme activity for line Rot1.4 is the mean of measurements on three extracts, each from a different tuber. Open table in a new tab To check whether activity of enzymes of starch metabolism other than SSIII and GBSS were affected in the SSIII/GBSS antisense tubers, we assayed activities of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch-branching enzyme and analyzed starch-degrading activities on native, amylopectin-containing gels. There were no major differences between the SSIII/GBSS antisense lines and untransformed Desiree with respect to these activities (Table I, Fig. 1C).Granule Morphology and AnatomyStarch contents (per gram of fresh weight) of mature tubers of the transgenic lines were not reduced relative to those of the control line. In three harvests, the starch contents of SSIII and GBSS antisense lines and the SSIII/GBSS antisense line Rot1.4 were not statistically significantly different from the control line. The starch content of the SSIII/GBSS antisense line Rot 1.1 was about 30% higher than that of the control line in two harvests and not statistically significantly different from the control line in the third harvest (data not shown).There were striking differences in the morphology of starch granules from mature tubers of the GBSS, SSIII, and SSIII/GBSS antisense lines. Granules of the GBSS antisense lines were ovoid and unfissured like those of untransformed Desiree (Fig. 2, A and B). Granules of SSIII antisense lines were deeply internally fissured with fissuring centered on the hilum (origin of growth), or were multilobed or clustered structures. This was true of lines with reductions in SSIII activity of as little as 2.5- to 3-fold, as well as of lines with greater reductions in activity (11, 13; Fig. 2C). Fissures developed as SSIII granules matured, rather than being formed continuously from the start of granule synthesis. Small granules from young, developing tubers were not fissured (Fig. 2D). Thus fissures represent a fracturing of a previously continuous matrix rather than the non-continuous development of the matrix. Granules of the SSIII/GBSS antisense lines were not fissured. Some appeared as clusters of small granules. Mature granules were more spherical and had a more central hilum than those of untransformed Desiree and the GBSS antisense lines (Fig. 2E).Figure 2Morphology and internal structure of starch granules.

The growth rings represent the alternation of semi-crystalline and amorphous zones within the matrix, with a repeat distance of some hundreds of nm. Growth rings were visualized by digesting internal surfaces with α-amylase, which preferentially digests material in amorphous zones. Rings were distinct and evenly spaced in granules from the control line and from the GBSS and SSIII/GBSS antisense lines (Fig. 2, G–I). However, growth rings in granules from SSIII antisense plants were much less distinct and regular in appearance (Fig. 2J). This indicates some disruption of the normal organization of the semi-crystalline zones of the granule.To investigate further the disruption of the semi-crystalline zones in granules of SSIII antisense lines, the small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns of starch preparations were examined. Starch granules from many different plants, including potato, show a characteristic peak in the SAXS pattern at a q-spacing of about 0.06 Å−1, where q is the angular distance in the scattering pattern. This peak represents a repeat distance of 9 nm within the semi-crystalline zones of the granule matrix. It is believed that this repeat represents the clustering of the shorter chains of amylopectin at regular intervals along the axis of amylopectin molecules. Adjacent chains within clusters form double helices. The packing of the helices in regular arrays produces alternating crystalline and amorphous lamellae (19.Jenkins P.J. Cameron R.E. Donald A.M. Starch/Staerke. 1993; 45: 417-420Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar).The SAXS peak for SSIII antisense starch occurred at a markedly lower q-value and was broader than that for untransformed Desiree starch, whereas the q-value for peaks for SSIII/GBSS antisense and GBSS antisense starches was similar to that of untransformed Desiree (Fig. 3). This indicates that the periodicity of the semi-crystalline repeat is greater and the packing is less well organized in starch from SSIII antisense tubers than in starch from control, SSIII/GBSS, and GBSS antisense tubers.Figure 3Small-angle x-ray scatter analysis of starches. Radiation with a wavelength of 1.5 Å was focused onto starch samples in the form of 50% (w/w) slurries in water. A gas-filled proportional wire chamber quadrant detector was used to collect the diffraction pattern. Experiments were carried out at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury Laboratory, UK. The symbols used indicate starches from a control line transformed with BIN19 alone (open triangles), SSIII antisense line 18 (closed triangles), GBSS antisense line 6 (closed squares), and SSIII/GBSS antisense line Rot1.1 (open squares).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Granule CompositionThe amylose content of starch was much lower in GBSS and SSSIII/GBSS antisense lines than in the control line. Amylose was almost undetectable in starch from both the most extreme GBSS antisense line and the SSIII/GBSS antisense lines when analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (Fig. 4A). C"

PTPμ has been shown previously to interact with the E-cadherin complex. LNCaP cells express normal levels of E-cadherin and catenins but do not mediate either PTPμ- or E-cadherin-dependent adhesion. Re-expression of PTPμ restored cell adhesion to PTPμ and to E-cadherin. A mutant form of PTPμ that is catalytically inactive was re-expressed, and it also restored adhesion to PTPμ and to E-cadherin. Expression of PTPμ-extra (which lacks most of the cytoplasmic domain) induced adhesion to PTPμ but not to E-cadherin, demonstrating a requirement for the presence of the intracellular domains of PTPμ to restore E-cadherin-mediated adhesion.

We tested whether PKC could be playing a role in the ability of PTPμ to restore E-cadherin-dependent adhesion. Activation of PKC reversed the adhesion of PTPμWT-expressing cells to E-cadherin, whereas treatment of parental LNCaP cells with a PKCδ-specific inhibitor induced adhesion to E-cadherin.

The extracellular segment of PTPμ contains a MAM ((Meprin/A5/PTPμ) domain, an Ig domain, and four fibronectin type III repeats (3.Gebbink M. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R.

PTPμ contains a single membrane-spanning region with two cytoplasmic PTP domains. Only the membrane proximal PTP domain has catalytic activity (8.Gebbink M.F. Verheijen M.H. Zondag G.C. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The role of the membrane distal PTP domain is not known, but this domain has been implicated in directing protein-protein interactions in other RPTPs (reviewed in Ref. 2.Brady-Kalnay S. Beckerle M. Cell Adhesion: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2001: 217-258Google Scholar). The intracellular juxtamembrane domain of PTPμ contains a region that is homologous to the conserved intracellular domain of the cadherins (9.Tonks N.K. Yang Q. Flint A.J. Gebbink M. Franza B.R. Hill D.E. Sun H. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cadherins are a family of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules that play an essential role in the formation of the cell-cell contacts termed adherens junctions (10.Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Cadherin-dependent adhesion is important for many physiological processes including establishment of cell polarity, morphogenetic movements such as epithelial/mesenchymal transitions, and cell type sorting during development (10.Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 11.Vleminckx K. Kemler R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Cadherins interact with the actin cytoskeleton via binding of the cytoplasmic domain to catenins (12.Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The catenins include α, β, γ/plakoglobin, and p120. β- and γ-catenin bind directly to the cytoplasmic segment of cadherin, whereas α-catenin binds to β- or γ-catenin thereby linking the cadherin-catenin complex to the cytoskeleton. Deletions in the catenin-binding region of cadherins disrupt cadherin-mediated adhesion despite the presence of an intact extracellular segment (12.Provost E. Rimm D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 567-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, the underlying mechanisms that regulate adhesion are still poorly understood. PTPμ has been shown to associate with the cadherin-catenin complex (13.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15.Hiscox S. Jiang W.G. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 1077-1080PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, PTPμ interacts with a number of classical cadherins including E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and cadherin 4 (also called R-cadherin) (14.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The classical cadherins have a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain, and PTPμ has been shown to bind directly to the C-terminal 38 amino acids of the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, which is the likely binding site in the other classical cadherins as well (14.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We have shown that PTPμ regulates N-cadherin-mediated neurite outgrowth (16.Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In fact, expression of a catalytically inactive form of PTPμ perturbed N-cadherin-mediated neurite outgrowth. This demonstrates that the phosphatase activity of PTPμ is required for N-cadherin-mediated signal transduction and/or regulation of the cytoskeleton in neurons. In this study, we employed the LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell line (17.Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S. Kawinski E. Karr J. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar) to investigate the role of PTPμ in E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. Unlike normal prostate epithelial cells, LNCaP cells do not express endogenous PTPμ. Although these cells express the proteins in the cadherin-catenin complex, we found that they did not mediate E-cadherin-dependent adhesion in aggregation assays and in an in vitro adhesion assay. By using a retroviral/tetracycline-repressible system, we re-expressed wild type and mutant forms of PTPμ in LNCaP cells and tested their effect on cell adhesion. Our data indicate that the cytoplasmic domain is important for restoring E-cadherin-dependent adhesion regardless of catalytic activity. In a recent paper (18.Mourton T. Hellberg C.B. Burden-Gulley S.M. Hinman J. Rhee A. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14896-14901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we isolated RACK1 as a PTPμ-interacting protein using a two-hybrid screen. RACK1 is a scaffolding protein that was originally identified as a receptor for activated protein kinase C (19.Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Because RACK1 binds activated protein kinase C, we tested whether PKC may play a role in the ability of PTPμ to regulate E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. Data presented here suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of PTPμ regulates E-cadherin-mediated adhesion through modulating PKC via the PTPμ/RACK1 interaction. Monoclonal antibodies against the intracellular (SK7) and extracellular (BK2) domains of PTPμ have been described (4.Brady-Kalnay S. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 6.Brady-Kalnay S. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28472-28477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against γ-catenin (5172) was kindly provided by Dr. Pamela Cowin (New York University). Monoclonal antibodies against chick L1 (8D9) were generated in our lab using hybridoma cells generously provided by Dr. Vance Lemmon (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). Monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin, p120, α- and β-catenin, and RACK1 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A monoclonal antibody against vinculin and a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of E-cadherin (DECMA) were purchased from Sigma. Goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM immunobeads were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Laboratories (San Francisco) or goat anti-mouse IgG immunobeads were alternatively obtained from Cappel (Costa Mesa, CA). Normal prostate epithelial cells were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). LY294002, PMA, rottlerin, chelerythrine chloride, GF109203X, and Gö6976 were purchased from Calbiochem. RPMI 1640 medium, SMEM medium, and laminin were obtained from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). Tween 20 was obtained from Fisher. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. The retroviral system used is a tetracycline-repressible (“tet-off”) promoter-based system (20.Paulus W. Baur I. Boyce F.M. Breakfield X.O. Reeves S.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 62-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using the pBPSTR1 vector generously provided by Dr. Steven Reeves (Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA), the following constructs were generated: wild type PTPμ, the C-S mutant form of PTPμ, and PTPμ-extra. The wild type PTPμ plasmid (PTPμWT) and the PTPμC1095S (C-S) catalytically inactive mutant have been described previously (16.Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, the wild type PTPμ plasmid contained almost the entire coding sequence of PTPμ (base pairs 1–4350, i.e. it only lacked the last two amino acids and the stop codon). This was done to create an in-frame fusion with the green fluorescence protein at the C terminus (PTPμ-GFP). The mutant form of PTPμ is also GFP-tagged and contains a cysteine to serine mutation at residue 1095. A construct containing the extracellular, the transmembrane, and 55 amino acids of the intracellular domains has been previously described (4.Brady-Kalnay S. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (Note: PTPμ-extra is not GFP-tagged.) This construct was subcloned into the tetracycline-regulatable retroviral vector, pBPSTR1. Replication-defective amphotrophic retroviruses were made by transfecting the PA317 helper cell line (ATCC CRL-9078) with the respective PTPμ-containing plasmids. Control virus was generated by transfecting PA317 helper cells with the pBPSTR1 plasmid. An E-cadherin GST fusion protein construct containing amino acids 9–139 of mouse E-cadherin was obtained from Dr. Robert Brackenbury (University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH). The E-cadherin GST fusion protein was constructed by restriction digest of pBATEM2 with PvuII and HincII. The fragment was ligated into the SmaI site of pGEX-KG, which results in a fusion protein containing amino acids 9–139 of E-cadherin with GST at the N terminus. The GST fusion protein construct for expression of the entire extracellular domain of PTPμ has been described previously (4.Brady-Kalnay S. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Expression of GST-tagged proteins in E. coli was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min and lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine, sonicated, and centrifuged again at 3000 × g for 10 min to remove debris. The supernatant was passed over glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed, and the bound protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione as described previously (4.Brady-Kalnay S. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells (17.Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S. Kawinski E. Karr J. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were infected with retrovirus by the addition of Polybrene (5 μg/ml) and virus-containing medium. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the medium was exchanged with normal culture medium. Five days after infection, the cells were checked for expression of the PTPμ proteins, which were tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) by fluorescence microscopy. LNCaP cells were rinsed once with PBS, and the cells were lysed in Triton-containing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm benzamidine, 200 μm phenylarsine oxide, 1 mm vanadate, 0.1 mm ammonium molybdate, and 2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture) and scraped off the dish. In all experiments where RACK1 was co-immunoprecipitated, the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm vanadate, and 2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 min, and the Triton-soluble material was recovered in the supernatant. The amount of protein was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as a standard. Lysates were boiled in equal volume of 2× sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by 6 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting as described previously (4.Brady-Kalnay S. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Antibodies (5 μg of IgG/IP or 1.25 μg of IgM/IP) were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG or IgM immunobeads, respectively, for 2 h at room temperature and then washed 3 times with PBS (9.5 mm phosphate, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Immunoprecipitates were prepared by incubating lysates containing either 250 μg of protein (Fig. 5) or 400 μg of protein (Fig. 6) with antibody-coupled beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, then boiled in sample buffer, and separated by 6 or 10% SDS-PAGE. One-fifth of the immunoprecipitate was loaded per lane. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted as described (4.Brady-Kalnay S. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).Figure 6PTP μ interacts with RACK1 regardless of catalytic activity. LNCaP cells were infected with retrovirus containing an empty vector (VEC), PTPμWT (WT), a catalytically inactive mutant form of PTPμ (C-S), or PTPμ-extra (E). Five days after infection, the cells were lysed, and 400 μg of the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody generated against RACK1 (a), a monoclonal antibody generated against the extracellular domain of PTPμ (BK2) (b), or a monoclonal antibody generated against the intracellular domain of PTPμ (SK7) (c). The immunoprecipitates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with antibodies generated against RACK1 (a–c). d, the immunoblot of RACK1 immunoprecipitates shown in a was stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal antibody generated against PKCδ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Aggregation assays were performed as described previously (21.Brackenbury R. Thiery J. Rutishauser U. Edelman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6835-6840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized in the presence of calcium, which selectively preserved cadherins (22.Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 464-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Uninfected LNCaP cells or cells infected with either PTPμWT or C-S mutant were rinsed twice in HCMF buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 5.5 mmglucose) containing 2 mm CaCl2 and trypsinized into single cells by incubation with 0.04% trypsin in HMCF buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2. The trypsin was inactivated by the addition of RPMI containing 10% serum. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2 ml of SMEM, followed by a 20-min incubation with 20 units/ml DNase on ice. Some of the cells re-expressing PTPμWT were treated with 200 μg/ml of an E-cadherin function-blocking antibody (DECMA) for an additional 20 min on ice. 2 × 106 cells were added to scintillation vials containing HMCF buffer with a final concentration of 2 mmCaCl2. Where indicated, the CaCl2 was substituted with 5 mm EDTA (final concentration). Aggregation was initiated by placing the vials at 37 °C at 90 rpm in a gyratory shaker. Aliquots of the samples were diluted 50-fold in PBS, and the number of particles were determined using a Coulter Counter. The Coulter Counter was set at a lower threshold of 10%, 1/aperture current of 16, 1/amplification of 2. Percent aggregation was calculated by subtracting the number of particles after 1 h (Nt) from the initial particle number and dividing by the initial number {((N0 −Nt)/N0) × 100}. Sterile coverslips were coated overnight with 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma), washed twice in sterile water, and allowed to dry. Subsequently, the coverslips were coated with nitrocellulose in methanol (23.Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and allowed to dry. Purified recombinant proteins were diluted in PBS containing 2 mm CaCl2 to a concentration of 75 μg/ml for PTPμ and E-cadherin, respectively, and 40 μg/ml for laminin. To identify the individual protein spots on the coverslips, the protein solutions were supplemented with 20 μg/ml Texas Red BSA (Sigma). Three distinct spots, each containing a single adhesion molecule (laminin, E-cadherin, and PTPμ), were generated by spotting 20 μl of each protein solution on one coverslip. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the protein solutions were aspirated, and this procedure was repeated once. Remaining binding sites on the nitrocellulose were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS, and the dishes were rinsed with RPMI 1640 medium. LNCaP cells infected with the indicated retrovirus were fully trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen), and 3 × 105 cells were added to coverslips, and the cells were allowed to adhere overnight to regenerate cell surface proteins. In the control experiments, function-blocking antibodies to either PTPμ (BK2, 10 μl/ml ascites) or E-cadherin (DECMA, 1:1 dilution of culture supernatant), or 5 mm EDTA (final concentration) was added to the dishes just prior to the addition of cells. In some experiments, the overnight incubation was followed by a 15-min incubation with 20 nm PMA or an equal volume of Me2SO. Alternatively, uninfected LNCaP cells were added to coverslips and incubated overnight followed by a 45-min incubation with either 5 μm rottlerin, 10 μm chelerythrine chloride, 0.5 μmGF109203X, 15 nm Gö6976, 10 μmLY294002, or Me2SO alone. At the concentrations used, chelerythrine chloride (IC50 = 0.66 μm) and GF109203X (IC50 ranges between 8 nm and 5.8 μm for different isoforms of PKC) are specific for PKC, whereas rottlerin is specific for PKCδ (IC50 = 6 μm), and Gö6976 is specific for PKCα and -β (IC50 = 2.3 and 6 nm, respectively). LY294002 inhibits the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (IC50 = 1.4 μm). The medium was then removed, and the coverslips were rinsed once in PBS to remove unattached cells. The cells were subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.01% glutaraldehyde in PEM buffer (80 mm Pipes, 5 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 3% sucrose), pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed twice in PBS and mounted in IFF mounting medium (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 20% glycerol, and 0.1% p-phenylenediamine). Adherent cells were detected by dark field microscopy, using a 5× objective, and photographed. To quantify the number of adherent cells, the 35-mm negatives were scanned, and the digitized images were analyzed using the Metamorph image analysis program (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). The number of adherent cells per image was approximated by highlighting the cells using the threshold function, and the total number of highlighted cells per image was calculated. The data obtained in 4–6 separate experiments were analyzed by Student's t test (Statview 4.51, Abacus Concepts, Inc.). The receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTPμ has been shown previously to interact with E-cadherin in a variety of tissues by immunoprecipitation (13.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K.

To investigate whether PTPμ plays a functional role in E-cadherin-mediated adhesion, we employed the LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell line (17.Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S. Kawinski E. Karr J. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike normal prostate epithelial cells (NPr), these cells do not express PTPμ (Fig. 1a, VEC). To re-express PTPμ in LNCaP cells, we generated a tetracycline-regulatable retrovirus encoding the PTPμ cDNA sequence tagged with the green fluorescence protein (PTPμ-GFP) (16.Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). By using this retrovirus, we re-expressed wild type PTPμ (PTPμWT) in the LNCaP cells. Five days after retroviral infection, the cells were analyzed for expression of PTPμWT-GFP by immunoblot and by fluorescence microscopy. Immunoblot analysis showed that LNCaP cells infected with retrovirus containing an empty vector do not express PTPμ (Fig. 1a, VEC). Cells infected with retrovirus containing PTPμWT (Fig. 1a, WT) expressed both the full-length protein (200 kDa) as well as the proteolytically processed forms (∼100 kDa) (6.Brady-Kalnay S. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28472-28477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the GFP tag, both the full-length and the proteolytically processed forms of the re-expressed PTPμWT migrated at a higher molecular weight than the PTPμ expressed in normal prostate cells (Fig. 1a, NPr). The retroviral system we used is a tet-off system, and in the presence of tetracycline the gene is not expressed. The re-expression of PTPμWT was inhibited by treating the cells with tetracycline (Fig. 1a, WT+T). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that between 70 and 90% of the LNCaP cells expressed PTPμWT and that PTPμ was primarily localized to the plasma membrane as expected (Fig. 2, C and D). This expression was repressed when the cells were grown in the presence of 4 μg/ml tetracycline (Fig. 2, E and F). Control cells infected with a virus containing an empty vector did not show any fluorescence (Fig. 2, A and B).Figure 2GFP-tagged forms of PTP μ are expressed at the cell surface and regulated by tetracycline. LNCaP cells were infected with a retrovirus containing an empty vector (A and B), wild type PTPμ tagged with GFP in the absence (C and D) or presence (E and F) of 4 μg/ml tetracycline, or with a mutant form of PTPμ containing a single C-S point mutation in the catalytic site (G and H). Five days after infection, the expression of GFP-tagged proteins was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (×128 magnification). Representative phase contrast (A, C, E, and G) and fluorescent (B, D, F, and H) images are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the functional role of PTPμ catalytic activity in the regulation of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion, we have generated tetracycline-repressible retrovirus encoding a mutant form of PTPμ-GFP containing a single amino acid mutation in the catalytic site (16.Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved cysteine residue PTPμC1095S (C-S) results in a catalytically inactive enzyme. Immunoblot analysis showed that the C-S mutant was expressed at a similar level to PTPμWT in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1a, C-S). Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that infection with the C-S mutant (Fig. 2, G and H) resulted in expression at the plasma membrane at a similar level as PTPμWT, demonstrating that the expression and subcellular localization are not affected by the loss of catalytic activity. To investigate whether PTPμ plays a role in E-cadherin-mediated adhesion in LNCaP cells, we trypsinized the cells in the presence of CaCl2 to selectively preserve the cadherins (22.Takeichi M. J.

https://openalex.org/W2058628193,"AKT1/protein kinase Balpha is a protein-serine/threonine kinase that regulates multiple targets involved in cell survival and cell cycle progression in a variety of cell types including breast cancer cells. To explore the role of Akt1 in mammary gland function and tumorigenesis, transgenic mice were generated that express human AKT1 under the control of the MMTV promoter. Virgin transgenic mice did not exhibit a dominant phenotype, but upon cessation of lactation, a notable delay in involution occurred compared to age-matched non-transgenic mice. The delay in involution coincided with increased hyperplasia as evidenced by an increased number of binucleated epithelial cells and a marked elevation in cyclin D1 expression in mammary epithelium. The delayed involution phenotype corresponded to increased phosphorylation of Thr308 in AKT1 and Ser136 in BAD, but not phosphorylation of Ser21 in GSK-3alpha. There was no evidence of mammary dysplasia or neoplasia during the lifespan of multiparous transgenic mice. These data suggest that AKT1 is involved in cell survival in the lactating and involuting mammary gland, but that overexpression of AKT1 alone is insufficient to induce transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2137661415,"We have investigated the role of HIF-1 in the cellular response to redox modulation via the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. We demonstrate that manipulation of redox in air, achieved by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase with cyanide, induces HIF-1 mediated transcription in wild-type CHO and HT1080 human tumour cells but not in CHO cells deficient in the oxygen responsive, HIF-1α sub-unit of HIF-1. Hypoglycaemia attenuates cyanide-mediated transcription in non-transformed HIF-1 wild-type CHO cells but not the human tumour derived cell line. Cells lacking either HIF-1α, or the second composite sub-unit of HIF-1, HIF-1β, were markedly more sensitive to the combined stress of perturbed redox and hypoglycaemia than wild-type cells. As such conditions together with hypoxia are prevalent in tumours, these data suggest that HIF-1 may have a protective role in adaptation to the tumour micro-environment. In support of this we demonstrate that HIF-1α deficient cells are less tumorigenic than wild-type cells. They showed a reduced growth rate when grown as xenografts in nude mice. This was not related to vascular parameters that were identical to those found in HIF-1 wild-type tumours. The HIF-1 deficient tumours lacked focal expression of Glut-1 in hypoxic tumour regions. Compromized glucose uptake and metabolic adaptation to the tumour micro-environment may form the basis of the reduced tumorigenecity associated with these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2134723313,"Retrograde signaling from postsynaptic cells to presynaptic neurons is essential for regulation of synaptic development, maintenance, and plasticity. Here we report that the novel protein AEX-1 controls retrograde signaling at neuromuscular junctions in C. elegans. aex-1 mutants show neural defects including reduced presynaptic activity and abnormal localization of the synaptic vesicle fusion protein UNC-13. Muscle-specific AEX-1 expression rescues these defects but neuron-specific expression does not. AEX-1 has an UNC-13 homologous domain and appears to regulate exocytosis in muscles. This retrograde signaling requires prohormone-convertase function in muscles, suggesting that a peptide is the retrograde signal. This signal regulates synaptic vesicle release via the EGL-30 Gq(alpha) protein at presynaptic terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2026511197,"Little is known about the growth-signaling pathways that govern the proliferation of Ewing tumor (ET) cells either in vitro or in vivo. We have studied signal transduction pathways in ET cell lines and compared kinase expression levels and proliferation rates with primary tumors. Cell lines were studied both as conventional adherent monolayers and as anchorage-independent multi-cellular spheroids. Importantly, we observed significant differences between these in vitro models and found that ET spheroids were more closely related to primary tumors with respect to cell morphology, cell–cell junctions, proliferative index and kinase activation. Monolayer ET cells demonstrated serum-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT and constitutively high serum-independent cyclin D1 protein expression. However, when ET cells were placed in suspension culture, there was immediate serum-independent activation of ERK1/2 and AKT. In addition, cyclin D1 protein expression was completely blocked until stable multi-cellular spheroids had formed, indicating that cell–cell adhesion is necessary for the proliferation of anchorage independent ET cells. This reduction in cyclin D1 expression was post-transcriptional and could be mimicked in monolayer cells by treatment with phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. Moreover, PI3K inhibition significantly reduced ET cell proliferation and, in primary ET samples, cyclin D1 expression correlated with expression of activated AKT. Thus, the PI3K–AKT pathway appears to be critical for the proliferation of ET cells both in vitro and in vivo and tumor cell growth in vivo may be better represented by the study of anchorage-independent multi-cellular spheroids."

https://openalex.org/W2080483972,"Amplification and/or overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase HER2/Neu and the cell cycle regulatory gene cyclin D1 are frequently associated with human breast cancer. We studied the functional significance of cyclin D1 in Neu-induced mammary oncogenesis by developing mice overexpressing either wild-type or mutant Neu in a cyclin D1 deficient background. The absence of cyclin D1 suppresses mammary tumor formation induced by the wild-type or activated mutant form of Neu, which promote multi- and single-step progression of tumorigenesis, respectively. These data indicate that cyclin D1 is preferentially required for Neu-mediated signal transduction pathways in mammary oncogenesis. Significantly, 35% of mutant Neu/cyclin D1(-/-) mice regained mammary tumor potential due to compensation by cyclin E. Thus, shared targets of cyclins D1 and E are important in modulating Neu function in mammary tumorigenesis. Our results imply that the combinatorial inhibition of cyclins D1 and E might be useful in the treatment of malignancies induced by Neu."
https://openalex.org/W1984604375,"We previously demonstrated that the forced expression of pro-caspase-3 can revert acquired chemoresistance in MT1-Adr breast cancer cells which show a defective activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. We now asked whether the manipulation of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling can revert different types of drug resistance, i.e. the resistance due to impaired mitochondrial activation in the MT1-Adr cells and the resistance in MT3-Adr cells which is caused by increased expression of the Mdr-1/p-glycoprotein ABC transporter. Here we show that Bcl-2 overexpression is the underlying cause for the resistant phenotype in the MT1-Adr cells. Overexpression of the apoptosis-promoting Bax homologue Bak or the BH3 only protein Nbk/Bik reverts, as expected, acquired drug resistance in the MT1-Adr cells as recently demonstrated for pro-caspase-3. Moreover, we show that both apoptosis-promoters, Nbk/Bik and Bak, antagonize acquired chemoresistance for epirubicin-mediated apoptosis in MT3-Adr breast cancer cells. Neither drug uptake nor drug efflux were influenced by Bak or Nbk/Bik. Thus, our data show that manipulation of the downstream apoptosis signaling cascade by Bak and Nbk/Bik can overcome not only drug resistance due to mitochondrial apoptosis deficiency (in the MT1-Adr cells) but also classical, i.e. efflux-mediated, resistance for drug-induced cell death in the MT3-Adr cell line. Nbk/Bik and Bak could therefore be target genes to increase chemosensitivity and overcome different types of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2022406631,"The mouse Polycomb-group gene, embryonic ectoderm development (eed), appears to regulate cellular growth and differentiation in a developmental and tissue specific manner. During embryogenesis, eed regulates axial patterning, whereas in the adult eed represses proliferation of myeloid and B cell precursors. The present report demonstrates two novel functional activities of eed: alteration of thymocyte maturation and suppression of thymic lymphoma development. Mice that inherit the viable hypomorphic 17Rn5(1989SB) eed allele sustain a partial developmental block at or before the CD4(-)CD8(-)CD44(-)CD25(+) stage of thymocyte differentiation. Furthermore, mice that are homozygous or heterozygous for the hypomorphic eed allele have an increased incidence and decreased latency of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced thymic lymphoma compared to wild-type littermates. These findings support the notion that Polycomb-group genes exert pleiotropic effects dictated by developmental stage and cellular context."

For example, substituting the glycine residue at position 88 with arginine decreases the affinity for RI and endows RNase A with cytotoxic activity (16.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Replacing Lys41 with an arginine residue results in a decrease in catalytic activity that is compensated by a decrease in affinity for RI (18.Bretscher L.E. Abel R.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9893-9896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). K41R/G88R RNase A has enhanced toxicity to K-562 cells as compared with G88R RNase A. Some endosomal pathways end in the lysosomal degradation of proteins. The KFERQ pentapeptide sequence targets cytosolic proteins for lysosomal degradation via an alternative pathway (for reviews, see Refs. 19.Dice J.F. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20.Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 21.Cuervo A.M.

Chem. 1985; 260: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that microinjected RNase A associates with lysosomes upon cellular fractionation. Subsequent studies found that the KFERQ pentapeptide, which comprises residues 7–11 of RNase A, regulates lysosomal degradation (23.Dice J.F. Chiang H.L. Spencer E.P. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6853-6859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Dice J.F. J. Protein Chem. 1988; 7: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The KFERQ sequence of RNase A is recognized by a cytosolic heat shock cognate (hsc) protein of 73 kDa (hsc73) (25.Agarraberes F.A. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). ONC does not contain a KFERQ sequence (Fig. 2). The significance of KFERQ-targeted lysosomal decay in ribonuclease-mediated cytotoxicity is unknown. This sequence, along with RI, could serve to protect cells against an invading ribonuclease. Here, we determine the effect of the KFERQ sequence on G88R RNase A-mediated cytotoxicity. Replacing Lys7 of the KFERQ sequence with an alanine residue has little effect on the conformational stability or catalytic activity of G88R RNase A. K7A/G88R RNase A does, however, have a marked decrease in affinity for RI compared with G88R RNase A and is the most cytotoxic variant of RNase A reported to date. Using other RNase A variants with substitutions in the KFERQ sequence that do not disrupt RI binding, we find that targeted lysosomal degradation via the KFERQ sequence does not modulate ribonuclease toxicity. Moreover, the toxicity of ribonucleases is not diminished in serum-deprived cells, which have enhanced KFERQ-mediated lysosomal degradation (22.McElligott M.A. Miao P. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). K-562 cells, which derive from a continuous human chronic myelogenous leukemia line, were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cell culture medium and supplements were from Invitrogen. ONC (16.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and porcine RI (26.Klink T.A. Vicentini A.M. Hofsteenge J. Raines R.T. Protein Exp. Purif. 2001; 22: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. Enzymes used for DNA manipulation were from Promega (Madison, WI) or New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [methyl-3H]Thymidine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). 6-Carboxyfluorescein∼dArU(dA)2∼6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (6-FAM∼dArU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA) was from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Yeast rRNA (16 S and 23 S) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were of commercial reagent grade or better and were used without further purification. Ultraviolet and visible absorption was measured with a Cary model 50 spectrophotometer from Varian (Sugar Land, TX). Fluorescence was measured with a QuantaMaster1 photon-counting spectrofluorometer from Photon Technology International (South Brunswick, NJ), using fluorescence-grade quartz or glass cuvettes (1.0-cm path length, 3.0-ml volume) from Starna Cells (Atascadero, CA). Radioactivity was measured with a Beckman model LS 3801 liquid scintillation counter from Beckman Instruments (Fullerton, CA). Plasmid pBXR (27.delCardayré S.B. Ribó M. Yokel E.M. Quirk D.J.

K7A RNase A and R10A RNase A were created by using oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (28.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The K7A/G88R and R10A/G88R substitutions within RNase A were created by ligating DNA fragments using the ApaI and MunI restriction sites. The K7A/K41R/G88R RNase A variant was created by ligating the DNA fragments using the ApaI and ClaI restriction sites. Wild-type RNase A and its variants were purified by using methods described previously (16.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virology. 1998; 251: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but with the following modifications. Refolding solutions for RNase A variants with the G88R substitution contained 0.50 marginine, instead of 0.10 m NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy using ε = 0.72 ml mg−1 cm−1 at 277.5 nm for RNase A (31.Sela M. Anfinsen C.B. Harrington W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and its variants and ε = 0.87 ml mg−1 cm−1at 280 nm for ONC (16.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). All ribonucleases used in biological assays were dialyzed exhaustively versus phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), which contained in 1.00 liter: KCl (0.20 g), KH2PO4 (0.20 g), NaCl (8.0 g), and Na2HPO4 (2.16 g). The conformational stability of RNase A variants was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 287 nm (A287) with increasing temperature (32.Eberhardt E.S. Wittmayer P.K. Templer B.M. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1697-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The temperature of solution of protein (0.3 mg/ml) in PBS was increased from 25 to 75 °C in 1 °C increments. The A287 was recorded after a 7-min equilibration at each temperature. The value of Tm is the temperature at the midpoint of the thermal denaturation. Data were collected and analyzed with the program THERMAL (Varian Analytical Instruments; Walnut Creek, CA). Ribonucleolytic activity was measured by using a fluorogenic substrate (33.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 23 °C in 2.00 ml of 0.10 m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing NaCl (0.10 m). Solutions contained 6-FAM∼dArU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA (50 nm) and enzyme (1.0–5.0 pm). Fluorescence was monitored by using 493 and 515 nm for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Kinetic parameters were determined by a linear least-squares regression analysis of the initial velocity using Equation 1 (33.Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), V/K=(ΔF/Δt)Fmax−F0Equation 1 where V/K is the first-order rate constant, ΔF/Δt is the slope from the linear regression, Fmax is the final fluorescence intensity after the reaction has reached completion, and F0 is the initial fluorescence intensity before enzyme is added. The value of kcat/Km was calculated by dividing V/K by the enzyme concentration. The value of Kd for the complex between porcine RI and RNase A variants was determined by using a competitive binding assay. It has been shown that the fluorescence of fluorescein-labeled A19C/G88R RNase A (fluorescein∼G88R RNase A) decreases by ∼15% upon binding to RI. 2R. A. Abel, M. C. Haigis, C. Park, and R. T. Raines (2002), submitted manuscript. Thus, fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to evaluate the ability of an unlabeled ribonuclease to compete with fluorescein∼G88R RNase A for binding to RI. Specifically, cuvettes of PBS containing fluorescein∼G88R RNase A (50 nm), an unlabeled RNase A variant (1 nm–2 μm), and dithiothreitol (1 mm) were incubated at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C). After 15 min, the initial fluorescence intensity was measured with 490 and 511 nm for the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Next, RI was added with stirring (to 50 nm), and the average fluorescence intensity was measured after an additional incubation of 4 min. The maximum fluorescence decrease upon RI binding was measured with samples that lacked unlabeled ribonuclease. The concentration of the RI·fluorescein∼G88R RNase A complex was determined by comparing the fluorescence of a sample with the fluorescence decrease observed when all of the fluorescein∼G88R RNase A was bound by RI. The Kd value was determined as described.2 The effect of RI binding on catalytic activity was monitored directly, but qualitatively, by an agarose gel-based assay as described previously (16.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.6-ml siliconized microcentrifuge tubes of 0.10m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing NaCl (0.10m), dithiothreitol (1 mm), yeast rRNA (4 μg), and a ribonuclease (10 ng) were mixed with RI (0, 10, 20, or 40 units, where 1 unit is the amount required to inhibit the activity of 5 ng of RNase A by 50%). After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing EDTA (50 mm), glycerol (30%, w/v), xylene cyanol FF (0.25%, w/v), and bromphenol blue (0.25%, w/v) was added. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through an agarose gel (1%, w/v) containing ethidium bromide (0.4 μg/ml). Control samples were incubated in the absence of a ribonuclease or RI (or both). The effect of RNase A, its variants, and ONC on cell proliferation was determined by measuring the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into cellular DNA. K-562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. Unless indicated otherwise, all culture medium contained fetal bovine serum (10%, v/v), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing CO2 (g; 5%, v/v). All toxicity studies were performed using asynchronous log-phase cultures. For toxicity assays, cells (95 μl of a solution of 5 × 104 cells/μl) were incubated with a 5-μl solution of a ribonuclease or PBS in the wells of a 96-well plate. Cells were incubated for 44 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing CO2 (g; 5%, v/v). Next, the proliferation of cells was monitored with a 4-h pulse of [methyl-3H]thymidine (0.4 μCi/well). Cells were harvested onto glass fiber filters using a PHD Cell Harvester (Cambridge Technology; Watertown, MA). Filters were washed with water and dried with methanol, and their 3H content was measured with liquid scintillation counting. Serum-deprived cells have enhanced KFERQ-mediated lysosomal degradation of RNase A (22.McElligott M.A. Miao P. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11986-11993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To discern the effect of RNase A, its variants, and ONC on the proliferation of cells with enhanced KFERQ-mediated degradation, K-562 cells were grown in RPMI medium without fetal bovine serum for 18 h prior to the addition of a ribonuclease. Ribonuclease-mediated cytotoxicity was measured as described above. Cytotoxicity data were analyzed with the programs SIGMAPLOT (SPSS Science; Chicago, IL) and DELTAGRAPH (DeltaPoint; Monterey, CA). Each data point represents the mean (± S.E.) of at least three experiments, each performed in triplicate. The IC50 value of each variant was calculated by using Equation 2, S=IC50IC50+[ribonuclease]×100Equation 2 where S is the percent of total DNA synthesis after the incubation period (48 h). RNase A variants were designed with the primary goal of discerning a role for the KFERQ sequence (residues 7–11) in cytotoxicity. Because RNase A itself is not cytotoxic, the cytotoxic G88R RNase A variant was used as a basis for this work. In addition, amino acid substitutions were combined with the secondary goal of producing variants that have high ribonucleolytic activity, low affinity for RI, and thus (presumably) high cytotoxicity. Lys7 and Arg10 comprise the enzymic P2 subsite, which interacts with a phosphoryl group of an RNA substrate (35.Boix E. Nogués M.V. Schein C.H. Benner S.A. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2529-2534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Nogués M.V. Vilanova M. Cuchillo C.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Cuchillo and co-workers (35.Boix E. Nogués M.V. Schein C.H. Benner S.A. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2529-2534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that replacing either Lys7 or Arg10 alone with a glutamine residue has only a minor effect on catalysis of RNA cleavage, but that replacing both Lys7 and Arg10 decreases catalytic activity by 60-fold. Likewise, replacing both Lys7 and Arg10 with alanine residues results in a kcat/Km value that is 60-fold lower than that of wild-type RNase A (37.Fisher B.M. Ha J.-H. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12121-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The interaction between Lys7 of RNase A and porcine RI was investigated previously by using semisynthetic variants (38.Neumann U. Hofsteenge J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Neumann and Hofsteenge (38.Neumann U. Hofsteenge J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) found that replacing Lys7 with an S-methyl cysteine residue resulted in a >50-fold decrease in affinity for RI. This result is consistent with the structure of the RI·RNase A complex in which the side-chain nitrogen of Lys7 donates a hydrogen bond to the C-terminal carboxyl group of RI (Fig. 1) (39.Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Arg10 makes no contact with RI in the complex. Accordingly, we replaced Lys7 and Arg10 of RNase A independently with an alanine residue. The resulting K7A and R10A variants are designed to disrupt the KFERQ sequence, without decreasing ribonucleolytic activity. By systematically incorporating these changes in a cytotoxic variant, G88R RNase A, we were able to investigate the contribution of Lys7 and Arg10to cytotoxicity. Phe8, Glu9, and Gln11 are important to the structure and function of RNase A. Replacing Gln11 with an alanine, glutamine, or histidine residue enables the enzyme to bind a substrate in a nonproductive manner (40.delCardayré S.B. Raines R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The contributions of Phe8 and Glu9have been determined in RNase S (or RNase S′), which is a noncovalent complex of residues 1–20 (or 1–15) and 21–124. In this complex, replacing Phe8 (41.Scoffone E. Rocchi R. Marchiori F. Moroder L. Marzotto A. Tamburro A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 5450-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or Glu9 (42.Dunn B.M. Chaiken I.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 95: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with other residues decreases its conformational stability or catalytic activity (or both). Because these three residues of the KFERQ sequence play roles other than in lysosomal degradation, we left them intact. The side chain of Lys41 of RNase A donates a hydrogen bond to the transition state during catalysis of RNA cleavage (29.Messmore J.M. Fuchs D.N. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8057-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Changing Lys41to an arginine residue results in a 102-fold decrease in catalytic activity. Although K41R/G88R RNase A has low catalytic activity, it binds RI with less affinity than does G88R RNase A. Moreover, K41R/G88R RNase A is more cytotoxic than G88R RNase A (18.Bretscher L.E. Abel R.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9893-9896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hence, we used the K7A/K41R/G88R RNase A variant to explore the additivity of single substitutions that disrupt RI binding, as well as the relationship between catalytic activity, RI affinity, and cytotoxicity. The conformational stability of the RNase A variants was measured to ensure that the proteins were folded properly during all assays. Values of Tm for RNase A, its variants, and ONC are listed in Table I. The Tm values of both wild-type RNase A and G88R RNase A in PBS were determined to be 63 °C, respectively; this value is similar to those reported previously (16.Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 43.Quirk D.J. Park C. Thompson J.E. Raines R.T.

K7A RNase A, K7A/G88R RNase A, R10A RNase A, and R10A/G88R RNase A were found to have Tm values of 63, 62, 60, and 62 °C, respectively. K41R/G88R RNase A and K7A/K41R/G88R RNase A were both found to have a Tm value of 63 °C. Hence, all RNase A variants were essentially completely folded during assays at 37 °C or room temperature. The Tm value of ONC in PBS was reported previously to be 90 °C (44.Leland P.A. Staniszewski K.E. Kim B. Raines R.T.

Ribonucleolytic activity was measured by using a fluorogenic substrate, 6-FAM∼dArU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA, which exhibits a nearly 200-fold increase in fluorescence upon cleavage of the P–O5′ bond on the 3′ side of the single ribonucleotide-embedded residue (33.Kelemen B.R.

https://openalex.org/W2077052091,"Opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic actions of TRAIL and the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) contribute to the cell's decision to survive or die. We demonstrate that in H157 human lung carcinoma cells, etoposide and doxorubicin induce the NF-kappaB-dependent expression of both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins including TRAIL and its death receptor, DR5, and IAPs. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation in H157 cells in response to genotoxin resulted in loss of cell surface expression of TRAIL and DR5, aggressive growth and chemotherapy resistance of tumors in nude mice. Similar to the paracrine TRAIL response in H157 cells, the sensitivity of normal lung and breast epithelium and carcinomas to undergo genotoxin-induced apoptosis correlates strongly with cell surface expression of TRAIL. Suppression of TRAIL signaling by expression of the TRAIL decoy receptor, DcR1, confers chemoresistance to cancer cells. These findings demonstrate that TRAIL signaling via its death receptors is a significant contributor to genotoxin-induced apoptosis in human epithelial carcinomas."

Its functional equivalents in mammalian cells are the mannose 6-phosphate receptors that mediate sorting to lysosomes of mannose 6-phosphate-containing lysosomal proteins. A chimeric receptor was constructed by substituting the cytoplasmic domain of Mr 300,000 mannose 6-phosphate receptor with the Vps10p cytoplasmic tail. Expression of the chimera in cells lacking endogenous mannose 6-phosphate receptors resulted in a subcellular receptor distribution and an efficiency in sorting of lysosomal enzymes similar to that of the wild type Mr 300,000 mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Moreover, the cytoplasmic tail of the Vps10p was found to interact with GGA1 and GGA2, two mammalian members of a recently discovered family of clathrin-binding cytosolic proteins that participate in trans-Golgi network-endosome trafficking in both mammals and yeast.

Our findings suggest a conserved machinery for Golgi-endosome/vacuole sorting and may serve as a model for future studies of yeast proteins. In mammalian cells, soluble lysosomal proenzymes are posttranslationally modified in the Golgi complex and acquire mannose 6-phosphate residues that function as lysosomal sorting signals. The two known mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs), 1The abbreviations used are: MPRmannose 6-phosphate receptorcdcytoplasmic domainCPYcarboxypeptidase YGSTglutathione S-transferaseTGNtrans-Golgi networkVHSVsp27p/Hrs/STAM homologywtwild typeLDLlow density lipoproteinMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast(s)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the larger MPR300 and the smaller MPR46, both mediate the transport of newly synthesized enzymes from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to a prelysosomal compartment (for review see Ref. 1.Hille-Rehfeld A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 177-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast to their ligands, the MPRs do not reach the lysosomes but recycle between endosomes and the TGN and additionally between endosomes and the plasma membrane. However, only MPR300 binds and internalizes ligands at the plasma membrane (2.Stein M. Meyer H.E. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Exchange of domains between MPR300 and MPR46 results in functional proteins mediating lysosomal enzyme sorting (3.Sandholzer U. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol.

The receptor for Golgi-vacuole transport of the soluble carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), i.e. the type I integral protein Vps10p, was discovered by the isolation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that missort CPY (5.Bankaitis V.A.

Vps10p binds lumenal ligands via its N-terminal domain, and although it bears no homology to MPRs and sorts CPY by recognition of a peptide and not a carbohydrate, its function in yeast corresponds to the function of MPRs in mammalian cells. The cytoplasmic domains (cds) of various receptors have been extensively analyzed for signals regulating their interaction with cytosolic binding partners and their intracellular trafficking. Clathrin has been directly linked to the process of MPR sorting at the TGN (10.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The ligand-MPR complex is transported in clathrin-coated vesicles to a prelysosomal compartment, and after dissociation of the complex, the ligands, i.e. lysosomal hydrolases, are delivered to the lysosomes, whereas the MPRs return to the TGN for another round of transport. Previous work has shown that MPRs are recruited into clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN by a process involving specific signals in the receptor cds (11.Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, a dileucine-based motif as well as a tyrosine-based motif is important for the efficient transport of MPRs from the TGN to prelysosomes and may represent binding sites for the Golgi-specific clathrin AP-1 complex (12.Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 13.Honing S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, sorting of a mutant MPR in which the dileucine residues were substituted by two alanines was not affected at the TGN (16.Tikkanen R. Obermuller S. Denzer K. Pungitore R. Geuze H.J. von Figura K. Honing S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and AP-1 knock-out appears to block the return of MPRs from the endosomes rather than their exit from Golgi (17.Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), indicating that alternative or additional proteins partake in sorting at TGN. Two such proteins could be the recently described TIP47 (18.Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and PACS-1 (19.Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Both bind the cytoplasmic tail of MPR300, and TIP47 has been shown to play a role in the retrieval of MPR300 and MPR46 from late endosomes to the TGN (18.Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Similar studies show evidence that the Vps10p cd plays a corresponding role in the retrieval of Vps10p from the prevacuolar compartment and that transport from the TGN to the endosome is independent of direct interactions between the receptor and the clathrin coat (20.Deloche O. Yeung B.G. Payne G.S. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, recycling of Vps10p to the TGN is conditioned by a tyrosine-based signal located in its cd (21.Cereghino J.L. Marcusson E.G. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22.Cooper A.A. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and cells that lack clathrin grow poorly but are viable and do not missort CPY (23.Seeger M. Payne G.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A novel family of ubiquitous coat proteins mediating the formation of intracellular transport-intermediates and selection of cargo are the GGAs (Golgi-localizing γ-adaptin ear homology domain ADP-ribosylation factor binding protein). The GGAs are characterized by an N-terminal VHS domain, and although they have a C-terminal domain with homology to the γ-adaptin “ear” domain, they are otherwise not related to the adaptor proteins. Disruption of the two GGA genes in S. cerevisiae results in missorting of CPY and in morphologically defective vacuoles (24.Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 25.Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1885-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Also, overexpression of a GGA construct lacking the clathrin binding domains seems to block the clathrin-dependent transport of MPR300 from the TGN to endosomes (27.Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These and other findings have strongly suggested that GGAs function to facilitate trafficking of proteins between TGN and the vacuole or its mammalian equivalent, the lysosome (for review see Ref.28.Dell'Angelica E.C. Payne G.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 395-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that GGAs interact directly with sortilin, a multiligand Vps10p-like mammalian receptor, and with the two MPRs, and that the interaction is established between the GGA-VHS domain and a C-terminal segment in the receptor cds (29.Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 30.Takatsu H. Katoh Y. Shiba Y.

Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, the picture emerges that the mammalian GGAs select receptors for TGN-endosome transport in clathrin-coated carriers and that the receptors are targeted on the basis of specific binding sites harbored within C-terminal acidic cluster-dileucine motifs of the receptor cd. In the present study we have expressed a MPR300/Vps10p cd chimeric receptor in MPR-deficient cells and show that it is as efficient as the wt MPR300 for sorting of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the Vps10p cd can bind (mammalian) GGAs that are new and potentially important participants in TGN-endosome transport. Our findings evidence a highly conserved sorting machinery and suggest that expression of Vps10p or other yeast receptors in similar mammalian cell models may provide new information on protein sorting and trafficking. The chimera was named corresponding to the origin of the lumenal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domain of either the MPR300 (L) or the Vps10p (V) (compare Fig. 1). The chimera was constructed from the human cDNAs using the overlap extension PCR-based mutagenesis method as described (3.Sandholzer U. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14132-14138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fragments of the genes that are to be recombined are generated in separate PCR reactions. For expression all cDNAs were subcloned into the pMPSVHE or pMPSVEH vector (32.Artelt P. Morelle C. Ausmeier M. Fitzek M. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For subcloning into the MPR300, an MluI restriction site was introduced behind the stop codon at position 7626. Chimeras containing the lumenal MPR300 portion were subcloned into a pMPSV-derived vector containing the MPR300 cDNA by an internal NdeI site at position 6724 and the recombinant MluI site. MPR300-furin-tail, MPR300-TGN38-tail and MPR300-LDL-receptor tail constructs were constructed by the above mentioned procedure, using cDNAs from cow for furin (33.Schafer W. Stroh A. Berghofer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), from rat for TGN38 (34.Luzio J.P. Brake B. Banting G. Howell K.E. Braghetta P. Stanley K.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and from human for LDL receptor (35.Yamamoto T. Davis C.G. Brown M.S. Schneider W.J. Casey M.L. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Cell. 1984; 39: 27-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced in the regions encompassing mutations using the ABI 310 system (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of the primers used in this study are available on request. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21) were grown in the same medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Transfection of BHK21 was performed as reported (36.Wendland M. Hille A. Nagel G. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and transfection of MEF deficient in MPR 46 and MPR300 (mpr− MEF) was performed as described (37.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For determination of the relative amounts of wild type MPR300 and MPR300-Vps10p chimera, the monoclonal mouse antibody 2C2 recognizing the luminal epitope of human MPR300 was used (38.Chao H.H. Waheed A. Pohlmann R. Hille A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded on 3.5-cm plates. The next day the plates where incubated with 5 μg of 2C2 antibody/ml of binding medium (Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.5% saponin. For determination of surface-associated receptors, the incubation was performed in the absence of saponin. The cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline in the absence or presence of saponin, respectively, harvested by using a rubber maid, and lysed in extraction buffer (50 mm imidazol, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C. A sandwich ELISA was performed to determine the amount of bound 2C2 antibody. A microtiter plate (96 wells) was coated overnight with affiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG antibody 10 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (Jackson Immuno Research Labaratories) at 4 °C. The following day the plate was washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, and unspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline) at room temperature as all following steps. The sample extracts containing the MPR-2C2 antibody complex were diluted 1:5 in blocking buffer and allowed to bind for 2 h. A dilution series from 100–2.5 ng/ml 2C2 antibody in blocking buffer was performed in parallel for generating a standard curve. The plate was washed twice with washing buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20) to remove unbound material. Immobilized 2C2 antibody was detected by ELISA. Biotin-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in blocking buffer (1: 300) was allowed to bind for 1 h. The plates were then washed three times with washing buffer followed by 1 h of incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated ExtrAvidin in blocking buffer (1:1000). After final washing steps the substrate reaction with pNitrophenylphosphate (Sigma) was performed and stopped after 5–10 min with 1.5 m NaOH. The intensity was measured by absorption at 405 nm using an ELISA reader. The expression levels were estimated as the number of ng of bound 2C2 antibody/mg of total protein. Lysosomal enzymes were detected using fluorometric assays as described (39.Koster A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For the analysis of the stability of the receptor polypeptides, the cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine exactly as described. Immunoprecipitation was performed from cells and media as described (3.Sandholzer U. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14132-14138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The human MPR300 was immunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for the human MPR300 (40.von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Hasilik A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The radioactivity incorporated into the polypeptides was quantified by densitometry using the PhosphorImager “Storm” and the program Image Quant (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Samples were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis as described (40.von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Hasilik A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For cathepsin D 25 μg of total cellular protein were subjected to Western blot analysis, and the blot was probed with antiserum specific for cathepsin D. For the human MPR300 lumenal domain the mouse monoclonal antibody 2C2 was used, and the human MPR46 was detected using a specific serum from goat. The blots were probed using an ECL light-based immunodetection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Phosphomannan-Sepharose affinity chromatography was performed as described (36.Wendland M. Hille A. Nagel G. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed as described (37.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM PCM2000, Nikon, Germany). Mouse Lamp1 was detected using a monoclonal anti-mouse hybridoma medium (1D4B; Developmental Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), human MPR300 was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (2C2) recognizing a lumenal epitope (38.Chao H.H. Waheed A. Pohlmann R. Hille A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), human MPR46 was detected using a goat antiserum directed against human MPR46 (41.Wenk J. Hille A. von Figura K. Biochem. Int. 1991; 23: 723-731PubMed Google Scholar), and cathepsin D was detected using a rabbit antiserum (42.Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid analysis (Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid system; CLONTECH) of the various receptor cd constructs and generation of the GGA2 domain constructs were carried out as previously described (29.Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The GGA1-VHS (nucleotides 16–519) and the GGA1-EAR (nucleotides 1429–1935) domain constructs were generated by a similar procedure using a full-length (nucleotides 16–1935) GGA1 cDNA kindly provided by L. Jacobsen. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with GGA1 and GGA2 were constructed in the pGEXvector (29.Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For pull-down experiments mpr− MEF (80% confluent), wild type or transfected with full-length MPR300 and MPR46, MPR300-Vps10p cd, MPR300-Furin cd, MPR300-TGN38 cd, or MPR300-LDL receptor cd chimeric constructs, were lysed on ice in a 1% Triton X-100 buffer either containing 300 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (buffer A), or containing 300 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (buffer B) and supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (CompleteMini; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Debris was removed by pelleting, and 100 μl of lysate supernatant was supplemented with 900 μl of buffer A or B (with proteinase inhibitors) prior to addition of 10 μg of GST fusion protein (GST-GGA1-FL, GST-GGA1-VHS, GST-GGA1-EAR, GST-GGA2-VHS, or GST alone) according to Ref. 29.Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar. Following overnight incubation (4 °C), the samples were supplemented with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and incubated for an additional 4 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose was pelleted, and the beads were washed (three times for 5 min) at 4 °C in buffer A and buffer B containing 0.1% Triton X-100 before resuspension in sample buffer and SDS-PAGE. For quantitation, the proteins precipitated from cells were dissociated from the Sepharose beads by the addition of surplus glutathione (Sigma) and subsequently subjected to Western blotting detecting MPR300. The amounts of MPR300 protein found in lysates prior to precipitation and the quantity isolated by affinity beads were finally compared by SDS-PAGE. MPR300 and Vps10p are type I transmembrane proteins. For the construction of the receptor chimera, the cd of the MPR300 was replaced by that of the Vps10p receptor (Fig. 1). The domains were designated L or V, according to their origin from the MPR300 or Vps10p, respectively. In the three-letter code the first letter signifies the lumenal, the second signifies the transmembrane, and the third signifies the cytoplasmic domain, e.g. MPR300 is termed LLL, and the MPR300/Vps10p cd chimera is termed LLV. The receptors were expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack endogenous MPR46 and MPR300 (mpr− MEF) (42.Pohlmann R. Boeker M.W. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27311-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and missort 98% of soluble lysosomal enzymes to the medium. In these cells, loss of lysosomal enzymes can be minimized by the expression of a receptor protein that re-establishes functional sorting. Stably transfected clones were selected, and the level of the chimera expression was quantified in permeabilized cells by measuring the binding of a monoclonal antibody directed against the lumenal domain of MPR300 (monoclonal antibody 2C2). The expression level of the chimeric receptor LLV was 0.7–1.9-fold that of endogenous MPR300 in normal MEF cells (Table I). Clones expressing similar levels of wt MPR300 were used for comparison (3.Sandholzer U. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol.

After expression, the subcellular distribution of the chimeric receptor, its ability to bind ligands, and its efficiency in sorting of lysosomal ligands was compared with that of the wild type MPR.Table IExpression level and surface expression of wt MPR300 and MPR300 Vps10p chimera in mpr− MEFCell line2C2 bindingaAll values are corrected for the binding of 2C2 to mpr− MEF and represent the mean of three or four independent experiments (for the LLL clone D see also Ref.37).Cell surface receptoraAll values are corrected for the binding of 2C2 to mpr− MEF and represent the mean of three or four independent experiments (for the LLL clone D see also Ref.37).MPR levelng/mg% of totalfold endogenousmpr−/MPR300 (LLL) Clone 145 ± 5.36.3 ± 2.11.08 Clone 290.5 ± 6.48.2 ± 1.72.18 Clone D112.1 ± 8.27.6 ± 3.22.71mpr−/LLV Clone A30.2 ± 2.49.2 ± 2.10.73 Clone B36 ± 2.111.3 ± 3.20.87 Clone C78 ± 4.310.2 ± 3.11.88a All values are corrected for the binding of 2C2 to mpr− MEF and represent the mean of three or four independent experiments (for the LLL clone D see also Ref.37.Kasper D.

Open table in a new tab The fraction of receptors accessible to the 2C2 antibody at the cell surface varied between 6 and 11% for the wt MPR300 as well as for the LLV chimera (Table I). Thus, the fraction of receptors present at the cell surface was essentially unaffected by substitution of the Vps10p cd for the MPR300 cd. Based on indirect immunofluorescence, the intracellular distribution of MPR300 and the LLV receptor was comparable. The bulk of receptors was concentrated in structures surrounding the nucleus and in vesicular structures that were scattered throughout the cytoplasm, with few toward the periphery of the cells. We saw no morphological signs indicating accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum or within lysosomal structures (as defined by the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D; Fig. 2). The capacity for lysosomal proteolysis in the mpr− MEF depends on the sorting function of the expressed MPRs. The apparent stability of MPRs expressed in mpr− MEF is therefore linked to their targeting to lysosomes and their efficiency in sorting of lysosomal proteinases. For this reason the stability of the chimera and of the wild type receptor was compared in BHK cells (described under “Experimental Procedures”). The BHK cells express endogenous MPR46 and MPR300, and the proteolytic capacity of lysosomes therefore depends less or not at all on the sorting function of the recombinant receptors. Similar half-lives were detected for wt MPR300 and LLV chimera (LLL, 11 h; LLV, 11 h). The ability of the LLV chimera and the wt MPR300 to bind ligands was analyzed by testing their binding to phosphomannan-Sepharose. Affinity chromatography of cell lysates was performed as described (3.Sandholzer U. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14132-14138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the amount of material that was eluted from the affinity matrix with 5 mm mannose 6-phosphate was found to be comparatively similar for the wt and chimeric MPR (LLL, 98%; LLV, 98%). Receptor-mediated endocytosis was examined using the monoclonal antibody 2C2, which is directed against the lumenal MPR300 domain. Thus, mpr− MPR300 and mpr− LLV cells were incubated with the 2C2 antibody for 2–60 min at 37 °C and subsequently analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. As seen in Fig. 3, the staining demonstrated that both receptors are subject to rapid internalization from the plasma membrane. To assess the sorting function of the chimeric and the wt MPR300, the accumulation of lysosomal enzymes in the medium was determined. When untransfected mpr− MEF are incubated for 24 h, about 90% of the total β-hexosaminidase activity contained in the culture is found in the medium, and only 10% is found in the cells. Transfection with wt MPR300 increases the cellular fraction of β-hexosaminidase to about 80% of total, depending on the level of receptor expression (37.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ability of the LLV chimera to increase the fraction of intracellularly retained β-hexosaminidase was comparable with that of wt MPR300 (91% for wt MPR300 and 82% for LLV). It is known from earlier studies that in cells expressing only MPR300, part of the newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are not transferred directly from the secretory route to endosomes/lysosomes but are first secreted and then recaptured by MPR300-mediated endocytosis (37.Kasper D. Dittmer F. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The extracellular activity of β-hexosaminidase was therefore measured in the presence and absence of 5 mm mannose 6-phosphate, which inhibits receptor-mediated uptake from the medium. As apparent from Fig. 4, the presence of mannose 6-phosphate in mpr− cultures increased the extracellular fraction of β-hexosaminidase from 18 to 38% in mpr− LLV cells and from 9 to 26% in wt MPR300 transfectants with a similar level of receptor expression. This indicates that the high sorting efficiency partly results from receptor-mediated binding and internalization of secreted lysosomal enzymes and that the secretion-recapture pathway known for MPR300 is also used by the LLV chimera. Analysis of the lysosomal proteinase cathepsin D by Western blotting revealed that expression of MPR300 or LLV chimera induced normal intracellular steady state concentrations of cathepsin D. Moreover, the relative distribution of the cathepsin D precursor, the single chain intermediate and of the double chain mature form was as in control MEF cells (Fig. 5). Because the proteolytic processing that leads to the intermediate and mature forms depends on the transport of the cathepsin D precursor to endosomes/lysosomes, these data further show evidence that cathepsin D is correctly targeted in cells expressing LLV chimera and that the endosomes/lysosomes in these cells contain the proteinases required for the full processing. This was supported by indirect immunofluorescence, showing colocalization of cathepsin D and the lysosomal marker Lamp1 in transfected as well as in MEF control cells (Fig. 2). Finally, no difference could be detected between wt MPR300 and LLV in the sorting of metabolically labeled newly synthesized β-glucuronidase (not shown). The above results show that the Vps10p cd is an efficient substitute for the MPR300 cd and that it conveys Golgi-endosome transport in mammalian cells. This strongly suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of the yeast protein is capable of interacting not only with the yeast adaptor molecules involved in this type of sorting but also with their mammalian counterparts. The recently discovered GGAs contribute to Vps10p sorting in yeast and are believed to play an important role in the Golgi-endosome trafficking of the Vps10p-related receptor sortilin and the two MPRs. Additional experiments were therefore performed to clarify whether the Vps10p cd could in fact bind to human GGA1 and GGA2. A series of chimeras containing the lumenal and the transmembrane part of the MPR300 in combination with the cds of various receptors were expressed in MEF cells and tested for interaction by pull-down experiments using GST-GGA fusion proteins comprising full-length GGA1 or the VHS or EAR domain of GGA1 and GGA2. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the LLV chimera bound to full-length GGA1 as well as to the VHS domain of both GGA1 and GGA2, whereas pull-down experiments by GGA1-EAR (Fig. 6) and GGA2-EAR (not shown) were unproductive. The results were similar with wild type receptors (shown in Fig. 6 for MPR46 and MPR300 and for sortilin in Nielsen et al. (29.Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar)) and chimeras carrying the cd of receptors known to bind GGAs and to mediate Golgi-lysosome transport (MPR46, MPR300, and sortilin (data not shown)). The MPR46, in accordance with previous observations (43.Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), did not react with GGA2-VHS. In contrast, none of the fusion protein constructs were able to precipitate chimeras containing the cd of the endocytic low density lipoprotein receptor or the Golgi-resident proteins Furin and TGN38. Further evidence to an interaction between the Vps10p cd and GGAs was obtained in the yeast two-hybrid system. Initial analysis demonstrated that the wt sortilin tail interacted readily with VHS constructs of GGA1 (Fig. 7) and GGA2 (not shown), whereas the wt cds of Vps10p, MPR300, and MPR46 provided little or no response (not shown). Positive reactions, however, were obtained using truncated constructs constituting the C-terminal parts of the receptor cds. Thus, the GGA2-VHS produced a weak response with the truncated MPR46 cd and a strong response with the truncated MPR300 cd (not shown), and both MPR constructs interacted strongly with GGA1-VHS (Fig. 7). Moreover, the truncated Vps10p cd, which did not interact with the GGA2-VHS (not shown), gave rise to a comparatively weak but distinct and specific response in combination with GGA1-VHS (Fig. 7). The function of MPRs in mammalian cells corresponds to the function of Vps10p in yeast. Both receptors are type I integral membrane proteins harboring signals for intracellular trafficking in their cds. This suggested that their cds might be exchangeable and that a chimeric MPR containing the Vps10p cd would target newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes in mammalian cells. The present study confirms this assumption and demonstrates that the chimeric receptor LLV, which combines the lumenal ligand binding and the transmembrane parts of human MPR300 with the yeast Vps10p cd, is functional in mammalian cells and corrects the missorting of mammalian lysosomal enzymes in MPR-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The analysis demonstrates that the chimeric receptor can internalize mannose 6-phosphate-containing ligands, indicating that the yeast Vps10p cd contains endocytosis signals that are recognized by mammalian cells. Thus, LLV and MPR300 are both functional in endocytosis despite their lack of cd structural homology, and, to our surprise, the LLV chimera cycles via the plasma membrane, a characteristic not observed for the wt Vps10p in yeast (44.Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude the possibility that unknown determinants harbored in the MPR300 lumenal domain may influence the subcellular receptor localization, but our findings strongly indicate that the yeast Vps10p cd contains sequence motifs that are recognized by the sorting machinery of mammalian cells. Indirect immunofluorescence showed no difference in the intracellular distribution of wt MPR300 and the LLV chimera. The bulk of the receptors was concentrated in the perinuclear area and in vesicular, tubular, and cisternal structures. None of the receptors accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum, nor did we see any accumulation of receptors in lysosome-like structures. The stability of MPR300 depends on its lumenal domain because loss of the receptor mainly occurs through non-lysosomal proteolysis in this segment. The cleaved lumenal domain is released into the extracellular fluid, indicating that proteolysis occurs at the cell surface or within the secretory route (45.Clairmont K.B. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12131-12134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various combinations of the lumenal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of MPR300 and MPR46 result in unstable receptors (3.Sandholzer U. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14132-14138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and MPR chimeras containing the furin or the TGN38 cd likewise have short half-lives. It is therefore interesting that the LLV chimera and the wt MPR300 in this study exhibit similar stability, suggesting that they are exposed to similar environmental conditions and consequently may travel through the same compartments. We furthermore present the first direct evidence of an interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of Vps10p and (mammalian) members of the recently described GGA family of cytosolic proteins, human GGA1 and GGA2, mediated by the VHS domains. This finding is in accordance with the present observations of LLV trafficking and with the concept that the GGAs are tail-binding proteins involved in receptor-mediated transport of lysosomal enzymes in mammalian and yeast cells. The pull-down experiments clearly demonstrated binding of the Vps10p cd to the receptor-binding VHS domains, in contrast to the EAR domains, of GGA1 as well as GGA2. However, in the two-hybrid analysis the interaction could only be confirmed by use of a truncated Vps10p cd construct. Because the cds of the two MPRs, but not the sortilin cd, also require truncation for two-hybrid GGA interaction, one explanation for this phenomenon could be that relatively large cytoplasmic domains have additional (structural) requirements not met by the two-hybrid system. The fact that the Vps10p cd only reacted with the GGA1 construct might in addition reflect that GGA1 have fewer requirements for binding than GGA2. 2L. Jacobsen, P. Madsen, and C.M. Petersen, unpublished results. The combined data support the hypothesis that adaptor proteins other than AP-1 are involved in transport of transmembrane receptors and their cargo from the TGN to the vacuole/lysosome. It also suggests that the transport systems to the yeast vacuole and the mammalian lysosome may be more conserved than expected. Expression in yeast of a Vps10p chimera containing the MPR300 cd should demonstrate whether the mammalian receptor cd harbors functional motifs that can mediate sorting to the yeast vacuole. In summary, our analysis shows that the LLV chimera is functional in terms of lysosomal enzyme sorting. The yeast Vps10p cd was as efficient as the human MPR300 cd for receptor-mediated transfer of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Another construct comprising the Vps10p cd in combination with the lumenal part of MPR46, the second MPR of mammalian cells, is currently under investigation. The GGAs have differential but related/overlapping requirements for binding, and the Vps10p cd contains several segments similar to the acidic cluster-dileucine-like motifs that serve as GGA-binding sites in sortilin and the MPRs (compare Fig. 7 and Fig. 1 in Ref. 28.Dell'Angelica E.C. Payne G.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 395-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Future studies should identify the functional motifs for GGA1 and GGA2 interaction in the Vps10p cd and determine whether binding includes the third mammalian isotype, i.e. GGA3. Finally, our findings suggest that expression of MPR300/Vps10p cd (LLV) chimeras in mammalian cells may prove a useful tool in future attempts to discriminate between the functional roles of individual GGAs.

https://openalex.org/W2058886919,"Tumorigenesis of meningioma has been associated with chromosome 22, most notably the NF2 gene, but additional genes have also been implicated in meningioma development. Previously, we have cloned the cDNAs for the meningioma expressed antigen 6 (MGEA6) and its splice variant MGEA11. Here, we show that antibodies against recombinantly expressed MGEA6/11 are found in 41.7% (10/24) of the sera from meningioma patients and in 2/8 sera of glioblastoma patients, whereas no response was seen in 12 sera from healthy persons. Western-blot analyses using generated polyclonal antibodies, revealed overexpression in meningioma and glioma tumor samples compared to normal brain. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections confirms reactivity in meningioma tumor cells and tumor cells of glial origin. We found no reactivity to normal astrocytes and only faint reactivity to normal leptomeninges. Sequence analysis predicted membranic localization of MGEA6/11, that was confirmed by cell fractionation. The immune response to MGEA6/11 is frequent in both meningioma and glioma patients and may likely be attributed to overexpression of the MGEA6/11 protein in the tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058268469,"Tumor-derived p53 mutants activate transcription from promoters of various growth-related genes. We tested whether this transactivation function of the mutant protein is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis ('gain of function'). Tumor-derived mutant p53-281G transactivates the promoters of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human multiple drug resistance gene (MDR-1). To determine whether the C-terminal domain functions only as an oligomerization domain in mutant p53-mediated transactivation, we have replaced the tetramerization domain of p53 by a heterologous tetramerization domain; although this mutant protein formed tetramers in solution, it failed to transactivate significantly. Therefore, for successful mutant p53-mediated transactivation, sequences near the C-terminus of mutant p53 are required to perform functions in addition to tetramerization. We also demonstrate that co-expression of a deletion mutant of p53 (p53 del 1-293), which retains the p53 oligomerization domain, inhibits this transactivation. p53 del 1-293 co-immunoprecipitates with p53-281G suggesting that hetero-oligomers of p53-281G and p53 del 1-293 are defective in transactivation. We also show that a cell line stably transfected with p53-281G expresses higher levels of endogenous NF-kappaB and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) compared to that transfected with vector alone. On co-expression, p53 del 1-293 lowered the levels of NF-kappaB and PCNA in p53-281G-expressing cells. However, on co-expression, p53 del 1-293 did not inhibit the tumorigenicity and colony forming ability of p53-281G expressing cells. Our earlier work showed that a deletion of the C-terminal sequences of p53-281G overlapping the oligomerization domain obliterates 'gain of function'. Taken together, the above information suggests that the C-terminal sequences have some critical role in 'gain of function' in addition to transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2039717963,"Laminin is a major component of the extracellular matrix. The laminin γ1 chain is the least variant component of the laminin heterotrimeric assembly. The laminin γ1 chain gene (LAMC1) expression is induced by several factors, including transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). LAMC1 promoter contains a highly conserved transcriptional element, bcn-1. We screened cDNA libraries with the yeast one-hybrid system to identify transcriptional factors that are recognized by the bcn-1 motif. Using this strategy we isolated the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLHzip) E-box-binding transcription factor, TFE3. Until now, the E-box was the only element known to recruit the bHLHzip transcription factors. Although the bcn-1 element only remotely resembles the E-box sequence, we show that TFE3 binds and activates the bcn-1 element. TFE3 cooperates with Smad proteins in the activation of the LAMC1 promoter in cells, an effect that is critically dependent not only on the bcn-1 element but also on one of the Smad-binding elements (SBE). The cooperative induction of the LAMC1 promoter and the endogenous LAMC1 gene by TFE3 and Smad3 is augmented by the TGF-β signaling pathway.

Laminin is a large glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix localized in basement membranes (1.Deutzmann R. Schlondorff D. Bonventre J.V. Molecular Nephrology: Kidney Function in Health and Disease. Dekker, New York1995: 41-59Google Scholar). Laminin is a multifunctional protein that regulates cell-to-matrix interactions, including cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and differentiation. Laminin exerts its effects on cellular behavior by interacting with cellular receptors that recognize specific sites on the laminin molecule. Laminin exhibits all the attributes of an extracellular signaling molecule that regulates cellular architecture, for example that of glomeruli (2.Abrahamson D.R. John P.L.S. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 73-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3.Hansen K. Abrass C.K. Pathobiology. 1999; 67: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The best studied laminin receptors are the members of the integrin family of proteins (1.Deutzmann R. Schlondorff D. Bonventre J.V. Molecular Nephrology: Kidney Function in Health and Disease. Dekker, New York1995: 41-59Google Scholar). Laminin is composed of three polypeptide chains, α, β, and γ, held together by disulfide bonds, forming a cruciform structure (4.Tunggal P. Smyth N. Paulsson M. Ott M.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). There are five α (α1–5), three β (β1–3), and three γ (γ1–3) chains that account for the twelve known laminin trimeric assemblies (Laminin 1–12) (4.Tunggal P. Smyth N. Paulsson M. Ott M.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The γ1 chain, found in ten of the twelve known trimeric laminin isoforms, is the most widely expressed laminin chain (4.Tunggal P. Smyth N. Paulsson M. Ott M.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Laminin γ1 is required for basement membrane formation, and its absence causes early lethality in mouse embryos (5.Smyth N.

Although the human and the rodent promoters share only a small degree of sequence similarity, they have several common features that may be functionally be similar.

Using the yeast one-hybrid screen we identified TFE3 as one of the factors that regulates the bcn-1 element. We show that TFE3 cooperates with Smad proteins in the activation of the LAMC1gene, an effect that is bcn-1- and SBE-dependent and is augmented by the TGF-β signaling pathway. Rat mesangial cells, SI−MC cells, were cultured and maintained as described previously (21.Abrass C.K. Spicer D. Raugi G.J. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 25-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml l-glutamine. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air and were passed every 5–7 days by trypsin. Yeast shuttle vectors, pHISi and pLacZi, were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). 3-Aminotrizole (3-AT) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), and SuperFect was obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The rat mesangial cells used for construction of the library were established from collagenase-treated glomeruli, and cells were characterized (8.Richardson C.A. Gordon K.L. Couser W.G. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F273-F278PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Adler S. Baker P.J. Johnson R.J. Ochi R.F. Pritzl P. Couser W.G. J. Clin. Inv. 1986; 77: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and maintained as described previously (14.Suzuki H. Denisenko O.N. Suzuki Y. Schullery D.S. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F518-F526PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was prepared from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated (1 h) rat mesangial cells as described previously (23.Okayama H. Kawaichi M. Brownstein M. Lee F. Yokota T. Arai K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+RNA was reverse-transcribed by using an oligo(dT) primer with an XhoI site. The RNA strand of the mRNA-cDNA hybrid was replaced with the corresponding DNA strand by using Escherichia coli RNase H, E. coli DNA polymerase I, and E. coli DNA ligase (23.Okayama H. Kawaichi M. Brownstein M. Lee F. Yokota T. Arai K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and the cDNA was ligated to EcoRI linkers after both termini were blunt-ended. After cleavage with EcoRI and XhoI, the cDNA was ligated to EcoRI/SalI-digested yeast expression plasmid pGAD424 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The ligation products were purified by ethanol precipitation and electro-transformed into E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) with E. coli Pulser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to generate the pGAD-MC cDNA library. The yeast one-hybrid screen analysis was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (MATCHMAKER One-Hybrid System, CLONTECH). Briefly, three tandem copies of the 17-bp bcn-1 motif (5′-ccccgcccacctcgcgc-3′) were inserted upstream of the His3 and LacZ reporter genes by designing sense and antisense 3× bcn-1 oligonucleotides with EcoRI and XbaI or SalI sites at the ends. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed and subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI-digested, pHISi-1 or EcoRI/SalI-digested pLacZi reporter plasmids (CLONTECH). Inserts were sequenced to confirm the presence and integrity of the bcn-1 elements. Both bcn-1-reporter constructs were integrated into the genome of YM4271 strain to generate bcn-1-reporter strains. Background HIS3 expression was ablated using 10 mm 3-aminotrizole (3-AT) (Sigma). Screening bcn-1-reporter strains with a pGAD-MC cDNA library identified genes encoding bcn-1-binding proteins. Plasmids were isolated from yeast clones capable of growing in the presence of 10 mm 3-AT in (−) leucine and (−) histidine media. Plasmids from these clones were transformed into competent DH5α bacteria, and each cDNA insert was sequenced and compared with known sequences in the GenBankTM data base. False positives were excluded using the LacZ reporter gene assay. The partial or complete cDNAs of TFE3 were used as a template for in vitro transcription by SP6 or T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerases to generate mRNAs for in vitro translation as previously described (24.Gurevich V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. Obukhova T.A. Zozulya S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In vitro translation in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). To confirm that the bcn-1 element binds to TFE3, 3 μl of cell-free system containing 35S-labeled proteins was incubated in 150 μl of binding buffer for 30 min (4 °C) with 0.5 μg of wild-type bcn-1 dimer double-stranded oligonucleotide with biotin on the 5′-end of the sense strand. After the binding reaction, the DNA·protein complexes were pulled-down with streptavidin-agarose beads, and the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.1%Triton X-100). 35S-Labeled proteins eluted with SDS-loading buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. TFE3L and TFE3S were subcloned into pEX vector, a derivative of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), after cutting it out from pSV2A-TFE3 (gift from Dr. Kathryn Calame) (25.Roman C. Cohn L. Calame K. Science. 1991; 254: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with NheI and BamHI. pEXL-Smad3, pEXL-Smad4, and pCMV-TβRI-T204D were described previously (gift from Dr. Xianxin Hua) (26.Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The LAMC1 promoter fragment spanning the −1077 to −20 region of the gene (relative to first ATG codon), designated −1077/−20 LAMC1, was constructed by PCR amplification of the LAMC1−1104/+35 5′-flanking promoter region (13.O'Neill B.O. Suzuki H. Loomis W.P. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F411-F420PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion constructs of LAMC1 promoter, −506/−20 LAMC1, −293/−20 LAMC1, −1077/−529 LAMC1, were generated by PCR using appropriate primers and the −1077/−20 LAMC1 promoter as a template. The PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and digested with SacI and BglII. The SacI-BglII fragments were ligated into pGL3 basic vector cut with SacI-BglII using a Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). −239/−20 LAMC1 was constructed by digesting the −1077/−20LAMC1 promoter with XhoI and BglII, and the fragments were subcloned into XhoI- and BglII-digested pGL3 basic vector. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange site- directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The rat LAMC1 promoter (−1077 to −20, relative to the first codon) was used as a template. Mutagenesis of the two bcn-1 bases (see boldface letters below) required for protein binding was performed using the following oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-CTCCACCGCCCCGCCCGGCTCGCGCCCTTCCC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GGGAAGGGCGCGAGCCGGGCGGGGCGGTGGAG-3′. The site-directed mutagenesis of the four SBE bases, (see boldface below) was performed using the following oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-GGGGAGGGCGAGGTCACGCCTTGCACTGCGTGGTTGCGG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CCGCAACCACGCAGTGCAAGGCGTGACCTCGCCCTCCCC-3′ for SBE1, with sense, 5′-CCTCATGAAGTCAAACTTGAGATTCCGAGCCACCTCACCG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CGGTGAGGTGGCTCGGAATCTCAAGTTTGACTTCATGAGG-3′ for SBE2. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. SI−MC cells were plated at 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates and incubated in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected with 2.0 μg of reporter plasmid, effector expression plasmid (indicated in each experiment), and 0.1 μg of pRL-null (Promega) using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cell extracts were prepared 24 h later by passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was assayed by Dual Reporter Assay System (Promega) (27.Shnyreva M. Schullery D.S. Suzuki H. Higaki Y. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). SI−MC cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/plate in 100-mm plates and grown in RPMI media with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected with 10.0 μg of expression vector containing TFE3L, Smad3, TβRI-T204D, and complementary empty vector using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). After 24 h, total RNA was extracted as described before (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, after lysing cells with 6 m urea/4 m LiCl, total RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and 100% ethanol. After denaturing, 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel with 2.2m formaldehyde and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred overnight onto a nylon membrane (Nytran-N nylon membrane, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) in 10× standard saline citrate (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) by a rapid downward transfer system (Turboblotter, Schleicher & Schuell). After cross-linking of RNA, hybridization was done with 32P-labeled LAMC1cDNA probe (14.Suzuki H. Denisenko O.N. Suzuki Y. Schullery D.S. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F518-F526PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were washed, and signals were measured using a phosphorimaging device (Cyclone, Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). The rodent and human laminin γ1 chain gene (LAMC1) promoter contains a transcriptional element, bcn-1, that binds nuclear proteins from mesangial cells (7.Suzuki H. O'Neill B.C. Suzuki Y. Denisenko O.N. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18981-18988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13.O'Neill B.O. Suzuki H. Loomis W.P. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F411-F420PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Suzuki H. Denisenko O.N. Suzuki Y. Schullery D.S. Bomsztyk K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F518-F526PubMed Google Scholar). We generated a cDNA fusion library from rat mesangial cells for a screen in yeast one-hybrid system to identify factors that bind the bcn-1 element. One of the cDNA clones isolated in this screen encoded the transcription factor E3 (TFE3) (29.Beckmann H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). TFE3 is composed of a basic helix-loop-helix region and a leucine zipper (bHLHzip). Both the basic helix-loop-helix region and the leucine zipper domains are essential for DNA binding and dimerization (25.Roman C. Cohn L. Calame K. Science. 1991; 254: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29.Beckmann H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The members of the bHLHzip family of transcription factors, including TFE3, bind directly the E-box DNA motif. Isolation of the TFE3 was unexpected, because the bcn-1 element (CCCCGCCCACCTCGCGC) does not contain the classical E-box (CACGTG) sequence. There are two predominant ubiquitously expressed TFE3 isoforms (25.Roman C. Cohn L. Calame K. Science. 1991; 254: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The two transcripts represent differentially spliced mRNAs that yield long, TFE3L, and short, TFE3S, isoforms. The TFE3L isoform is by far the most abundant accounting for more than 80% of the transcripts, and the rest are mostly in the form of TFE3S (25.Roman C. Cohn L. Calame K. Science. 1991; 254: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). There is also another recently described form of TFE3, TFE3-full, that is longer than TFE3L, but its level of expression does not appear to be significant (30.Weterman M.A. Wilbrink M. Geurts van Kessel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15294-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 31.Weterman M.J. van Groningen J.J. Jansen A. van Kessel A.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TFE3L and TFE3-full contain two activation domains, one acidic (AAD) in the N terminus of the protein and the other proline-rich (Pro-AD) C-terminal to the bHLHzip region (Fig. 1A) (30.Weterman M.A. Wilbrink M. Geurts van Kessel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15294-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 31.Weterman M.J. van Groningen J.J. Jansen A. van Kessel A.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the two activation domains act synergistically, the short spliced variant, TFE3S, lacks the acidic activation domain and its transcriptional activity appears to be diminished (25.Roman C. Cohn L. Calame K. Science. 1991; 254: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine if TFE3 binds to the bcn-1 motif directly, the three forms of the protein,35S-TFE3-full, 35S-TFE3L, and 35S-TFE3S (Fig. 1A) were synthesized in a cell-free system and pull-down assays were done using biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the bcn-1 element.35S-Labeled luciferase served as a negative control.35S-Labeled proteins were incubated with biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the bcn-1 element, and then the mix was added to streptavidin beads. After binding, beads were washed, and proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-loading buffer.35S-Labeled translational products (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4) and 35S-labeled proteins eluted from the beads (Fig. 1B, lanes 5–8) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by densitometry (Fig. 1C). All three isoforms of TFE3 (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–8) bound to the bcn-1 element with apparently similar affinity (Fig. 1C). In contrast, 35S-luciferase did not bind the oligonucleotide at all (lane 5). These results demonstrate that TFE3 binds to DNA directly. The fact that all three TFE3 isoforms bind the bcn-1 element equally well is to be expected, because all three contain an intact bHLHzip domain that has previously been shown to mediate the binding to the E-box (32.Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 33.Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This result suggests that all three isoforms may regulate the activity of the LAMC1 promoter. The bcn-1 motif contains the CAC trinucleotide found in the E-box, suggesting that these nucleotides could mediate TFE3 binding. To test this, we compared binding of 35S-TFE3L to bcn-1 oligonucleotide in the presence of either no competitor, double-stranded oligonucleotide containing wild-type bcn-1, or double-stranded oligonucleotide mutant bcn-1 in which the AC dinucleotide was mutated to GG. As illustrated in Fig. 2, 35S-TFE3 binding to bcn-1 was greatly diminished when wild-type bcn-1 competitor was present (compare lane 3 to 2). In contrast, in the presence of a competitor containing the CAC to CGG mutation, there was little or no decrease in the amount of bcn-1-bound 35S-TFE3 (compare lane 4 to 2). These studies demonstrate that the binding of TFE3 to the bcn-1 element is specific and that the AC dinucleotide found in this motif is important for mediating this interaction. To test if TFE3 can activate the LAMC1promoter and if it is bcn-1-dependent, we carried out reporter gene assays in transient transfections of primary rat mesangial cells. Firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by the LAMC1 promoter was co-expressed with either empty expression vector or expression vector containing cDNA-encoding TFE3L. The β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter was used as a control for transfection efficiency. These experiments showed a greater than 3-fold activation of the wild-type −1077/−20LAMC1 promoter fragment (subcloned into pGL3-basic plasmid) by TFE3 compared with expression vector (Fig. 3B, wt-bcn-1). Mutation of the two nucleotides within the bcn-1 element that are key for TFE3 binding (Fig. 2, B and C), decreased both the constitutive activity of the LAMC1 promoter and its response to TFE3 (Fig. 3B, mt-bcn-1). As in the case of TFE3L, expression of TFE3-full also activated (greater than 3-fold induction) the LAMC1 promoter in a bcn-1-dependent manner (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the LAMC1 promoter is responsive to TFE3 and that the bcn-1 element plays an important role in TFE3-mediated response. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates a host of cellular effects, including cell proliferation, development, and differentiation (34.Hill C.S. Cell Signaling. 1996; 8: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TGF-β activates expression of many genes, including LAMC1 (7.Suzuki H. O'Neill B.C. Suzuki Y. Denisenko O.N. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18981-18988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TGF-β binds two cell surface serine/threonine kinase receptors, TβRI and TβRII, resulting in the activation of the TβRI kinase, an enzyme that in turn phosphorylates transcription factors such as Smad2 and Smad3 (35.Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). After binding to Smad4, the Smad2·Smad4 and Smad3·Smad4 complexes translocate to the nucleus where they regulate expression of a diversity of gene targets that account for the pleiotropic effects of TGF-β (35.Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Smad proteins are composed of two Mad homology (MH1 and MH2) domains separated by a linker (26.Hua X. Miller Z.A. Wu G. Shi Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13130-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Although the function of the MH domains has not been fully defined, in the case of Smad3, the MH1 domain mediates its binding to the Smad-binding element (SBE), AGAC (35.Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells express TFE3L (data not shown) and several of the Smad proteins, including Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 (36.Poncelet A.C. Schnaper H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6983-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that TFE3L and Smad synergistically activate the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter (33.Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We wondered if there is similar cooperation between TFE3 and Smad proteins in the activation of the LAMC1 promoter in mesangial cells. Expression of either Smad3 or Smad4 alone increased the activity of the −1077/−20 LAMC1 promoter fragment by more than 2-fold (Fig. 4B). This result shows the LAMC1 promoter is Smad-responsive. When TFE3 was expressed with either Smad3 or Smad4, the activity of the LAMC1 promoter increased by 8- and 10-fold, respectively (Fig. 4B). Co-expression of TFE3, Smad3, and Smad4 did not further increase the promoter activity beyond that seen with TFE3 and one of the two Smads (Fig. 4C). In agreement with the PAI-1 study (33.Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), these results demonstrate TFE3·Smad3 cooperative activation of the LAMC1 promoter. Expression of TFE3 and Smad3 in HeLa cells synergistically activated LAMC1 promoter cloned upstream of luciferase gene (data not shown), thus the cooperation between the two transcription factors is not specific to mesangial cells. The sequence AGAC is sufficient for high affinity binding of Smad3 and Smad4 to SBEs (35.Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Previously it has been shown that two closely located SBEs are required for the TFE3·Smad-med"
