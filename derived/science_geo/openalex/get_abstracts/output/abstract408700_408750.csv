FTO knockdown with siRNA led to increased amounts of m(6)A in mRNA, whereas overexpression of FTO resulted in decreased amounts of m(6)A in human cells. We further show the partial colocalization of FTO with nuclear speckles, which supports the notion that m(6)A in nuclear RNA is a major physiological substrate of FTO."
https://openalex.org/W2145931730,"Recently, a new regulatory circuitry has been identified in which RNAs can crosstalk with each other by competing for shared microRNAs. Such competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) regulate the distribution of miRNA molecules on their targets and thereby impose an additional level of post-transcriptional regulation. Here we identify a muscle-specific long noncoding RNA, linc-MD1, which governs the time of muscle differentiation by acting as a ceRNA in mouse and human myoblasts. Downregulation or overexpression of linc-MD1 correlate with retardation or anticipation of the muscle differentiation program, respectively. We show that linc-MD1 “sponges” miR-133 and miR-135 to regulate the expression of MAML1 and MEF2C, transcription factors that activate muscle-specific gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that linc-MD1 exerts the same control over differentiation timing in human myoblasts, and that its levels are strongly reduced in Duchenne muscle cells. We conclude that the ceRNA network plays an important role in muscle differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2135398049,"Here, we demonstrate that protein-coding RNA transcripts can crosstalk by competing for common microRNAs, with microRNA response elements as the foundation of this interaction. We have termed such RNA transcripts as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). We tested this hypothesis in the context of PTEN, a key tumor suppressor whose abundance determines critical outcomes in tumorigenesis. By a combined computational and experimental approach, we identified and validated endogenous protein-coding transcripts that regulate PTEN, antagonize PI3K/AKT signaling, and possess growth- and tumor-suppressive properties. Notably, we also show that these genes display concordant expression patterns with PTEN and copy number loss in cancers. Our study presents a road map for the prediction and validation of ceRNA activity and networks and thus imparts a trans-regulatory function to protein-coding mRNAs."

These include ∼7,000 genes whose transcripts act as miR “sponges” and 148 genes that act through alternative, nonsponge interactions. Biochemical analyses in cell lines confirmed that this network regulates established drivers of tumor initiation and subtype implementation, including PTEN, PDGFRA, RB1, VEGFA, STAT3, and RUNX1, suggesting that these interactions mediate crosstalk between canonical oncogenic pathways. siRNA silencing of 13 miR-mediated PTEN regulators, whose locus deletions are predictive of PTEN expression variability, was sufficient to downregulate PTEN in a 3′UTR-dependent manner and to increase tumor cell growth rates. Thus, miR-mediated interactions provide a mechanistic, experimentally validated rationale for the loss of PTEN expression in a large number of glioma samples with an intact PTEN locus.

Computational inference reveals a network of miR-mediated interactions in glioblastoma These interactions regulate thousands of genes, including oncogenes and tumor suppressors These interactions regulate miR targets without affecting miR expression These interactions enable crosstalk between established oncogenic pathways Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis (Gabriely et al., 2011Gabriely G.

Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer. Yet few such modulators of miR activity have been characterized (Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3096) Google Scholar, Poliseno et al., 2010Poliseno L. Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B. Haveman W.J. Pandolfi P.P.

By analyzing a large set of sample-matched gene and miR expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we show here that the regulation of target genes by modulators of miR activity is surprisingly extensive in human glioma and that it affects genes with an established role in gliomagenesis and tumor subtype implementation. Specifically, we study two types of miR activity modulators with distinct molecular mechanisms (Figures 1A and 1B ). Sponge modulators include both messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and noncoding RNAs, which share miR-binding sites with other RNAs. Thus, these modulators act as miR sponges, or competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), via an established titration mechanism (Arvey et al., 2010Arvey A. Larsson E. Sander C. Leslie C.S. Marks D.S. Target mRNA abundance dilutes microRNA and siRNA activity.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2010; 6: 363Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Ebert et al., 2007Ebert M.S. Neilson J.R. Sharp P.A.

Depending on their expression levels and on the total number of functional miR-binding sites that they share with a target, sponge modulators can decrease the number of free miR molecules available to repress other functional targets. Nonsponge modulators, on the other hand, are implemented by proteins and RNAs acting via a variety of alternative mechanisms, including activation or suppression of miRISC-mediated regulation of target RNAs (Krol et al., 2010Krol J.

As a result, they do not necessarily share miR-binding sites with their modulated targets. Established sponge modulators include VCAN (Lee et al., 2010Lee D.Y. Jeyapalan Z. Fang L. Yang J. Zhang Y.

Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B. Haveman W.J. Pandolfi P.P. A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology.Nature. 2010; 465: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), and CD44 (Jeyapalan et al., 2011Jeyapalan Z.

Expression of CD44 3′-untranslated region regulates endogenous microRNA functions in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 3026-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and nonsponge modulators include miRISC core components, such as the members of the AGO and TNRC6 families (Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3096) Google Scholar). Notably, genetic alterations at the PTENP1, AGO2, and TNRC6A loci have all been implicated in tumorigenesis (Kim et al., 2010bKim M.S. Oh J.E. Kim Y.R. Park S.W. Kang M.R. Kim S.S. Ahn C.H. Yoo N.J.

To evaluate both the range and potential tumorigenic role of this class of miR-mediated interactions, we present a new multivariate analysis method called Hermes. Hermes systematically infers candidate modulators of miR activity from large collections of genome-wide expression profiles of both genes and miRs from the same tumor samples. Hermes extends the functionality of the modulator inference by network dynamics (MINDy) algorithm, which uses measurements from information theory to identify genes that modulate transcription factor activity via posttranslational modifications. MINDy has been used to infer posttranslational modulators of the MYC transcription factor in human B cells (Wang et al., 2009bWang K. Saito M. Bisikirska B.C. Alvarez M.J. Lim W.K. Rajbhandari P. Shen Q. Nemenman I. Basso K. Margolin A.A. et al.Genome-wide identification of post-translational modulators of transcription factor activity in human B cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), to infer signaling modulators of all transcription factors in human B cells (Wang et al., 2009aWang K. Alvarez M.J. Bisikirska B.C. Linding R. Basso K. Dalla Favera R. Califano A. Dissecting the interface between signaling and transcriptional regulation in human B cells.Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2009; : 264-275PubMed Google Scholar), and to identify the ubiquitin-conjugating ligase HUWE1 as a modulator of N-MYC turnover in neural stem cells (Zhao et al., 2009Zhao X. D'Arca D. Lim W.K. Brahmachary M. Carro M.S. Ludwig T. Cardo C.C. Guillemot F. Aldape K. Califano A. et al.The N-Myc-DLL3 cascade is suppressed by the ubiquitin ligase Huwe1 to inhibit proliferation and promote neurogenesis in the developing brain.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 210-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In essence, MINDy and Hermes make inferences by estimating two quantities from information theory: the mutual information (MI) and conditional mutual information (CMI). The MI quantifies how much one variable informs about another variable (i.e., high MI between two variables implies that knowledge about the first variable is predictive of state of the second variable). The CMI calculates the expected value of MI of two variables given the third variable. Specifically, given a modulator (M), a regulator (R), and a regulated target (T), the algorithms dissect the regulatory dependency of these three components by studying the difference between the CMI of the regulator's expression level and the target's expression level (conditional on the expression level of the modulator) and the MI of the regulator and target expressions, ΔI = I[R;T|M] − I[R;T] (Wang et al., 2006Wang K. Nemenman I. Banerjee N. Margolin A.A. Califano A. Genome-wide discovery of modulators of transcriptional interactions in human B lymphocytes. RECOMB 2006 also.Lect. Notes Comput. Sci. 2006; 3909: 348-362Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These quantities and their associated statistical significance can be computed from large collections of gene expression profiles (>250 samples) using a variety of estimators for MI and CMI (Wang et al., 2006Wang K. Nemenman I. Banerjee N. Margolin A.A. Califano A. Genome-wide discovery of modulators of transcriptional interactions in human B lymphocytes. RECOMB 2006 also.Lect. Notes Comput. Sci. 2006; 3909: 348-362Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), i.e., computational tools that can quantitatively estimate their values. Hermes expands the MINDy information theoretic framework to identify candidate genes that modulate miR activity (i.e., modulators), whose availability M affects the relationship between the expression of miRs targeting a gene T and its expression profile, T. We use the term “miR program” to indicate a set of miRs targeting a gene and the term “common miR program” to indicate the intersection between the miR programs of two distinct genes. Analysis of Hermes-inferred sponge and nonsponge interactions in TCGA glioblastoma data revealed a regulatory network of previously unsuspected size. Experimental validation of 29 such interactions (26 sponge and 3 nonsponge), of which only 3 failed to validate, suggested that Hermes has a low false positive rate and showed that its predicted interactions participate collectively in regulation of key drivers of gliomagenesis and tumor subtype, that these interactions mediate crosstalk between independent pathways, and that they affect cell pathophysiology. Whereas MINDy considers one candidate modulator/regulator/target triplet at a time, Hermes integrates the analysis across all miRs in the common miR program of two genes (sponge interactions) or in the miR program of a target gene (nonsponge interactions) using Fisher's method (Fisher, 1925Fisher R.A. Statistical methods for research workers. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh, London1925Google Scholar). Specific technical details of the analysis are provided in the Experimental Procedures. The cartoon example of Figure 1C illustrates the type of interaction that Hermes can help to dissect. Here, the increase in expression of the modulator gene is associated with a corresponding increase in mutual information between the expression of several miRs and the expression of their common target. In principle, one could evaluate all possible modulator/miR/target triplets and then select statistically significant ones that share the same modulator and target via different miRs. Though this would avoid having to select relevant miR programs a priori, it would also entail evaluating a huge number of triplets (∼4.0 × 1011), which is computationally prohibitive and will effectively prevent the discovery of many interactions due to excessive multiple hypothesis testing correction. Similar to MINDy, which addresses this problem by testing only triplets for experimentally validated or computationally inferred transcription factor-target interactions, we use a new miR target discovery algorithm, Cupid, which is specifically tailored to the identification of miR programs, to reduce the number of statistical tests performed by Hermes (see Experimental Procedures). Specifically, for sponge modulators, Hermes considers only modulator-target pairs (M, T) sharing a statistically significant number of miRs in their Cupid-inferred common miR programs. In addition, Hermes assumes that sponge interactions are symmetric and thus jointly evaluates the statistical significance of both M as a miR program-mediated modulator of T and T as a miR program-mediated regulator of M by combining p values using Fisher's method (Fisher, 1925Fisher R.A. Statistical methods for research workers. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh, London1925Google Scholar). Indeed, even though miR binding and regulatory kinetics may differ in the two targets, most sponge-mediated interactions should still exhibit symmetric behavior. This is because, when averaged over the multiple miRs in their common miR program, the differences in the number of individual miR-binding sites and their regulatory kinetics should average out. As shown in Experimental Procedures, symmetry analysis confirmed that only a very small fraction of candidate sponge interactions with strictly asymmetric supporting evidence is missed by Hermes (<0.02%). Conversely, nonsponge regulatory interactions are asymmetric by definition, as the modulator acts via alternative protein-protein or protein-RNA interaction mechanisms. Thus, they can be identified by selecting candidate (M, T) pairs with an empty or nonstatistically significant common miR program. Furthermore, because nonsponge interactions may be mediated by a single miR, rather than by a substantial miR program, use of a miR prediction algorithm may introduce too many false positive interactions. To reduce false positive predictions for nonsponge interactions, we restricted Hermes analysis to (M, miR, T) triplets with an experimentally validated miR-target regulatory interaction. The statistical significance of ΔI = I[miR;T|M] − I[miR;T] can be effectively estimated from a large number of samples (>250) using a variety of CMI estimators (Wang et al., 2009bWang K. Saito M. Bisikirska B.C. Alvarez M.J. Lim W.K. Rajbhandari P. Shen Q. Nemenman I. Basso K. Margolin A.A. et al.Genome-wide identification of post-translational modulators of transcription factor activity in human B cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), provided that matched miR and gene expression profiles are available for the same samples. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets are thus ideally suited for this analysis, as they are among only a handful satisfying these requirements. For this analysis, we used a publicly available set of 262 matched gene (both mRNA and noncoding RNA) and miR expression profiles from glioblastoma biopsies (TCGA (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network), 2008TCGA (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network)Comprehensive genomic characterization defines human glioblastoma genes and core pathways.Nature. 2008; 455: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (5221) Google Scholar). When used in a genome-wide fashion on this data set, Hermes identified nearly 7,000 sponge modulators participating in ∼248,000 pairwise miR program-mediated (RNA-RNA) interactions at a highly conservative false discovery rate (FDR < 1 × 10−4). These interactions are summarized in Figure 2A and are enumerated in Data S1 available online. In addition, Hermes identified 148 nonsponge modulators participating in 169 miR program-mediated regulatory (mPR) interactions with more than 100 genes (Data S1), including many established oncogenes and tumor suppressors, such as PTEN, RUNX1, TP63, VEGFA, EGFR, MYC, and NOTCH1, among others. For these, the sponge mechanism is excluded because modulator and target have no common miR regulators. Thus, their mechanism is likely mediated by protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Together, sponge- and nonsponge-mediated interactions constitute a large and previously uncharacterized mPR network. Globally, the sponge-mediated component of the mPR network presents roughly the same size and scale-free structure of typical transcriptional regulatory networks (Maslov and Sneppen, 2002Maslov S. Sneppen K. Specificity and stability in topology of protein networks.Science. 2002; 296: 910-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). For instance, ARACNe-based reverse engineering of transcriptional interactions in glioblastoma dissected ∼150,000 distinct TF-target interactions (Carro et al., 2010Carro M.S. Lim W.K. Alvarez M.J. Bollo R.J. Zhao X. Snyder E.Y. Sulman E.P. Anne S.L. Doetsch F. Colman H. et al.The transcriptional network for mesenchymal transformation of brain tumours.Nature. 2010; 463: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), compared to ∼248,000 mPR interactions inferred by Hermes. We modeled the network graphically, with RNAs represented as nodes and their sponge-mediated mPR interactions as undirected edges (Figure 2A). Because inferred sponge interactions are symmetric, RNAs in this network both regulate and are regulated by their neighbor RNAs. However, mPR interactions sharing a common RNA are not necessarily mediated by the same miR program. Common miR programs supporting mPR network interactions include 18 miRs on average and up to a maximum of 153 miRs (Data S1). This suggests that, on average, sponge modulation effects associated with each individual miR in a common program may be negligible compared to the global effect of the entire program. The mPR network contains many highly interconnected (i.e., dense) structures, i.e., N gene subgraphs, with a number of internal edges approximating the theoretical maximum of Nmax = N(N − 1)/2. Indeed, the largest dense glioma mPR structure is a 564 node, 111 core subgraph (Barrat et al., 2008Barrat A. Barthelemy M. Vespignani A. Dynamical processes on complex networks. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2008Crossref Scopus (1744) Google Scholar), i.e., a structure in which each RNA is directly linked to at least 111 of the other 563 RNAs (Data S1). RNAs in these dense subgraphs are strongly coexpressed, as each RNA tracks the average expression of the other subgraph members that it is connected to. Densest subgraph RNAs and their interactions are shown in red, near the center of Figure 2A. Conversely, subgraphs near the edge of the figure, which are shown in purple, are sparser, and their members are less coexpressed. Nodes in the network are clustered according to their subgraph connectivity, and each node is depicted with a color representing the size of the subgraph that contains it. The mPR network is scale free (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Thus, the number of same-color nodes in a band increases exponentially with their distance from the center (Figure 2A). The overall regulatory effect on a node depends on many variables, including the number of its mPR neighbors, the size of the miR programs that mediate its interactions, and the individual kinetics of the individual miR-target interactions that it shares with its neighbors. In general, however, nodes in larger highly connected subgraphs will have more neighbors and will thus be more strongly regulated by their mPR interactions. Indeed, coexpression of RNAs in a subgraph increases exponentially with the subgraph size, as shown in Figure 2B. Analysis of the mPR network shows that mPR interactions participate in distal regulation between genes within and across chromosomes (see Figure 2C by Circos) (Krzywinski et al., 2009Krzywinski M. Schein J. Birol I. Connors J. Gascoyne R. Horsman D. Jones S.J. Marra M.A. Circos: an information aesthetic for comparative genomics.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1639-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (5211) Google Scholar). In addition, analysis of KEGG pathway genes (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000Kanehisa M. Goto S. KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (13657) Google Scholar) targeted by mPR interactions shows that this interaction layer mediates crosstalk between numerous pathways (see Figure S1 and Data S1). PTEN downregulation is a hallmark of gliomagenesis, and its locus has been identified as one of the most frequently altered in glioblastoma (Verhaak et al., 2010Verhaak R.G. Hoadley K.A. Purdom E. Wang V. Qi Y. Wilkerson M.D. Miller C.R. Ding L. Golub T. Mesirov J.P. et al.Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkIntegrated genomic analysis identifies clinically relevant subtypes of glioblastoma characterized by abnormalities in PDGFRA, IDH1, EGFR, and NF1.Cancer Cell. 2010; 17: 98-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar). Though homozygous deletions at the PTEN locus are rare, appearing in less than 2% of glioblastoma samples, PTEN is haploinsufficient, and even moderate PTEN downregulation at the protein level, such as that resulting from loss of a single allele, may be tumorigenic. Surprisingly, however, the range of PTEN expression in heterozygously deleted samples is comparable to its range of expression in samples in which its locus is intact (Figures 3A and 3B ), suggesting that its expression may be tightly regulated and that a variety of additional mechanisms may contribute to its downregulation in tumors. PTEN regulation by miRs is well established. In glioblastoma, for instance, amplifications at the miR-26a locus have been implicated with downregulation of PTEN (Kim et al., 2010aKim H. Huang W. Jiang X. Pennicooke B. Park P.J. Johnson M.D. Integrative genome analysis reveals an oncomir/oncogene cluster regulating glioblastoma survivorship.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 2183-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PTEN is one of the genes in the densest 111 core subgraph, with a total of 534 interactions in the mPR network (Data S1), suggesting that its expression is strongly regulated by sponge effect. Indeed, not only do > 80% of the tumors with an intact PTEN locus have deletions in at least one of the PTEN mPR regulator loci (44/53 as of March, 2011). But the total number of such deletions in each sample is highly predictive of PTEN expression (p < 10−4 by permutation testing) (see Figure 3B). Interestingly, these deletions are more predictive of PTEN expression in PTEN wild-type tumors than in tumors with PTEN heterozygous deletions, suggesting that mPR regulators may account for missing PTEN genetic variability in glioblastoma. We focused on a subset of 13 PTEN mPR regulators that are expressed in the glioblastoma cell line SNB19 and whose loci are enriched for deletions in tumors with an intact PTEN locus (25/53); interestingly, these 25 tumors include all of the 8/53 PTEN intact tumors with amplification at the miR-26a. The total number of deletions at these 13 gene loci, as well as their total mRNA expression, was found to be highly predictive of PTEN expression not only in PTEN intact samples, but also across all 262 tumors tested in our analysis (Figures 3A and 3B and Data S1; pDel < 2 ×10−10 and pE < 5 × 10−23 by Pearson correlation analysis, respectively). Correlation between the genetics and genomics of PTEN mPR regulators and PTEN's mRNA expression suggests that deletions at PTEN mPR loci may collectively represent a key contribution to loss of PTEN expression in glioblastoma. In addition, PTEN is not the only gene whose expression may be regulated by deletions at the loci of its mPR regulators. In total, glioblastoma expression profiles of 292 genes, including many known drivers of tumorigenesis and tumor subtypes such as RUNX1, PTPRN, FGFR3, TGFBR2, and DICER1, were significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with deletions at the loci of their mPR regulators (Data S1). Strikingly, the expression profiles of more than half of these genes had stronger correlation with deletions at the loci of their mPR regulators than with deletions at their own loci. To confirm functional mPR-based PTEN regulation by these 13 mPR regulators, we performed siRNA-mediated silencing of each gene in SNB19 cells (see Figure S2 for silencing efficiency estimates) and measured the effect on PTEN using a PTEN 3′UTR luciferase reporter assay. Silencing of 11 of the 13 modulators in SNB19 leads to a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in PTEN luciferase activity, compared to negative controls (Figure 3C). To further validate that this regulatory mechanism is symmetric in nature, thus allowing PTEN expression to modulate the same 13 genes, we transfected SNB19 cells with PTEN 3′UTR and measured the effects on modulator expression (Figure 3D). This also addressed the potential issue that siRNA-mediated silencing may perturb endogenous miRs, possibly affecting the results displayed in Figure 3C. Upregulation of 10 of the 13 modulators was significant (p < 0.01). Overall, 13/13 tested interactions were positive either in siRNA silencing or in 3′UTR expression assays. To ensure that the effects are not cell line specific, we repeated the two experiments in the glioblastoma cell line SF188, using the subset of genes that were expressed in this cell line (9/13) (Figures 3E and 3F). Results in SF188 confirmed the SNB19 results: indeed, silencing nine of the nine modulators lead to a significant reduction in PTEN luciferase activity, and transfection with PTEN 3′UTR upregulated seven of the nine modulators. Taken in aggregate, the cumulative Fisher's p value across all of the experiments is effectively below machine precision (p < 10−221 based on an analytical estimate). To show that these effects are specific to mPR regulators, six negative control genes were selected randomly among those that (1) are not PTEN neighbors in the mPR network, (2) have variable length UTRs, and (3) show a variety of correlation patterns with PTEN's mRNA expression (positively correlated, negatively correlated, and uncorrelated). Randomly selected genes include TMEM149 (30 base 3′UTR), POFUT1 (4003 base 3′UTR), DDX24 (269 base 3′UTR), SLC46A3 (1416 base 3′UTR), EXTL3 (2819 base 3′UTR), PIK3R2 (1239 base 3′UTR), and EHMT2 (324 base 3′UTR). Of these, expression profiles of DDX24 and SLC46A3 are significantly positively correlated with that of PTEN,"

However, the functional role of ceRNAs in cancer remains unknown. Loss of PTEN, a tumor suppressor regulated by ceRNA activity, frequently occurs in melanoma. Here, we report the discovery of significant enrichment of putative PTEN ceRNAs among genes whose loss accelerates tumorigenesis following Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis in a mouse model of melanoma. We validated several putative PTEN ceRNAs and further characterized one, the ZEB2 transcript. We show that ZEB2 modulates PTEN protein levels in a microRNA-dependent, protein coding-independent manner. Attenuation of ZEB2 expression activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, enhances cell transformation, and commonly occurs in human melanomas and other cancers expressing low PTEN levels. Our study genetically identifies multiple putative microRNA decoys for PTEN, validates ZEB2 mRNA as a bona fide PTEN ceRNA, and demonstrates that abrogated ZEB2 expression cooperates with BRAFV600E to promote melanomagenesis.

Aberrant activation of the MAPK-signaling pathway plays a central role in melanoma development, as exemplified by the frequent occurrence of activating mutations in BRAF (Brose et al., 2002Brose M.S. Volpe P. Feldman M. Kumar M. Rishi I. Gerrero R. Einhorn E. Herlyn M. Minna J. Nicholson A. et al.BRAF and RAS mutations in human lung cancer and melanoma.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6997-7000PubMed Google Scholar, Davies et al., 2002Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P.

Genetic and molecular analyses have demonstrated that oncogenic BRAFV600E represents an initiating event in the evolution of melanoma (Davies et al., 2002Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J. Bottomley W. et al.Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer.Nature. 2002; 417: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (8271) Google Scholar). Indeed, 80% of human nevi harbor a BRAFV600E mutation (Pollock et al., 2003Pollock P.M. Harper U.L. Hansen K.S. Yudt L.M. Stark M. Robbins C.M. Moses T.Y. Hostetter G. Wagner U. Kakareka J. et al.High frequency of BRAF mutations in nevi.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Moreover, mouse models of BRAFV600E develop melanoma only after a long latency and with incomplete penetrance (Dankort et al., 2009Dankort D. Curley D.P. Cartlidge R.A. Nelson B. Karnezis A.N. Damsky Jr., W.E. You M.J. DePinho R.A. McMahon M. Bosenberg M. Braf(V600E) cooperates with Pten loss to induce metastatic melanoma.Nat.

Silencing of the tumor suppressor PTEN represents one such mutation and is observed in ∼30% of human melanoma cases (Tsao et al., 2004Tsao H. Goel V. Wu H. Yang G. Haluska F.G. Genetic interaction between NRAS and BRAF mutations and PTEN/MMAC1 inactivation in melanoma.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In mice, complete or partial PTEN loss dramatically accelerates BRAFV600E-induced melanoma (Dankort et al., 2009Dankort D. Curley D.P. Cartlidge R.A. Nelson B. Karnezis A.N. Damsky Jr., W.E. You M.J.

Genet. 2009; 41: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), thus highlighting the oncogenic potential of combined hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to regulate PTEN and thus contribute to cell transformation mediated by aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Poliseno et al., 2010aPoliseno L. Salmena L. Riccardi L. Fornari A. Song M.S. Hobbs R.M. Sportoletti P. Varmeh S. Egia A. Fedele G. et al.Identification of the miR-106b∼25 microRNA cluster as a proto-oncogenic PTEN-targeting intron that cooperates with its host gene MCM7 in transformation.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra29Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). miRNAs are endogenous, noncoding ∼22 nucleotide RNA molecules that bind to microRNA response elements (MREs) contained in their target mRNAs (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar, Thomas et al., 2010Thomas M. Lieberman J. Lal A. Desperately seeking microRNA targets.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This association recruits the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to target mRNA transcripts, thereby antagonizing their stability and/or translation (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar, Thomas et al., 2010Thomas M. Lieberman J. Lal A. Desperately seeking microRNA targets.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). miRNA-mediated modulation of mRNA levels is conserved in most eukaryotic organisms and is considered a mechanism to fine-tune gene expression. In recent years, numerous examples of abnormal gene regulation by miRNA misexpression have been demonstrated to contribute to pathological conditions (http://202.38.126.151/hmdd/mirna/md/). mRNAs harbor multiple MREs and thus can be regulated by several miRNAs, and miRNAs are known to target dozens of mRNA transcripts. The fact that distinct RNA molecules can be targeted by common miRNAs led us to propose that related highly homologous mRNAs, such as gene-pseudogene pairs, may act as miRNA decoys for each other. Pseudogenes are considered “junk DNA,” as they lack a protein coding function (D'Errico et al., 2004D'Errico I. Gadaleta G. Saccone C. Pseudogenes in metazoa: origin and features.Brief. Funct. Genomics Proteomics. 2004; 3: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, by binding to common miRNAs, pseudogene mRNAs may maintain the balance between their ancestral genes and such miRNAs. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that the PTEN pseudogene transcript PTENP1 regulates the levels of PTEN through sequestration of shared miRNAs (Poliseno et al., 2010bPoliseno L. Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B. Haveman W.J. Pandolfi P.P. A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology.Nature. 2010; 465: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). On this basis, we further hypothesized that the concept of gene regulation by competition for common miRNAs is not limited to pseudogenes and can be extended to mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs and have termed RNA molecules that act as miRNA decoys as “competitive endogenous RNAs” (ceRNAs) (Salmena et al., 2011Salmena L. Poliseno L. Tay Y. Kats L. Pandolfi P.P. A ceRNA hypothesis: the Rosetta Stone of a hidden RNA language?.Cell. 2011; 146: 353-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4795) Google Scholar). Importantly, we proposed that the mRNA and the protein encoded by ceRNA genes may be involved in distinct biological processes (Salmena et al., 2011Salmena L. Poliseno L. Tay Y. Kats L. Pandolfi P.P. A ceRNA hypothesis: the Rosetta Stone of a hidden RNA language?.Cell. 2011; 146: 353-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4795) Google Scholar). Employing bioinformatics-guided prediction methods of MRE overlap, we have discovered that multiple mRNAs serve as ceRNAs for PTEN (Tay et al., 2011Tay Y. Kats L. Salmena L. Weiss D. Tan S.M. Ala U. Karreth F. Poliseno L. Provero P. Di Cunto F. et al.Coding-independent regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by competing endogenous mRNAs.Cell. 2011; 147 (this issue): 344-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]). Importantly, the proteins encoded by PTEN ceRNAs have thus far not been associated with the regulation of PTEN, supporting the notion that, in some instances, mRNAs and the proteins that they encode may be involved in distinct biological processes. Our recent work suggests that mRNAs may act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes through their ceRNA activity. However, whether aberrant ceRNA expression is associated with cancer development in general and whether loss of PTEN ceRNAs promotes BRAFV600E-induced melanoma in vivo in particular are unknown. Here, we report a striking enrichment for PTEN ceRNAs among genes that were identified in a transposon mutagenesis screen in an oncogenic BRAF-driven mouse model of melanoma. Detailed functional analysis of one such putative PTEN ceRNA, ZEB2, validated its protein-independent and miRNA-dependent ability to regulate PTEN expression. Moreover, we show that ZEB2 and PTEN are coregulated and that ZEB2 levels are commonly attenuated in human cancers. Oncogenic BRAFV600E is an initiating mutation in melanoma, and whereas some other mutations such as loss of PTEN commonly occur in melanoma, the full spectrum of tumor-promoting genetic events remains to be determined. To this end, we performed a forward genetic screen utilizing the Sleeping Beauty transposon system in a B-RafV619E-driven mouse model of melanoma (Figure S1 and Extended Experimental Procedures available online), in which B-RafV619E corresponds to human BRAFV600E. A detailed description and in-depth analysis of this screen will be reported elsewhere (F.A.K., D.P., and D.A.T., unpublished data). In brief, we created mutant mice that carried the following alleles: LoxP-STOP-LoxP-B-RafV619E (LSL-B-RafV619E; F.A.K., D.P., and D.A.T., unpublished data), Tyrosinase-CreERt2 (TyrCreERt2 [Bosenberg et al., 2006Bosenberg M.

Treatment of compound mutant LSL-B-RafV619E; TyrCreERt2; LSL-SB; T2Onc mice with 4-OH Tamoxifen activated the melanocyte-specific Cre, leading to excision of the STOP cassettes and expression of endogenous oncogenic B-Raf and SB13. Sleeping Beauty transposase-mediated “hopping” of the T2Onc transposon resulted in insertional mutagenesis, thereby accelerating melanoma development (Figures 1A and S1 and data not shown). 454 sequencing of genomic melanoma DNA identified 320 genes with a significant enrichment of transposon insertions, termed “common insertion sites” (CIS). Importantly, PTEN was among the most significant CIS (data not shown), thus demonstrating the ability of our Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis approach to identify key genes altered in melanoma.Figure 1Identification of Putative PTEN ceRNAsShow full caption(A) Schematic outline of our hypothesis: oncogenic BRAF mediates the transformation from melanocytes to nevi, and additional loss of PTEN promotes progression to melanoma.

We postulated that the ability of any given mRNA to act as a miRNA decoy for PTEN increases with the number of MREs that they share. The 3′UTR of murine PTEN was predicted to contain MREs for 39 different miRNAs (Table S1). We set a stringent cutoff of at least seven shared MREs between PTEN and putative PTEN ceRNAs for the MuTaME analysis (Figure 1B). Using these conditions, we identified 33 candidate PTEN ceRNAs among the 320 CIS discovered in the Sleeping Beauty screen (Figure 1C). Notably, this represented a significant enrichment of putative PTEN ceRNAs (p = 7.76 × 10−11), as the MRE-based overlap with PTEN expected by chance was only approximately nine genes. Thus, our Sleeping Beauty approach uncovered putative PTEN ceRNAs that promote cancer in an in vivo model of melanoma. We ranked the 33 putative PTEN ceRNAs according to their similarity with PTEN (Figure 2A ). The similarity score is based on a Poisson distribution: we used a linear combination, with equal and opposite weights, of the dissimilarity based on distinct occurrences and the additive similarity as defined previously (van Helden, 2004van Helden J. Metrics for comparing regulatory sequences on the basis of pattern counts.Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This approach utilized all miRNAs predicted by TargetScan and the total number of their MREs located in the 3′UTRs to obtain the similarity score for each CIS. Furthermore, most candidate PTEN ceRNAs contain several MREs for the same miRNAs, and thus the total numbers of MREs shared with PTEN are even greater (Table S1). To examine whether the identified putative PTEN ceRNAs regulate expression of PTEN, we performed RNAi-mediated gene silencing in human melanoma cells using pools of four siRNAs to reduce off-target effects. We selected eight putative PTEN ceRNAs (AFF1, DCBLD2, JARID2, MBNL1, RBM9, TNRC6a, TNRC6b, and ZEB2) and depleted them in WM35 cells (Figure 2B). Knockdown of seven genes led to reduction of PTEN, six of which significantly attenuated PTEN expression (AFF1, JARID2, MBNL1, RBM9, TNRC6a, TNRC6b, and ZEB2). A reduction of PTEN mRNA levels following PTEN ceRNA silencing was also evident in WM35 cells (Figure S2A ). In a second human melanoma cell line, A375, decreased PTEN expression was also observed following PTEN ceRNA knockdown, albeit at lower levels (Figures S2C and S2D). The knockdown efficiencies are shown in Figures S2B and S2E. Interestingly, in some instances, depletion of PTEN resulted in downregulation of the putative PTEN ceRNA (Figures S2B and S2E), indicating that the regulatory relationship between PTEN and PTEN ceRNAs might be reciprocal. Importantly, we found that CNOT6L, a PTEN ceRNA that we predicted using the rna22 algorithm and validated in prostate cancer (Tay et al., 2011Tay Y. Kats L. Salmena L. Weiss D. Tan S.M. Ala U. Karreth F. Poliseno L. Provero P. Di Cunto F. et al.Coding-independent regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by competing endogenous mRNAs.Cell. 2011; 147 (this issue): 344-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), was a CIS identified by Sleeping Beauty. Similar to its ceRNA function in prostate cancer cells (Tay et al., 2011Tay Y. Kats L. Salmena L. Weiss D. Tan S.M. Ala U. Karreth F. Poliseno L. Provero P. Di Cunto F. et al.Coding-independent regulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by competing endogenous mRNAs.Cell. 2011; 147 (this issue): 344-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), siRNA-mediated knockdown of CNOT6L significantly reduced PTEN expression in both human melanoma cell lines (Figures 2B and S2C). Critically, the T2Onc transposons inserted in PTEN and the putative PTEN ceRNAs in both orientations throughout the genes (Figure S2F). This insertion pattern is indicative of gene repression via the polyadenylation signals rather than gene activation by the MSCV promoter (Collier et al., 2005Collier L.S. Carlson C.M. Ravimohan S. Dupuy A.J. Largaespada D.A. Cancer gene discovery in solid tumours using transposon-based somatic mutagenesis in the mouse.Nature. 2005; 436: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Thus, these CIS are likely tumor suppressors. Taken together, these results indicate that the candidate ceRNAs identified by Sleeping Beauty may indeed act as tumor-suppressive ceRNAs for PTEN. As silencing of several of the putative PTEN ceRNAs led to reduced PTEN protein levels, we sought to further validate and characterize the ability of a CIS mRNA to function as a PTEN ceRNA. None of the seven CIS that reduced PTEN levels in WM35 melanoma cells code for a known tumor suppressor protein. The ZEB2 protein, however, has been well established as an activator of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Gregory et al., 2008Gregory P.A. Bert A.G. Paterson E.L. Barry S.C. Tsykin A. Farshid G. Vadas M.A. Khew-Goodall Y. Goodall G.J. The miR-200 family and miR-205 regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition by targeting ZEB1 and SIP1.Nat.

Berx G. SIP1/ZEB2 induces EMT by repressing genes of different epithelial cell-cell junctions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6566-6578Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and therefore plays a critical role in the progression of epithelial cancers. Whether the ZEB2 protein is protumorigenic in melanoma is unknown; however, as a PTEN ceRNA, the ZEB2 mRNA may be tumor suppressive. Given the potentially distinct function of the ZEB2 protein and transcript, we decided to examine whether ZEB2 mRNA exerts a tumor-suppressive function in melanoma through its competition for PTEN-targeting miRNAs. Transposon insertions in the 5′-3′ orientation in the ZEB2 locus could theoretically allow for overexpression of the ZEB2 3′UTR, which would potentially sequester miRNAs from PTEN and result in elevated PTEN levels. To ascertain that the ZEB2 3′UTR is not overexpressed in melanomas with such insertions, we analyzed the expression ratio of the ZEB2 5′UTR and 3′UTR. Importantly, we observed a 1:1 ratio of expression in all cases, thus excluding overexpression of the 3′UTR (Figure 2C). As an additional control, we tested the effects of transposon insertion in the PTEN locus. Similarly, tumors with transposon insertions in the 5′-3′ orientation did not display an increase in the PTEN 3′UTR:5′UTR ratio (Figure 2C), indicating that the transposon acts as a gene trap in these cases. We further tested whether ZEB2 protein levels are affected by transposon insertions. PTEN and ZEB2 are readily detectable by immunoblotting in melanomas without transposon insertions (Figure 2D, lanes 1–4). In contrast, transposon insertion in either PTEN (Figure 2D, lanes 5–7) or ZEB2 (Figure 2D, lanes 8–10) reduced expression of both proteins (Figure 2D). These data confirm that transposon insertion in PTEN and ZEB2 represses gene expression and indicate that ZEB2 reduction modulates protein levels of PTEN. Moreover, the decrease in ZEB2 expression in tumors with a PTEN transposon insertion suggests that the PTEN-ZEB2 miRNA decoy mechanism may be reciprocal. To further examine the regulation of PTEN by ZEB2 via miRNA sequestration, we used pools of four siRNAs to deplete PTEN or ZEB2 in a primary murine melanoma cell line, TB13602, isolated from a LSL-B-RafV619E; TyrCreERt2 mouse. Knockdown of ZEB2 in TB13602 cells reduced PTEN protein levels by ∼60% (Figure 3A ). RNAi-mediated silencing of PTEN led to a slight attenuation of ZEB2 expression (Figure 3A), similar to the results obtained in melanomas with PTEN or ZEB2 CIS (Figure 2D). As PTEN is a major antagonist of PI3K/AKT signaling, we examined whether ZEB2-mediated reduction of PTEN activates this pathway. ZEB2 depletion had no effect on AKT phosphorylation at steady-state levels (data not shown); however, upon starvation and restimulation, ZEB2-depleted cells displayed elevated AKT activation compared to control cells (Figure 3B). We next analyzed whether ZEB2 acts as a PTEN ceRNA in human melanoma cells. In four human melanoma cell lines, PTEN protein levels were reduced following knockdown of ZEB2 (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3A ). Moreover, depletion of ZEB2 led to AKT activation in these cell lines (Figures 3C, 3E, and S3A). Importantly, ZEB2 siRNAs without potential seed matches to PTEN efficiently lowered PTEN levels in mouse and human melanoma cells (Figure S3B), indicating that PTEN downregulation is not due to off-target effects of the ZEB2 siRNA pools. Interestingly, ZEB2 depletion had only minor and statistically insignificant effects on PTEN mRNA levels in TB13602 and A375 cells (Figures 3F and 3G), whereas it significantly reduced PTEN transcript in WM35 cells (Figure 3H). These data suggest that the miRNAs mediating the functional interaction of PTEN and ZEB2 regulate mRNA stability in a cell line-dependent fashion, whereas their control of translation is a more universal phenomenon. These in vitro and in vivo data support the notion that ZEB2 acts as a PTEN ceRNA. They do not exclude, however, the transcriptional regulation or protein stability as potential mechanisms of ZEB2 loss-mediated PTEN reduction. We addressed these possibilities by ectopic expression of a luciferase-PTEN3′UTR reporter construct in TB13602 cells, followed by knockdown of PTEN or ZEB2. Silencing of either PTEN or ZEB2 increased the availability of shared miRNAs, thereby suppressing the luciferase-PTEN3′UTR reporter as measured by diminished luciferase activity (Figure 4A ). Importantly, as the luciferase-PTEN3′UTR reporter construct is expressed from a CMV promoter and does not code for a PTEN peptide, reduced luciferase activity was dependent on the PTEN 3′UTR, thus eliminating transcriptional regulation and protein stability as explanations for the ZEB2-PTEN functional interaction. To exclude the involvement of RNA-binding proteins that could regulate PTEN mRNA translation through its 3′UTR, we used cells deficient for the miRNA biogenesis protein Dicer to examine whether ZEB2 controls PTEN levels in a miRNA-dependent manner. In Dicer wild-type HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, siRNA against ZEB2 lowered PTEN levels, similar to our observation in melanoma cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, ZEB2 depletion failed to reduce PTEN expression in Dicer null HCT116 cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, ZEB2 knockdown decreased PTEN mRNA only in Dicer wild-type cells, but not in Dicer-deficient cells (Figure 4C). Conversely, PTEN silencing resulted in diminished ZEB2 mRNA levels in Dicer wild-type HCT116 cells, which was rescued in Dicer-deficient HCT116 cells (Figure 4C). Similar to PTEN attenuation, AKT activation by ZEB2 silencing is only evident in Dicer wild-type HCT116 cells (Figure 4D). These data indicate that regulation of PTEN expression by ZEB2 is indeed miRNA dependent. As ablation of ZEB2 mRNA reduces PTEN expression due to increased availability of common miRNAs, overexpression of ZEB2 mRNA should have the opposite effect. However, ectopic expression of full-length ZEB2 mRNA would also increase ZEB2 protein. We therefore overexpressed only the ZEB2 3′UTR to uncouple potential effects of elevated ZEB2 protein on PTEN expression, such as transcriptional regulation, from the miRNA-based regulation via MREs. This approach was also used to show that the 3′UTRs of other putative PTEN ceRNAs increase PTEN levels in prostate cancer (Poliseno et al., 2010bPoliseno L. Salmena L. Zhang J. Carver B. Haveman W.J.

RIG-I comprises N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), a DECH helicase, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). We present crystal structures of the ligand-free, autorepressed, and RNA-bound, activated states of RIG-I. Inactive RIG-I has an open conformation with the CARDs sequestered by a helical domain inserted between the two helicase moieties. ATP and dsRNA binding induce a major rearrangement to a closed conformation in which the helicase and CTD bind the blunt end 5′ppp-dsRNA with perfect complementarity but incompatibly with continued CARD binding. We propose that after initial binding of 5′ppp-dsRNA to the flexibly linked CTD, co-operative tight binding of ATP and RNA to the helicase domain liberates the CARDs for downstream signaling. These findings significantly advance our molecular understanding of the activation of innate immune signaling helicases.

These findings significantly advance our molecular understanding of the activation of innate immune signaling helicases. RIG-I helicase domain switches from open to closed conformation upon RNA and ATP binding Tandem CARDs contribute to autorepression by binding the helicase domain Structures support a model for how RIG-I senses viral RNA and initiates signaling RIG-I-like helicases (RLHs), which include RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I, DDX58), MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5), and LGP2 (DHX58), are key cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) of the vertebrate innate immune system that form the first line of defense against infection by RNA viruses (Yoneyama et al., 2004Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. The RNA helicase RIG-I has an essential function in double-stranded RNA-induced innate antiviral responses.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). PRRs are sensors of nonself microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPS), which in the case of RLHs are virus-specific RNA structures. Detection of viral RNA MAMPS by RIG-I activates the NF-κB and IRF3 signaling pathways, leading to interferon-β (IFN-β) production. This in turn leads to the upregulation of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including RIG-I itself, that either directly combat the viral infection or mobilize other cells of the immune system (Gerlier and Lyles, 2011Gerlier D. Lyles D.S. Interplay between innate immunity and negative-strand RNA viruses: towards a rational model.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2011; 75: 468-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RIG-I is activated by diverse positive- and negative-stranded RNA viruses including influenza, rift valley, measles, vesicular stomatitis (VSV), and hepatitis C viruses (Loo and Gale, 2011Loo Y.M. Gale Jr., M. Immune signaling by RIG-I-like receptors.Immunity. 2011; 34: 680-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in RIG-I are more susceptible to infection by RNA viruses (Kato et al., 2006Kato H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Matsui K. Uematsu S. Jung A. Kawai T. Ishii K.J. et al.Differential roles of MDA5 and RIG-I helicases in the recognition of RNA viruses.Nature. 2006; 441: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar), and the natural RIG-I deficiency of chickens may contribute to their high susceptibility to influenza virus (Barber et al., 2010Barber M.R. Aldridge Jr., J.R. Webster R.G. Magor K.E. Association of RIG-I with innate immunity of ducks to influenza.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

RIG-I, a 925 residue, 106 kDa protein in human (hRIG-I), is highly conserved within vertebrates and comprises two N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), a central DECH-box RNA helicase, and a C-terminal domain (CTD). MDA-5 has a similar architecture, whereas LGP2 lacks the CARDs. The RLHs form a subgroup of superfamily 2 (SF2) RNA helicases and are closely related to DEAD-box helicases (Fairman-Williams et al., 2010Fairman-Williams M.E. Guenther U.P. Jankowsky E. SF1 and SF2 helicases: family matters.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). They comprise N- and C-terminal RecA-like domains (denoted Hel1 and Hel2) that contain up to 12 conserved sequence motifs involved in nucleic acid and ATP binding and in ATP hydrolysis (Linder and Jankowsky, 2011Linder P. Jankowsky E. From unwinding to clamping - the DEAD box RNA helicase family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). RIG-I is thus a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent ATPase (Gee et al., 2008Gee P. Chua P.K. Gevorkyan J. Klumpp K. Najera I. Swinney D.C. Deval J. Essential role of the N-terminal domain in the regulation of RIG-I ATPase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9488-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The RIG-I subfamily includes Dicer, involved in the processing of small RNAs, as well as archaebacterial helicase-associated endonuclease for fork-structured DNA (Hef) (Nishino et al., 2005Nishino T.

Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In uninfected cells, RIG-I is thought to be in an autorepressed conformation, with the CARDs unavailable for signal transduction. In vitro activation of RIG-I requires either an RNA that forms a blunt-ended, base-paired region of at least 18–20 nucleotides with a 5′triphosphate and free of mismatches near the blunt end (denoted 5′ppp-dsRNA [5′triphosphate double-stranded RNA]) (Marq et al., 2010Marq J.B.

Several mechanistic questions concerning the RIG-I activation pathway remain open, including the nature of the conformational changes and oligomerization state associated with viral RNA binding and the respective roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis. To resolve these issues, detailed structural information on the different states of RIG-I is essential. Although the crystal structure of RIG-I CTD bound to short 5′ppp-dsRNA has been determined (Lu et al., 2010Lu C. Xu H. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Brooks M.T. Hou T.Y. Hu F. Herr A.B. Strong R.K. Kao C.C.

Biol. 2010; 17: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), neither the overall RIG-I architecture nor the atomic structure of any other domain, with or without bound RNA, is known. As our attempts to crystallize hRIG-I were unsuccessful, we turned to the homolog from the mallard duck Anas platyrhynchos (dRIG-I), which shares 53% sequence identity with hRIG-I (Data S1 available online). Transfection of dRIG-I into chicken cells (which naturally lack RIG-I or a RIG-I-like activity) (Karpala et al., 2011Karpala A.J. Stewart C. McKay J. Lowenthal J.W. Bean A.G. Characterization of chicken Mda5 activity: regulation of IFN-β in the absence of RIG-I functionality.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 5397-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) enables them to respond to 5′ppp-RNA and activate interferon gene expression (Barber et al., 2010Barber M.R. Aldridge Jr., J.R. Webster R.G. Magor K.E. Association of RIG-I with innate immunity of ducks to influenza.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 5913-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). dRIG-I has in vitro dsRNA-dependent ATPase activity (Figure S1A ) and was also found to elicit an antiviral state in chicken DF-1 cells in response to a 5′ppp leader RNA transcript from rabies virus (Figure S1B), indicating a likely similarity of the mechanisms of action of dRIG-I and hRIG-I. We crystallized and determined the structure of the following constructs of dRIG-I: the helicase domain alone (dRIG-I-Hel, 242–794) and in ternary complex with an ATP analog and an unphosphorylated 19-mer dsRNA (dRIG-I-Hel-ds19), dRIG-I-ΔCTD (1–794), and full-length dRIG-I (dRIG-I-FL, 1–933). These structures, together with previously published data, enable us to propose a detailed structure-based mechanism for RIG-I activation by viral RNA. The dRIG-I-Hel structure was determined at 3 Å resolution by the single anomalous diffraction method using seleno-methionine-labeled protein (Figure S2A ). Ligand-free RIG-I helicase shows an open conformation in which the Hel1 (242–456) and Hel2 (458–469, 609–745) domains are not in direct contact, and several interstrand loops, particularly of Hel2, are disordered (Figure 1). Secondary structure elements and helicase motifs are indicated in the RIG-I sequence alignment in Data S1. The C-terminal extension of Hel1 links to the outermost strand (β8) of Hel2 and then directly into an insertion domain (denoted Hel2i, residues 470–608), which is a bundle of five long, antiparallel α helices (α22–α26) (Figure 1C). Hef, the member of the RIG-I subfamily of helicases with the highest sequence homology to RLHs, has the same overall architecture as RIG-I (Figure 1D). The most striking feature of RIG-I helicase is an elbow-like helical structure that emerges from Hel2 and that will be referred to as the bridging domain (also named the pincer domain; see accompanying article by Luo et al., 2011Luo D. Ding S.C. Vela A. Kohlway A. Lindenbach B.D. Pyle A.M. Structural insights into RNA recognition by RIG-I.Cell. 2011; 147 (this issue): 409-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar; this issue of Cell]). This comprises a long α helix (α31, 746–769) that bridges back to Hel1, with an ∼80° bend at conserved residue Trp772 leading into a second helix (α32, 774–793), which would connect to the CTD, absent from this construct (Figure 1). Extensive contacts are made by residues 761–789, either side of the bend, with residues on helices α19 and α20 and the following linker of Hel1. The proximal end of α31 has counterparts in other helicases (e.g., Hef, Figure 1D, and DPB5; see below), but the elbow structure bridging to the Hel1 domain is specific to RIG-I. Hel1-interacting residues E759, M762, Q770, K780, and Q785, some of which stabilize elements of the ATP-binding site (see below), are highly conserved, suggesting that the bridging domain is common to all RLH family members (Data S2).Figure 1Structure of dRIG-I Helicase DomainShow full caption(A) Domain structure of dRIG-I helicase.

Superposing on the Hel2 domain, the Hel1 domain rotates by 49° and Hel2i by 24°. See also Data S1, Figures S1 and S2, and Movie S2. Structures of the helicase in the context of the longer constructs dRIG-I-ΔCTD (1–794) and full-length dRIG-I (1–933) were also determined (see below). In all ligand-free structures, the helicase is in an open conformation with Hel2 and Hel2i forming a single rigid-body unit (Hel2i-Hel2 module). Between the five crystallographically different RIG-I molecules in three crystal forms, there is an angular span of about 30° in the orientation of the Hel1 domain after superposing the Hel2i-Hel2 module (Figure 1E; Movie S1). The two hinge regions lie between residues 456 and 460 in the linker between Hel1 and β8 of Hel2 and 744–748 preceding the bridging helix α31. This highlights the intrinsic flexibility of the open form of the helicase, which probably contributes to the difficulty in crystallizing RIG-I. Full-length RIG-I shows optimal RNA-dependent ATPase activity in the presence of 5′ppp-dsRNA, whereas RIG-I lacking the tandem CARDs (RIG-I-ΔCARDs) is equally active with 5′ppp- or 5′OH-dsRNA (Cui et al., 2008Cui S. Eisenächer K. Kirchhofer A. Brzózka K. Lammens A. Lammens K. Fujita T. Conzelmann K.K. Krug A. Hopfner K.P. The C-terminal regulatory domain is the RNA 5′-triphosphate sensor of RIG-I.Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Additionally, removing the CTD (i.e., RIG-I-Hel) significantly reduces ATPase activity (Cui et al., 2008Cui S. Eisenächer K. Kirchhofer A. Brzózka K. Lammens A. Lammens K. Fujita T. Conzelmann K.K.

We succeeded in crystallizing dRIG-I-Hel with a blunt-ended 5′OH-dsRNA 19-mer in the presence of either the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP (monoclinic form, 4.2 Å resolution) or the transition state analog ADP-AlF3 (tetragonal form, 3.7 Å resolution) (Figure 2B ). Despite the modest resolution, the structure is well defined, with clear electron density for the ADP-AlF3-Mg++ (Figure S2B) and the RNA (Figure S2C). In both crystal forms, the dsRNA forms pseudocontinuous A-form double helices throughout the crystal but with dislocations in the backbone between the 19-mers (Figures 2C and S2C). In the tetragonal form, crystallographically independent RIG-I molecules alternate along this pseudohelix without contacting each other, with an average spacing of 53 Å (Figure 2C). In the monoclinic crystal, the two independent RIG-I molecules form two distinct, parallel pseudocontinuous helices (not shown). Co-operative dsRNA and ATP binding results in a dramatic conformational change of the RIG-I helicase with all three subdomains (Hel1, Hel2i, and Hel2) moving relative to each other (Figure 1F; Movie S2). This brings the two RecA domains into intimate contact, creating the mature dsRNA- and ATP-binding sites (Figure 2). Using Hel2 as reference, the Hel1 domain rotates by about 60° from its extreme position in the free helicase structures, and the Hel2i domain rotates 23° to form one wall of the dsRNA-binding groove. The configuration of Hel1, Hel2, and RNA thus becomes very similar to that observed for other RNA helicases bound to ATP and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (e.g., DPB5, Figure 2D)."

They identify 42 loci associated with concentrations of one or more liver enzymes in plasma, and use a range of functional genomic analyses to suggest candidate genes at these loci. Concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma are widely used as indicators of liver disease. We carried out a genome-wide association study in 61,089 individuals, identifying 42 loci associated with concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma, of which 32 are new associations (P = 10−8 to P = 10−190). We used functional genomic approaches including metabonomic profiling and gene expression analyses to identify probable candidate genes at these regions. We identified 69 candidate genes, including genes involved in biliary transport (ATP8B1 and ABCB11), glucose, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (FADS1, FADS2, GCKR, JMJD1C, HNF1A, MLXIPL, PNPLA3, PPP1R3B, SLC2A2 and TRIB1), glycoprotein biosynthesis and cell surface glycobiology (ABO, ASGR1, FUT2, GPLD1 and ST3GAL4), inflammation and immunity (CD276, CDH6, GCKR, HNF1A, HPR, ITGA1, RORA and STAT4) and glutathione metabolism (GSTT1, GSTT2 and GGT), as well as several genes of uncertain or unknown function (including ABHD12, EFHD1, EFNA1, EPHA2, MICAL3 and ZNF827). Our results provide new insight into genetic mechanisms and pathways influencing markers of liver function."
https://openalex.org/W2011902133,"Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination requires resection of 5'-termini to generate 3'-single-strand DNA tails. Key components of this reaction are exonuclease 1 and the bifunctional endo/exonuclease, Mre11 (refs 2-4). Mre11 endonuclease activity is critical when DSB termini are blocked by bound protein--such as by the DNA end-joining complex, topoisomerases or the meiotic transesterase Spo11 (refs 7-13)--but a specific function for the Mre11 3'-5' exonuclease activity has remained elusive. Here we use Saccharomyces cerevisiae to reveal a role for the Mre11 exonuclease during the resection of Spo11-linked 5'-DNA termini in vivo. We show that the residual resection observed in Exo1-mutant cells is dependent on Mre11, and that both exonuclease activities are required for efficient DSB repair. Previous work has indicated that resection traverses unidirectionally. Using a combination of physical assays for 5'-end processing, our results indicate an alternative mechanism involving bidirectional resection. First, Mre11 nicks the strand to be resected up to 300 nucleotides from the 5'-terminus of the DSB--much further away than previously assumed. Second, this nick enables resection in a bidirectional manner, using Exo1 in the 5'-3' direction away from the DSB, and Mre11 in the 3'-5' direction towards the DSB end. Mre11 exonuclease activity also confers resistance to DNA damage in cycling cells, suggesting that Mre11-catalysed resection may be a general feature of various DNA repair pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2158217876,"Intracellular RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs, including RIG-I, MDA-5, and LGP2) recognize viral RNAs as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate an antiviral immune response. To understand the molecular basis of this process, we determined the crystal structure of RIG-I in complex with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The dsRNA is sheathed within a network of protein domains that include a conserved ""helicase"" domain (regions HEL1 and HEL2), a specialized insertion domain (HEL2i), and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). A V-shaped pincer connects HEL2 and the CTD by gripping an α-helical shaft that extends from HEL1. In this way, the pincer coordinates functions of all the domains and couples RNA binding with ATP hydrolysis. RIG-I falls within the Dicer-RIG-I clade of the superfamily 2 helicases, and this structure reveals complex interplay between motor domains, accessory mechanical domains, and RNA that has implications for understanding the nanomechanical function of this protein family and other ATPases more broadly."

We now show that STAT6 is required for innate immune signaling in response to virus infection. Viruses or cytoplasmic nucleic acids trigger STING (also named MITA/ERIS) to recruit STAT6 to the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to STAT6 phosphorylation on Ser407 by TBK1 and Tyr641, independent of JAKs. Phosphorylated STAT6 then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to induce specific target genes responsible for immune cell homing. Virus-induced STAT6 activation is detected in all cell-types tested, in contrast to the cell-type specific role of STAT6 in cytokine signaling, and Stat6–/– mice are susceptible to virus infection.

IL-4 induces the phosphorylation of IL-4 receptor, which in turn recruits cytosolic STAT6 by its SH2 domain; the recruited STAT6 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 641 (Y641) by JAK1, which results in the dimerization and nuclear translocation of STAT6 to activate target genes (Mikita et al., 1996Mikita T.

A thorough understanding of biological consequences of STAT6 signaling awaits additional studies. It is known that NF-κB, AP-1 and IRFs are responsible for the induction of many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), however, the role of STAT6 in anti-viral response is unclear. Here we report a STAT6-dependent antiviral innate immune signaling event that leads to the induction of chemokines, including CCL2, CCL20, and CCL26, and these chemokines recruit immune cells to combat viral infection. More importantly, virus induces STAT6 activation independently of JAK, but instead relies on STING and TBK1, as well as MAVS in the case of RNA virus. The physiological significance of the novel pathway is reflected by a higher susceptibility of Stat6–/– mice to viral infections; moreover, unlike other cell type-specific STAT6 signaling pathways, virus-induced STAT6 activation is ubiquitously detected, implying a fundamental requirement of this mechanism in the defense against viral infections. Using C-terminal STING (aa 178–379) as bait in the yeast 2-hybrid screen, we identified an STING-STAT6 interaction and confirmed it in 293 cells by coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) (Figure S1A available online). Specifically, the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of STAT6 and STING C terminus (aa 317–379) were required for this interaction (Figures S1B–S1D). We next examined this interaction at endogenous protein levels. Analysis with confocal microscope showed a dispersed pattern of STAT6 in the cytosol of unstimulated HeLa cells; upon infection with Sendai virus (SeV, an RNA virus), STAT6 redistributes to the perinuclear regions, colocalizes with STING, and eventually translocates into the nucleus (Figure 1A ). CoIP analyses also revealed an inducible interaction of endogenous STAT6 with STING, as well as MAVS and TBK1, in SeV-infected primary MEFs, 2fTGH and THP-1 cells (Figure 1B). Consistent with these observations, endogenous STAT6 co-fractionate with STING in HeLa cell lysates after Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1, a DNA virus) infection (Figure 1C). Similar results were obtained from SeV-infected HeLa cells, with an additional location to a mixed fraction containing MAVS-resident mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) and also MAVS-resident peroxisomal membrane (Dixit et al., 2010Dixit E.

Taking advantage of this property, we first established a 293 cell-line stably expressing Flag-STAT6 (293-STAT6) and confirmed its normal responsiveness to IL-4/13 with intact Y641 phosphorylation (data not shown). Virus infection resulted in the nuclear translocation of STAT6, suggesting that STAT6 may serve as a transcriptional activator under this situation. To confirm this hypothesis, we assessed Y641 phosphorylation of STAT6, since it is required for STAT6 activation in response to cytokines. We found that STAT6 was indeed phosphorylated on Y641 in SeV-infected and poly (I:C)/poly dAdT-transfected cells, and this STAT6 phosphorylation takes place prior to the phosphorylation of IRF3 and other STATs (Figures 2A, 2D, and 2H , and Figures S2B and S2H ). A STAT6-responsive luciferase reporter (E3-Luc) (Yuan et al., 2006Yuan Q. Campanella G.S. Colvin R.A. Hamilos D.L. Jones K.J. Mathew A. Means T.K. Luster A.D.

By contrast, neither reporter was activated in 293 cells, indicating a transactivation function of STAT6 in response to virus. These findings imply a previously unknown pathway of STAT6 activation in response to viral infection and cytoplasmic dsRNA/DNA.Figure S2STAT6 Is Phosphorylated and Activated upon Viral Infection, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) 293-STAT6 or 293 cells transfected with E3-Luc were treated with IL-4/IL-13 for 12 hr, or transfected with poly (I:C) (pIC) (left); or 293-STAT6 cells transfected with E3-Luc were transfected with poly (I:C) (pIC-trans) or treated with poly (I:C) (pIC-add) for indicated hours (right), STAT6 activation was analyzed using luciferase assay (fold induction).(B) 293-STAT6 cells were transfected with poly dAdT (upper) or poly (I:C) (lower) for indicated hours.

To clarify a potential role of cytokines in STAT6 activation during viral challenges, we first monitored cytokine production in virus-infected cells. Neither IL-4 nor IL-13 was induced by virus (Figure 2B and Figure S2C), thus excluding their involvement in STAT6 activation after virus infection. Strikingly, other cytokines including type I IFNs, IL-8 and STAT6-induced genes (CCL2 and CCL20, see below), displayed similar kinetics post infection. Therefore, CCL2/20 is unlikely regulated by cytokines like type I IFNs or IL-8. In fact, when media of SeV-infected 293-STAT6 cells were used to treat naive 293-STAT6 cells, STAT6 phosphorylation was only detected in virus-infected but not media-treated cells, whereas phosphorylation of STAT1/2/3/5 was detected in media-treated cells (Figure 2D and data not shown), excluding any STAT6-activating cytokines in the media within these time points. Furthermore, STAT6 phosphorylation was intact upon SeV and poly (I:C) stimulation when production of cytokines including IL-8 and type I IFNs was inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX) pretreatment (Figures 2E and 2F). These data collectively indicate a cytokine –independent pathway of STAT6 activation upon virus infection. Next we used 2fTGH and its derivative cell lines (Kumar et al., 1997Kumar A. Commane M.

https://openalex.org/W2044994347,"In many organisms, developmentally programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) formed by the SPO11 transesterase initiate meiotic recombination, which promotes pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes. Because every chromosome must receive a minimum number of DSBs, attention has focused on factors that support DSB formation. However, improperly repaired DSBs can cause meiotic arrest or mutation; thus, having too many DSBs is probably as deleterious as having too few. Only a small fraction of SPO11 protein ever makes a DSB in yeast or mouse and SPO11 and its accessory factors remain abundant long after most DSB formation ceases, implying the existence of mechanisms that restrain SPO11 activity to limit DSB numbers. Here we report that the number of meiotic DSBs in mouse is controlled by ATM, a kinase activated by DNA damage to trigger checkpoint signalling and promote DSB repair. Levels of SPO11-oligonucleotide complexes, by-products of meiotic DSB formation, are elevated at least tenfold in spermatocytes lacking ATM. Moreover, Atm mutation renders SPO11-oligonucleotide levels sensitive to genetic manipulations that modulate SPO11 protein levels. We propose that ATM restrains SPO11 via a negative feedback loop in which kinase activation by DSBs suppresses further DSB formation. Our findings explain previously puzzling phenotypes of Atm-null mice and provide a molecular basis for the gonadal dysgenesis observed in ataxia telangiectasia, the human syndrome caused by ATM deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1997444760,"Spinal opioid-induced itch, a prevalent side effect of pain management, has been proposed to result from pain inhibition. We now report that the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) isoform MOR1D is essential for morphine-induced scratching (MIS), whereas the isoform MOR1 is required only for morphine-induced analgesia (MIA). MOR1D heterodimerizes with gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in the spinal cord, relaying itch information. We show that morphine triggers internalization of both GRPR and MOR1D, whereas GRP specifically triggers GRPR internalization and morphine-independent scratching. Providing potential insight into opioid-induced itch prevention, we demonstrate that molecular and pharmacologic inhibition of PLCβ3 and IP3R3, downstream effectors of GRPR, specifically block MIS but not MIA. In addition, blocking MOR1D-GRPR association attenuates MIS but not MIA. Together, these data suggest that opioid-induced itch is an active process concomitant with but independent of opioid analgesia, occurring via the unidirectional cross-activation of GRPR signaling by MOR1D heterodimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2077055700,"Microbes survive in a variety of nutrient environments by modulating their intracellular metabolism. Balanced growth requires coordinated uptake of carbon and nitrogen, the primary substrates for biomass production. Yet the mechanisms that balance carbon and nitrogen uptake are poorly understood. We find in Escherichia coli that a sudden increase in nitrogen availability results in an almost immediate increase in glucose uptake. The concentrations of glycolytic intermediates and known regulators, however, remain homeostatic. Instead, we find that α-ketoglutarate, which accumulates in nitrogen limitation, directly blocks glucose uptake by inhibiting enzyme I, the first step of the sugar-phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS). This inhibition enables rapid modulation of glycolytic flux without marked changes in the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates by simultaneously altering import of glucose and consumption of the terminal glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate. Quantitative modeling shows that this previously unidentified regulatory connection is, in principle, sufficient to coordinate carbon and nitrogen utilization."

Experiments were conducted to determine the mechanism of action of these two signals in regulation of Vg gene expression. Injection of bovine insulin or FOXO double-stranded RNA into the previtellogenic, starved, or JH-deficient female adults increased Vg mRNA and protein levels, thereby implicating the pivotal role for insulin-like peptide signaling in the regulation of Vg gene expression and possible cross-talk between JH and insulin-like peptide signaling pathways. Reduction in JH synthesis or its action by RNAi-mediated silencing of genes coding for acid methyltransferase or methoprene-tolerant decreased expression of genes coding for insulin-like peptides (ILPs) and influenced FOXO subcellular localization, resulting in the down-regulation of Vg gene expression. Furthermore, JH application to previtellogenic female beetles induced the expression of genes coding for ILP2 and ILP3, and induced Vg gene expression.

The insulin-like peptide/TOR pathways sense nutrient status and play important roles in determining the tradeoff between survival and reproduction. In D. melanogaster, the mutant of insulin receptor (InR) yielded dwarf females with extended lifespan. These insects exhibited decreased JH levels and undeveloped ovarioles that resembled the ovarioles of wild-type flies that are in diapause, a delay in development in response to adverse environmental conditions (7Tatar M. Kopelman A. Epstein D. Tu M.P. Yin C.M. Garofalo R.S. Science. 2001; 292: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar).

Previous studies from our laboratory showed that nutrition, insulin-like peptide, 20 hydroxyecdysone (20E), and JH regulate female reproduction in T. castaneum. 20E regulates oocyte maturation, JH regulates Vg synthesis in the fat body, and the nutritional signals mediated by insulin-like peptide/TOR pathways play key role in both Vg synthesis and oocyte maturation (19Parthasarathy R.

In this study we show that both nutrition and JH are necessary for vitellogenesis, and both these signals work through the insulin-like peptide pathway and the downstream FOXO transcription factor to regulate Vg synthesis. Strain GA-1 of T. castaneum was maintained as described previously (19Parthasarathy R. Sheng Z. Sun Z. Palli S.R. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Purified PCR products were transcribed to synthesize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) using the MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The control dsRNA was prepared using a fragment of Escherichia coli malE gene. Newly emerged female adults (∼6 h post adult emergence (PAE)) or 3-day-old female pupae (appearance of black eyes but not black wings) were anesthetized with ether vapor for 8 min. dsRNAs (400 ng/insect) were injected into beetles on the ventral side of the first abdominal segment using a aspirator tube assembly (Sigma) fitted with 3.5-inch glass capillary tube (Drummond) pulled by a needle puller (Model P-2000, Sutter Instrument Co.). Injected insects were allowed to recover for 8 h at room temperature (∼22 °C) and then transferred to standard conditions. Knockdown efficiency of gene expression in the RNAi insects was calculated as the ratio of gene expression between target dsRNA-injected and control dsRNA-injected beetles.TABLE 1Primers used to prepare dsRNA and in qRT-PCRNameSequencedsRNA ILP1-FTCGCCTATAACGAATACGACGAGT ILP1-RTTTCCGGCAACATTCGTCCACAA ILP2-FAAGTCAGACATTCACGAGATGGGTGC ILP2-RCGCCGCAATATTGGGACAGTTCTT ILP3-FCGGCAAATAGTGGACGAATGTT ILP3-RCATTTGCAATGCCCATGGTTTGG ILP4-FAGATCACAATCCGACTGGGAGGAA ILP4-RCGTCCGTGTTAGTGATGTAATTATTGTAGC FOXO-FAGCCGTCTCCCGACCCTTTAAATA FOXO-RTGCTGGTGATCCCTGAAATCGTCT AKT-FAAAAGGACGAAGTCGCTCAC AKT-RTCCGTATCGCTAGTAACCTGqRT-PCR ILP1-FTTACGTCTGGTCTTCACCGCACAT ILP1-RTGGTTGGGTTTGGATTCGGAGAGT ILP2-FTGGCCGGAATACACACTTGTAGGA ILP2-RTCTTCTTCCGCAGTAGACCGCTTT ILP3-FAAAGTCTGCTTCACCTTGCTCCTC ILP3-RAATAGCGCACAGTTCGGTGAGAGT ILP4-FTCGGAGAAGCGACCAAAGCTACAA ILP4-RTCTGAAGTGATAGAAGCGCCAGCA FOXO-FCAACGAAGAGGGCAACAAGT FOXO-RCGCACTGATTTTCCTGGTTT AKT-FCGACTTCACCAAGTGCAAAA AKT-RGCCCCCTCATTGTAAACGTA Open table in a new tab Polyclonal antibodies made against D. melanogaster phospho-AKT (Ser-505), β-actin, and phospho-FOXO1 (Ser-256) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, and Drosophila-FOXO antibody was gifted from Dr. Marc Tatar, Brown University. Tribolium-Vg antibody was produced in our laboratory; a 1-kb fragment of Vg gene was cloned into pGEX-5X-1 expression vector (GE Healthcare), and the construct DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) to produce GST-Vg fusion protein. GST-Vg fusion protein was isolated by cutting a 50-kDa band from SDS-PAGE gel and injected into rabbit. After three injections, antiserum was collected and tested using isolated GST-Vg protein and fat body samples from various adult stages. Isolated fat bodies were homogenized in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), boiled 5 min in SDS loading buffer, and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) to collect the supernatant. Cytoplasm and nuclear extracts were also prepared from isolated fat bodies using a kit from Marligen Bioscience. 30 μg of denatured protein samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution (1× TBS with 5% nonfat milk and 0.02% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:1000 primary antibody in blocking solution. Thermo Scientific Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate kit (containing goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate with horseradish peroxidase) was used to visualize horseradish peroxidase. To decipher the effect of nutrition and JH on vitellogenesis simultaneously, food deprivation plus RNAi of JHAMT experiments were performed by keeping JHAMT dsRNA-injected (malE dsRNA as a control) female adults without food (with food as the control) and collecting samples every day during days 1–5 PAE for Vg expression analysis. After 4 days of starvation, JHAMT dsRNA-injected (malE dsRNA as a control) beetles were fed on a hydroprene plus diet (50 μg of hydroprene in 200 μl of acetone/g diet, 200 μl of acetone/g diet for the control) for 6, 12, and 24 h, and Vg2 mRNA levels were quantified. JH III was also applied topically (10 mm in acetone, 200 nl/insect) on JHAMT dsRNA-injected or previtellogenic beetles. Bovine insulin (10 mg/ml, 100 nl/insect, Sigma) was injected into female adults on days 1 and 2 PAE. Insulin-injected beetles were recovered by keeping them at room temperature for 8 h and transferred to standard conditions until use. Fat bodies were isolated from day 1 PAE female beetles and cultured in Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with 7% FBS. Dissected fat bodies were washed in the medium three times and precultured in the medium for 1 h at 28 °C. JH (10 μm) was added in the culture, and acetone was used as a control. Total RNA was extracted from fat bodies isolated from 4 adults, 12 heads or 30 brains of staged, dsRNA-injected, starved, or hormone-treated female beetles using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati OH). cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR reactions were performed using the gene-specific primers (reported in Refs. 19Parthasarathy R.

The mean ± S.D. of at least three independent replicates is shown. Full-length FOXO and Met proteins were expressed in the baculovirus system as described in our previous publication (22Zhang Z. Xu J. Sheng Z. Sui Y. Palli S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8437-8447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). 30-bp primers (forward, 5′-GGTGAAACAACACGTAAACAAAAATAAGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCTTATTTTTGTTTACGTGTTGTTTCACC-3′) containing FOXO response element (FHRE) identified in the Vg promoter were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and purified by passing through a Sephadex G50 column. Proteins were mixed in assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 0.05 μg/μl poly[dI-dC], and 20 μm single-stranded, nonspecific DNA) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min, then the labeled probe was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The components of the reactions were then resolved on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed in 7% acetic acid, dried onto a Whatman filter paper and visualized by phosphorimaging. In competition experiments a 100× concentration of unlabeled FHRE or a 30-bp unrelated double-stranded oligonucleotide was included in the initial reaction mixture before adding the labeled probe. Vitellogenin is coded by two genes, Vg1 and Vg2, in T. castaneum. Preliminary studies showed that the expression profiles of both the Vg genes are identical, and therefore, only Vg2 mRNA levels were measured in the studies described here. The antibodies made against Vg protein recognize products of both Vg genes. As shown by the appearance of blue dye mixed with flour in the gut, the adult females start feeding at about 2.5 days (Fig. 1A). The Vg2 mRNA was detected on the 3rd day PAE and increased rapidly on days 4 and 5 PAE (Fig. 1B). The vitellogenin proteins were detected on day 4 PAE and increased on day 5 PAE (Fig. 1C). In addition, starvation prevented an increase in Vg2 mRNA and Vg protein levels on days 4 and 5 PAE (Fig. 1, B and C). These data suggest that nutrition signals are required for expression of Vg genes. To determine whether or not JH is also required for Vg synthesis, expression of the gene coding for a key enzyme involved in JH biosynthesis, JHAMT was knocked down by injecting JHAMT dsRNA. As shown in Fig. 1D, the mRNA levels of JHAMT started to increase on day 2 PAE and reached the maximum levels by day 4 or 3 in fed and starved insects, respectively. JHAMT expression was successfully silenced by injecting JHAMT dsRNA into newly emerged female adults (Fig. 1E). JHAMT RNAi beetles synthesized no Vg2 mRNA in starved beetles but showed trace levels of Vg2 mRNA in fed insects (Fig. 1B). Similarly, JHAMT RNAi beetles showed no detectable Vg protein on days 4 and 5 (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that JH signaling is required for Vg synthesis. Feeding the starved beetles induced Vg2 mRNA by 12 h after feeding (Fig. 1F) and induced Vg protein levels by 24 h after feeding (Fig. 1G). However, this induction of Vg2 mRNA or protein levels by feeding was not observed in JHAMT RNAi beetles (Fig. 1, F and G). Feeding the diet plus hydroprene (JH analog) to starved JHAMT RNAi beetles increased the Vg2 mRNA and Vg protein levels by 24 h after feeding (Fig. 1, F and G). These data suggest that both nutrition and JH are required for Vg synthesis. T. castaneum genome contains four genes coding for insulin-like peptides (23Li B. Predel R. Neupert S. Hauser F. Tanaka Y. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Arakane Y. Verleyen P. Schoofs L. Schachtner J. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Park Y. Genome Res. 2008; 18: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). All four peptides contain both A and B chains as well as cysteines and other amino acids residues conserved among insulin-like peptides (Fig. 2A). The ILP1 coded by TC08479 is highly expressed in the brain, and the mRNA levels increase from day 0 to day 3 PAE (Fig. 2B). The ILP2 coded by TC07035 and ILP3 coded by TC00934 are expressed highly both in the brain and fat body. Although the ILP2 mRNA levels increased significantly on day 2 and day 3 PAE in both the brain and the fat body, the mRNA levels of ILP3 increased in the fat body on day 3 PAE (Fig. 2B). It is interesting that ILP2 mRNA levels began to increase on day 2 before feeding, and the ILP3 levels began to increase on day 3 after initiation of feeding. The ILP4 coded by TC00643 is expressed both in the brain and the fat body although at a lower level when compared with the levels observed for the other three ILPs (Fig. 2B). Injection of bovine insulin into beetles on the 2nd day PAE induced Vg gene expression (Fig. 2C), and insulin induction of Vg gene expression was dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 2, C and D). Injection of insulin also induced Vg gene expression in starved beetles (Fig. 2E). However about 48-h exposure to insulin is required to reach the maximum levels of induction. Furthermore, injection of insulin into day-1 but not day-0 PAE beetles caused an increase in Vg mRNA levels (Fig. 2F). These data suggest activation of insulin pathway is sufficient to induce Vg gene expression. To determine whether any of the four ILPs are required for Vg synthesis, ILP1, ILP2, ILP3, or ILP4 dsRNA was injected into the pupae, and the ILP1, ILP2, ILP3, ILP4, and Vg2 mRNA levels were quantified in adults on 3rd day PAE. As shown in Fig. 2G, injection of ILP2 and ILP4 dsRNAs reduced mRNA levels of only ILP2 and ILP4, respectively. Injection of ILP2 or ILP4 dsRNA did not affect the expression of genes coding for other three ILPs (Fig. 2G). However, injection of ILP1 dsRNA caused a reduction in the mRNA levels of both ILP1 and ILP3. Similarly, injection of ILP3 dsRNA caused a reduction in the mRNA levels of both ILP3 and ILP1 (Fig. 2G). The similarity between DNA sequences used to prepare ILP1 and ILP3 dsRNA was not very high, and there was no 22-nucleotide stretch that was identical between these two dsRNAs. Therefore, the reduction in the ILP3 mRNA in ILP1 RNAi insects and ILP1 mRNA in the ILP3 RNAi insects suggests that these two ILPs may regulate each other's expression. Interestingly, the Vg2 mRNA levels were reduced by more than 90% in ILP1 or ILP3 dsRNA-injected insects when compared with its expression in control beetle-injected malE dsRNA (Fig. 2H). The ILP2 and ILP4 dsRNA-injected insects showed about a 68 and 50% decrease in Vg2 mRNA levels, respectively. These data suggest that expression of genes coding for ILP2 and ILP3 is required for Vg gene expression. The ILP1 effect may be indirect due to regulation of its expression by ILP3. The ILP4 gene is expressed at very low levels in these tissues; therefore, it may not have a significant effect on Vg synthesis. Feeding starved beetles resulted in an increase in both ILP3 and Vg2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2I). These data and expression profile of ILP3 (Fig. 2B) suggest that feeding induces expression of Vg gene through ILP3. To further study the role of insulin-like peptide signaling in Vg synthesis, the gene coding for FOXO, a transcription factor involved in insulin-like peptide signaling was knocked down by RNAi. The mRNA levels of FOXO were decreased by more than 90% by 2 days after injection of dsRNA, indicating that FOXO gene was successfully silenced by RNAi (Fig. 3A). RNAi-mediated silencing of FOXO resulted in a precocious expression of Vg2 gene on day 2 PAE (Fig. 3B). The Vg2 mRNA levels in FOXO RNAi beetles on day 2 PAE are similar to those present in untreated day 5 PAE beetles (Fig. 3B). Similarly, silencing of FOXO caused precocious appearance of Vg protein on day 2 PAE (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, silencing of FOXO precociously induced Vg2 gene expression even in starved beetles. When compared with the Vg mRNA levels in the control beetles injected with malE dsRNA, an increase in the Vg2 mRNA levels was detected in FOXO RNAi beetles that were starved from day 1 to day 4 PAE (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that FOXO suppresses the expression of Vg genes in adults after their emergence until nutritional signals are received via insulin-like peptide/TOR pathway when beetles began to feed. We determined the levels of FOXO protein in the whole cell as well as in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions isolated from the fat body dissected from beetles between day 2 (previtellogenic, before initiation of feeding) and day 5 (vitellogenic, after initiation of feeding) PAE. FOXO protein levels in the whole cell increased gradually from day 2 to day 5 PAE (Fig. 3E). Phosphorylated FOXO protein detected by phosphospecific antibody showed an increase on day 3 and remained high on day 4 but decreased on day 5 PAE (Fig. 3E). FOXO protein levels gradually increased in the cytoplasm from day 2 to day 5 PAE. In contrast, FOXO protein levels decreased in the nuclear fraction from day 2 to day 5 PAE (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that dephosphorylated FOXO resides in the nucleus and likely binds to the Vg gene promoters to prevent its expression until insulin-like peptide/TOR pathways are turned on by nutrition. When these pathways are turned on by nutrition, the FOXO protein is phosphorylated and transported out of the nucleus, allowing expression of Vg genes. AKT is another important protein involved in insulin-like peptide signaling. Insulin-like peptide induces the phosphorylation of this protein, and AKT in turn influences FOXO phosphorylation and localization. Phosphorylated AKT levels are lower on day 1 PAE but increased to reach the maximum levels by day 3 PAE when female beetles begin to ingest food and synthesize Vg (Fig. 3F). Similarly, phosphorylated AKT levels were lower in starved beetles but increased by 12 h after initiation of feeding and reached the maximum levels by 24 h after feeding (Fig. 3G). These data suggest that nutritional signals enhance phosphorylation of AKT. To further confirm the key role of AKT in the nutrition-induced Vg synthesis, AKT was knocked down by RNAi. Injection of AKT dsRNA into adult females resulted in more than a 90% reduction in AKT mRNA levels in day 4 PAE adults (Fig. 3H). Knockdown in the expression of gene coding for AKT resulted in a reduction in Vg"
https://openalex.org/W2147007332,"Jan Brosens and his colleagues have found that deregulation of a single kinase—SGK1, a kinase involved in fluid balance—in two distinct cellular compartments of the endometrium is linked to two different forms of reproductive failure in humans. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in mice, the group confirmed the importance of these expression changes in such pathologies. Infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) are prevalent but distinct causes of reproductive failure that often remain unexplained despite extensive investigations1,2. Analysis of midsecretory endometrial samples revealed that SGK1, a kinase involved in epithelial ion transport and cell survival3,4,5,6, is upregulated in unexplained infertility, most prominently in the luminal epithelium, but downregulated in the endometrium of women suffering from RPL. To determine the functional importance of these observations, we first expressed a constitutively active SGK1 mutant in the luminal epithelium of the mouse uterus. This prevented expression of certain endometrial receptivity genes, perturbed uterine fluid handling and abolished embryo implantation. By contrast, implantation was unhindered in Sgk1−/− mice, but pregnancy was often complicated by bleeding at the decidual-placental interface and fetal growth retardation and subsequent demise. Compared to wild-type mice, Sgk1−/− mice had gross impairment of pregnancy-dependent induction of genes involved in oxidative stress defenses. Relative SGK1 deficiency was also a hallmark of decidualizing stromal cells from human subjects with RPL and sensitized these cells to oxidative cell death. Thus, depending on the cellular compartment, deregulated SGK1 activity in cycling endometrium interferes with embryo implantation, leading to infertility, or predisposes to pregnancy complications by rendering the feto-maternal interface vulnerable to oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2106549599,"Light is a fundamental signal that regulates important physiological processes such as development and circadian rhythm in living organisms. Phytochromes form a major family of photoreceptors responsible for red light perception in plants, fungi and bacteria. They undergo reversible photoconversion between red-absorbing (Pr) and far-red-absorbing (Pfr) states, thereby ultimately converting a light signal into a distinct biological signal that mediates subsequent cellular responses. Several structures of microbial phytochromes have been determined in their dark-adapted Pr or Pfr states. However, the structural nature of initial photochemical events has not been characterized by crystallography. Here we report the crystal structures of three intermediates in the photoreaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophytochrome (PaBphP). We used cryotrapping crystallography to capture intermediates, and followed structural changes by scanning the temperature at which the photoreaction proceeded. Light-induced conformational changes in PaBphP originate in ring D of the biliverdin (BV) chromophore, and E-to-Z isomerization about the C(15) = C(16) double bond between rings C and D is the initial photochemical event. As the chromophore relaxes, the twist of the C(15) methine bridge about its two dihedral angles is reversed. Structural changes extend further to rings B and A, and to the surrounding protein regions. These data indicate that absorption of a photon by the Pfr state of PaBphP converts a light signal into a structural signal via twisting and untwisting of the methine bridges in the linear tetrapyrrole within the confined protein cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2026887719,"Heterochromatin comprises tightly compacted repetitive regions of eukaryotic chromosomes. The inheritance of heterochromatin through mitosis requires RNA interference (RNAi), which guides histone modification during the DNA replication phase of the cell cycle. Here we show that the alternating arrangement of origins of replication and non-coding RNA in pericentromeric heterochromatin results in competition between transcription and replication in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Co-transcriptional RNAi releases RNA polymerase II (Pol II), allowing completion of DNA replication by the leading strand DNA polymerase, and associated histone modifying enzymes that spread heterochromatin with the replication fork. In the absence of RNAi, stalled forks are repaired by homologous recombination without histone modification."
https://openalex.org/W2032681988,"Our recent study demonstrated miR-15a/16-1 downregulation in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Here, we investigated mechanisms of miR-15a/16-1 transcriptional repression and its epigenetic regulation by c-Myc and histone deacetylase (HDAC) in MCL. c-Myc expression was detected in MCL cell lines and in the primary MCL samples, and pri-miR-15a/16-1 mRNAs were significantly upregulated in Mino and Jeko-1 cells with c-Myc knockdown by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Our co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that c-Myc interacted with HDAC3. Moreover, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that both c-Myc and HDAC3 co-localized to the two promoters of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster gene, DLEU2, and inhibition of HDAC3 increased histone acetylation of the DLEU2 promoters. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed the dependence of Myc-mediated DLEU2 transcriptional repression on HDAC3. Treatment with the pan-HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and HDAC3 siRNA resulted in increased miR-15a/16-1 expression. The regulatory mechanism of miR-15a/16-1 was further demonstrated in Burkitt lymphoma and Myc overexpressing cell lines. These findings highlight the role of HDAC3 in Myc-induced miR-15a/16-1 changes and reveal novel mechanisms for c-Myc-driven microRNA suppression and malignant transformation in aggressive B-cell malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2066604609,"To identify endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced microRNAs (miRNA) that govern ER protein influx during the adaptive phase of unfolded protein response, we performed miRNA microarray profiling and analysis in human airway epithelial cells following ER stress induction using proteasome inhibition or tunicamycin treatment. We identified miR-346 as the most significantly induced miRNA by both classic stressors. miR-346 is encoded within an intron of the glutamate receptor ionotropic delta-1 gene (GRID1), but its ER stress-associated expression is independent of GRID1. We demonstrated that the spliced X-box-binding protein-1 (sXBP1) is necessary and sufficient for ER stress-associated miR-346 induction, revealing a novel role for this unfolded protein response-activated transcription factor. In mRNA profiling arrays, we identified 21 mRNAs that were reduced by both ER stress and miR-346. The target genes of miR-346 regulate immune responses and include the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene products, interferon-induced genes, and the ER antigen peptide transporter 1 (TAP1). Although most of the repressed mRNAs appear to be indirect targets because they lack specific seeding sites for miR-346, we demonstrate that the human TAP1 mRNA is a direct target of miR-346. The human TAP1 mRNA 3′-UTR contains a 6-mer canonical seeding site for miR-346. Importantly, the ER stress-associated reduction in human TAP1 mRNA and protein levels could be reversed with an miR-346 antagomir.

Increased synthesis of secretory pathway proteins and cellular insults that disturb ER homeostasis activate the UPR (1Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev.

The UPR is primarily a cellular adaptive mechanism that alleviates ER stress by increasing the protein folding capacity and simultaneously reducing the influx of nascent polypeptides into the ER. When stress persists or the recovery mechanisms are ineffective, apoptotic cascades are activated (3Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol.

The mammalian UPR is initiated by three ER transmembrane sensors, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6,) and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) (3Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). To increase the protein folding capacity of the ER, the transcription factors, IRE1-spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) and ATF6, enhance the expression of ER-resident chaperones and foldases and promote ER expansion (9Bommiasamy H. Back S.H. Fagone P. Lee K. Meshinchi S. Vink E. Sriburi R. Frank M. Jackowski S. Kaufman R.J. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Sriburi R.

For example, the UPR reduces expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) via transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms (11Bartoszewski R.

Protein synthesis during the UPR is inhibited through protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α, a modification that leads to a loss of translation initiation complexes (13DuRose J.B.

Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Because it is clear that the UPR utilizes multiple mechanisms to resolve ER stress, we reasoned that UPR-induced miRNAs may contribute to ER protein and peptide load reduction by decreasing the stability of certain mRNAs (18Guo H. Ingolia N.T. Weissman J.S. Bartel D.P. Nature. 2010; 466: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3145) Google Scholar). miRNAs are small, ∼22-nucleotide, endogenous RNAs that govern mRNA stability by recruiting the RNA-induced silencing complex to the specific sequences at the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs, resulting in mRNA degradation (18Guo H. Ingolia N.T. Weissman J.S. Bartel D.P. Nature. 2010; 466: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3145) Google Scholar, 19Bartel D.P.

Because the information is limited regarding ER stress-induced miRNAs and their biological significance, the studies presented herein were designed to select ER stress-induced miRNAs, identify their UPR-associated activators, and characterize their targets. Calu-3 and HeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Glioblastoma multiforme cells and human primary astrocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone). Cells were split into 6-well plates and allowed to grow until 70–80% confluency prior to experiments. Xbp1+/+ and Xbp1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts were provided by Dr. Randal Kaufman, University of Michigan, and were cultured as described previously (9Bommiasamy H. Back S.H. Fagone P. Lee K.

Total cellular RNA was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen). RNA concentration was calculated based on the absorbance at 260 nm. RNA samples were stored at −20 °C. Total cellular RNA + microRNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were stored at −20 °C. The Affymetrix human genome array (HG-U133 Plus 2.0) was used to analyze the mRNA expression pattern of the human airway epithelial cell line Calu-3 (11Bartoszewski R. Rab A. Twitty G. Stevenson L.

Real time RT-PCR was performed according to the TaqMan® microRNA and small RNA assays protocol using the TaqMan® microRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Details about the microarray are available in the supplemental Materials and Methods. To test the impact of hsa-miR-346 on gene expression, we used the miR-346 mimic and miR-346 inhibitor/antagomir (Qiagen). As a control, we used cel-miR-67 (C67, Qiagen), which has no homology to any known mammalian microRNA. HeLa cells grown on 6-well plates were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ER-TrackerTM Red (glibenclamide BODIPY® TR), anti mouse IgG Alexa Fluor-488, and anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor-596 (Molecular Probes) were used according to the manufacturer's protocols. Anti-XBP1 N-terminal polyclonal (rabbit) antibody (Millipore) recognizing both spliced and unspliced XBP1 was used at 1:200 dilution. Anti-TAP1 monoclonal (mouse) antibody (Proteintech Group), anti-KDEL polyclonal (rabbit) antibody (Sigma), and anti-actin polyclonal (rabbit) antibody (Sigma) were used at 1:1000 dilutions. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, washed three times in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min. All incubations were at room temperature unless stated otherwise. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, washed three times for 2 min each with PBS, and then blocked with 2.5% goat serum/PBS. Cells were incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 2 h. Coverslips were washed five times for 5 min each with PBS. Secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (1:500), and coverslips were incubated for 45 min followed by washing steps and mounted with VECTASHIELD/DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Microscopy was performed using a Leitz epifluorescence microscope equipped with a step motor and a filter wheel assembly (Ludl Electronic Products) and an 83,000-filter set (Chroma Technology). Images were obtained with a SenSys cooled, charge-coupled high-resolution camera (Photometrics). IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics) was used for image acquisition. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) on ice for 15 min. The cell lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined by BCATM protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Following normalization of protein concentrations, lysates were mixed with equal volumes of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 30–45 min at 37 °C prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins from the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (300 mA for 90 min at 4 °C). The membranes were then blocked with milk proteins dissolved in PBS/Tween-20 (5% milk, 0.5% Tween 20 for 1–2 h) followed by immunoblotting with the primary antibody specified for each experiment. After the washing steps, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) and detected using ECL (Pierce). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). Pharmacological induction of ER stress and activation of the UPR was performed according to previously described methods (11Bartoszewski R. Rab A. Twitty G. Stevenson L. Fortenberry J. Piotrowski A.

Briefly, cells were treated with the compounds for the time periods specified: proteasome inhibition with ALLN (calpain inhibitor I; 100 μm); brefeldin A (0.4 μg/ml, Sigma); 300 nm thapsigargin (Sigma); tunicamycin (5 μg/ml, Sigma); or 4 mm DTT (Sigma) for the time periods specified in each experiment. For the time course experiment, tunicamycin (TM) was added to samples for the time periods specified at 5 μg/ml final concentration (21Lin H.J. Tsai C.H. Tsai F.J. Chen W.C. Chen H.Y. Fan S.S. Mol. Diagn. 2004; 8: 245-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance among means was determined using the Student's t test (two samples, paired and unpaired). To identify ER stress-induced miRNAs, we utilized human airway epithelial cells, Calu-3, as our primary model. We used two classic compounds, a proteasome inhibitor, ALLN (calpain inhibitor I), and a glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, to induce ER stress (11Bartoszewski R. Rab A. Twitty G. Stevenson L.

Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Isolated RNA samples were first subjected to qRT-PCR to measure the levels of UPR reporters (BiP and spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) mRNA) (12Rab A. Bartoszewski R. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C756-C766Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to confirm UPR activation. BiP mRNA levels were increased >14-fold and sXBP1 mRNA levels were increased >3-fold, confirming that the UPR was activated. Next, the samples were subjected to genome-wide miRNA expression arrays followed by bioinformatics analysis. We only selected miRNAs that were increased more than 2-fold by both ER stressors (Fig. 1A). Two miRNAs, miR-346 and miR-885-3p, fit the selection criteria. Based on the most significant increase, we selected miR-346 for further analysis. mir-346 is encoded within the intron 2 of GRID1, also considered a schizophrenia susceptibility gene, on chromosome 10. miR-346 levels are lower in schizophrenic patients, but there is no strong correlation between GRID1 and miR-346 expression, suggesting that miR-346 expression is regulated independently from its host gene (23Zhu Y. Kalbfleisch T. Brennan M.D. Li Y. Schizophr. Res. 2009; 109: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated miR-346 expression in lymphatic (24Thompson L.H. Whiston R.A. Rakhimov Y. Taccioli C. Liu C.G. Croce C. Metcalfe S.M. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 4213-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and adipose tissues (25Tsai N.P. Lin Y.L. Wei L.N. Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our analysis of GRID1 mRNA levels in the genome-wide mRNA expression arrays and by qRT-PCR indicated that GRID1 mRNA levels did not change during ER stress in Calu-3 or HeLa cells, whereas miR-346 levels were increased under the same conditions (Fig. 1B). Therefore, these results support the view that GRID1 and miR-346 expression are independently regulated. The chromosomal locations of mir-346 and GRID1 are shown in Fig. 1C (based on the GRID1 entry in the GeneCards database). To confirm the predicted increase in miR-346 levels during ER stress and to determine the time period for the induction of miR-346, we performed time course qRT-PCR experiments following ER stress induction with TM. In these experiments, we monitored sXBP1 mRNA as a reporter of UPR activation (12Rab A. Bartoszewski R. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C756-C766Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and measured miR-346 levels from the same samples. The results demonstrate that both sXBP1 mRNA and miR-346 levels increase following TM treatment, reaching a maximum at 8 h after ER stress induction (Fig. 1D). These results are consistent with UPR activation (sXBP1 mRNA increase) and simultaneous miR-346 induction, suggesting a UPR-associated transcriptional activation of miR-346 in human airway epithelial cells. To determine whether miR-346 expression can be induced by the UPR in other cell types, we performed studies to measure miR-346 levels in Calu-3, HeLa, primary glioblastoma, and primary astrocytoma cells using a panel of classic ER stressors (supplemental Fig. S1). The results of these studies indicate that miR-346 expression is induced by a common UPR mechanism independent of the ER stressor. Importantly, miR-346 expression increased in response to UPR activation in all cells tested. However, the magnitude of miR-346 induction in response to ER stress varied among cell types, and this may reflect differences in basal expression of miR-346. Because miR-346 expression is enhanced during ER stress without any significant change in GRID1 mRNA, we investigated whether UPR-activated transcription factors can activate miR-346 expression. To determine which transcriptional activator to test, we analyzed the putative regulatory region of the miR-346 gene upstream of the transcription start site using the miRGen 2.0 database (26Alexiou P. Vergoulis T. Gleditzsch M. Prekas G. Dalamagas T. Megraw M. Grosse I. Sellis T. Hatzigeorgiou A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D137-D141Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Landgraf P.

This analysis indicated a binding site for the UPR-activated transcription factor sXBP1 in addition to binding sites for a number of non-UPR specific transcription factors (supplemental Fig. S2). The location of the sXBP-binding site is −1736 upstream of the transcription start site (26Alexiou P. Vergoulis T. Gleditzsch M. Prekas G. Dalamagas T. Megraw M. Grosse I. Sellis T.

Young R.A. Cell. 2008; 134: 521-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether the overexpression of the transcriptionally active sXBP1 alone would enhance miR-346 expression. Because miR-346 is expressed in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S1), these cells were transfected with plasmids expressing sXBP1, unspliced XBP1 (uXBP1), or an empty vector. To ensure the efficiency of the transfection, we measured sXBP1 and uXBP1 mRNA levels and visualized the nuclear localization of sXBP1 and uXBP1 proteins by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2, A and B). Although uXBP1 is translated and enters the nucleus, it lacks the ability to promote transcription (29Yoshida H. Oku M. Suzuki M. Mori K. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar); therefore, overexpression of this construct served as a specificity control. The results indicate that overexpression of sXBP1 increased miR-346 levels, whereas uXBP1 had no effect (Fig. 2C). Therefore, these studies indicate that sXBP1 overexpression is sufficient for miR-346 transcription. To confirm the role of sXBP1 as transcriptional activator of miR-346 during ER stress, we utilized wild-type (Xbp1+/+) and XBP1 knock-out (Xbp1−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (9Bommiasamy H. Back S.H. Fagone P. Lee K. Meshinchi S. Vink E. Sriburi R. Frank M. Jackowski S. Kaufman R.J. Brewer J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1626-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We induced ER stress with TM for different time periods and then assessed miR-346 expression using mouse-specific primers and qRT-PCR. Although miR-346 expression increased in Xbp1+/+ cells, reaching maximal levels by 8 h, miR-346 levels did not change in Xbp1−/− cells, confirming the role of sXBP1 in miR-346 induction (Fig. 3A). To ensure that the XBP1-independent UPR pathways were intact in the Xbp1−/− cells, we assessed the expression of a known XBP1-dependent and an XBP1-independent gene as controls. ERdj4 is encoded by the XBP1-dependent UPR target gene Dnajb9 (30Adachi Y. Yamamoto K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Harada A. Mori K. Cell Struct. Funct. 2008; 33: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 31Shaffer A.L. Shapiro-Shelef M. Iwakoshi N.N. Lee A.H. Qian S.B. Zhao H. Yu X. Yang L. Tan B.K. Rosenwald A. Hurt E.M.

Immunity. 2004; 21: 81-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), and the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, also known as growth arrest and DNA damage gene 153) is encoded by the XBP1-independent UPR target gene Ddit3 (14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2430) Google Scholar, 32Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). As expected, ER stress-associated induction of Dnajb9 was markedly compromised in Xbp1−/− cells (Fig. 3B), whereas CHOP expression was strongly induced in Xbp1−/− cells (Fig. 3C). Therefore, these data demonstrate that sXBP1 is essential for induction of miR-346 during ER stress. A model depicting the mechanism of miR-346 induction during ER stress is presented in Fig. 4.FIGURE 4ER stress-associated miR-346 induction. Step 1, induction of miR-346 transcription. ER stress activates IRE1α, which splices the XBP1 mRNA, resulting in the translation of sXBP1 protein. sXBP1 enters the nucleus and activates pri-miR-346 transcription. Step 2, target mRNA degradation. Pri-miR-346 enters the miRNA maturation pathway, and in the cytosol, miR-346 is generated. Mir-346 binds to the 3′-UTR of target transcripts and recruits the RNA-induced silencing complex, leading to mRNA decay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A previous study indicated that miR-436 targets the 5′-UTR of a mouse brain-specific splice variant of the receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP140) mRNA and induces its expression (25Tsai N.P. Lin Y.L. Wei L.N. Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Based on this, we tested whether RIP140 levels were altered either during ER stress or by miR-346. Our results indicated that neither ER stress nor miR-346 had any effect on RIP140 levels in human Calu-3 airway epithelial cells or in HeLa cells, indicating that RIP140 was not a target. As a more practical method for identifying the ER stress-associated targets of miR-346, we applied miRNA target prediction algorithms such as TargetBoost and TargetScan (33Saetrom O. Snøve Jr., O. Saetrom P. RNA. 2005; 11: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 34Saetrom P. Heale B.S. Snøve Jr., O. Aagaard L. Alluin J. Rossi J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These databases were developed based on the observation that the conserved seed pairing sites for miRNAs are often flanked by adenosines (35Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

We wanted to focus on targets that were repressed by ER stress and contributed to the regulation of ER protein influx. To accomplish this, we overexpressed an miR-346 mimic that resembles mature miR-346, or a control miRNA (miR-C67) that has no mammalian target sequences, in HeLa cells. We then performed mRNA profiling arrays and selected transcripts that were repressed in the miR-346 mimic-expressing cells. This approach identified 28 mRNAs as significantly reduced (>2-fold) when the mature form of miR-346 (mimic) was overexpressed. To select transcripts that were also reduced during ER stress, we cross-referenced the"

To investigate the contribution of splicing to ribosome production and function, we systematically eliminated introns from all RP genes to evaluate their impact on RNA expression, pre-rRNA processing, cell growth, and response to stress. The majority of introns were required for optimal cell fitness or growth under stress. Most introns are found in duplicated RP genes, and surprisingly, in the majority of cases, deleting the intron from one gene copy affected the expression of the other in a nonreciprocal manner. Consistently, 70% of all duplicated genes were asymmetrically expressed, and both introns and gene deletions displayed copy-specific phenotypic effects. Together, our results indicate that splicing in yeast RP genes mediates intergene regulation and implicate the expression ratio of duplicated RP genes in modulating ribosome function.PaperClip/cms/asset/7216221d-1346-4005-a309-01413276e33b/mmc3.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 2.78 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2152718807,"In multicellular organisms, uncontrolled movement of cells can contribute to pathological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and cancer. In highly aggressive tumors, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is linked to the capacity of tumor cells to invade surrounding tissue and current research indicates that the membrane-anchored membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) has a central role in this process. Endocytosis and trafficking of MT1-MMP are essential for its proper function, and here we examine the phosphorylation, internalization, and recycling of this enzyme, and the associated biochemical signaling in HeLa and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Activation of protein kinase C with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate resulted in phosphorylation of endogenous MT1-MMP at Thr(567) in vivo. Mutation of Thr(567) to alanine (to mimic non-phosphorylated MT1-MMP) reduced internalization of MT1-MMP, whereas mutation of Thr(567) to glutamic acid (to mimic phosphorylation) resulted in decreased levels of MT1-MMP on the cell surface. The endosomal trafficking and recycling of MT1-MMP was found to be dependent upon Rab7 and VAMP7, and blocking the function of these proteins reduced cell migration and invasion. Intracellular trafficking of MT1-MMP was observed to be coupled to the trafficking of integrin α5 and phosphorylation of ERK that coincided with this was dependent on phosphorylation of MT1-MMP. Together, these results reveal important roles for MT1-MMP phosphorylation and trafficking in both cell signaling and cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2093107479,"Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the ATXN1 gene encoding the protein ataxin-1. Puneet Opal and his colleagues find that ataxin-1 represses the expression of the angiogenic and neurotrophic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and that VEGF levels are decreased in animals with motor impairment. Overexpression or infusion of VEGF improves motor performance and pathology, suggesting VEGF may have therapeutic potential in this disease. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an adult-onset, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a glutamine repeat tract in ataxin-1 (ATXN1). Although the precise function of ATXN1 remains elusive, it seems to be involved in transcriptional repression. We find that mutant ATXN1 represses transcription of the neurotrophic and angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Genetic overexpression or pharmacologic infusion of recombinant VEGF mitigates SCA1 pathogenesis, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2060662881,"Several epidemiological studies have shown that high levels of melatonin, an indolic hormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland, reduce the risks of developing cancer, thus suggesting that melatonin triggers the activation of tumor-suppressor pathways that lead to the prevention of malignant transformation. This paper illustrates that melatonin induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 inhibiting cell proliferation and preventing DNA damage accumulation of both normal and transformed cells. This activity requires p53 and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) expression and efficient phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 residue. Melatonin-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser-15 residue does not require ataxia telangiectasia-mutated activity, whereas it is severely impaired upon chemical inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. By and large, these findings imply that the activation of the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway is a critical mediator of melatonin and its anticancer effects. Therefore, it provides molecular insights into increasing observational evidence for the role that melatonin has in cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W1981390207,"Oncolytic virotherapy with reovirus has demonstrated anti-cancer activity and minimal toxicity in clinical trials, but the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been fully elucidated. Reolysin, a proprietary formulation of reovirus for cancer therapy, stimulated selective viral replication and apoptosis in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Reolysin-mediated apoptosis was associated with an induction of endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress-related gene expression, swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum, increases in intracellular calcium levels and a strong induction of the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only pro-apoptotic protein NOXA. Knockdown of NOXA expression by short hairpin RNA significantly reduced the pro-apoptotic effects of Reolysin. We next showed that co-administration of Reolysin and bortezomib resulted in the dual accumulation of viral and ubiquitinated proteins, which led to enhanced ER stress, NOXA induction and apoptosis. Importantly, the combination of reovirus infection and proteasomal inhibition significantly decreased tumor burden in a xenograft and syngeneic bone disease model of MM without exhibiting adverse side effects. Our study establishes ER stress stimulation and NOXA induction as novel mediators of reovirus-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, reovirus infection can be used as a promising approach to augment the anti-myeloma activity of bortezomib by promoting additional stress to the endoplasmic reticulum of MM cells."

In adipocytes, insulin-stimulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton has been proposed to play a role in promoting GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake, in a PI3K-dependent manner. However, the PI3K effectors that promote GLUT4 translocation via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in adipocytes remain to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that the PI3K-dependent Rac exchange factor, P-Rex1, enhances membrane ruffling in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and promotes GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane at submaximal insulin concentrations. P-Rex1-facilitated GLUT4 trafficking requires a functional actin network and membrane ruffle formation and occurs in a PI3K- and Rac1-dependent manner. In contrast, expression of other Rho GTPases, such as Cdc42 or Rho, did not affect insulin-stimulated P-Rex1-mediated GLUT4 trafficking. P-Rex1 siRNA knockdown or expression of a P-Rex1 dominant negative mutant reduced but did not completely inhibit glucose uptake in response to insulin. Collectively, these studies identify a novel RacGEF in adipocytes as P-Rex1 that, at physiological insulin concentrations, functions as an insulin-dependent regulator of the actin cytoskeleton that contributes to GLUT4 trafficking to the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2079262040,"Release factor 3 (RF3) is a GTPase found in a broad range of bacteria where it is thought to play a critical ""recycling"" role in translation by facilitating the removal of class 1 release factors (RF1 and RF2) from the ribosome following peptide release. More recently, RF3 was shown in vitro to stimulate a retrospective editing reaction on the bacterial ribosome wherein peptides carrying mistakes are prematurely terminated during protein synthesis. Here, we examine the role of RF3 in the bacterial cell and show that the deletion of this gene sensitizes cells to other perturbations that reduce the overall fidelity of protein synthesis. We further document substantial effects on mRNA stability and protein expression using reporter systems, native mRNAs and proteins. We conclude that RF3 plays a primary role in vivo in specifying the fidelity of protein synthesis thus impacting overall protein quantity and quality."
https://openalex.org/W1963948449,"Ron Evans and his colleagues have shown that excess thyroid hormone receptor signaling during embryonic development in mice impairs the differentiation of type I pneumocytes, a key lung cell type needed for proper gas exchange. They also show that treatment with antithyroid drugs during this stage of development rescues the defect in lung maturation, suggesting a possible therapy for some children born with respiratory distress syndrome. Although the lung is a defining feature of air-breathing animals, the pathway controlling the formation of type I pneumocytes, the cells that mediate gas exchange, is poorly understood. In contrast, the glucocorticoid receptor and its cognate ligand have long been known to promote type II pneumocyte maturation; prenatal administration of glucocorticoids is commonly used to attenuate the severity of infant respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Here we show that knock-in mutations of the nuclear co-repressor SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) in C57BL/6 mice (SMRTmRID) produces a previously unidentified respiratory distress syndrome caused by prematurity of the type I pneumocyte. Though unresponsive to glucocorticoids, treatment with anti–thyroid hormone drugs (propylthiouracil or methimazole) completely rescues SMRT-induced RDS, suggesting an unrecognized and essential role for the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) in lung development. We show that TR and SMRT control type I pneumocyte differentiation through Klf2, which, in turn, seems to directly activate the type I pneumocyte gene program. Conversely, mice without lung Klf2 lack mature type I pneumocytes and die shortly after birth, closely recapitulating the SMRTmRID phenotype. These results identify TR as a second nuclear receptor involved in lung development, specifically type I pneumocyte differentiation, and suggest a possible new type of therapeutic option in the treatment of RDS that is unresponsive to glucocorticoids."
https://openalex.org/W2040352400,"Human pituitary tumour-transforming gene 1 (hPTTG1) is an oncogenic transcription factor that is overexpressed in many tumour types, especially tumours with metastatic abilities. However, how hPTTG1 overexpression drives metastasis is not yet clear. As a transcription factor, hPTTG1 may promote metastasis by activating target genes that are involved in the metastatic process. Here, we showed that Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1 (GEF-H1) was transcriptionally activated by hPTTG1, thereby promoting breast cancer metastasis. Luciferase reporter analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that hPTTG1 directly bound and activated the GEF-H1 gene promoter. In this study, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of hPTTG1 in highly metastatic breast tumour cells decreased GEF-H1 expression and RhoA activation, thereby reducing cell motility and invasion, and interfering with cytoskeletal remodelling in vitro, and impairing the tumour metastasis in vivo. The restoration of GEF-H1 expression in hPTTG1-knockdown cells rescued the hPTTG1-knockdown effects on cytoskeletal changes in vitro and tumour metastasis in vivo. Conversely, ectopic expression of hPTTG1 in non-metastatic breast tumour cells induced cytoskeletal rearrangements, and allowed these cells to metastasise in a mouse model by orthotopic implantation. In human tumour samples, hPTTG1 expression was also correlated to GEF-H1 expression in aggressive breast carcinoma. Altogether, these findings definitively establish a role for hPTTG1 in activating the GEF-H1/RhoA pathway as a newly identified mechanism in breast cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1976563135,"The molecular mechanisms underlying protein turnover and enzyme regulation in the peroxisomal matrix remain largely unknown. Trypsin domain-containing 1 (Tysnd1) and peroxisomal Lon protease (PsLon) are newly identified peroxisomal matrix proteins that harbor both a serine protease-like domain and a peroxisome-targeting signal 1 (PTS1) sequence. Tysnd1 processes several PTS1-containing proteins and cleaves N-terminal presequences from PTS2-containing protein precursors. Here we report that knockdown of Tysnd1, but not PsLon, resulted in accumulation of endogenous β-oxidation enzymes in their premature form. The protease activity of Tysnd1 was inactivated by intermolecular self-conversion of the 60-kDa form to 15- and 45-kDa chains, which were preferentially degraded by PsLon. Peroxisomal β-oxidation of a very long fatty acid was significantly decreased by knockdown of Tysnd1 and partially lowered by PsLon knockdown. Taken together, these data suggest that Tysnd1 is a key regulator of the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway via proteolytic processing of β-oxidation enzymes. The proteolytic activity of oligomeric Tysnd1 is in turn controlled by self-cleavage of Tysnd1 and degradation of Tysnd1 cleavage products by PsLon."
https://openalex.org/W2102450703,"The mechanisms by which chronic inflammatory lung diseases, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, confer enhanced risk for lung cancer are not well-defined. To investigate whether nuclear factor (NF)-κB, a key mediator of immune and inflammatory responses, provides an interface between persistent lung inflammation and carcinogenesis, we utilized tetracycline-inducible transgenic mice expressing constitutively active IκB kinase β in airway epithelium (IKTA (IKKβ trans-activated) mice). Intraperitoneal injection of ethyl carbamate (urethane), or 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used to induce lung tumorigenesis. Doxycycline-treated IKTA mice developed chronic airway inflammation and markedly increased numbers of lung tumors in response to urethane, even when transgene expression (and therefore epithelial NF-κB activation) was begun after exposure to carcinogen. Studies using a separate tumor initiator/promoter model (MCA+BHT) indicated that NF-κB functions as an independent tumor promoter. Enhanced tumor formation in IKTA mice was preceded by increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis of alveolar epithelium, resulting in increased formation of premalignant lesions. Investigation of inflammatory cells in lungs of IKTA mice revealed a substantial increase in macrophages and lymphocytes, including functional CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). Importantly, Treg depletion using repetitive injections of anti-CD25 antibodies limited excessive tumor formation in IKTA mice. At 6 weeks following urethane injection, antibody-mediated Treg depletion in IKTA mice reduced the number of premalignant lesions in the lungs in association with an increase in CD8 lymphocytes. Thus, persistent NF-κB signaling in airway epithelium facilitates carcinogenesis by sculpting the immune/inflammatory environment in the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W1989939869,"The vascular endothelium continually senses and responds to biochemical and mechanical stimuli to appropriately initiate angiogenesis. We have shown previously that fluid wall shear stress (WSS) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) cooperatively initiate the invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells into collagen matrices (Kang, H., Bayless, K. J., and Kaunas, R. (2008) Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 295, H2087–2097). Here, we investigated the role of calpains in the regulation of endothelial cell invasion in response to WSS and S1P. Calpain inhibition significantly decreased S1P- and WSS-induced invasion. Short hairpin RNA-mediated gene silencing demonstrated that calpain 1 and 2 were required for WSS and S1P-induced invasion. Also, S1P synergized with WSS to induce invasion and to activate calpains and promote calpain membrane localization. Calpain inhibition results in a cell morphology consistent with reduced matrix proteolysis. Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) has been shown by others to regulate endothelial cell invasion, prompting us to test whether calpain acted upstream of MT1-MMP. S1P and WSS synergistically activated MT1-MMP and induced cell membrane localization of MT1-MMP in a calpain-dependent manner. Calpain activation, MT1-MMP activation and MT1-MMP membrane localization were all maximal with 5.3 dynes/cm2 WSS and S1P treatment, which correlated with maximal invasion responses. Our data show for the first time that 5.3 dynes/cm2 WSS in the presence of S1P combine to activate calpains, which direct MT1-MMP membrane localization to initiate endothelial sprouting into three-dimensional collagen matrices.

Through unresolved mechanisms, deletion of functional peroxisomes from mouse hepatocytes (L-Pex5−/− mice) causes severe structural and functional abnormalities at the inner mitochondrial membrane. We now demonstrate that the peroxisomal and mitochondrial anomalies trigger energy deficits, as shown by increased AMP/ATP and decreased NAD+/NADH ratios. This causes suppression of gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis and up-regulation of glycolysis. As a consequence, L-Pex5−/− mice combust more carbohydrates resulting in lower body weights despite increased food intake. The perturbation of carbohydrate metabolism does not require a long term adaptation to the absence of functional peroxisomes as similar metabolic changes were also rapidly induced by acute elimination of Pex5 via adenoviral administration of Cre. Despite its marked activation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) was not causally involved in these metabolic perturbations, because all abnormalities still manifested when peroxisomes were eliminated in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α null background. Instead, AMP-activated kinase activation was responsible for the down-regulation of glycogen synthesis and induction of glycolysis. Remarkably, PGC-1α was suppressed despite AMP-activated kinase activation, a paradigm not previously reported, and they jointly contributed to impaired gluconeogenesis. In conclusion, lack of functional peroxisomes from hepatocytes results in marked disturbances of carbohydrate homeostasis, which are consistent with adaptations to an energy deficit. Because this is primarily due to impaired mitochondrial ATP production, these L-Pex5-deficient livers can also be considered as a model for secondary mitochondrial hepatopathies.

https://openalex.org/W2003904579,"The C-terminally-truncated human prion protein variant Y145Stop (or PrP23-144), associated with a familial prion disease, provides a valuable model for studying the fundamental properties of protein amyloids. In previous solid-state NMR experiments, we established that the β-sheet core of the PrP23-144 amyloid is composed of two β-strand regions encompassing residues ∼113-125 and ∼130-140. The former segment contains a highly conserved hydrophobic palindrome sequence, (113)AGAAAAGA(120), which has been considered essential to PrP conformational conversion. Here, we examine the role of this segment in fibrillization of PrP23-144 using a deletion variant, Δ113-120 PrP23-144, in which the palindrome sequence is missing. Surprisingly, we find that deletion of the palindrome sequence affects neither the amyloidogenicity nor the polymerization kinetics of PrP23-144, although it does alter amyloid conformation and morphology. Using two-dimensional and three-dimensional solid-state NMR methods, we find that Δ113-120 PrP23-144 fibrils contain an altered β-core extended N-terminally to residue ∼106, encompassing residues not present in the core of wild-type PrP23-144 fibrils. The C-terminal β-strand of the core, however, is similar in both fibril types. Collectively, these data indicate that amyloid cores of PrP23-144 variants contain ""essential"" (i.e. nucleation-determining) and ""nonessential"" regions, with the latter being ""movable"" in amino acid sequence space. These findings reveal an intriguing new mechanism for structural polymorphism in amyloids and suggest a potential means for modulating the physicochemical properties of amyloid fibrils without compromising their polymerization characteristics."

Notch signaling has been demonstrated to frequently participate in the process of lung carcinogenesis. Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) is a vascular-specific ligand of Notch, and has a critical role in the angiogenesis of numerous cancers. However, the role of Dll4 in the cross-talk between endothelial cells (ECs) and tumor cells remains obscure. Herein, our study revealed that Dll4-expressing ECs (EC-Dll4) significantly suppressed the proliferation of neighboring non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and attenuated the growth of NSCLC xenograft in nude mice. On the contrary, silencing endothelial Dll4 by its specific interference RNA reversed these effects of Dll4 on NSCLC cell proliferation and tumor formation. Furthermore, activation of Notch1, but not Notch2 or Notch3, was enhanced in NSCLC cells cultured with EC-Dll4, as well as in xenografts induced by a mixture of NSCLC cells and EC-Dll4. Interference of Notch1 significantly attenuated Dll4-mediated suppression of NSCLC cell proliferations, indicating that Dll4/Notch1 signaling negatively modulates the NSCLC growth. Moreover, PTEN expression in NSCLC cells was increased by EC-Dll4 or rhDll4 (recombinant human-Dll4 protein), and the induction was impaired by Notch1 interference suggesting that Dll4 could upregulate PTEN expression by Notch1. Taken together, we conclude that the cross-talk between ECs and NSCLC cells by Dll4/Notch1/PTEN signaling pathway inhibits the growth of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2071389132,"Pin1 regulates a subset of phosphoproteins by isomerizing phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro motifs via a ‘post-phosphorylation’ mechanism. Here, we characterize TR3 as a novel Pin1 substrate, and the mitogenic function of TR3 depends on Pin1-induced isomerization. There are at least three phospho-Ser-Pro motifs on TR3 that bind to Pin1. The Ser95-Pro motif of TR3 is the key site through which Pin1 enhances TR3 stability by retarding its degradation. Pin1 can also catalyze TR3 through phospho-Ser431-Pro motif, which is phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), resulting in enhanced TR3 transactivation. Furthermore, Pin1 not only facilitates TR3 targeting to the promoter of cyclin D2, a novel downstream target of TR3, but also promotes TR3 to recruit p300, thereby inducing cell proliferation. Importantly, we found that Pin1 is indispensable for TR3 to promote tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Our study thus suggests that Pin1 has an important role in cell proliferation by isomerizing TR3."

The human monoclonal antibody HC-1 recognizes a conformational epitope on the HCV E2 glycoprotein. Previous studies showed that HC-1 neutralizes most HCV genotypes but has modest potency. To improve neutralization, we affinity-matured HC-1 by constructing a library of yeast-displayed HC-1 single chain Fv (scFv) mutants, using for selection an E2 antigen from one of the poorly neutralized HCVpp. We developed an approach by parallel mutagenesis of the heavy chain variable (VH) and κ-chain variable (Vk) genes separately, then combining the optimized VH and Vk mutants. This resulted in the generation of HC-1-related scFv variants exhibiting improved affinities. The best scFv variant had a 92-fold improved affinity. After conversion to IgG1, some of the antibodies exhibited a 30-fold improvement in neutralization activity. Both surface plasmon resonance and solution kinetic exclusion analysis showed that the increase in affinity was largely due to a lowering of the dissociation rate constant, Koff. Neutralization against a panel of HCV pseudoparticles and infectious 2a HCV virus improved with the affinity-matured IgG1 antibodies. Interestingly, some of these antibodies neutralized a viral isolate that was not neutralized by wild-type HC-1. Moreover, propagating 2a HCVcc under the selective pressure of WT HC-1 or affinity-matured HC-1 antibodies yielded no viral escape mutants and, with the affinity-matured IgG1, needed 100-fold less antibody to achieve complete virus elimination. Taken together, these findings suggest that affinity-matured HC-1 antibodies are excellent candidates for therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2004782643,"CENP-W was originally identified as a putative oncogene, cancer-upregulated gene 2 (CUG2) that was commonly up-regulated in many cancer tissues. Recently, CENP-W has also been identified as a new centromeric component that interacts with CENP-T. As a complex with CENP-T, CENP-W plays crucial roles in assembly of the functional kinetochore complex. In this study, the subnuclear localization of CENP-W was extensively analyzed using various approaches. We found that ectopically expressed CENP-W primarily accumulated in the nucleolus and remained substantially associated with the nucleolus in stable cells. The following fractionation study also showed that CENP-W is associated with RNA as well as DNA. Moreover, a considerable amount of CENP-W was found in the nuclear mesh-like structure, nuclear matrix, possibly indicating that CENP-W participates in diverse subnuclear activities. Finally, biochemical affinity binding analysis revealed that CENP-W specifically interacts with the nucleolar phosphoprotein, nucleophosmin (B23). Depletion of cellular B23 by siRNA treatment induced a dramatic decrease of CENP-W stability and severe mislocalization during prophase. Our data proposed that B23 may function in the assembly of the kinetochore complex by interacting with CENP-W during interphase."
https://openalex.org/W2077576278,"Enzymological paradigms have shifted recently to acknowledge the biological importance of catalytic promiscuity. However, catalytic promiscuity is a poorly understood property, and no thermodynamic treatment has described the conformational landscape of promiscuous versus substrate-specific enzymes. Here, two structurally similar glutathione transferase (GST, glutathione S-transferase) isoforms with high specificity or high promiscuity are compared. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates a reversible low temperature transition for the promiscuous GSTA1-1 that is not observed with substrate-specific GSTA4-4. This transition is assigned to rearrangement of the C terminus at the active site of GSTA1-1 based on the effects of ligands and mutations. Near-UV and far-UV circular dichroism indicate that this transition is due to repacking of tertiary contacts with the remainder of the subunit, rather than ""unfolding"" of the C terminus per se. Analysis of the DSC data using a modified Landau theory indicates that the local conformational landscape of the active site of GSTA1-1 is smooth, with barrierless transitions between states. The partition function of the C-terminal states is a broad unimodal distribution at all temperatures within this DSC transition. In contrast, the remainder of the GSTA1-1 subunit and the GSTA4-4 protein exhibit folded and unfolded macrostates with a significant energy barrier separating them. Their partition function includes a sharp unimodal distribution of states only at temperatures that yield either folded or unfolded macrostates. At intermediate temperatures the partition function includes a bimodal distribution. The barrierless rearrangement of the GSTA1-1 active site within a local smooth energy landscape suggests a thermodynamic basis for catalytic promiscuity."
https://openalex.org/W1999833640,"Genetic ablations of p73 have shown its implication in the development of the nervous system. However, the relative contribution of ΔNp73 and TAp73 isoforms in neuronal functions is still unclear. In this study, we have analyzed the expression of these isoforms during neuronal death induced by alteration of the amyloid-β precursor protein function or cisplatin. We observed a concomitant up-regulation of a TAp73 isoform and a down-regulation of a ΔNp73 isoform. The shift in favor of the pro-apoptotic isoform correlated with an induction of the p53/p73 target genes such as Noxa. At a functional level, we showed that TAp73 induced neuronal death and that ΔNp73 has a neuroprotective role toward amyloid-β precursor protein alteration or cisplatin. We investigated the mechanisms of p73 expression and found that the TAp73 expression was regulated at the promoter level. In contrast, regulation of ΔNp73 protein levels was regulated by phosphorylation at residue 86 and multiple proteases. Thus, this study indicates that tight transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms regulate the p73 isoform ratios that play an important role in neuronal survival. Genetic ablations of p73 have shown its implication in the development of the nervous system. However, the relative contribution of ΔNp73 and TAp73 isoforms in neuronal functions is still unclear. In this study, we have analyzed the expression of these isoforms during neuronal death induced by alteration of the amyloid-β precursor protein function or cisplatin. We observed a concomitant up-regulation of a TAp73 isoform and a down-regulation of a ΔNp73 isoform.

Given that over 50% of human tumors exhibit mutations or inactivation of p53 (1Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), this gene has been extensively studied for its major role in tumor suppression. DNA damage, oncogene activation, and also various other cellular stresses (hypoxia, radical oxidized species production, etc.) increase p53 protein levels leading to cell growth arrest or apoptosis through up-regulation of its target genes (p21, Bax, GADD 45, MDM2, or DR5 (2Menendez D. Inga A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 724-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar)). Beside its tumor suppressor gene function, p53 plays a role in other physiological or pathological situations. In the nervous system, p53 has been shown to participate in terminal neuronal maturation as well as neuronal apoptosis (3Eizenberg O. Faber-Elman A. Gottlieb E. Oren M. Rotter V. Schwartz M. Mol.

More recently, p63 and p73, two homologs of p53, have been identified (16Arrowsmith C.H. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similarly to p53, these genes play important roles in the embryonic development of various organs (brain, skin, limb, immune system, etc.). In particular, p73−/− mice exhibit defects in the nervous system, notably in the hippocampus and the olfactory bulbs (17Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Analysis of the contribution of p73 to neuronal differentiation and apoptosis is complicated by the existence of multiple isoforms. These isoforms vary in their C terminus due to alternative splicing (TAp73α, -β, -δ, and -γ) or in their N terminus due to alternate promoter usage that skips an N-terminal transactivation domain (ΔNp73α and -β) (18De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 19Casciano I. Ponzoni M. Lo Cunsolo C. Tonini G.P. Romani M. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 391-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). TAp73s are transcription factors with positive or negative effects on gene expression (20Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dötsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol.

ΔNp73 isoforms, which lack the N-terminal transactivation domain (TA), 6The abbreviations used are: TAtransactivation domainAPPamyloid-β precursor proteinMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideCDKcyclin-dependent kinaseAICDamyloid precursor protein intracellular cytoplasmic/C-terminal domain. were shown to exert a dominant inhibitory effect on the full-length isoforms. TAp73 isoforms induce neuronal differentiation in SYH5 cells (22De Laurenzi V. Raschellá G. Barcaroli D. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Ranalli M. Catani M.V. Tanno B. Costanzo A. Levrero M. Melino G.

More recently, a complex regulation of p73 and p63 has also been identified in cortical neurons following ischemia, with TAp73 being down-regulated while TAp63 is induced (26Bui T. Sequeira J. Wen T.C. Sola A. Higashi Y. Kondoh H. Genetta T. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4e4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). transactivation domain amyloid-β precursor protein 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide cyclin-dependent kinase amyloid precursor protein intracellular cytoplasmic/C-terminal domain. Neuronal apoptosis has been proposed to be a part of the processes involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Alzheimer, Parkinson, or even neuropathy following anticancer treatments. Alzheimer disease is characterized by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-β plaques resulting from mutations in the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) or the γ-secretases, PS1 and PS2. Interestingly, p73 expression is increased in neurons from Alzheimer patients, and the TAp73 isoforms are induced by treatment with the amyloid-β peptide (27Wilson C. Henry S. Smith M.A. Bowser R. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2004; 30: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Li Q. Athan E.S. Wei M. Yuan E. Rice S.L. Vonsattel J.P. Mayeux R.P. Tycko B. BMC Med. Genet. 2004; 5: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has also recently been shown that the deletion of the p73 gene favors neuronal aging and the appearance of Tau phosphorylation, a characteristic of Alzheimer disease (29Wetzel M.K. Naska S. Laliberté C.L. Rymar V.V. Fujitani M. Biernaskie J.A. Cole C.J. Lerch J.P. Spring S. Wang S.H. Frankland P.W. Henkelman R.M. Josselyn S.A. Sadikot A.F. Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 2008; 59: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that p73 may be playing a role in the neuronal apoptosis induced by alteration of the APP processing. To clarify the role of the p73 gene in the regulation of the balance between survival and apoptosis in neurons, we undertook a comparative study of the TAp73 and ΔNp73 isoforms in primary cultures of neurons submitted to activation of the β-amyloid polypeptide precursor and cisplatin, a DNA-damaging drug. Using these models, we previously showed a regulation of MDMX and MDM2, two proteins that control p53 and p73 activity (30Benosman S. Gross I. Clarke N. Jochemsen A.G. Okamoto K. Loeffler J.P. Gaiddon C. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The data obtained here clearly indicate that both p73 isoforms exert opposite effects on neuronal survival. Furthermore, we found that the ratio between the two types of isoforms was altered by a variety of neurotoxic insults, including the activation of the APP pathway. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to tight regulation of this ratio, critical for neuronal survival. Cortical neurons were dissected from E16 murine embryos as described previously (30Benosman S. Gross I. Clarke N. Jochemsen A.G. Okamoto K. Loeffler J.P. Gaiddon C. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, after enzymatic and mechanical dissociation, cells were plated at a density of 500 cells/mm2 on 0.1 mg/ml polyornithine precoated culture dishes and were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air). Plating culture medium contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen), 100 nm insulin (Invitrogen), and 50 mg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen). 48 h after plating, cells were switched to defined medium containing DMEM supplemented with 10 nm insulin, 100 mg/ml human transferrin, 60 mm putrescine, 30 nm sodium selenite, and 50 mg/ml gentamycin. Neurons were considered as immature up to 2 days after plating and as mature 5 days after plating. N2A cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured in 96-well culture dishes (Costar). A modified procedure of the original method (31Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46230) Google Scholar) was used to measure mitochondrial activity (MTT assay) as described previously (32Meng X. Leyva M.L. Jenny M. Gross I. Benosman S. Fricker B. Harlepp S. Hebraud P. Boos A. Wlosik P. Bischoff P. Sirlin C. Pfeffer M. Loeffler J.P. Gaiddon C. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5458-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were rinsed with DMEM and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in freshly prepared culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of MTT (Sigma). Medium was then removed, and dark blue crystals formed during reaction were dissolved by adding 100 μl/well of 0.04 m HCl in isopropyl alcohol. Plates were stirred at room temperature to ensure that all crystals were dissolved and read on a Bio-Rad 680 micro-ELISA plate reader, using a test wavelength of 490 nm and a nonspecific wavelength of 650 nm for background absorbency. Results are given as percentage of survival, taking cultures grown in HK medium as 100%. HA-TAp73β and HA-ΔNp73β expression vectors were described previously (33Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Gross I.

Okamoto (Cancer Center, Tokyo). pCMV HA-JNK was kindly provided by Dr. Ron Prywes. pcDNA constructs encoding CDK1 or CDK2 proteins were a gift from Dr. S. van den Heuvel. pCMV-HA ΔNp73β T86A was generated using the Stratagene PCR mutagenesis kit. CMV wild type APP, APP KM670/671NL (APPSW), AICD, PS1, and PS1 A79V (PS1μt) were generated by RT-PCR and subcloned in pcDNA3 vector and site-directed mutagenesis. pBax-Luc has been described (34Sohm F. Gaiddon C. Antoine M. Boutillier A.L. Loeffler J.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2762-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). pBax-min-Luc was kindly provided by Dr. C. DiComo (Aureon Biosciences) and contains a duplex oligonucleotide encoding the p53-responsive cis-acting element from bax, cloned upstream from the minimal c-fos promoter (−53 to +42) in pGL3-OFLUC. The DR5 promoter reporter plasmid was obtained from Dr. T. Sakai (Kyoto, Japan). The Noxa luciferase construct was a generous gift of Dr. Tanigushi (Tokyo, Japan). Stealth siRNA annealed duplexes were obtained from Invitrogen and targeted the following 5′ to 3′ DNA sequences: siTAp73#1, GCCATCCGAAACACCAATGAGTACA; siTap73#2, GCAGGAAAGGACTCATGAAATCATA; siCt, sequence control GC 50% (Invitrogen). Cotransfection experiments with siRNA and GFP-expressing plasmid were performed as described previously (35Gross I. Armant O. Benosman S. de Aguilar J.L. Freund J.N. Kedinger M. Licht J.D. Gaiddon C. Loeffler J.P. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1802-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by a polyethyleneimine-based protocol as described previously (36René F. Monnier D. Gaiddon C. Félix J.M. Loeffler J.P. Neuroendocrinology. 1996; 64: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FBS and transfected with various amounts of DNA. DNA and polyethyleneimine (0.33 μl of 0.1 m/μg DNA) were mixed and added to the cells. Plates were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min and placed in the incubator for 1 h, after which fresh medium was added. For luciferase assays, cells were seeded in 12-well, 3.8-cm2 plates and transfected with the expression vectors (200 ng of each) and the reporter constructs (250 ng of each). Luciferase activity was measured in each well 24 h later, and results were normalized with a CMV-driven reporter gene. Neurons were grown on coverslips coated with polyornithine in 24-well plates. Cells were cotransfected with the expression vectors (200 ng/well), siRNA (50 nm), and the GFP expression vector (50 ng/well) as described previously (35Gross I. Armant O. Benosman S. de Aguilar J.L. Freund J.N. Kedinger M. Licht J.D. Gaiddon C. Loeffler J.P. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1802-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were treated or not for 18 h with the neurotoxic agents. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After two washes, cells were incubated for 10 min with the Hoechst nuclei staining agent (1 μg/ml). GFP-positive cells were then observed with a microscope to assess the morphology of the nuclei and the neurites. Neurons were lysed as described previously (37Gaiddon C. de Tapia M. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in 150 μl of lysis buffer (TEGN: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors (Sigma)), sonicated for 30 s, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 12 min. Protein concentrations were determined using a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Sample buffer (38Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984Google Scholar) was added to 20–75 μg of proteins, and samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min followed by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). CO73A and TA73A were produced and purified using a differential purification with peptides located in the N-terminal part and in the core domain. Bax was detected with the anti-Bax (N20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:2000) and DR5 with the anti-DR5 (M20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200) antibodies. Actin detection was done with an anti-actin antibody from Dr. Aunis (Strasbourg, France). Neurons or N2A cells were plated in 6-cm diameter plates and treated in duplicates or triplicates subsequently mixed. N2A cells were transfected with ΔNp73β expression vectors, and after 48 h cells were harvested. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (TEGN: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 5 mm PMSF, 100 μm benzamidine, 300 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml bacitracin, 100 μg/ml, α-macroglobulin, and phosphatase inhibitors (cocktails I and II, Sigma)), and the extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 12 min to remove cell debris. p73 proteins (400–750 μg of whole cell extract) were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 3 h with 30 μl of 50% slurry protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked to an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) or with a mixture of protein A-Sepharose beads and anti-pan p73 antibody. After incubation, the samples were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). For immunoblotting, the excess of liquid was aspirated, and 35 μl of sample buffer was added to the beads before heating at 95 °C for 3 min. After centrifugation (3 min at 13,000 rpm), samples were separated by electrophoresis through 10% SDS-PAGE. For in vitro phosphorylation, dried beads were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing radioactive γ-ATP and the immunopurified cyclin A-CDK1 complex. After a 30-min incubation period at 37 °C, beads were washed, resuspended in sample buffer, heated, and loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE. For in-tube degradation assay, immunoprecipitation of ΔNp73 proteins was done in the absence of protease inhibitors, and purified p73 proteins were incubated 2 h with extracts from neurons prepared in TEGN buffer in the absence of protease inhibitors. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). For HA detection, the 16B12 monoclonal HA antibody (Babco, 1 mg/ml) was used at 1:1000. Thr-86 phosphorylation was followed by an antigen-purified phospho-Thr-86 p73 rabbit polyclonal antibody used at a dilution of 1:1000 (33Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Gross I. Levasseur D. Taya Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27421-27431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). p73 detection was performed with the mouse monoclonal ER15 (New England Biolabs), the rabbit polyclonal PAN (CO73A), or the rabbit polyclonal specific for TAp73 isoforms (TA73A) antibodies. CO73A and TA73A were produced and purified using a differential purification with peptides located in the N-terminal part and in the core domain. Bax was detected with the anti-Bax (N20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:2000) and DR5 with the anti-DR5 (M20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200) antibodies. Actin detection was done with an anti-actin antibody from Dr. Aunis (Strasbourg, France). Proteins were then visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were grown in 6-well plates. After treatment, cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen kit and treated with DNase (RQ1 RNase-free DNase, Promega). Reverse transcriptions were performed with 1 μg of RNA using the IScript kit (Bio-Rad). The IQ SYBR Green supermix kit (Bio-Rad) was used for real time PCRs. For each gene analyzed, a standard curve (from 2 to 0.032 μl) was done with a mix of all RT reactions. Based on this curve, 0.5 μl of RT reaction was analyzed for each condition with all sets of oligonucleotides (250 nm). Real time PCR protocol included in all experiments a melting curve that assessed the specificity of the products. Data were taken in account only if the efficiency was between 85 and 105% and if the percentage of correlation (r) was better than 0.995. Real time PCRs and analysis were performed on an ICycler (Bio-Rad). The following primers were used: mouse ΔNp73 (forward, TGC CTG GCC CTG TCT TTG; reverse, CAG CTC CAG CAT GAG TGC); mouse TAp73 (forward, TGG CCT CTC TTG GCC TCC AAC TTG T; reverse, TTG ACC AGG CCT TGG AGA GCT C); mouse TBP (forward, CTT CGT GCA AGA AAT GCT GA; reverse, CCC ACC ATG TTC TGG ATC TT); mouse Noxa (forward, CAG ATG CCT GGG AAG TCG; reverse, TGA GCA CAC TCG TCC TTC AA); mouse Bax (forward, ATG CGT CCA CCA AGA AGC TGA; reverse, AGC AAT CAT CCT CTG CAG CTC C); mouse DR5 (forward, GTC CAG CTG GCC TAC AGC; reverse, GCT TGC AGT TCC CTT CTG AC). Cells were fixed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and quenched with 0.125 m glycine for 5 min. ChIP experiments were carried out using the EZ-Magna ChIPTM chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Millipore). Sheared cross-linked chromatin from ∼106 cells was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of mouse anti-CHOP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or preimmune mouse IgG (Millipore). Input corresponds to nonimmunoprecipitated sheared cross-linked chromatin from ∼105 cells (1%). PCR analysis was performed with 1/25th of immunoprecipitated DNA as template and primers of the mouse Noxa promoter (forward, GAA GTT TCC CTC CCA CCT TC; reverse, GAC GTC ATG TGA CGA CAT CC). To analyze the potential contribution of the p73 gene to neuronal apoptosis, we first examined the expression of its isoforms following neurotoxic treatments in primary cultures of murine cortical neurons. These neurons were treated with either the DNA-damaging drug cisplatin, which causes neuropathy and has already been shown to induce p73 expression (39Kedar A. Cohen M.E. Freeman A.I. Cancer Treat. Rep. 1978; 62: 819-821PubMed Google Scholar, 40Steeghs N. de Jongh F.E. Sillevis Smitt P.A. van den Bent M.J.

Loeffler J.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 19: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both of these treatments induced neuronal cell death as revealed by an MTT test (Fig. 1A) or by detection of the active fragment of caspase 3 (p20, Fig. 1B). Under the same conditions, we monitored by Western blot the protein levels of p73 after 1, 6, and 18 h of treatment using new polyclonal antibodies that we had generated to detect the various isoforms of p73. The antibody TA73A was raised against a peptide located in the N-terminal part of the TAp73 isoforms. The antibody CO73A was raised against a peptide sequence of the core domain of the p73 proteins common to the TA and the ΔN isoforms (see supplemental data 1). In mouse cortical neurons, the TA73A antibody detected a signal around 65 kDa corresponding to TAp73β, whereas the CO73A antibody revealed a band migrating slightly below corresponding to ΔNp73β (Fig. 1B and supplemental data 1). The lack of detection of the TA isoforms by the CO73A antibody might be due to its weaker sensitivity (as observed with the commercial ER15 antibody) toward the TA isoforms (supplemental data #1). Other p73 isoforms (TAp73α, -δ, and -γ and ΔNp73α), which display noticeable size difference with TAp73β and ΔNp73β, were not detected in mouse cortical neurons, and immunoblotting with commercial antibodies also suggested that these cells mostly express the β isoforms of p73 (Fig. 1B and supplemental data). As reported in cancer cells, cisplatin increased TAp73β protein levels (44Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3041-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Treatment with the APP-directed antibody also led to an increase of protein levels of TAp73β. In contrast, ΔNp73β protein levels progressively decreased upon both neurotoxic treatments (Fig. 1B). This set of experiments indicates that in cortical neurons the respective levels of the TA and ΔN p73β isoforms are inversely regulated upon various neurotoxic stresses, including those associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the balance between the p73 isoforms induced (TA) and down-regulated (ΔN) isoforms shifts toward a probable activation of the p53/p73 target genes in neurons. To test the possibility that a shift between the TA and the ΔN p73 isoforms might lead to the induction of p53/p73 target genes, we followed the expression of such genes involved in apoptosis, namely Noxa, Bax, and DR5 (47Kiryu-Seo S. Hirayama T. Kato R. Kiyama H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 48Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell.

Indeed, protein levels as well as mRNA levels of the three genes progressively increased after treatment with the APP-directed antibody (Fig. 1, C and D). Transcriptional activities of reporter genes containing the Noxa, Bax, or the DR5 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene were also stimulated by the APP-directed antibody (Figs. 1, E and F, and 2A). APP-dependent neuronal apoptosis has been linked to mutations in the APP or its processing proteases, the γ-secretase presenilins (50Pardo L.M. van Duijn C.M. Mutat. Res. 2005; 592: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These mutations have been found in patients with early onset familial Alzheimer disease. To confirm that the alteration of the APP function leads to activation of these genes, we expressed in cortical neurons mutated version of the APP (K670N/M67L, APPSW) and presenilin 1 (A79V, PS1μt) proteins (51Brouwers N. Sleegers K. Van Broeckhoven C. Ann. Med. 2008; 40: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The mutations correspond to the ones found in familial Alzheimer disease. As expected, expression of the mutated APP and presenilin proteins induced the promoter activity of Noxa, Bax, and DR5 (Figs. 1, E and F, and. 2A and supplemental data 4). Similar results were obtained with a minimal synthetic reporter gene (p53 min Luc, Fig. 2C), suggesting that the p53 response element mediated the induction seen by alteration of the APP function. Accordingly, no stimulation was observed when the p53-binding sites of the Noxa promoter were mutated (Fig. 2B). To further confirm that alteration of the APP function in cortical neurons induced Noxa expression through p73 activation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using the TA73A antibody. As shown on Fig. 2D, treatment of cortical neurons with the APP Ab led to an increased binding of TAp73 to the Noxa promoter. The ability of p73 to stimulate the No"

The regulated turnover of triacylglyceride in LDs provides fatty acids for mitochondrial β-oxidation and ATP generation in physiological states of high demand for energy. The mechanisms for the formation of LDs in conditions of energy excess are not entirely understood. Fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2 (FIT2/FITM2) is the anciently conserved member of the fat storage-inducing transmembrane family of proteins implicated to be important in the formation of LDs, but its role in energy metabolism has not been tested. Here, we report that expression of FIT2 in mouse skeletal muscle had profound effects on muscle energy metabolism. Mice with skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of FIT2 (CKF2) had significantly increased intramyocellular triacylglyceride and complete protection from high fat diet-induced weight gain due to increased energy expenditure. Mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling suggested that CKF2 skeletal muscle had increased oxidation of branched chain amino acids but decreased oxidation of fatty acids. Glucose was primarily utilized in CKF2 muscle for synthesis of the glycerol backbone of triacylglyceride and not for glycogen production. CKF2 muscle was ATP-deficient and had activated AMP kinase. Together, these studies indicate that FIT2 expression in skeletal muscle plays an unexpected function in regulating muscle energy metabolism and indicates an important role for lipid droplet formation in this process.

Together, these studies indicate that FIT2 expression in skeletal muscle plays an unexpected function in regulating muscle energy metabolism and indicates an important role for lipid droplet formation in this process. The maintenance of energy expenditure in mammals involves the dynamic integration of two metabolically opposed states, fasting and feeding. Fasting involves the induction of catabolic, or ATP generating pathways, whereas feeding engages anabolic or ATP-consuming pathways that build carbon skeletons and store energy. The integration of these states is governed by endocrine signals, such as insulin and glucagon, nutrient signals such as long chain fatty acids and branched chain amino acids, adipose and gut-derived polypeptide hormones, such as leptin and Glp-1, and nutrient-sensing kinases, such as AMPK 2The abbreviations used are: AMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseLDlipid dropletBCAAbranched chain amino acidTAGtriacylglycerideATGLadipose triacylglyceride lipasePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorGTTglucose tolerance testITTinsulin tolerance testSCstandard chowEDLextensor digitorum longusHFhigh fatRQrespiratory quotientIMTGintramyocellular triacylglycerideDGATacyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferaseACCacetyl-CoA carboxylase. and mammalian target of rapamycin. One peripheral tissue that plays an important role in energy metabolism is skeletal muscle, because it comprises a large percentage of the organism's mass and is the major site of glucose disposal and fatty acid and amino acid catabolism. Changes in the efficiency of substrate utilization or in the type of substrate used by skeletal muscle might affect energy balance. For example, enhancing the cataplerosis of the TCA cycle in skeletal muscle by overexpression of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase resulted in mice with increased mitochondria activity and leanness (1Hakimi P. Yang J. Casadesus G. Massillon D. Tolentino-Silva F. Nye C.K. Cabrera M.E. Hagen D.R. Utter C.B. Baghdy Y. Johnson D.H. Wilson D.L. Kirwan J.P. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

Similarly, deficiency of the mitochondrial branched chain amino acid aminotransferase isozyme (BCAT2) resulted in enhanced energy expenditure (2She P. Reid T.M. Bronson S.K. Vary T.C. Hajnal A.

An anabolic pathway important for the maintenance of energy balance is the storage of triacylglycerides (TAG) in cells. TAG is the primary energy reservoir in most eukaryotes that is stored in structures called cytosolic lipid droplets (LD) (3Wolins N.E. Brasaemle D.L. Bickel P.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Fatty acids stored as TAG are important for ATP production in many tissues, such as skeletal muscle, during physiological stresses such as exercise (4Kiens B. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 205-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 5van Loon L.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 97: 1170-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6Watt M.J. Heigenhauser G.J.

However, excessive accumulation of TAG-rich lipid droplets in tissues such as adipose, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (8Savage D.B. Petersen K.F. Shulman G.I. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The ability to store energy in the form of TAG-rich lipid droplets is evolutionarily conserved from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to humans (9Greenberg A.S. Coleman R.A. Kraemer F.B. McManaman J.L. Obin M.S. Puri V. Yan Q.W. Miyoshi H. Mashek D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2102-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). TAG-rich LDs are composed of a monolayer of phospholipids surrounding the TAG core and a unique proteome that associates with the surface of LDs (9Greenberg A.S. Coleman R.A. Kraemer F.B.

A common theme in the turnover of TAG from LD in many mammalian tissues is the regulation of lipase action involving perilipin proteins that is coordinated with the energy demands of the cell (9Greenberg A.S. Coleman R.A. Kraemer F.B. McManaman J.L. Obin M.S. Puri V. Yan Q.W. Miyoshi H. Mashek D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 2102-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 11Brasaemle D.L. J.

Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 3-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The formation of TAG LDs might also be coordinated with the energy demands of the cell. TAG-rich LDs form at the endoplasmic reticulum and require the enzymatic activity of the endoplasmic reticulum-resident membrane proteins diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and 2 in mammals (13Harris C.A. Haas J.T. Streeper R.S. Stone S.J. Kumari M. Yang K. Han X. Brownell N. Gross R.W. Zechner R. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid Res. 2011; 52: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The process of LD formation and regulation of LD formation downstream of DGAT activity are poorly understood. Our laboratory has recently identified a two-gene family of evolutionarily conserved proteins that are important in the partitioning of newly synthesized triacylglyceride into lipid droplets, which we named fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 1 and 2 (FITM1/FIT1 and FITM2/FIT2) (14Kadereit B. Kumar P. Wang W.J. Miranda D. Snapp E.L. Severina N. Torregroza I. Evans T. Silver D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fat storage-inducing transmembrane proteins have six transmembrane domains and reside exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum (14Kadereit B. Kumar P. Wang W.J. Miranda D. Snapp E.L. Severina N. Torregroza I. Evans T. Silver D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Gross D.A. Snapp E.L. Silver D.L. PLoS One. 2010; 5e10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). FIT2 is the anciently conserved fat storage-inducing transmembrane family member and is ubiquitously expressed at low levels in mammalian tissues with highest expression in white adipose tissue. This expression profile of FIT2 raises the possibility that FIT2 may play a role in TAG storage in “long term” fat depots like adipose tissue, as opposed to the more rapidly turning over TAG-LDs in muscle (5van Loon L.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 97: 1170-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 16Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of FIT2 in mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo resulted in TAG LD accumulation. The process of TAG LD accumulation was found to be through the partitioning of newly synthesized TAG into LD without an increase in TAG biosynthesis. Conversely, knockdown of FIT2 in pre-adipocyte NIH 3T3-L1 cells reduced the size and number of LDs, indicating that FIT2 plays an important role in lipid droplet formation but not TAG biosynthesis. The distinct tissue distribution pattern of FIT1 and FIT2 raises the idea that FIT2, being highly expressed in adipose, is primarily involved in the generation of large lipid droplets for long term storage of triacylglycerides, whereas FIT1 is important for generating small lipid droplets involved in the rapid mobilization of triacylglycerides during increased ATP demand. We took advantage of the unique biochemical function of FIT2 in LD formation to examine the effects of FIT2 expression and TAG-LDs on muscle energy metabolism. Here, we report that muscle-specific overexpression of FIT2 resulted in robust reprogramming of skeletal muscle metabolism whereby reduced metabolic efficiency resulted in increased energy expenditure and decreased energy charge. The data indicate that FIT2 plays an important role in regulating energy expenditure through modulating TAG storage. The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used for these studies: p-AKT, p-AMPK, AMPK, p-glycogen synthase, glycogen synthase, p-GSK3B, GSK3B, p-ACC, ACC, LC3B (Cell Signaling), Glut1 (Abcam), myoglobin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), OXPAT (Novus Biologicals), anti-calnexin (Sigma), and mouse monoclonal AKT (Cell Signaling). Mouse FIT2 cDNA was cloned downstream of the mouse creatine kinase promoter for use in transgenesis. CKF2 mice were backcrossed for 10 generations to C57BL/6J. All experiments were conducted using 2–3-month-old male transgenic and WT littermates. Study protocols were approved by the Institute of Animal Studies of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Mice were fed a standard chow (LabDiet number 5058) or high fat diet (Research Diets, Inc., number D12492) composed of 60 kcal % fat for the indicated amount of time. Body weight was monitored weekly during the study period. Prior to GTT or ITT, mice were fasted overnight for 12 h with ad libitum access to water and then administered glucose (1 g/kg) or insulin (1 unit/kg) intraperitoneally, respectively. Blood glucose was measured in blood samples collected from tail vain using a glucometer (Accu-Check Compact, Roche Applied Science). C2C12 myocytes were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. For differentiation, C2C12 cell were induced at 80–90% confluency by switching the cell media to DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (differentiation media). On day 5 of differentiation, C2C12 were infected for 12 h in differentiation media. All experiments were performed 36 h post-infection. C2C12 cells were differentiated in 6-well plates and infected with empty or C-terminal tagged FIT2 (FIT2-V5) adenovirus as described above. For fatty acid oxidation, differentiation media was then replaced with 1 ml of low glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 μm [3H]palmitic acid/BSA (0.4 μCi/ml) and 1 μm l-carnitine. After 4 h, media was collected and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min in a table top centrifuge to remove cellular debris. 100 μl of media was then treated with 900 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5% w/v activated charcoal (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature to absorb fatty acids. Samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. 200 μl of the supernatant was used to determine fatty acid oxidation by measuring tritiated water using a scintillation counter and normalized to total protein. BCAA oxidation was performed in C2C12 myotubes expressing FIT2-V5 cultured in 6-well plates using a pulse-chase method. C2C12 myotubes were pulsed for 30 min with DMEM 5% horse serum supplemented with [3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml). After 30 min, C2C12 myotubes were extensively washed with Krebs-Henseleit buffer and then chased for 4 h with Krebs-Henseleit buffer supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 10 mm leucine, and 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA. After 4 h, media was collected and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min in a table top centrifuge to remove cellular debris. 500 μl of media was then treated with 500 μl of 6% perchloric acid for 30 min at room temperature to precipitate protein. Samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. 200 μl of the supernatant was used to determine BCAA oxidation by measuring tritiated water using a scintillation counter and normalized to total protein. For glucose uptake, C2C12 myotubes were starved in low glucose DMEM for 2 h, then washed twice with KRPH buffer (5 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl), and incubated for 20 min in 2 ml of KRPH buffer supplemented with 5 μm 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 1 mCi/ml 2-[3H]deoxy-d-glucose, plus or minus 100 nm insulin. After 20 min, C2C12 myotubes were washed extensively with PBS buffer and lysed with 1 ml of RIPA buffer supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem). Glucose uptake was determined by measuring 800 μl of lysate using a scintillation counter and normalized to total protein. C2C12 myocytes were differentiated in 25-mm glass bottom dishes (Wilco) and infected with empty or C-terminally tagged FIT2 (FIT2-V5) adenovirus as described above. Visualization of LDs in C2C12 cells were performed as described previously using BODIPY 493/503 (15Gross D.A. Snapp E.L. Silver D.L. PLoS One. 2010; 5e10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Metabolic measurements (oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, food intake, and physical activity) were obtained continuously using a CLAMS (Columbus Instruments) open-circuit indirect calorimetry system for 5 consecutive days and normalized to lean body mass. Mice were allowed to acclimate for 2 days in individual chambers prior to data collection. Mitochondria isolation and mitochondrial ATP production rate were performed as described previously with some modifications (17Wibom R. Lundin A. Hultman E. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1990; 50: 143-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 mg of quadriceps was homogenized in 800 μl of Buffer A (100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm ATP, and 1 mm EDTA) plus EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and spun down at 1,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then spun down at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was then washed in 800 μl of Buffer A and spun down at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer B (180 mm sucrose, 35 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm EDTA) plus protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Mitochondria lysates were then diluted 1:500 in Buffer B and immediately used to determine maximal mitochondrial ATP production rate using the following substrates for oxidation: 10 mm glutamate plus 1 mm malate and 35 mm ADP (state 3 respiration). ATP production was monitored using the ENLITEN® ATP bioluminescence detection kit (Promega). All reactions were conducted simultaneously at 25 °C for 25 min in a 200-μl reaction volume using 10 μl of diluted mitochondria protein, 100 μl of the luciferase/luciferin reagent, and substrates for oxidation plus or minus ADP (state 2 respiration). Mitochondrial ATP production rate was normalized to total protein. Blood glucose was measured under fasting conditions in blood samples collected from tail vein using a glucometer (Accu-Check Compact, Roche Applied Science). Plasma insulin levels were measured under fasting conditions and after treating mice with 1 g/kg glucose intraperitoneally using ELISA (Millipore). Total serum ketone bodies and lactate were determined using a colorimetric assay (Stanbio and Bioassays). Total serum triacylglyceride and cholesterol levels were measured using a colorimetric assay (Infinity). DGAT activity was determined using microsomes isolated from quadriceps as described previously (18Levin M.C. Monetti M. Watt M.J. Sajan M.P. Stevens R.D. Bain J.R. Newgard C.B. Farese Sr., R.V. Farese Jr., R.V. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E1772-E1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TAG was separated by TLC and quantified as described previously (15Gross D.A. Snapp E.L. Silver D.L. PLoS One. 2010; 5e10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mice were fasted for 4 h and injected intraperitoneally with universally labeled d-[14C]glucose (310 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and insulin at 2,500 μCi/kg and 1 unit/kg, respectively. Quadriceps were collected and freeze-clamped 15 min post-injection, homogenized in 1 ml of PBS, and spun down 16,000 × g at 4 °C. 50 μl of the resulting supernatant was used for scintillation counting to determine total glucose uptake. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Lipids were then extracted from 1 mg of protein and TAG separated by TLC as described previously (15Gross D.A. Snapp E.L. Silver D.L. PLoS One. 2010; 5e10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Radioactive TAGs were quantified by using PhosphorImager analysis and represented as a rate of d-[14C]glucose incorporated into TAG (arbitrary units obtained from PhosphorImager analysis) per mg of protein normalized to total glucose uptake. Muscle glycogen content was determined in WT and CKF2 quadriceps as described previously (19Vaitheesvaran B. LeRoith D. Kurland I.J. Diabetologia. 2010; 53: 2224-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Ex vivo basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport was performed using extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle as described previously (20Chadt A. Leicht K. Deshmukh A. Jiang L.Q. Scherneck S. Bernhardt U. Dreja T. Vogel H. Schmolz K. Kluge R. Zierath J.R. Hultschig C. Hoeben R.C. Schürmann A. Joost H.G. Al-Hasani H. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Quadriceps were elongated, placed on cork, covered with OCT, and frozen in pre-chilled 2-methylbutane. Samples were then sectioned and stained for neutral lipids using Oil Red-O. Lipids were extracted from 1 mg of protein isolated from WT and CKF2 quadriceps using chloroform/methanol (2:1). The organic phase was transferred to glass bottom tubes and dried down under a stream of nitrogen. Total TAG was then quantified using TLC as described previously (15Gross D.A. Snapp E.L. Silver D.L. PLoS One. 2010; 5e10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TAG was quantified from C2C12 myotubes cultured in 6-well plates as described previously (15Gross D.A. Snapp E.L. Silver D.L. PLoS One. 2010; 5e10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from mouse quadriceps RNA using SuperScript III first strand cDNA synthesis kit and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). Gene expression analysis was assessed by quantitative SYBER Green real time PCR using a 7300 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Primers were obtained from Invitrogen; sequences are available upon request. Relative quantification of each target was normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. HPLC-based nucleotide analysis was performed on freeze-clamped quadriceps as described previously (21Ellis J.M. Mentock S.M. Depetrillo M.A. Koves T.R. Sen S. Watkins S.M. Muoio D.M. Cline G.W. Taegtmeyer H. Shulman G.I. Willis M.S. Coleman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1252-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry-based metabolite profiling was performed following a 4-h fast as described previously (22Koves T.R. Ussher J.R. Noland R.C. Slentz D. Mosedale M. Ilkayeva O. Bain J. Stevens R. Dyck J.R. Newgard C.B. Lopaschuk G.D. Muoio D.M. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). Tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer plus EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce), and 80 μg of protein were used per sample. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8, 12, or 15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated with indicated antibodies. Quantification of signals was performed using an Odyssey infrared scanner (Li-Cor). All quantitative data are represented as mean ± S.E. p values were generated by Student's t test. To examine the effects of FIT2 overexpression in skeletal muscle, we generated muscle-specific FIT2 transgenic mice (CKF2) by using the mouse creatine kinase promoter. We identified two founder lines, 130 and 137, that exhibited similar levels of skeletal muscle-specific expression without enhanced expression in heart or changes in FIT1 expression (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Because both lines exhibited similar phenotypes, we arbitrarily focused on line 137 throughout these studies. CKF2 mice were viable, reproduced normally, did not die prematurely, and had similar food intake as wild-type (WT) mice (see below). We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of FIT2 in mouse liver and in cells in culture resulted in the accumulation of TAG in lipid droplets (14Kadereit B. Kumar P. Wang W.J. Miranda D. Snapp E.L. Severina N. Torregroza I. Evans T. Silver D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Gross D.A. Snapp E.L. Silver D.L. PLoS One. 2010; 5e10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As expected, overexpression of FIT2 resulted in a significant intramyocellular accumulation of neutral lipid as indicated by Oil-Red O staining of sections of quadriceps (Fig. 1B). To further characterize this phenotype, total lipids were extracted from quadriceps of 12-week-old WT and CKF2 mice fed a standard chow (SC) diet and analyzed using thin layer chromatography. CKF2 mice exhibited a 7-fold increase in total TAG (Fig. 1C). Diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity was unchanged in muscles from CKF2 mice relative to WT muscle (Fig. 1D), supporting previous findings that FIT2 does not mediate triacylglyceride biosynthesis (14Kadereit B. Kumar P. Wang W.J. Miranda D. Snapp E.L. Severina N. Torregroza I. Evans T. Silver D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Increased expression of FIT2 in skeletal muscle had a profound effect on body weight. At 6 weeks of age CKF2 exhibited 20% less body weight as compared with their WT littermates (Fig. 2A, time point zero). EchoMRI analysis indicated that the difference in body weight was due to decreased fat mass and lean mass (Fig. 2B). Decreased lean mass was not due to increased activation of atrophy pathways because Murf1 and Atrogin-1/Fbox32 were not increased but were decreased in CKF2 muscle (Fig. 3A). However, CKF2 mice had increased levels of LC3-II compared with WT, potentially indicating an increase in autophagy (Fig. 3B). Increased autophagy may be an indication of decreased energy state in muscle (discussed below). We then challenged CKF2 mice with high fat (HF) diet beginning at 6 weeks of age for 12 weeks. Surprisingly, CKF2 mice were completely protected from HF diet-induced weight gain and maintained a similar body weight and fat mass as CKF2 mice on a SC diet (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings raised the possibility that FIT2 overexpression might be affecting energy expenditure.FIGURE 3No increase in muscle atrophy markers. A, real time PCR analysis of E3 ligases Atrogin-1 and Murf1 indicated that CKF2 mice did not have increased atrophy in quadriceps.

Mb, myoglobin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several possible mechanisms can contribute to the maintenance of body weight in CKF2 mice on SC and HF diets relative to their respective WT controls, namely decreased food intake, increased voluntary physical activity, and increased thermogenesis. Because CKF2 mice are leaner than WT mice even when fed a SC diet, we focused the remainder of our studies on mice fed a SC diet. CKF2 mice exhibited similar food intake as WT mice and had decreased physical activity compared with WT mice (Fig. 4, A and B). CKF2 mice had decreased body temperature compared with WT littermates that was correlated with significantly decreased UCP-1 protein levels in brown adipose tissue compared with WT mice (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, UCP-3 expression in skeletal muscle was unchanged (Fig. 4E). An alternative explanation for the leanness of CKF2 mice and protection from HF diet-induced weight gain is that CKF2 mice have enhanced energy expenditure independent of enhanced thermogenesis. To determine the mechanisms by which CKF2 mice are lean and resistant to diet-induced weight gain, we measured energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry of mice fed a SC diet. We chose to examine SC-fed mice because CKF2 mice fed a SC diet were already protected from body weight gain over time (Fig. 2A), and thus we could avoid complicating effects of HF diet on our analysis of metabolism. CKF2 mice had increased oxygen consumption in both the light and dark cycles as compared with WT mice, indicating increased energy expenditure (Fig. 4F). CKF2 mice also exhibited a significant increase in carbon dioxide production compared with WT mice (Fig. 4F). Respiratory quotient (RQ) was calculated to determine whether CKF2 mice have a particular preference for carbohydrate or fatty acids in their substrate utilization (Fig. 4F). RQ in CKF2 and WT mice increased from the light phase to the dark phase indicating that CKF2 mice were similarly metabolically flexible as WT mice. CKF2 mice did show a slight but significant reduction in RQ in the dark phase, which reflects a selective decline in glucose oxidation relative to fatty acid and/or amino acid oxidation. However, given that CKF2 mice had significantly higher plasma ketone bodies (Table 1), oxidation of fatty acids by liver partly explains the small decrease in RQ. We observed a significant increase in serum triacylglyceride and free fatty acids and a small but significant decrease in cholesterol. Levels of serum lactate were unchanged (Table 1).TABLE 1CKF2 mice serum metabolitesMetaboliteWTCKF2Triglyceride (mg/dl)65.27 ± 4.6085.76 ± 11.63ap < 0.001.Cholesterol (mg/dl)82.22 ± 3.0173.11 ± 1.75ap < 0.001.FFA (nmol/ml)562.52 ± 30.04858.82 ± 66.24bp < 0.0001.Ketones (nmol/ml)314.84 ± 50.14700.21 ± 82.10bp < 0.0001.Lactate (nmol/ml)3.39 ± 0.6872.74 ± 0.306a p < 0.001.b p < 0.0001.

https://openalex.org/W1982586042,"The WRN protein belongs to the RecQ family of DNA helicases and is implicated in replication fork restart, but how its function is regulated remains unknown. We show that WRN interacts with the 9.1.1 complex, one of the central factors of the replication checkpoint. This interaction is mediated by the binding of the RAD1 subunit to the N-terminal region of WRN and is instrumental for WRN relocalization in nuclear foci and its phosphorylation in response to replication arrest. We also find that ATR-dependent WRN phosphorylation depends on TopBP1, which is recruited by the 9.1.1 complex in response to replication arrest. Finally, we provide evidence for a cooperation between WRN and 9.1.1 complex in preventing accumulation of DNA breakage and maintaining genome integrity at naturally occurring replication fork stalling sites. Taken together, our data unveil a novel functional interplay between WRN helicase and the replication checkpoint, contributing to shed light into the molecular mechanism underlying the response to replication fork arrest."

Although these enzymes have been described in many organisms, few had their corresponding genes cloned and their recombinant proteins biochemically characterized, and none had their physiological roles determined. We found previously that FMN hydrolase activity in pea chloroplasts is Mg(2+)-dependent, suggesting an enzyme of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily. In this study, a new FMN hydrolase was purified by multistep chromatography after ammonium sulfate precipitation. The molecular weight of the native protein was estimated at ∼59,400, a dimer of about twice the predicted molecular weight of most HAD superfamily phosphatases. After SDS-PAGE of the partially purified material, two separate protein bands within 25-30 kDa were extracted from the gel and analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS. Peptide sequence matching to the protein samples suggested the presence of three HAD-like hydrolases. cDNAs for sequence homologs from Arabidopsis thaliana of these proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Activity screening of the encoded proteins showed that the At1g79790 gene encodes an FMN hydrolase (AtcpFHy1). Plastid localization of AtcpFHy1 was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy of A. thaliana protoplasts transiently expressing the N-terminal fusion of AtcpFHy1 to enhanced green fluorescent protein. Phosphatase activity of AtcpFHy1 is FMN-specific, as assayed with 19 potential substrates. Kinetic parameters and pH and temperature optima for AtcpFHy1 were determined. A phylogenetic analysis of putative phosphatases of the HAD superfamily suggested distinct evolutionary origins for the plastid AtcpFHy1 and the cytosolic FMN hydrolase characterized previously."
https://openalex.org/W1974537614,"JAK-STAT-activated gene expression is both rapid and transient and requires dynamic post-translational modification of the chromatin template. Previously, we showed that following IFN-γ treatment, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 79 (H3K79me3) is rapidly and highly induced in the 5'-end of the STAT1-dependent gene interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), but the role of this histone modification was unexplored. Here we report that DOT1L, the non-SET domain containing methyltransferase that modifies Lys-79, is localized across IRF1 in the uninduced state and is not further recruited by IFN-γ induction. RNAi-mediated depletion of DOT1L prevents the induction of H3K79me3 and lowers the transcription of IRF1 2-fold, as expected. Surprisingly, STAT1 binding to its DNA recognition element near the IRF1 promoter is diminished 2-fold in the DOT1L-depleted cell line. In vivo and in vitro protein interaction assays reveal a DOT1L-STAT1 interaction. Domain mapping identifies the middle region of DOT1L (amino acids 580-1183) as the STAT1 interaction domain. Overexpression of the DOT1L STAT1 interaction domain represses IRF1 transcription (2-fold) and interferes with STAT1 DNA binding at IRF1 and endogenous DOT1L histone methyltransferase activity. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel STAT1-DOT1L interaction that is required for the regulation JAK-STAT-inducible gene expression."
