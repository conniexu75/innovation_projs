More than three decades have passed since the original formulation of the concept, revolutionary at the time, that multiple connective tissues could emanate from a common progenitor or stem cell retained in the postnatal bone marrow. Despite the many important advances made since that time, substantial ambiguities still plague the field regarding the nature, identity, function, mode of isolation and experimental handling of MSCs. These uncertainties have a major impact on their envisioned therapeutic use."
https://openalex.org/W2026413615,"Biguanides such as metformin, which is the most widely prescribed drug for type-2 diabetes, are shown to antagonize the actions of glucagon by decreasing the levels of cyclic AMP. Hyperglycaemia is a common consequence of insulin resistance, the inability of insulin to suppress glucose output by the liver. Biguanides such as phenformin and metformin are often used to lower excessive glucose levels, for example in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Until recently metformin was thought to reduce glucose production by activating AMP-activated protein kinase. Here it is shown, however, that it antagonizes the actions of glucagon. Biguanides increase the levels of intracellular AMP and related nucleotides, thereby inhibiting the ability of glucagon to activate adenylyl cyclase. This results in reduced levels of cyclic AMP and protein kinase A activity, which blocks phosphorylation of substrates that are important for maintaining glucose output from hepatocytes. This work suggests that glucagon antagonists may have antidiabetic potential. Glucose production by the liver is essential for providing a substrate for the brain during fasting. The inability of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output is a major aetiological factor in the hyperglycaemia of type-2 diabetes mellitus and other diseases of insulin resistance1,2. For fifty years, one of the few classes of therapeutics effective in reducing glucose production has been the biguanides, which include phenformin and metformin, the latter the most frequently prescribed drug for type-2 diabetes3. Nonetheless, the mechanism of action of biguanides remains imperfectly understood. The suggestion a decade ago that metformin reduces glucose synthesis through activation of the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has recently been challenged by genetic loss-of-function experiments4. Here we provide a novel mechanism by which metformin antagonizes the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. In mouse hepatocytes, metformin leads to the accumulation of AMP and related nucleotides, which inhibit adenylate cyclase, reduce levels of cyclic AMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activity, abrogate phosphorylation of critical protein targets of PKA, and block glucagon-dependent glucose output from hepatocytes. These data support a mechanism of action for metformin involving antagonism of glucagon, and suggest an approach for the development of antidiabetic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1982548635,"Diagnostic and surgical procedures that rely on optical imaging are improved by using near-infrared fluorescent probes with low background signal. The signal-to-background ratio (SBR) is the key determinant of sensitivity, detectability and linearity in optical imaging. As signal strength is often constrained by fundamental limits, background reduction becomes an important approach for improving the SBR. We recently reported that a zwitterionic near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore, ZW800-1, exhibits low background. Here we show that this fluorophore provides a much-improved SBR when targeted to cancer cells or proteins by conjugation with a cyclic RGD peptide, fibrinogen or antibodies. ZW800-1 outperforms the commercially available NIR fluorophores IRDye800-CW and Cy5.5 in vitro for immunocytometry, histopathology and immunoblotting and in vivo for image-guided surgery. In tumor model systems, a tumor-to-background ratio of 17.2 is achieved at 4 h after injection of ZW800-1 conjugated to cRGD compared to ratios of 5.1 with IRDye800-CW and 2.7 with Cy5.5. Our results suggest that introducing zwitterionic properties into targeted fluorophores may be a general strategy for improving the SBR in diagnostic and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2004732016,"The roots of plants have the ability to influence its surrounding microbiology, the so-called rhizosphere microbiome, through the creation of specific chemical niches in the soil mediated by the release of phytochemicals. Here we report how these phytochemicals could modulate the microbial composition of a soil in the absence of the plant. For this purpose, root exudates of Arabidopsis were collected and fractionated to obtain natural blends of phytochemicals at various relative concentrations that were characterized by GC-MS and applied repeatedly to a soil. Soil bacterial changes were monitored by amplifying and pyrosequencing the 16 S ribosomal small subunit region. Our analyses reveal that one phytochemical can culture different operational taxonomic units (OTUs), mixtures of phytochemicals synergistically culture groups of OTUs, and the same phytochemical can act as a stimulator or deterrent to different groups of OTUs. Furthermore, phenolic-related compounds showed positive correlation with a higher number of unique OTUs compared with other groups of compounds (i.e. sugars, sugar alcohols, and amino acids). For instance, salicylic acid showed positive correlations with species of Corynebacterineae, Pseudonocardineae and Streptomycineae, and GABA correlated with species of Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Frankineae, Variovorax, Micromonosporineae, and Skermanella. These results imply that phenolic compounds act as specific substrates or signaling molecules for a large group of microbial species in the soil."
https://openalex.org/W2004590033,"A better understanding of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis at the molecular level will facilitate the discovery of tumor-initiating events. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that adenosine-to-inosine (A→I) RNA editing of AZIN1 (encoding antizyme inhibitor 1) is increased in HCC specimens. A→I editing of AZIN1 transcripts, specifically regulated by ADAR1 (encoding adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1), results in a serine-to-glycine substitution at residue 367 of AZIN1, located in β-strand 15 (β15) and predicted to cause a conformational change, induced a cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation and conferred gain-of-function phenotypes that were manifested by augmented tumor-initiating potential and more aggressive behavior. Compared with wild-type AZIN1 protein, the edited form has a stronger affinity to antizyme, and the resultant higher AZIN1 protein stability promotes cell proliferation through the neutralization of antizyme-mediated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cyclin D1 (CCND1). Collectively, A→I RNA editing of AZIN1 may be a potential driver in the pathogenesis of human cancers, particularly HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2021440104,"A major unresolved issue in treating pain is the paradoxical hyperalgesia produced by the gold-standard analgesic morphine and other opiates. We found that hyperalgesia-inducing treatment with morphine resulted in downregulation of the K(+)-Cl(-) co-transporter KCC2, impairing Cl(-) homeostasis in rat spinal lamina l neurons. Restoring the anion equilibrium potential reversed the morphine-induced hyperalgesia without affecting tolerance. The hyperalgesia was also reversed by ablating spinal microglia. Morphine hyperalgesia, but not tolerance, required μ opioid receptor-dependent expression of P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) in microglia and μ-independent gating of the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by P2X4Rs. Blocking BDNF-TrkB signaling preserved Cl(-) homeostasis and reversed the hyperalgesia. Gene-targeted mice in which Bdnf was deleted from microglia did not develop hyperalgesia to morphine. However, neither morphine antinociception nor tolerance was affected in these mice. Our findings dissociate morphine-induced hyperalgesia from tolerance and suggest the microglia-to-neuron P2X4-BDNF-KCC2 pathway as a therapeutic target for preventing hyperalgesia without affecting morphine analgesia."
https://openalex.org/W1978009694,"The first global metabolic models that incorporate reactive oxygen species in E. coli reveal targets for potentiating the action of antibacterials. The ever-increasing incidence of antibiotic-resistant infections combined with a weak pipeline of new antibiotics has created a global public health crisis1. Accordingly, novel strategies for enhancing our antibiotic arsenal are needed. As antibiotics kill bacteria in part by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)2,3,4, we reasoned that targeting microbial ROS production might potentiate antibiotic activity. Here we show that ROS production can be predictably enhanced in Escherichia coli, increasing the bacteria's susceptibility to oxidative attack. We developed an ensemble approach of genome-scale, metabolic models capable of predicting ROS production in E. coli. The metabolic network was systematically perturbed and its flux distribution analyzed to identify targets predicted to increase ROS production. Targets that were predicted in silico were experimentally validated and further shown to confer increased susceptibility to oxidants. Validated targets also increased susceptibility to killing by antibiotics. This work establishes a systems-based method to tune ROS production in bacteria and demonstrates that increased microbial ROS production can potentiate killing by oxidants and antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2013422844,"Tuning of neurons in higher visual cortices is less diverse than in primary visual cortex (V1), but the mechanisms underlying this specialization are unknown. In this paper, Glickfeld and colleagues used two-photon imaging in awake mice to measure the visual responses of boutons from V1 projection neurons in the higher visual areas and found that bouton tunings matched the preference of their target areas. These findings suggest that inter-areal visual stimulus feature segregation occurs via the target-specific routing of visual information as it ascends the cortical hierarchy. Neurons in primary sensory cortex have diverse response properties, whereas higher cortical areas are specialized. Specific connectivity may be important for areal specialization, particularly in the mouse, where neighboring neurons are functionally diverse. To examine whether higher visual areas receive functionally specific input from primary visual cortex (V1), we used two-photon calcium imaging to measure responses of axons from V1 arborizing in three areas with distinct spatial and temporal frequency preferences. We found that visual preferences of presynaptic boutons in each area were distinct and matched the average preferences of recipient neurons. This specificity could not be explained by organization within V1 and instead was due to both a greater density and greater response amplitude of functionally matched boutons. Projections from a single layer (layer 5) and from secondary visual cortex were also matched to their target areas. Thus, transmission of specific information to downstream targets may be a general feature of cortico-cortical communication."

The interaction of DNA and histones with a number of hemostatic factors has been shown to promote clotting and is associated with increased thrombosis, but little is known about the effects of DNA and histones on the regulation of fibrin stability and fibrinolysis. Here we demonstrate that the addition of histone-DNA complexes to fibrin results in thicker fibers (increase in median diameter from 84 to 123 nm according to scanning electron microscopy data) accompanied by improved stability and rigidity (the critical shear stress causing loss of fibrin viscosity increases from 150 to 376 Pa whereas the storage modulus of the gel increases from 62 to 82 pascals according to oscillation rheometric data). The effects of DNA and histones alone are subtle and suggest that histones affect clot structure whereas DNA changes the way clots are lysed. The combination of histones + DNA significantly prolongs clot lysis. Isothermal titration and confocal microscopy studies suggest that histones and DNA bind large fibrin degradation products with 191 and 136 nm dissociation constants, respectively, interactions that inhibit clot lysis. Heparin, which is known to interfere with the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, appears to prolong lysis time at a concentration favoring ternary histone-DNA-heparin complex formation, and DNase effectively promotes clot lysis in combination with tissue plasminogen activator.Background: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) composed of DNA and proteins form a scaffold in thrombi, supplementing the fibrin matrix.Results: DNA and histones modify the structure of fibrin and render it resistant to mechanical and enzymatic destruction.Conclusion: NET components are essential factors in thrombus stability.Significance: Therapeutic strategies could be optimized to enhance fibrinolysis in clots containing DNA and histones.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) 2The abbreviations used are: NETneutrophil extracellular traptPAtissue plasminogen activatorSEMscanning electron microscopeITCisothermal titration calorimetryFDPfibrin degradation productSAXSsmall angle x-ray scattering. are networks of DNA decorated with histones and other proteins, proteases, and other antimicrobial factors (1.Brinkmann V.

They are produced when neutrophils, basophils, or mast cells release nucleosomes after stimulation by inflammatory cytokines or LPS for example (1.Brinkmann V. Reichard U. Goosmann C. Fauler B.

It is proposed that NET formation is the first line of defense of the innate immune system, providing an effective way of trapping pathogenic microbes and removing them from the circulation (4.Massberg S.

The DNA and histones of NETs provide a scaffold for cell localization (including neutrophils and red blood cells), platelet aggregation, and activation that serves to promote coagulation and thrombosis (5.Fuchs T.A.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15880-15885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). Thus, NETs are a focus of significant cross-talk between innate immunity, inflammation, and hemostasis, and there are many points of contact including bidirectional interactions with platelets, inflammatory cytokines (IL-8), fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, protein C, thrombomodulin, factor XII, and neutrophil-derived serine proteases (3.Semeraro F.

Histones H3 and H4 have been identified as critical players and mediators of damage able to stimulate phosphatidylserine exposure and factor Va expression on platelets and interact with polyphosphates to promote clotting even in the absence of factor XII (3.Semeraro F.

Extracellular histones promote thrombin generation through platelet-dependent mechanisms: involvement of platelet TLR2 and TLR4.Blood. 2011; 118: 1952-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Histones may come from NETs or dying cells and are implicated in the progression of sepsis. Stimulation of coagulation by NETs can result in unwanted thrombosis (7.Borissoff J.I. ten Cate H. From neutrophil extracellular traps release to thrombosis: an overshooting host-defense mechanism?.J. Thromb.

Targeting the release of nucleosomes, development of NETs, and availability of circulating histones could be a strategy for prevention or therapeutic intervention for venous thromboembolism, sepsis, and other diseases involving cell death and lysis. However, although there are extensive studies on the interaction between NET components and coagulation, little is known about the effects of DNA and histones on fibrinolysis. Bacterial infection by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. is accompanied by secretion of plasminogen-binding and activating proteins as the bacteria hijack the host fibrinolytic system (10.Gladysheva I.P. Sazonova I.Y. Chowdhry S.A. Liu L. Turner R.B. Reed G.L. Chimerism reveals a role for the streptokinase β-domain in nonproteolytic active site formation, substrate, and inhibitor interactions.J.

Streptokinase is a classic example of a plasminogen activator from streptococci, and staphylokinase is produced by staphylococci. Interestingly, streptococci also release a DNase, streptodornase, which is linked to bacterial virulence (12.Aziz R.K. Ismail S.A. Park H.W. Kotb M.

Microbiol. 2004; 54: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that streptokinase and streptodornase can work together to break down fibrin clots and NETs and promote bacterial dissemination. DNases have been shown to degrade NETs and prevent platelet adhesion and activation (5.Fuchs T.A. Brill A. Duerschmied D. Schatzberg D. Monestier M. Myers Jr., D.D. Wrobleski S.K. Wakefield T.W.

Systemic infection triggers coagulation and an immune response involving neutrophils and NETs that work together to restrict the movement of microorganisms within the vasculature and at the same time promote thrombin generation and thrombosis. As suggested previously (5.Fuchs T.A. Brill A. Duerschmied D. Schatzberg D. Monestier M. Myers Jr., D.D. Wrobleski S.K. Wakefield T.W. Hartwig J.H. Wagner D.D.

These topics are the subject of the current study with the main focus on the endogenous fibrinolysis system regulated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). tPA was modified to express a C-terminal fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein using pFastBac-tPA (and derivatives) as described previously (14.Longstaff C. Thelwell C. Williams S.C. Silva M.M. Szabó L. Kolev K. The interplay between tissue plasminogen activator domains and fibrin structures in the regulation of fibrinolysis: kinetic and microscopic studies.Blood. 2011; 117: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Plasminogen activation and fibrin lysis assays were performed as described previously (15.Silva M.M. Thelwell C. Williams S.C. Longstaff C. Regulation of fibrinolysis by C-terminal lysines operates through plasminogen and plasmin but not tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).J. Thromb.

Where heparin was present in reaction mixtures (over a range of concentrations shown under “Results”), it was added first to reaction wells followed by solution a and then solution b. Fibrinogen and DNA (calf thymus) were from Calbiochem; plasminogen was from Hyphen-Biomed, Neuville-sur-Oise, France; histones (calf thymus, type IIIS) were from Sigma-Aldrich; and α-thrombin (01/580), tPA (98/714), and heparin (07/328) were from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, UK. Selectable endpoints for analysis (such as clotting maximum absorbance, time to clotting maximum absorbance, time to 50% lysis, time to 100% lysis, and time to 50% lysis from clotting maximum) were extracted from absorbance versus time data and analyzed using bespoke software written using the free statistical software package R (16.R Development Core TeamR, a Program for Statistical Computing. The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Wien, Austria2011Google Scholar) (script available on request). tPA activity was also determined in tubes by mixing 200 μl of a solution of histones (50 μg/ml), thrombin (30 nm), and tPA with 1.0 ml of fibrinogen (1.3 mg/ml), plasminogen (200 nm), and DNA (70 μg/ml) (final concentrations given) and monitoring the collapse of clots by release of bubbles (17.Sands D.

Haemost. 2002; 88: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). tPA was present at 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 nm so potency relative to conditions without DNA and histones and 95% confidence limits could be calculated using parallel line bioassay methods (17.Sands D.

DNase I was from Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL. Immediately (within 5 min) after surgery or the preparation of fibrin, 5 × 5 × 10-mm pieces of thrombi or fibrin clots of 100-μl volume were placed into 10 ml of 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2 buffer for 24 h at 4 °C. Following repeated washes with the same buffer, samples were fixed in 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 16 h. The fixed samples were dehydrated in a series of ethanol dilutions (20–96% (v/v)), a 1:1 mixture of 96% (v/v) ethanol/acetone, and pure acetone followed by critical point drying with CO2 in an E3000 Critical Point Drying Apparatus (Quorum Technologies, Newhaven, UK). The specimens were mounted on adhesive carbon discs and sputter-coated with gold in an SC7620 Sputter Coater (Quorum Technologies), and images were taken with scanning electron microscope EVO40 (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany). After surgery, the removed thrombus samples were frozen immediately at −70 °C and stored until examination. Cryosections (6-μm thickness) of thrombi were attached to lysine-coated slides. Sections were fixed in acetone at 4 °C for 10 min and air-dried for 5 min at room temperature followed by incubation in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer (PBS) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin to eliminate nonspecific binding of antibodies. Subsequently, slides were washed in PBS three times, and DNA was stained with the dimeric cyanine nucleic acid dye TOTO-3® (T-3604, Invitrogen; excitation, 640 nm, emission, 660 nm) at 1:5000 dilution with PBS containing 10% glycerol and 0.02% Tween 20 for 15 min followed by three washes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 7.4 buffer (TBS). For double immunostaining, the sections were incubated with 2 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-human fibrin antibody (ADI313, American Diagnostica, Pfungstadt, Germany) and 2 μg/ml rabbit anti-human histone H1 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS. Following washing with TBS, sections were treated with Alexa Fluor® 488 (excitation, 495 nm; emission, 519 nm) goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:100 dilution and Alexa Fluor 546 (excitation, 556 nm; emission, 573 nm) goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:100 dilution. Following three washes, glass coverslips were affixed over a drop of 50% (v/v) glycerol in TBS. Confocal fluorescence images were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 20× 1.4 objective (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) at 488-nm excitation laser line (20% intensity) and emission in the 500–530-nm wavelength range, 543-nm excitation laser line (100% intensity) and emission in the 565–615-nm wavelength range, 633-nm excitation laser line (100% intensity) and emission in the range over 650-nm wavelength. Enthalpy changes accompanying the interaction of DNA and proteins (fibrin degradation products (FDPs), fibrinogen, histones, and plasminogen) were measured using an isothermal titration method on a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The proteins were injected in a series of 25 aliquots (10 μl each) into the cell of the calorimeter containing DNA or protein, and the heat increment of each addition was recorded by the instrument. Dilutions of protein into buffer were carried out in a separate series of injections, and these heat increments were subtracted from the raw data. Heat data for the interactions were evaluated according to the single site algorithm with ITC Data Analysis version 7.0 software (MicroCal Inc.). For the calculation of equilibrium parameters, the mass concentration of DNA was converted to molar concentration of nucleotides using an average molecular mass of 500 Da. The molar concentration of the FDPs of 150 kDa or larger was estimated from the mass concentration and densitometric data of the polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (PAGE) pattern of the FDPs used for the binding experiments. Clotting of fibrinogen (human, plasminogen-depleted; Calbiochem) and fibrinolysis were initiated simultaneously with thrombin (90 nm) and plasmin (5 nm). The final concentration of fibrinogen was 6 μm for preparation of extensively degraded products of fibrin digestion and 12 μm for partial digestion and generation of large FDPs. Plasmin action was stopped by the addition of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Pefabloc® from Roche Applied Science) at a final concentration of 0.05 mm immediately after a steel ball placed on the surface of the clot reached the bottom of the tube (∼16–18 h after the start of lysis). For more extensive degradation Pefabloc was added 2–4 h later when the visible fibrin gel had totally disappeared. The fluid phases were withdrawn from each of the tubes after centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min, and the total protein contents were determined from the values of absorbance of the supernatants at 280 nm (A280 of 1.6 corresponds to 1 g/liter non-clottable fibrin degradation products measured under identical conditions (18.Komorowicz E. Kolev K. Machovich R. Fibrinolysis with des-kringle derivatives of plasmin and its modulation by plasma protease inhibitors.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9112-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). The supernatant was subjected to SDS electrophoresis on a 4–15% polyacrylamide gel under non-reducing and reducing conditions and silver-stained. Concentrations of large degradation fragments (over 150 kDa) were calculated as a fraction of total protein based on quantitative gel analysis using SigmaGel software (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany). Fibrin clots were prepared from 6 μm fibrinogen, 2% of which was Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated fibrinogen (Invitrogen), and 1.5 μm plasminogen clotted with 16 nm thrombin for 30 min at room temperature in sterile, uncoated Ibidi VI 0.4 μ-Slides (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). In certain cases, 50 or 100 μg/ml DNA (human; isolated from granulocytes) and/or 3.45 μm histone IIIS (from calf thymus; Sigma-Aldrich) was also added to the mixture. Thereafter, 4 μg/ml tPA-GFP was added to the edge of the clot, and the fluorescence (excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission wavelength, 525 nm for tPA-GFP detection; excitation wavelength, 543 nm; emission wavelength, 575 nm for Alexa Fluor 546-fibrinogen detection) was monitored with Confocal Laser Scanning System LSM510 (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) taking sequential images of the fluid-fibrin interface at a distance of ∼50 μm from the glass surface with identical exposures and laser intensities using a Plan-Neofluar×20/0.5 objective. Neutrophil granulocytes were isolated from the buffy coat fraction of human blood (Hungarian Blood Supply Service, Budapest, Hungary) (19.Rácz Z. Baróti C. Technical aspects of buffy coat removal from whole blood and those of platelet production from single buffy coat units.Biomed. Tech. 1993; 38: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) according to a procedure described previously (20.Wohner N. Keresztes Z. Sótonyi P. Szabó L. Komorowicz E. Machovich R. Kolev K. Neutrophil granulocyte-dependent proteolysis enhances platelet adhesion to the arterial wall under high-shear flow.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2010; 8: 1624-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Following cell lysis, DNA was extracted using 25:24:1 phorbol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich); precipitated out of the water phase in 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2 buffer and 96% (v/v) ethanol; and resuspended in 25 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4 buffer containing 75 mm NaCl. The ratio of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm was 1.88–1.95 in the final preparation. The concentration of DNA was determined from absorbance at 260 nm using calf thymus DNA (Calbiochem) as a reference. 140 μl of 10 mg/ml fibrinogen was premixed with 60 or 120 μl of 0.5 mg/ml DNA and supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 buffer containing 150 mm NaCl to a 500-μl final volume. Clotting was initiated with 50 μl of 100 nm thrombin added to 410 μl of fibrinogen solution, and 410 μl of the clotting mixture was transferred to the plate of the HAAKE RheoStress 1 oscillation rheometer (Thermo Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany) thermostatted at 37 °C. The cone (titanium, 2° angle, 35-mm diameter) of the rheometer was brought to the gap position, and a shear strain (γ) of 0.015 was imposed exactly at 2 min after the addition of thrombin. Measurements of storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) were taken at 1 Hz in the course of 15 min with HAAKE RheoWin data manager software v. 3.50.0012 (Thermo Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany) (21.Ryan E.A.

Following this 15-min clotting phase, determination of the flow limit of fibrin gels was performed in the same samples by increasing the applied shear stress (τ) from 0.01 to 500.0 pascals stepwise in 150 s, and the resulting strain measured was used for calculation of the viscosity modulus (the critical shear stress τ0 determined by extrapolation of the decline in viscosity to 0 that was used as an indicator of the gel/fluid transition in the fibrin structure). Fibrin samples with the same composition as those used for the evaluation of rigidity and additional samples containing unfractionated heparin were also examined by SAXS measurements performed on the four-crystal monochromator beamline of Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) (Berlin, Germany) supplemented by the SAXS setup of Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB German Patent DE 2006 029 449) at the synchrotron radiation facility BESSY II (HZB, Berlin, Germany) (22.Gleber G. Cibik S. Haas S. Hoell A. Muller P. Krumrey M. Traceable size determination of PMMA nanoparticles based on Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS).J. Phys. Conf. Ser. 2010; 24710.1088/1742-6596/247/1/012027Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The samples were filled into glass capillaries with 1.0-mm diameter. The energy of the incoming x-ray beam was 7 keV, and the two-dimensional scattering patterns were collected with a gas-filled area detector. Measurements were performed at sample-to-detector distances of 1.4 and 4 m to cover the range of momentum transfer of q = 0.7–3 nm−1 (q = 4π/λ sinθ where θ is half the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength of the incident x-ray beam). All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The scattering curves were obtained by radial averaging of the two-dimensional patterns using SASREDTOOL program v. 1.2 (Sylvio Haas, Helmholtz-Zentrum, Berlin, Germany). For quantitative analysis of the scattering pattern, non-linear least square fitting of an empirical model function to the scattering curves was performed using SASfit program v. 0.93.3 (Joachim Kohlbrecher and Ingo Bressler, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) in which the peaks were approximated by Lorentzian functions and the decay trend was taken into account by different power law functions. The SEM images of fibrin were analyzed to determine the diameter of the fibrin fibers using self-designed scripts running under Image Processing Toolbox v. 7.0 of Matlab 7.10.0.499 (R2010a) (The Mathworks, Natick, MA) (23.Nikolova N.D. Toneva-Zheynova D. Kolev K. Tenekedjiev K. Chan W.K. Theory and Applications of Monte Carlo Simulations. InTech, Rijeka, Croatia2012Google Scholar). For the diameter measurements, a grid was drawn over the image with 10–15 equally spaced horizontal lines, and all fibers crossed by them were included in the analysis. The diameters were measured by manually placing the pointer of the Distance tool over the end points of transverse cross-sections of 300 fibers from each image (always perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the fibers). Two images of two independent samples were analyzed in a single global procedure. The distribution of the data on fiber diameter was analyzed using an algorithm described in detail previously (23.Nikolova N.D. Toneva-Zheynova D. Kolev K. Tenekedjiev K. Chan W.K. Theory and Applications of Monte Carlo Simulations. InTech, Rijeka, Croatia2012Google Scholar) where theoretical distributions were fitted to the empirical data sets and compared using the Kuiper test and Monte Carlo simulation procedures. Little is known about the distribution of DNA and histones in thrombi found in patients. Fig. 1 shows staining for DNA and histones found in three representative thrombi recovered from patients. There was variable but widespread staining for DNA. Histones were also present although not so widely dispersed and in some cases were coincident with fibrin aggregates. The thrombi rich in red blood cells (Fig. 1, TO) or in fibrin (GI) according to the SEM images showed limited DNA- and histone-positive regions in contrast to the extensively stained areas in the leukocyte-rich (TJ) thrombus.

UNC1215 binds L3MBTL3 with a Kd of 120 nM, competitively displacing mono- or dimethyllysine-containing peptides, and is greater than 50-fold more potent toward L3MBTL3 than other members of the MBT family while also demonstrating selectivity against more than 200 other reader domains examined. X-ray crystallography identified a unique 2:2 polyvalent mode of interaction between UNC1215 and L3MBTL3. In cells, UNC1215 is nontoxic and directly binds L3MBTL3 via the Kme-binding pocket of the MBT domains. UNC1215 increases the cellular mobility of GFP-L3MBTL3 fusion proteins, and point mutants that disrupt the Kme-binding function of GFP-L3MBTL3 phenocopy the effects of UNC1215 on localization. Finally, UNC1215 was used to reveal a new Kme-dependent interaction of L3MBTL3 with BCLAF1, a protein implicated in DNA damage repair and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1992789034,"Nearly half the exoplanets found within binary star systems reside in very wide binaries with average stellar separations greater than 1,000 astronomical units (one astronomical unit (AU) being the Earth-Sun distance), yet the influence of such distant binary companions on planetary evolution remains largely unstudied. Unlike their tighter counterparts, the stellar orbits of wide binaries continually change under the influence of the Milky Way's tidal field and impulses from other passing stars. Here we report numerical simulations demonstrating that the variable nature of wide binary star orbits dramatically reshapes the planetary systems they host, typically billions of years after formation. Contrary to previous understanding, wide binary companions may often strongly perturb planetary systems, triggering planetary ejections and increasing the orbital eccentricities of surviving planets. Although hitherto not recognized, orbits of giant exoplanets within wide binaries are statistically more eccentric than those around isolated stars. Both eccentricity distributions are well reproduced when we assume that isolated stars and wide binaries host similar planetary systems whose outermost giant planets are scattered beyond about 10 AU from their parent stars by early internal instabilities. Consequently, our results suggest that although wide binaries eventually remove the most distant planets from many planetary systems, most isolated giant exoplanet systems harbour additional distant, still undetected planets."
https://openalex.org/W2150747374,"Human apolipoprotein E (apoE) isoforms may differentially modulate amyloid-β (Aβ) levels. Evidence suggests physical interactions between apoE and Aβ are partially responsible for these functional effects. However, the apoE/Aβ complex is not a single static structure; rather, it is defined by detection methods. Thus, literature results are inconsistent and difficult to interpret. An ELISA was developed to measure soluble apoE/Aβ in a single, quantitative method and was used to address the hypothesis that reduced levels of soluble apoE/Aβ and an increase in soluble Aβ, specifically oligomeric Aβ (oAβ), are associated with APOE4 and AD. Previously, soluble Aβ42 and oAβ levels were greater with APOE4 compared with APOE2/APOE3 in hippocampal homogenates from EFAD transgenic mice (expressing five familial AD mutations and human apoE isoforms). In this study, soluble apoE/Aβ levels were lower in E4FAD mice compared with E2FAD and E3FAD mice, thus providing evidence that apoE/Aβ levels isoform-specifically modulate soluble oAβ clearance. Similar results were observed in soluble preparations of human cortical synaptosomes; apoE/Aβ levels were lower in AD patients compared with controls and lower with APOE4 in the AD cohort. In human CSF, apoE/Aβ levels were also lower in AD patients and with APOE4 in the AD cohort. Importantly, although total Aβ42 levels decreased in AD patients compared with controls, oAβ levels increased and were greater with APOE4 in the AD cohort. Overall, apoE isoform-specific formation of soluble apoE/Aβ modulates oAβ levels, suggesting a basis for APOE4-induced AD risk and a mechanistic approach to AD biomarkers."

The process is mediated by eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) in conjunction with the 40 S ribosomal subunit and (initiator) tRNAi. Here, we provide evidence that the C-terminal tail (CTT) of eIF1A, which we previously implicated in start codon recognition, moves closer to the N-terminal domain of eIF5 when the PIC encounters an AUG codon. Importantly, this movement is coupled to dissociation of eIF1 from the PIC, a critical event in start codon recognition, and is dependent on the scanning enhancer elements in the eIF1A CTT. The data further indicate that eIF1 dissociation must be accompanied by the movement of the eIF1A CTT toward eIF5 in order to trigger release of phosphate from eIF2, which converts the latter to its GDP-bound state. Our results also suggest that release of eIF1 from the PIC and movement of the CTT of eIF1A are triggered by the same event, most likely accommodation of tRNAi in the P site of the 40 S subunit driven by base pairing between the start codon in the mRNA and the anticodon in tRNAi.

The PIC is formed when a ternary complex (TC) of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), GTP, and the methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi) binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Three initiation factors, eIF1, -1A, and -3, associate with the 40 S subunit and promote TC loading. The PIC then binds to the 5′-end of an mRNA with the assistance of the eIF4 factors, eIF3, and the poly(A)-binding protein and subsequently scans the mRNA in search of an initiation codon. Once the initiation codon is encountered, base pairing takes place between the anticodon of the initiator tRNA and the AUG in the mRNA, triggering a series of events that commit the complex to continuing the initiation process at that point on the message. These events include dissociation of eIF1 from the PIC and conversion of eIF2 to its GDP-bound form via gated phosphate (Pi) release, which requires the action of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF5. Subsequent dissociation of eIF5 and eIF2·GDP from the 40 S subunit clears the way for eIF5B·GTP-dependent joining of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to form an 80 S initiation complex.

Start codon recognition by the PIC is a critical event for accurate gene expression. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanics underlying the accurate recognition of an AUG codon in an mRNA by the translational machinery. In the current model for this process (1.Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R. The mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation. New insights and challenges.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: 1-25Crossref Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 2.Aitken C.E. Lorsch J.R. A mechanistic overview of translation initiation in eukaryotes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), the PIC binds to the message in an “open” conformation that is competent to scan in search of a start codon (4.Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U. Eukaryotic ribosomes require initiation factors 1 and 1A to locate initiation codons.Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This open conformation is induced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by eIF1 and eIF1A (5.Passmore L.A. Schmeing T.M. Maag D. Applefield D.J. Acker M.G. Algire M.A. Lorsch J.R. Ramakrishnan V.

Kolupaeva V.G. Marintchev A. Wagner G. Pestova T.V.

Crystal structure of the eukaryotic 40S ribosomal subunit in complex with initiation factor 1.Science. 2011; 331: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The folded body of eIF1A binds in the A site of the 40 S subunit, but its long, unstructured N- and C-terminal tails (NTT and CTT, respectively) reach into the P site (10.Yu Y. Marintchev A.

The position of the CTT is also thought to sterically occlude full access of the tRNA to the P site. We previously showed that when the PIC encounters the start codon, eIF1 is ejected from the complex (11.Maag D. Fekete C.A. Gryczynski Z. Lorsch J.R.

Cell. 2005; 17: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We also showed that start codon recognition induces a strong direct or indirect interaction between eIF1A and eIF5 (12.Maag D. Algire M.A. Lorsch J.R.

Biol. 2006; 356: 724-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A variety of data indicate that base pairing between the anticodon of tRNAi and the start codon induces a transition from the open state to a closed one that is arrested on the mRNA (13.Kolitz S.E. Takacs J.E. Lorsch J.R. Kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the role of start codon/anticodon base pairing during eukaryotic translation initiation.RNA. 2009; 15: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have proposed that this codon-anticodon pairing drives the tRNAi fully into the P site (Pin state), which in turn ejects eIF1 and the CTT of eIF1A due to their steric clashes with the fully accommodated tRNA (2.Aitken C.E. Lorsch J.R. A mechanistic overview of translation initiation in eukaryotes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 14.Lorsch J.R. Dever T.E.

In addition, ejection of eIF1 was shown to set the rate of Pi release from eIF2, because eIF1 and Pi release occur with nearly the same rate constants, and mutations in eIF1 that speed up or slow down its ejection have the same effect on Pi release (15.Algire M.A. Maag D.

Additional studies have further defined the roles played by eIF1A and eIF5 in start codon recognition, although the mechanistic basis for these roles has remained obscure (18.Fekete C.A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1094-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As noted above, a strong interaction between eIF1A and eIF5, dependent on the CTT of eIF1A, occurs upon start codon recognition. This interaction is sensitive to the codon in the P site and is strongly influenced by mutations in eIF5 and eIF1A that decrease (Sui− phenotype) or increase (Ssu− phenotype) the fidelity of start codon recognition in vivo (12.Maag D. Algire M.A. Lorsch J.R. Communication between eukaryotic translation initiation factors 5 and 1A within the ribosomal pre-initiation complex plays a role in start site selection.J. Mol.

N- and C-terminal residues of eIF1A have opposing effects on the fidelity of start codon selection.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1602-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified elements in the CTT and NTT of eIF1A that play important roles in start codon recognition (6.Saini A.K. Nanda J.S. Lorsch J.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Regulatory elements in eIF1A control the fidelity of start codon selection by modulating tRNAiMet binding to the ribosome.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mutations in the two scanning enhancer (SE) elements in the CTT produce Sui− phenotypes, and our data suggested that these residues function to antagonize the closed state of the PIC and/or stabilize the Pout state of the tRNAi relative to the Pin state. Two scanning inhibitor (SI) elements were also identified, one in the NTT and the other in a helix adjacent to the CTT. Mutations in these SI elements increase the fidelity of start codon recognition (Ssu−), suggesting that the elements promote closed complex formation and/or transition to the Pin state of the tRNAi. One way to explain these opposing functions of the SE and SI elements is that the former binds in the P site of the 40 S subunit prior to start codon recognition, whereas the SI elements have affinity for a site(s) in the PIC that is incompatible with binding of the SE elements in the P site. In this model, mutation of the SE elements would facilitate removal of the CTT from the P site, stabilizing Pin relative to Pout, whereas mutation of the SI elements would have the opposite effect. Release of the eIF1A CTT from the P site upon start codon recognition presumably allows its direct or indirect interaction with eIF5, and this interaction might be the trigger for Pi release from eIF2. There is also mounting evidence that eIF5 plays a direct role in start codon recognition in addition to its function as a GAP for eIF2. eIF5 consists of an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain (NTD and CTD), connected by a linker region (Fig. 1A) (21.Wei Z.

The NTD has an unstructured N-terminal tail, which contains the key arginine residue (Arg-15) required for GAP function and which presumably interacts directly with the GTP-binding pocket in eIF2γ. This tail is followed by a region with a fold similar to that of eIF1 and the α/β globular domain of archaeal homologs of eIF2β, which sits on top of a zinc-binding domain (ZBD) (22.Conte M.R.

One such Sui− substitution in the eIF5 NTD (G31R) was shown to alter the interaction of eIF5 with eIF1A in a manner that stabilizes the closed complex at UUG but destabilizes it at AUG, strongly implicating the eIF5 GAP domain in the conformational rearrangement of the PIC upon start codon recognition (12.Maag D. Algire M.A. Lorsch J.R. Communication between eukaryotic translation initiation factors 5 and 1A within the ribosomal pre-initiation complex plays a role in start site selection.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 724-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that eIF5 promotes AUG recognition by enhancing eIF1 dissociation from the PIC. We recently showed that high concentrations of eIF5 antagonize binding of eIF1 to the PIC in vitro (16.Nanda J.S. Cheung Y.N. Takacs J.E. Martin-Marcos P. Saini A.K. Hinnebusch A.G.

Similarly, it was shown that overexpression of eIF5 in mammalian cells increases use of near-cognate codons and AUG codons in suboptimal sequence contexts as start sites, and this effect is suppressed by co-overexpression of eIF1, consistent with the notion that high concentrations of eIF5 reduce the fidelity of start codon recognition in vivo by promoting release of eIF1 from the PIC (31.Loughran G.

Stringency of start codon selection modulates autoregulation of translation initiation factor eIF5.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 2898-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on the available data, we proposed a model in which start codon recognition induces movement of the CTT of eIF1A out of the P site, allowing it to interact with eIF5 (12.Maag D. Algire M.A. Lorsch J.R. Communication between eukaryotic translation initiation factors 5 and 1A within the ribosomal pre-initiation complex plays a role in start site selection.J. Mol.

N- and C-terminal residues of eIF1A have opposing effects on the fidelity of start codon selection.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1602-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This interaction could be the trigger for Pi release from eIF2, particularly if it was coupled to dissociation of the eIF5 GAP domain from the GTP-binding pocket in eIF2γ. As noted above, displacement of the eIF1A CTT from the P site should also facilitate accommodation of tRNAi in the Pin state of the closed complex required for AUG recognition (6.Saini A.K. Nanda J.S. Lorsch J.R. Hinnebusch A.G.

Position of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF1A on the 40S ribosomal subunit mapped by directed hydroxyl radical probing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 5167-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, we proposed that upon dissociation of eIF1 from the PIC, one of the domains of eIF5 might move into the eIF1 binding site (e.g. a site on the 40 S subunit or in the unstructured NTT of eIF2β), preventing rebinding of eIF1 and promoting transition to downstream steps in the initiation process (16.Nanda J.S. Cheung Y.N. Takacs J.E. Martin-Marcos P. Saini A.K. Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R. eIF1 controls multiple steps in start codon recognition during eukaryotic translation initiation.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 394: 268-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This competition for the same binding site would explain the antagonism between eIF1 and eIF5. Recent results indicate that interaction of the eIF5 CTD with the eIF2β NTT is crucial for proper dissociation of eIF1 from the PIC and start codon recognition (25.Luna R.E. Arthanari H. Hiraishi H. Nanda J. Martin-Marcos P. Markus M.A. Akabayov B. Milbradt A.G. Luna L.E. Seo H.C. Hyberts S.G. Fahmy A. Reibarkh M. Miles D. Hagner P.R. O'Day E.M. Yi T. Marintchev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R.

The C-terminal domain of eukaryotic initiation factor 5 promotes start codon recognition by its dynamic interplay with eIF1 and eIF2β.Cell Rep. 2012; 1: 689-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this paper, we provide data that directly support and refine this model. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorophores on the C terminus of eIF1A and on eIF5, we show that the CTT of eIF1A moves closer to the NTD of eIF5 in response to start codon recognition in a manner controlled by the rate of eIF1 dissociation from the PIC and dependent on the SE elements in the eIF1A CTT. Remarkably, mutations in the SE elements uncouple eIF1 release from Pi release, dramatically impairing both Pi release and movement of the eIF1A CTT while minimally affecting eIF1 release. These findings demonstrate that eIF1 dissociation is not sufficient for Pi release and that movement of the eIF1A CTT toward the eIF5 NTD is additionally required for this key step in start codon recognition. The available data suggest that eIF1 release determines the timing of these events in WT PICs by setting the rate of accommodation of tRNAi into the P site, which in turn triggers movement of the eIF1A CTT toward the eIF5 NTD. Finally, we show that the CTD of eIF5 is responsible for the factor's antagonism with eIF1 in binding to the PIC, reinforcing the notion that interaction of the eIF5 CTD with the eIF2β NTT is critical for eIF1 release and stable TC binding with tRNAi fully accommodated in the P site. Our data indicate that a multistep series of movements of eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF5 takes place in response to start codon recognition and that these events are coupled to one another in WT PICs, most likely beginning with the movement of the initiator tRNA into the P site. The reaction (“recon”) buffer was composed of 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm KOAc (pH 7.4), 3 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 2 mm DTT.

The virus from the Filoviridae family causes hemorrhagic fever, which rapidly progresses and in some cases has a fatality rate near 90%. The Ebola genome encodes seven genes, the most abundantly expressed of which is viral protein 40 (VP40), the major Ebola matrix protein that regulates assembly and egress of the virus. It is well established that VP40 assembles on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane; however, the mechanistic details of plasma membrane association by VP40 are not well understood. In this study, we used an array of biophysical experiments and cellular assays along with mutagenesis of VP40 to investigate the role of membrane penetration in VP40 assembly and egress. Here we demonstrate that VP40 is able to penetrate specifically into the plasma membrane through an interface enriched in hydrophobic residues in its C-terminal domain. Mutagenesis of this hydrophobic region consisting of Leu(213), Ile(293), Leu(295), and Val(298) demonstrated that membrane penetration is critical to plasma membrane localization, VP40 oligomerization, and viral particle egress. Taken together, VP40 membrane penetration is an important step in the plasma membrane localization of the matrix protein where oligomerization and budding are defective in the absence of key hydrophobic interactions with the membrane."

However, little is known about how catK degrades compact collagen macromolecules. The present study is aimed to explore the structural and mechanical consequences of collagen fiber degradation by catK. Mouse tail type I collagen fibers were incubated with either catK or non-collagenase cathepsins. Methods used include scanning electron microscopy, protein electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy, and tensile strength testing. Our study revealed evidence of proteoglycan network degradation, followed by the progressive disassembly of macroscopic collagen fibers into primary structural elements by catK. Proteolytically released GAGs are involved in the generation of collagenolytically active catK-GAG complexes as shown by AFM. In addition to their structural disintegration, a decrease in the tensile properties of fibers was observed due to the action of catK. The Young's moduli of untreated collagen fibers versus catK-treated fibers in dehydrated conditions were 3.2 ± 0.68 GPa and 1.9 ± 0.65 GPa, respectively. In contrast, cathepsin L, V, B, and S revealed no collagenase activity, except the disruption of proteoglycan-GAG interfibrillar bridges, which slightly decreased the tensile strength of fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2122830685,"TRIP-Br2–null mice are resistant to obesity and insulin resistance and have higher energy expenditure because of increased thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism. As expression of this transcriptional regulator is elevated in fat from obese humans, TRIP-Br2 might be a new therapeutic target against insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. Obesity develops as a result of altered energy homeostasis favoring fat storage. Here we describe a new transcription co-regulator for adiposity and energy metabolism, SERTA domain containing 2 (TRIP-Br2, also called SERTAD2). TRIP-Br2–null mice are resistant to obesity and obesity-related insulin resistance. Adipocytes of these knockout mice showed greater stimulated lipolysis secondary to enhanced expression of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and β3-adrenergic (Adrb3) receptors. The knockout mice also have higher energy expenditure because of increased adipocyte thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism caused by upregulating key enzymes in their respective processes. Our data show that a cell-cycle transcriptional co-regulator, TRIP-Br2, modulates fat storage through simultaneous regulation of lipolysis, thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism. These data, together with the observation that TRIP-Br2 expression is selectively elevated in visceral fat in obese humans, suggests that this transcriptional co-regulator is a new therapeutic target for counteracting the development of obesity, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2093990648,"This study shows that a non-clustered protocadherin, NFPC, is locally translated in retinal axons in response to Sema3A and demonstrates that NFPC-mediated homophilic adhesion helps guide retinal axons in the optic tract, thus revealing a new mechanism for axon guidance by linking a diffusible cue to adhesion-based navigation. Cell adhesion molecules and diffusible cues both regulate axon pathfinding, yet how these two modes of signaling interact is poorly understood. The homophilic cell adhesion molecule NF-protocadherin (NFPC) is expressed in the mid-dorsal optic tract neuroepithelium and in the axons of developing retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in Xenopus laevis. Here we report that targeted disruption of NFPC function in RGC axons or the optic tract neuroepithelium results in unexpectedly localized pathfinding defects at the caudal turn in the mid-optic tract. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), which lies adjacent to this turn, stimulates rapid, protein synthesis–dependent increases in growth cone NFPC and its cofactor, TAF1, in vitro. In vivo, growth cones exhibit marked increases in NFPC translation reporter activity in this mid-optic tract region that are attenuated by blocking neuropilin-1 function. Our results suggest that translation-linked coupling between regionally localized diffusible cues and cell adhesion can help axons navigate discrete segments of the pathway."

Increased Pol-I transcription and the concurrent increase in ribosome biogenesis has been linked to the high rates of proliferation in cancers. The ellipticine family contains a number of potent anticancer therapeutic agents, some having progressed to stage I and II clinical trials; however, the mechanism by which many of the compounds work remains unclear. It has long been thought that inhibition of Top2 is the main reason behind the drugs antiproliferative effects. Here we report that a number of the ellipticines, including 9-hydroxyellipticine, are potent and specific inhibitors of Pol-I transcription, with IC(50) in vitro and in cells in the nanomolar range. Essentially, the drugs did not affect Pol-II and Pol-III transcription, demonstrating a high selectivity. We have shown that Pol-I inhibition occurs by a p53-, ATM/ATR-, and Top2-independent mechanism. We discovered that the drug influences the assembly and stability of preinitiation complexes by targeting the interaction between promoter recognition factor SL1 and the rRNA promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2163876340,"Growth hormone (GH) is a major anabolic hormone and the primary regulator of organism growth. Its transcription is triggered by GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) through the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and by caloric intake. In contrast, the deacetylase Sirt1 is activated by caloric restriction. Therefore, the present study investigates how Sirt1 affects CREB function and GH synthesis. Sirt1 pharmacological activation with resveratrol (IC₅₀=87 μM) suppressed GHRH-induced GH secretion from rat anterior pituitary cells in vivo and in vitro, while vehicle controls showed no effect. Resveratrol's effects were abolished after knocking down Sirt1 with RNA interference, but not in control scrambled siRNA-transfected rat somatotrophs, confirming the Sirt1 specificity. Sirt1 activation and overexpression suppressed forskolin-induced CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation, but no effect was seen with vehicle and empty plasmid controls. The deacetylase-dead mutant Sirt1 retained CREB-Ser(133) phosphorylation by keeping protein phosphatase protein phosphatase 1 activity low. Sirt1 activation suppressed glycogen synthase kinase 3 β acetylation, and a mutation on the GSK3β-Lys(205) residue mimicking a hypoacetylated form revealed increased activity. In summary, this is a novel mechanism through which Sirt1 intercepts the cAMP pathway by suppressing CREB transcriptional activation, resulting in decreased GH synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1975287780,"Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) is a crucial proangiogenic factor, which regulates blood vessel supply under physiologic and pathologic conditions. The VEGF mRNA 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) bears internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), which confer sustained VEGF mRNA translation under hypoxia when 5'-cap-dependent mRNA translation is inhibited. VEGF IRES-mediated initiation of translation requires the modulated interaction of trans-acting factors. To identify trans-acting factors that control VEGF mRNA translation under hypoxic conditions we established an in vitro translation system based on human adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7). Cytoplasmic extracts of MCF-7 cells grown under hypoxia (1% oxygen) recapitulate VEGF IRES-mediated reporter mRNA translation. Employing the VEGF mRNA 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR in an RNA affinity approach we isolated interacting proteins from translational active MCF-7 extract prepared from cells grown under normoxia or hypoxia. Interestingly, mass spectrometry analysis identified the DEAD-box RNA helicase 6 (DDX6) that interacts with the VEGF mRNA 5'-UTR. Recombinant DDX6 inhibits VEGF IRES-mediated translation in normoxic MCF-7 extract. Under hypoxia the level of DDX6 declines, and its interaction with VEGF mRNA is diminished in vivo. Depletion of DDX6 by RNAi further promotes VEGF expression in MCF-7 cells. Increased secretion of VEGF from DDX6 knockdown cells positively affects vascular tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Our results indicate that the decrease of DDX6 under hypoxia contributes to the activation of VEGF expression and promotes its proangiogenic function."

https://openalex.org/W2146587528,"Resolution of neutrophilia characteristic of acute inflammation requires cessation of neutrophil recruitment and removal of tissue neutrophils. Based on in vitro studies, a role in these events was hypothesized for oxidant-generated lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) on recruited neutrophils signaling via the G2A receptor on macrophages. Peritoneal exudate neutrophils harvested from wild type (WT) mice had 5-fold more lyso-PS (lyso-PS(high)) than those of gp91(phox)(-/-) (lyso-PS(low)) mice. Ex vivo engulfment of lyso-PS(high) neutrophils (95% viable) by WT peritoneal macrophages was quantitatively similar to UV-irradiated apoptotic blood neutrophils, although the signaling pathway for the former was uniquely dependent on macrophage G2A. In contrast, lyso-PS(low) neutrophils were poorly engulfed unless presented with exogenous lyso-PS. Enhanced clearance of lyso-PS(high) neutrophils was also seen in vivo following their adoptive transfer into inflamed peritonea of WT but not G2A(-/-) mice, further supporting a requirement for signaling via G2A. To investigate downstream effects of lyso-PS/G2A signaling, antibody blockade of G2A in WT mice reduced macrophage CD206 expression and efferocytosis during peritonitis. Conversely, adoptive transfer of lyso-PS(high) neutrophils early in inflammation in gp91(phox)(-/-) mice led to accelerated development of efferocytic(high) and CD206(high) macrophages. This macrophage reprogramming was associated with suppressed production of pro-inflammatory mediators and reduced neutrophilia. These effects were not seen if G2A was blocked or lyso-PS(low) neutrophils were transferred. Taken together, the results demonstrate that oxidant-generated lyso-PS made by viable tissue neutrophils is an endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator working in vivo to orchestrate the ""early"" and rapid clearance of recruited neutrophils as well as the reprogramming of ""resolving"" macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2014420515,"Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1) is a ubiquitin receptor containing multiple ubiquitin-related domains including ubiquitin-associated (UBA), ubiquitin-like (UBL) 1, UBL2, and ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX). We previously showed that N-terminal UBA domain recognizes Lys(48)-ubiquitin linkage to recruit polyubiquitinated proteins and that a C-terminal UBX domain interacts with valosin-containing protein (VCP). This study shows that FAF1 interacts only with VCP complexed with Npl4-Ufd1 heterodimer, a requirement for the recruitment of polyubiquitinated proteins to UBA domain. Intriguingly, VCP association to C-terminal UBX domain regulates ubiquitin binding to N-terminal UBA domain without direct interaction between UBA and UBX domains. These interactions are well characterized by structural and biochemical analysis. VCP-Npl4-Ufd1 complex is known as the machinery required for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. We demonstrate here that FAF1 binds to VCP-Npl4-Ufd1 complex via UBX domain and polyubiquitinated proteins via UBA domain to promote endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1978028274,"Ubiquitination plays a key role in trafficking of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC). Previous work indicated that ubiquitination enhances ENaC endocytosis and sorting to lysosomes for degradation. Moreover, a defect in ubiquitination causes Liddle syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension. In this work, we identified a role for USP8 in the control of ENaC ubiquitination and trafficking. USP8 increased ENaC current in Xenopus oocytes and collecting duct epithelia and enhanced ENaC abundance at the cell surface in HEK 293 cells. This resulted from altered endocytic sorting; USP8 abolished ENaC degradation in the endocytic pathway, but it had no effect on ENaC endocytosis. USP8 interacted with ENaC, as detected by co-immunoprecipitation, and it deubiquitinated ENaC. Consistent with a functional role for deubiquitination, mutation of the cytoplasmic lysines of ENaC reduced the effect of USP8 on ENaC cell surface abundance. In contrast to USP8, USP2-45 increased ENaC surface abundance by reducing endocytosis but not degradation. Thus, USP8 and USP2-45 selectively modulate ENaC trafficking at different steps in the endocytic pathway. Together with previous work, the data indicate that the ubiquitination state of ENaC is critical for the regulation of epithelial Na(+) absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2108899532,"Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), generated by PI 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), regulates many critical cellular events. PIP(2) is also known to mediate plasma membrane localization of the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), required for the MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling pathway. Microglia are the primary immune competent cells in brain tissue, and TLR4 is important for microglial activation. However, a functional role for PIP5K and PIP(2) in TLR4-dependent microglial activation remains unclear. Here, we knocked down PIP5Kα, a PIP5K isoform, in a BV2 microglial cell line using stable expression of lentiviral shRNA constructs or siRNA transfection. PIP5Kα knockdown significantly suppressed induction of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-1β, and nitric oxide, by lipopolysaccharide. PIP5Kα knockdown also attenuated signaling events downstream of TLR4 activation, including p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation, NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation, and IκB-α degradation. Complementation of the PIP5Kα knockdown cells with wild type but not kinase-dead PIP5Kα effectively restored the LPS-mediated inflammatory response. We found that PIP5Kα and TIRAP colocalized at the cell surface and interacted with each other, whereas kinase-dead PIP5Kα rendered TIRAP soluble. Furthermore, in LPS-stimulated control cells, plasma membrane PIP(2) increased and subsequently declined, and TIRAP underwent bi-directional translocation between the membrane and cytosol, which temporally correlated with the changes in PIP(2). In contrast, PIP5Kα knockdown that reduced PIP(2) levels disrupted TIRAP membrane targeting by LPS. Together, our results suggest that PIP5Kα promotes TLR4-associated microglial inflammation by mediating PIP(2)-dependent recruitment of TIRAP to the plasma membrane."

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the cumulative effects of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across genes of choline/1-carbon metabolism and functionally related pathways increase susceptibility to developing hepatic steatosis. In biopsy-characterized cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and controls, we assessed 260 SNPs across 21 genes in choline/1-carbon metabolism. When SNPs were examined individually, using logistic regression, we only identified a single SNP (PNPLA3 rs738409) that was significantly associated with severity of hepatic steatosis after adjusting for confounders and multiple comparisons (P=0.02). However, when groupings of SNPs in similar metabolic pathways were defined using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we identified groups of subjects with shared SNP signatures that were significantly correlated with steatosis burden (P=0.0002). The lowest and highest steatosis clusters could also be differentiated by ethnicity. However, unique SNP patterns defined steatosis burden irrespective of ethnicity. Our results suggest that analysis of SNP patterns in genes of choline/1-carbon metabolism may be useful for prediction of severity of steatosis in specific subsets of people, and the metabolic inefficiencies caused by these SNPs should be examined further.—Corbin, K.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) on hematopoietic and skeletal actions of PTH. In the bone microenvironment, PTH stimulated sIL-6R protein levels in primary osteoblast cultures in vitro and bone marrow in vivo in both IL-6(+/+) and IL-6(-/-) mice. PTH-mediated hematopoietic cell expansion was attenuated in IL-6(-/-) compared with IL-6(+/+) bone marrow, whereas sIL-6R treatment amplified PTH actions in IL-6(-/-) earlier than IL-6(+/+) marrow cultures. Blocking sIL-6R signaling with sgp130 (soluble glycoprotein 130 receptor) inhibited PTH-dependent hematopoietic cell expansion in IL-6(-/-) marrow. In the skeletal system, although intermittent PTH administration to IL-6(+/+) and IL-6(-/-) mice resulted in similar anabolic actions, blocking sIL-6R significantly attenuated PTH anabolic actions. sIL-6R showed no direct effects on osteoblast proliferation or differentiation in vitro; however, it up-regulated myeloid cell expansion and production of the mesenchymal stem cell recruiting agent, TGF-β1 in the bone marrow microenvironment. Collectively, sIL-6R demonstrated orphan function and mediated PTH anabolic actions in bone in association with support of myeloid lineage cells in the hematopoietic system."

https://openalex.org/W2145136803,"Pyogenic Arthritis, Pyoderma Gangrenosum, and Acne Syndrome (PAPA syndrome) is an autoinflammatory disease caused by aberrant production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1. Mutations in the gene encoding proline serine threonine phosphatase-interacting protein-1 (PSTPIP1) have been linked to PAPA syndrome. PSTPIP1 is an adaptor protein that interacts with PYRIN, the protein encoded by the Mediterranean Fever (MEFV) gene whose mutations cause Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). However, the pathophysiological function of PSTPIP1 remains to be elucidated. We have generated mouse strains that either are PSTPIP1 deficient or ectopically express mutant PSTPIP1. Results from analyzing these mice suggested that PSTPIP1 is not an essential regulator of the Nlrp3, Aim2, or Nlrc4 inflammasomes. Although common features of human PAPA syndrome such as pyogenic arthritis and skin inflammation were not recapitulated in the mouse model, ectopic expression of the mutant but not the wild type PSTPIP1 in mice lead to partial embryonic lethality, growth retardation, and elevated level of circulating proinflammatory cytokines."

With the goal of developing a general approach for identification of novel PLC inhibitors, we developed a high-throughput assay based on the fluorogenic substrate reporter WH-15. The assay is highly sensitive and reproducible: screening a chemical library of 6280 compounds identified three novel PLC inhibitors that exhibited potent activities in two separate assay formats with purified PLC isozymes in vitro. Two of the three inhibitors also inhibited G protein-coupled receptor-stimulated PLC activity in intact cell systems. These results demonstrate the power of the high-throughput assay for screening large collections of small molecules to identify novel PLC modulators. Potent and selective modulators of PLCs will ultimately be useful for dissecting the roles of PLCs in cellular processes, as well as provide lead compounds for the development of drugs to treat diseases arising from aberrant phospholipase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2006742766,"Since the elucidation of the myoglobin (Mb) structure, a histidine residue on the E helix (His-E7) has been proposed to act as a gate with an open or closed conformation controlling access to the active site. Although it is believed that at low pH, the His-E7 gate is in its open conformation, the full relationship between the His-E7 protonation state, its conformation, and ligand migration in Mb is hotly debated. We used molecular dynamics simulations to first address the effect of His-E7 protonation on its conformation. We observed the expected shift from the closed to the open conformation upon protonation, but more importantly, noted a significant difference between the conformations of the two neutral histidine tautomers. We further computed free energy profiles for oxygen migration in each of the possible His-E7 states as well as in two instructive Mb mutants: Ala-E7 and Trp-E7. Our results show that even in the closed conformation, the His-E7 gate does not create a large barrier to oxygen migration and permits oxygen entry with only a small rotation of the imidazole side chain and movement of the E helix. We identify, instead, a hydrophobic site in the E7 channel that can accommodate an apolar diatomic ligand and enhances ligand uptake particularly in the open His-E7 conformation. This rate enhancement is diminished in the closed conformation. Taken together, our results provide a new conceptual framework for the histidine gate hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2159164710,"Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) associated with a variety of pathologies. However, the therapeutic potential of PAR2 is limited by a lack of potent and specific ligands. Following proteolytic cleavage, PAR2 is activated through a tethered ligand. Hence, we reasoned that lipidation of peptidomimetic ligands could promote membrane targeting and thus significantly improve potency and constructed a series of synthetic tethered ligands (STLs). STLs contained a peptidomimetic PAR2 agonist (2-aminothiazol-4-yl-LIGRL-NH2) bound to a palmitoyl group (Pam) via polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers. In a high-throughput physiological assay, these STL agonists displayed EC50 values as low as 1.47 nM, representing a ~200 fold improvement over the untethered parent ligand. Similarly, these STL agonists were potent activators of signaling pathways associated with PAR2: EC50 for Ca2+ response as low as 3.95 nM; EC50 for MAPK response as low as 9.49 nM. Moreover, STLs demonstrated significant improvement in potency in vivo, evoking mechanical allodynia with an EC50 of 14.4 pmol. STLs failed to elicit responses in PAR2 cells at agonist concentrations of >300-fold their EC50 values.

Treatment of proteasome inhibitor, MG132, blocked high glucose-induced AMPKα2 down-regulation. Endogenous AMPKα2 ubiquitination was detected by immunoprecipitation of AMPKα2 followed by immunoblotting detection of ubiquitin.

Interaction between AMPKα2 and WWP1 was validated by co-immunoprecipitation. Knockdown of WWP1 blocked high glucose-induced AMPKα2 down-regulation. The overexpression of WWP1 down-regulated AMPKα2. In addition, the expression of WWP1 is increased under high glucose culture conditions in both mRNA and protein levels. The level of AMPKα2 was down-regulated in the quadriceps muscle of diabetic animal model db/db mice. Expression of WWP1 blocked metformin-induced glucose uptake.

HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) is released from infected cells and has the ability to recruit microglia. The purpose of this study was to investigate molecular mechanisms by which recombinant Tat1-72, but not heated-inactive Tat1-72, induces migration of rat primary microglia. Using primary microglia in Boyden chambers, we demonstrated the role of nonmuscle myosin light-chain kinase (nmMYLK) in Tat1-72 (14.4 nM)-mediated increased microglial migration (up to 171.85%). These findings were validated using microglia isolated from wild-type (WT) or nmMYLK–/– mice in Dunn chamber assays. Tat1-72-mediated activation of nmMYLK resulted in “inside-out” activation of β1 integrin, followed by “outside-in” activation of c-Src, Pyk2, and Cdc42-GTP (using G-LISA in primary and nmMYLK–/– microglia) and, subsequently, actin polymerization (flow cytometry and Western blot assays). In vivo corroboration of these findings demonstrated decreased migration of nmMYLK–/– microglia (2×105 cells transplanted into corpus callosum) compared with WT microglia toward microinjected Tat1-72 (2 μg/mouse) in hippocampus.

DSP and PP are synthesized as part of a single secreted precursor, DSP-PP, which is conserved in marsupial and placental mammals. Using a baculovirus expression system, we previously found that DSP-PP is accurately cleaved into DSP and PP after secretion into medium by an endogenous, secreted, zinc-dependent Sf9 cell activity. Here we report that mutation of conserved residues near and distant from the G(447)↓D(448) cleavage site in DSP-PP(240) had dramatic effects on cleavage efficiency by the endogenous Sf9 cell processing enzyme. We found that: 1) mutation of residues flanking the cleavage site from P(4) to P(4)' blocked, impaired, or enhanced DSP-PP(240) cleavage; 2) certain conserved amino acids distant from the cleavage site were important for precursor cleavage; 3) modification of the C terminus by appending a C-terminal tag altered the pattern of processing; and 4) mutations in DSP-PP(240) had similar effects on cleavage by recombinant human BMP1, a candidate physiological processing enzyme, as was seen with the endogenous Sf9 cell activity. An analysis of a partial TLR1 cDNA from Sf9 cells indicates that residues that line the substrate-binding cleft of Sf9 TLR1 and human BMP1 are nearly perfectly conserved, offering an explanation of why Sf9 cells so accurately process mammalian DSP-PP. The fact that several mutations in DSP-PP(240) significantly modified the amount of PP(240) product generated from DSP-PP(240) precursor protein cleavage suggests that such mutation may affect the mineralization process."

This isoform is a 514-amino acid protein containing a C-terminal 59-amino acid that is distinct from the rCLCA-f sequence. Immunohistochemistry revealed rCLCA-t to be located in the basal cells of the rat submandibular gland excretory duct and the stratum basale of rat epidermis, whereas rCLCA-f was detected in cells during the process of differentiation. In a heterologous expression system, rCLCA-t was found to be a membrane protein present predominantly in the perinuclear region, and not to be either present on the cell surface or secreted. rCLCA-t failed to enhance ionomycin-induced Cl(-) conductance (unlike rCLCA-f). When compared with rCLCA-f, it weakened cell attachment to a greater extent and in a manner that was evidently modulated by intracellular Ca(2+), protein kinase C, and β(1)-integrin. rCLCA-t was found to associate with RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase) and to reduce expression of mature β(1)-integrin. Treatment of rat skin with rCLCA-t siRNA increased the expression of β(1)-integrin in the stratum basale of the epidermis. These results are consistent with cell-specific splicing of rCLCA mRNA playing a role in the modulation of the adhesive potential of undifferentiated epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087778493,"Cardiolipin is a glycerophospholipid found predominantly in the mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotes and in bacterial membranes. Cardiolipin interacts with protein complexes and plays pivotal roles in cellular energy metabolism, membrane dynamics, and stress responses. We recently identified the mitochondrial phosphatase, PTPMT1, as the enzyme that converts phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) to phosphatidylglycerol, a critical step in the de novo biosynthesis of cardiolipin. Upon examination of PTPMT1 evolutionary distribution, we found a PTPMT1-like phosphatase in the bacterium Rhodopirellula baltica. The purified recombinant enzyme dephosphorylated PGP in vitro. Moreover, its expression restored cardiolipin deficiency and reversed growth impairment in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant lacking the yeast PGP phosphatase, suggesting that it is a bona fide PTPMT1 ortholog. When ectopically expressed, this bacterial PGP phosphatase was localized in the mitochondria of yeast and mammalian cells. Together, our results demonstrate the conservation of function between bacterial and mammalian PTPMT1 orthologs."

Currently, trial requirements can be relaxed if doing so is in the 'public interest', but a clearer definition of what this means is needed before this provision should be used."
