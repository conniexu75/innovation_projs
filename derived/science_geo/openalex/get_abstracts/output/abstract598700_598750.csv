Here, we show that force applied to the nucleus directly drives YAP nuclear translocation by decreasing the mechanical restriction of nuclear pores to molecular transport. Exposure to a stiff environment leads cells to establish a mechanical connection between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton, allowing forces exerted through focal adhesions to reach the nucleus. Force transmission then leads to nuclear flattening, which stretches nuclear pores, reduces their mechanical resistance to molecular transport, and increases YAP nuclear import. The restriction to transport is further regulated by the mechanical stability of the transported protein, which determines both active nuclear transport of YAP and passive transport of small proteins.

Both biochemical and mechanical cues control YAP’s main regulatory mechanism, which is its localization in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus, where it binds to and activates TEAD transcription factors (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao B.

At the biochemical level, YAP is regulated by the Hippo signaling pathway, largely through its phosphorylation (Meng et al., 2016Meng Z. Moroishi T. Guan K.L. Mechanisms of Hippo pathway regulation.Genes Dev. 2016; 30: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). At the mechanical level, YAP is regulated by mechanical cues such as extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity, strain, shear stress, or adhesive area (Aragona et al., 2013Aragona M. Panciera T. Manfrin A.

This mechanical regulation requires cytoskeletal integrity (Das et al., 2016Das A. Fischer R.S. Pan D. Waterman C.M.

Oria R. Chen Y. Kosmalska A. Pérez-González C. Castro N. Zhu C. Trepat X. Roca-Cusachs P. Mechanical regulation of a molecular clutch defines force transmission and transduction in response to matrix rigidity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Finally, the Linker of the Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the impairment of which decreases nuclear YAP concentration (Driscoll et al., 2015Driscoll T.P. Cosgrove B.D. Heo S.J. Shurden Z.E. Mauck R.L. Cytoskeletal to nuclear strain transfer regulates YAP signaling in mesenchymal stem cells.Biophys. J. 2015; 108: 2783-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Further, this mechanical regulation also depends on nuclear transport, since YAP localizes to the nucleus regardless of mechanical cues when active nuclear export is blocked (Dupont et al., 2011Dupont S. Morsut L. Aragona M. Enzo E. Giulitti S. Cordenonsi M. Zanconato F. Le Digabel J. Forcato M. Bicciato S. et al.Role of YAP/TAZ in mechanotransduction.Nature. 2011; 474: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar). However, the role of those different molecular elements is unclear, and how mechanical signals regulate YAP remains unknown. To start exploring how force regulates YAP, we noted that, among the different cytoskeletal structures involved, talin and the LINC complex are particularly relevant for intracellular mechanical connections. Indeed, talin unfolding leads to focal adhesion and stress fiber formation (Elosegui-Artola et al., 2016Elosegui-Artola A. Oria R. Chen Y. Kosmalska A. Pérez-González C. Castro N. Zhu C. Trepat X. Roca-Cusachs P. Mechanical regulation of a molecular clutch defines force transmission and transduction in response to matrix rigidity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2008Zhang X. Jiang G. Cai Y. Monkley S.J. Critchley D.R. Sheetz M.P. Talin depletion reveals independence of initial cell spreading from integrin activation and traction.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), whereas the LINC complex mechanically couples the nucleus to stress fibers (Lombardi et al., 2011Lombardi M.L. Jaalouk D.E. Shanahan C.M. Burke B. Roux K.J. Lammerding J. The interaction between nesprins and sun proteins at the nuclear envelope is critical for force transmission between the nucleus and cytoskeleton.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 26743-26753Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that talin unfolding and the LINC complex could mechanically couple ECM, focal adhesions, cytoskeleton, and nucleoskeleton, allowing forces to reach the nucleus and directly drive YAP translocation. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated YAP response to ECM rigidity. We used talin 1−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which exhibit a wild-type phenotype due to overexpression of talin (Roca-Cusachs et al., 2009Roca-Cusachs P. Gauthier N.C. Del Rio A. Sheetz M.P. Clustering of alpha(5)beta(1) integrins determines adhesion strength whereas alpha(v)beta(3) and talin enable mechanotransduction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 16245-16250Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2008Zhang X. Jiang G. Cai Y. Monkley S.J. Critchley D.R. Sheetz M.P. Talin depletion reveals independence of initial cell spreading from integrin activation and traction.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) (henceforth referred to as control cells), and knocked down talin 2 using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Figure S1A). We seeded cells on top of polyacrylamide gels of different rigidities coated with fibronectin. In previous work (Elosegui-Artola et al., 2016Elosegui-Artola A. Oria R. Chen Y. Kosmalska A. Pérez-González C. Castro N. Zhu C. Trepat X. Roca-Cusachs P. Mechanical regulation of a molecular clutch defines force transmission and transduction in response to matrix rigidity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), we showed that actomyosin forces unfold talin only above a rigidity threshold, triggering YAP nuclear translocation. Confirming these previous results, YAP was mainly in the cytoplasm in control cells seeded on soft substrates, whereas above the rigidity threshold of 5 kPa, the actin cytoskeleton was reinforced with stress fibers, and YAP translocated to the nucleus (Figures 1A and 1B ). However, when talin 2 was depleted, cells lacked stress fibers and YAP remained in the cytoplasm (Figures 1A and 1B) independently of rigidity. We then determined whether this threshold was related to a mechanical coupling between the cytoskeleton and the nucleus. To this end, we seeded cells on gels and stretched gels bi-directionally using a previously described stretch device (Casares et al., 2015Casares L. Vincent R. Zalvidea D. Campillo N. Navajas D. Arroyo M. Trepat X. Hydraulic fracture during epithelial stretching.Nat. Mater. 2015; 14: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, Kosmalska et al., 2015Kosmalska A.J. Casares L.

Navajas D. et al.Physical principles of membrane remodelling during cell mechanoadaptation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We then measured strain (length increment/original length) for both nuclei and cells and defined the cell/nucleus mechanical coupling as the ratio between nuclear and cellular strain. In talin 2-depleted cells, mechanical coupling was low (close to 0), independently of substrate rigidity. In contrast, the nucleus of control cells was uncoupled on soft substrates but coupled (close to 1) above a rigidity threshold (Figures 1C and 1D). This threshold coincided with that observed for YAP translocation, suggesting that YAP translocation was mediated by forces transmitted to the nucleus.Figure 1Mechanical Coupling between the Cytoskeleton and the Nucleus Is Required for YAP Nuclear TranslocationShow full caption(A) Nuclear/cytosolic YAP ratio in control (red) and talin 2 shRNA (blue) cells plated on fibronectin-coated polyacrylamide gels of increasing rigidity (n ≥ 20 cells per condition).

To verify this possibility, we blocked the LINC complex by transfecting cells with two dominant-negative plasmids (EGFP-Nesprin1-KASH and EGFP-Nesprin2-KASH; Figure S1A) that block the main interaction of the LINC complex, the link between nesprins and sun proteins (Lombardi et al., 2011Lombardi M.L. Jaalouk D.E. Shanahan C.M. Burke B. Roux K.J. Lammerding J. The interaction between nesprins and sun proteins at the nuclear envelope is critical for force transmission between the nucleus and cytoskeleton.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 26743-26753Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2001Zhang Q. Skepper J.N. Yang F. Davies J.D. Hegyi L. Roberts R.G. Weissberg P.L. Ellis J.A. Shanahan C.M. Nesprins: a novel family of spectrin-repeat-containing proteins that localize to the nuclear membrane in multiple tissues.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4485-4498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike talin depletion, blocking the LINC complex did not affect cell-substrate traction forces or focal adhesions (Figures S1B–S1E). However, blocking the LINC complex impaired cell/nuclear mechanical coupling (Figure 1E), the translocation of YAP (Figures 1F and 1G) and its co-factor TAZ (Figure S1F), and one of the main downstream effects of YAP activity, cell proliferation (Figure S1G). As a control, YAP localization was unaffected after nocodazole treatment to depolymerize microtubules (Figures S1H and S1I), discarding an effect mediated by their reported association to the LINC complex (Stewart and Burke, 2014Stewart C.L. Burke B. The missing LINC: a mammalian KASH-domain protein coupling meiotic chromosomes to the cytoskeleton.Nucleus. 2014; 5: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, force transmitted through the LINC complex mediates rigidity-dependent YAP nuclear translocation and downstream effects. To further support this association, we monitored YAP dynamically during cell spreading on a stiff 29-kPa gel after trypsinization. When control cells transfected with EGFP-YAP (Figure S1J) started spreading, we observed that YAP remained mainly in the cytoplasm, while the nucleus continuously rotated, indicating a loose mechanical link to the actin cytoskeleton and the substrate (quantification of nuclear rotation is shown in Figure 1H, and an example appears in Figure 1I) (Kim et al., 2014Kim D.H. Cho S. Wirtz D. Tight coupling between nucleus and cell migration through the perinuclear actin cap.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 2528-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, at a given time point, the rotation of the nucleus dramatically slowed down, coinciding with the onset of YAP nuclear translocation (Figures 1H–1J; Movie S1). We then carried out different experiments to assess whether this mechanical effect was mediated by biochemical regulation of the Hippo pathway. First, we transfected cells with the YAP mutants FLAG-YAP S94A, which prevents YAP binding to the transcription factor TEAD and thereby reduces nuclear localization (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao B. Ye X. Yu J. Li L. Li W. Li S. Yu J. Lin J.D. Wang C.Y. Chinnaiyan A.M. et al.TEAD mediates YAP-dependent gene induction and growth control.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1962-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar), and FLAG-YAP S127A, which has impaired phosphorylation, leading to decreased cytoplasmic retention (Varelas, 2014Varelas X. The Hippo pathway effectors TAZ and YAP in development, homeostasis and disease.Development. 2014; 141: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) (Figure S1K). As expected, FLAG-YAP S94A and FLAG-YAP S127A decreased and increased YAP nuclear localization on stiff substrates, respectively (Figure 1K). However, the rigidity threshold triggering YAP nuclear translocation remained unaltered and, thus, could not be explained by biochemical regulation. Second, we evaluated the effect of rigidity and LINC blockage on the expression levels of YAP and the upstream YAP regulators MST and LATS and on YAP phosphorylation (Figures S1L and S1M). No effects of either rigidity or LINC blockage were observed. Finally, we evaluated YAP localization after overexpressing LATS and MST, both of which promote YAP phosphorylation and, thereby, promote YAP cytoplasmic retention (Piccolo et al., 2014Piccolo S. Dupont S. Cordenonsi M. The biology of YAP/TAZ: hippo signaling and beyond.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). As expected, overexpression of both proteins reduced YAP nuclear localization, but the effect of rigidity was maintained (Figures S1N and S1O). Together, these experiments suggest that forces exerted on ECM adhesions reach the nucleus through the actin cytoskeleton and the LINC complex, triggering YAP nuclear entry independently of the Hippo pathway. Next, we sought to determine whether nuclear force drives YAP translocation directly or requires transmission through the cytoskeleton. To this end, we plated control cells transfected with EGFP-YAP on soft 5-kPa substrates, at a range where the nucleus and the actin cytoskeleton were uncoupled (Figure 1C). Then, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to directly apply a constant force of 1.5 nN to the cell nucleus, using cantilevers with 20-μm spherical tips. Force application to the nucleus increased the nuclear/cytosolic YAP ratio, which returned to initial values upon force release (Figures 2A and 2D ; Movie S2). As a control, nuclear DNA intensity (assessed with a Hoechst dye) remained constant during the experiment, showing that nuclear shape changes induced by force did not affect fluorescence per se (Figure 2A). No differences in YAP ratio were observed when the spherical probe pressed outside the nucleus (Figures 2B and 2E; Movie S2). Force-induced YAP nuclear translocation has been proposed to be mediated by actin cytoskeletal integrity (Das et al., 2016Das A. Fischer R.S. Pan D. Waterman C.M. YAP nuclear localization in the absence of cell-cell contact is mediated by a filamentous actin-dependent, myosin II- and phospho-YAP-independent pathway during extracellular matrix mechanosensing.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 6096-6110Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), F-actin-severing and -capping proteins (Aragona et al., 2013Aragona M. Panciera T. Manfrin A. Giulitti S. Michielin F.

A mechanical checkpoint controls multicellular growth through YAP/TAZ regulation by actin-processing factors.Cell. 2013; 154: 1047-1059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), and talin (Elosegui-Artola et al., 2016Elosegui-Artola A. Oria R. Chen Y. Kosmalska A. Pérez-González C. Castro N. Zhu C. Trepat X. Roca-Cusachs P. Mechanical regulation of a molecular clutch defines force transmission and transduction in response to matrix rigidity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To verify the respective roles of these molecular players versus direct nuclear force, we seeded cells on stiff substrates and abrogated YAP nuclear localization, focal adhesions, and cytoskeletal force transmission by either depolymerizing actin with 2 μM cytochalasin D (Figures S2A–S2F) or depleting talin (Elosegui-Artola et al., 2016Elosegui-Artola A. Oria R. Chen Y. Kosmalska A. Pérez-González C. Castro N. Zhu C. Trepat X. Roca-Cusachs P. Mechanical regulation of a molecular clutch defines force transmission and transduction in response to matrix rigidity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). As expected, both treatments decreased YAP nuclear localization to the levels observed on soft substrates (Figures 1A, 1B, and S2A–S2F ). However, in the case of both cytochalasin D (Figures 2C and 2F; Movie S2) and talin depletion (Figures S2G and S2I; Movie S3), force application to the nucleus with the AFM was sufficient to rescue YAP nuclear localization.Figure S2Cytochalasin Treatment Disrupts Focal Adhesion Formation, Force Transmission, and YAP Nuclear Localization, Related to Figure 2 and Movie S3Show full caption(A) Average traction forces measured on fibronectin-coated gels of 29 kPa by control cells and control cells with 2μM cytochalasin D (n ≥ 13 cells per condition).(B) Length of cell-substrate adhesions measured from pFAK stainings for the same conditions as in A (n ≥ 32 adhesions from ≥ 11 cells per condition).(C) Nuclear/cytosolic YAP ratios for the same conditions as in A (n ≥ 21 cells per condition).(D–F) Corresponding examples of traction force color maps (D), pFAK adhesions and phalloidin stainings (E), and YAP stainings (F).(G) Top: representation of force sequence applied with a spherical cantilever.

Immune evasion represents a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43102) Google Scholar). The majority of cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade therapy, aim to counteract immune evasion by shifting the balance in favor of immune activation, enabling T cell-mediated cancer cell elimination (Schumacher and Schreiber, 2015Schumacher T.N. Schreiber R.D. Neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy.Science. 2015; 348: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). However, only a subset of patients benefit from immunotherapies, emphasizing the need to identify the genomic and molecular determinants underpinning immune evasion. Recent work has highlighted the importance of cancer-specific neoantigens in determining cytolytic and T cell activity as well as predicting efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition (Brown et al., 2014Brown S.D.

A critical step in neoantigen presentation and cytolytic T cell response is governed by class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which presents intra-cellular peptides on the cell surface for recognition by T cell receptors. Each individual’s genome contains up to six distinct HLA class I alleles, encoded by three genes (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C), located on the homologous paternal and maternal chromosome 6. Downregulation of HLA genes may result in reduced antigen presentation and thus facilitate immune evasion. HLA downregulation, characterized by immunohistochemistry or monoclonal antibodies, has been found to be prevalent across a range of cancer types and has also been linked to poor outcome (Campoli and Ferrone, 2008Campoli M.

Immunother. 2008; 57: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Loss of either the maternal or paternal HLA haplotype may also impact upon the efficacy of immunotherapy. An intriguing report documented loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the HLA locus, with loss of HLA-C∗08:02 in the resistant lesion from a tumor treated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes composed of T cell clones targeting KRAS G12D (Tran et al., 2016Tran E. Robbins P.F. Lu Y.C. Prickett T.D. Gartner J.J. Jia L. Pasetto A. Zheng Z. Ray S. Groh E.M. et al.T-cell transfer therapy targeting mutant KRAS in cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Because the presence of the HLA-C∗08:02 allele was required for presentation of the KRAS G12D neoantigen and tumor recognition by T cells, its loss was proposed to directly enable immune evasion. However, the impact of loss of an HLA haplotype on anti-tumor immunity, clonal expansions, and neoantigen prediction has not been systematically explored as the polymorphic nature of the HLA locus prevents alignments of sequencing reads to the human reference genome and inference of copy number. To this end, we developed LOHHLA (loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigen), a computational tool permitting allele-specific copy number estimation of the HLA locus from next-generation sequencing data. Building upon previous work imputing HLA haplotypes from sequencing data (Shukla et al., 2015Shukla S.A. Rooney M.S. Rajasagi M. Tiao G. Dixon P.M. Lawrence M.S. Stevens J. Lane W.J. Dellagatta J.L.

In order to determine allele-specific copy number, the majority of copy-number tools rely on the relative coverage and variant allele frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the tumor and matched normal across the genome or exome (Carter et al., 2012Carter S.L.

USA. 2010; 107: 16910-16915Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). However, inferring copy number status at the HLA locus is problematic due to poor coverage and the polymorphic nature of the region. SNPs cannot readily be identified at the HLA locus using sequencing data that has been aligned to the human reference genome, as reads that are highly polymorphic will not align and will therefore be discarded. Indeed, despite being one of the most polymorphic regions of the human genome, an average of <1 (mean 0.84, range 0–7) informative heterozygous SNP in the three HLA class I genes was identified in 96 patients where copy-number analysis was possible from the TRACERx cohort (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017Jamal-Hanjani M. Wilson G.A. McGranahan N. Birkbak N.J. Watkins T.B.K. Veeriah S. Shafi S. Johnson D.H. Mitter R. Rosenthal R. et al.TRACERx ConsortiumTracking the Evolution of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 2109-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) using the state-of-the-art SNP caller Platypus (Rimmer et al., 2014Rimmer A. Phan H. Mathieson I. Iqbal Z. Twigg S.R.F. Wilkie A.O.M. McVean G. Lunter G. Lunter G. WGS500 ConsortiumIntegrating mapping-, assembly- and haplotype-based approaches for calling variants in clinical sequencing applications.Nat. Genet. 2014; 46: 912-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). These data suggest that conventional copy-number calling algorithms are not suited to directly infer haplotype-specific copy number of the HLA locus. We reasoned that, by leveraging the reads that map specifically to an individual’s germline HLA alleles rather than the human reference genome, it would be possible to accurately determine HLA haplotype-specific copy number. To achieve this, we developed the computational tool LOHHLA (Figure 1A). Implementation of LOHHLA relies upon five steps. First, tumor and germline reads that map to the HLA region of the genome and chromosome 6, including contigs, are extracted. Second, tumor and germline HLA allele-specific .bam files are generated by aligning reads to patient-specific HLA alleles (obtained from HLA serotyping or an inference tool, e.g., Polysolver [Shukla et al., 2015Shukla S.A. Rooney M.S. Rajasagi M. Tiao G. Dixon P.M. Lawrence M.S. Stevens J. Lane W.J. Dellagatta J.L. Steelman S. et al.Comprehensive analysis of cancer-associated somatic mutations in class I HLA genes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar] or Optitype [Szolek et al., 2014Szolek A. Schubert B. Mohr C. Sturm M. Feldhahn M. Kohlbacher O. OptiType: precision HLA typing from next-generation sequencing data.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30: 3310-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar]). Third, polymorphic sites between homologous HLA alleles are identified. Fourth, tumor coverage relative to germline (logR) and b-allele frequencies (BAF) are inferred at each HLA locus, making use of identified polymorphic sites. Finally, HLA allele-specific copy number is determined for each HLA gene, accounting for stromal contamination. To the best of our knowledge, no other computational method currently exists to infer haplotype-specific copy number of the HLA locus, and as such, there is no gold-standard with which we can compare LOHLA copy-number estimation or inference of which HLA haplotype is subject to loss. Therefore, to test the accuracy of HLA copy-number estimation, we made the assumption that genomic segments adjacent to the HLA locus will often exhibit the same copy-number profile as the HLA locus itself, which holds for cases without a highly focal HLA event (Figure S1D). We therefore used ASCAT (Van Loo et al., 2010Van Loo P. Nordgard S.H. Lingjærde O.C. Russnes H.G. Rye I.H. Sun W. Weigman V.J. Marynen P. Zetterberg A. Naume B. et al.Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 16910-16915Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) to estimate the frequency of allelic imbalance and LOH in the genomic regions surrounding the HLA locus in 288 TRACERx non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exomes from 96 patients (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017Jamal-Hanjani M. Wilson G.A. McGranahan N. Birkbak N.J. Watkins T.B.K. Veeriah S. Shafi S. Johnson D.H. Mitter R. Rosenthal R. et al.TRACERx ConsortiumTracking the Evolution of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 2109-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) and compared these to LOHHLA copy-number estimation. Notably, given that ASCAT is not designed to infer which HLA haplotype is subject to loss or imbalance, for this analysis, we could only compare whether ASCAT and LOHHLA exhibited concordant copy-number profiles not whether concordant haplotypes were predicted to be lost. We observed a highly significant relationship between the minor and major allele copy-number estimates obtained from LOHHLA and ASCAT (p = 1.36e-115, rho = 0.70, Spearman’s rank test; Figures 1B and S1A), supporting the utility of LOHHLA to accurately estimate copy number and LOH. We found concordant allelic imbalance estimates in 246/288 tumor regions (Figures 1C, S1B, and S1C). Thirty-four additional allelic imbalance events in tumor regions were uncovered using LOHHLA while only 8 tumor regions exhibited evidence of allelic imbalance using ASCAT and not LOHHLA. In many cases, the discrepancies between ASCAT and LOHHLA could be explained by the fact that ASCAT cannot directly infer haplotype-specific copy number at the HLA locus, and thus, the copy number of either the 5′ or 3′ adjacent segment is erroneously assumed to cover the HLA locus (Figure S1D). Concordant LOH inference, where either the maternal or paternal allele was deleted, was observed in 258/288 tumor regions, with additional LOH defined by LOHHLA identified in 21 tumor regions, while 9 tumor regions were identified as harboring a lost haplotype by ASCAT and not LOHHLA (Figures 1D and S1C). To further validate LOHHLA using an approach independent of exome sequencing, we performed PCR-based fragment analysis of highly polymorphic stretches of DNA in close proximity to the HLA locus in 82 tumor regions from 27 tumors (Figure S2). Tumor regions analyzed were either predicted to have all loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) subject to LOH, or no loci affected. Supporting the utility of LOHHLA to accurately classify LOH, we observed significant differences in normalized allelic ratio between tumors classified as exhibiting LOH, allelic imbalance without LOH, or no observable imbalance (p = 1.07e-19 [LOH versus no imbalance], p = 4.57e-05 [LOH versus allelic imbalance]; Figure S2). Furthermore, the distinction between these three categories was clearer using LOHHLA than the copy-number tools ASCAT (Van Loo et al., 2010Van Loo P. Nordgard S.H. Lingjærde O.C. Russnes H.G. Rye I.H. Sun W. Weigman V.J. Marynen P. Zetterberg A. Naume B. et al.Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 16910-16915Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), Sequenza (Favero et al., 2015Favero F. Joshi T. Marquard A.M. Birkbak N.J. Krzystanek M. Li Q. Szallasi Z. Eklund A.C. Sequenza: allele-specific copy number and mutation profiles from tumor sequencing data.Ann. Oncol. 2015; 26: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), or TITAN (Ha et al., 2014Ha G. Roth A. Khattra J. Ho J. Yap D. Prentice L.M. Melnyk N. McPherson A. Bashashati A. Laks E. et al.TITAN: inference of copy number architectures in clonal cell populations from tumor whole-genome sequence data.Genome Res. 2014; 24: 1881-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). Taken together, these data suggest that LOHHLA is able to accurately infer both allelic imbalance and LOH in tumor samples. While it may be possible to infer whether the HLA locus is subject to allelic imbalance and/or LOH in the majority of cases using copy-number tools such as ASCAT (Van Loo et al., 2010Van Loo P. Nordgard S.H. Lingjærde O.C. Russnes H.G. Rye I.H. Sun W. Weigman V.J. Marynen P. Zetterberg A. Naume B. et al.Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 16910-16915Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), LOHHLA provides additional sensitivity and specificity to detect these aberrations, even if they are highly focal. Crucially, LOHHLA also infers specifically which HLA allele homolog is subject to loss at each of the three HLA genes, which, to the best of our knowledge, is currently not possible with other tools. HLA mutations, which have the ability to disrupt neoantigen-MHC binding, have been previously described in many cancer types, including NSCLC (Shukla et al., 2015Shukla S.A. Rooney M.S. Rajasagi M. Tiao G. Dixon P.M. Lawrence M.S. Stevens J. Lane W.J. Dellagatta J.L. Steelman S. et al.Comprehensive analysis of cancer-associated somatic mutations in class I HLA genes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, despite being linked to cancer and immune escape, mutations in HLA genes are infrequently detected (Lawrence et al., 2014Lawrence M.S. Stojanov P. Mermel C.H. Robinson J.T. Garraway L.A. Golub T.R. Meyerson M. Gabriel S.B. Lander E.S. Getz G.

Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In our cohort of 90 lung adenocarcinoma or lung squamous cell carcinoma TRACERx patients, only tumors from three patients were found to harbor nonsynonymous mutations in HLA genes using Polysolver (Shukla et al., 2015Shukla S.A. Rooney M.S. Rajasagi M. Tiao G. Dixon P.M. Lawrence M.S. Stevens J. Lane W.J. Dellagatta J.L. Steelman S. et al.Comprehensive analysis of cancer-associated somatic mutations in class I HLA genes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). One lung adenocarcinoma tumor had also acquired a mutation in β-2 microglobulin (B2m), which is vital for MHC class I expression and peptide binding stability. No further mutations predicted to disrupt antigen presentation or the MHC class I complex were identified in this cohort. Likewise, a broader study of 174 lung squamous cell and 223 lung adenocarcinoma patients from TCGA only classified 8% and 5% of tumors as harboring HLA mutations, respectively (Shukla et al., 2015Shukla S.A. Rooney M.S. Rajasagi M. Tiao G. Dixon P.M. Lawrence M.S. Stevens J. Lane W.J. Dellagatta J.L. Steelman S. et al.Comprehensive analysis of cancer-associated somatic mutations in class I HLA genes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In 36/90 (40%) of NSCLCs LOHHLA identified HLA LOH, where either the maternal or paternal allele was lost, resulting in HLA homozygosity. Just as HLA mutations occur more frequently in lung squamous cell carcinomas (Shukla et al., 2015Shukla S.A. Rooney M.S. Rajasagi M. Tiao G. Dixon P.M. Lawrence M.S. Stevens J. Lane W.J. Dellagatta J.L. Steelman S. et al.Comprehensive analysis of cancer-associated somatic mutations in class I HLA genes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), we also observed an enrichment for HLA LOH in this histological subtype (p = 0.004, 19/31 [61%] of lung squamous cell carcinomas versus 17/59 [29%] of lung adenocarcinomas) (Figures 2A and 2B). The high frequency with which HLA LOH occurs and the possibility of previously antigenic peptides no longer being presented on the lost allele suggests that HLA LOH has the capacity to be a more prevalent mechanism of immune disruption than HLA or B2M mutations. To investigate whether HLA allele-specific loss was an early event in the tumor’s evolution, present clonally in every cancer cell, or whether it was present subclonally, in only a subset of cancer cells, indicating an occurrence later in evolution and potentially in response to a shift in the equilibrium between immune recognition and evasion, we utilized the high-depth and multi-region nature of the TRACERx dataset. In this cohort of early stage NSCLC tumors, HLA LOH appeared to frequently occur subclonally in both histological subtypes, with 13/17 lung adenocarcinoma and 9/17 lung squamous cell carcinomas exhibiting loss of an HLA allele in a subset of cancer cells (Figures 2C and 2D). Clonality of the HLA LOH event could not be determined for two lung squamous cell carcinoma patients with only a single region available for copy-number analysis. Phylogenetic analysis permitted us to map HLA LOH events to probable subclones from the tumor’s evolutionary tree (Figures 2E and 2F) (Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017Jamal-Hanjani M. Wilson G.A. McGranahan N. Birkbak N.J. Watkins T.B.K. Veeriah S. Shafi S. Johnson D.H. Mitter R. Rosenthal R. et al.TRACERx ConsortiumTracking the Evolution of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 2109-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). These data suggest that selective pressure from the immune system may increase during tumor development and also that without multi-region sequencing, the prevalence of HLA LOH may be significantly underestimated. To shed further light on the timing of HLA LOH in NSCLC tumor evolution, we obtained sequencing data for 37 NSCLC primary tumors with matched brain metastases (Brastianos et al., 2015Brastianos P.K. Carter S.L. Santagata S. Cahill D.P. Taylor-Weiner A. Jones R.T. Van Allen E.M. Lawrence M.S. Horowitz P.M. Cibulskis K. et al.Genomic characterization of brain metastases reveals branched evolution and potential therapeutic targets.Cancer Discov. 2015; 5: 1164-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Consistent with data from early stage NSCLC, we identified HLA LOH in 17/37 (46%) tumors and found that the LOH event occurred subclonally in 11/17 (65%) cases in which it occurred (Figure 2G). Furthermore, when we compared primary and metastatic samples taken from the same patient, we observed a trend toward enrichment of HLA LOH in brain metastases compared to the matched primary tumor (p = 0.08, McNemar’s test), with seven patients harboring HLA LOH in the metastatic sample alone and only one patient where the converse was observed, with HLA LOH in the primary tumor alone (Figure 2H). These results support the notion of HLA LOH occurring later in cancer evolution and indicate that there may be selection for immune evasive mechanisms in late stage disease. Given the relevance to immune evasion and high incidence of both clonal and subclonal LOH in HLA genes, we asked whether HLA LOH was significantly more frequent than expected by chance. Taking the frequency of LOH in every tumor into account, we simulated the expected frequencies of both focal and arm-level events. The observed incidence of focal, but not arm-level, HLA LOH occurred at a significantly greater frequency than expected by chance (Figures 3, p < 0.001, and S3). Indeed, we observed a clear peak in focal LOH centered around the HLA locus for both histological subtypes. This peak was more pronounced when restricting the analysis to subclonal LOH (Figure S3). Thus, while chromosomal instability may lead to LOH at the HLA locus, facilitating immune escape, the high prevalence of HLA LOH, beyond that expected by chance, suggests it is subject to significant positive selection in tumor evolution.Figure S3Arm-Level and Focal Subclonal LOH across the Genome, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A and B) Arm-level LOH across the genome for lung adenocarcinoma (A) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (B).

Moreover, in keeping with a strong selective pressure later in tumor evolution, in four tumors we observed losses of HLA haplotypes occurring as distinct events on separate branches of the tumors’ phylogenetic trees, indicative of parallel evolution with convergence upon HLA loss (Figure 3C). Of note, in all four cases where we observed parallel evolution, the same alleles were subject to loss on distinct branches, suggesting that loss of these alleles specifically may have been required for subclonal expansions. We also noted that in certain cases (e.g., CRUK0051) only one HLA gene was subject to allele-specific loss, implying a selective benefit of perturbations to neoantigen presentation associated with that gene specifically.

Co-occurring genetic alterations influence clinical outcomes and underscore the need for combination therapies. A widespread approach to modern cancer therapy is to identify a single oncogenic driver gene and target its mutant-protein product (for example, EGFR-inhibitor treatment in EGFR-mutant lung cancers). However, genetically driven resistance to targeted therapy limits patient survival. Through genomic analysis of 1,122 EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell-free DNA samples and whole-exome analysis of seven longitudinally collected tumor samples from a patient with EGFR-mutant lung cancer, we identified critical co-occurring oncogenic events present in most advanced-stage EGFR-mutant lung cancers. We defined new pathways limiting EGFR-inhibitor response, including WNT/β-catenin alterations and cell-cycle-gene (CDK4 and CDK6) mutations. Tumor genomic complexity increases with EGFR-inhibitor treatment, and co-occurring alterations in CTNNB1 and PIK3CA exhibit nonredundant functions that cooperatively promote tumor metastasis or limit EGFR-inhibitor response. This study calls for revisiting the prevailing single-gene driver-oncogene view and links clinical outcomes to co-occurring genetic alterations in patients with advanced-stage EGFR-mutant lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2767983921,"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and type I interferons (IFNs) protect against infections and cancer, but excessive IRF3 activation and type I IFN production cause autoinflammatory conditions such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and STING-associated vasculopathy of infancy (SAVI). Myocardial infarction (MI) elicits inflammation, but the dominant molecular drivers of MI-associated inflammation remain unclear. Here we show that ischemic cell death and uptake of cell debris by macrophages in the heart fuel a fatal response to MI by activating IRF3 and type I IFN production. In mice, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of 4,215 leukocytes isolated from infarcted and non-infarcted hearts showed that MI provokes activation of an IRF3-interferon axis in a distinct population of interferon-inducible cells (IFNICs) that were classified as cardiac macrophages. Mice genetically deficient in cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), its adaptor STING, IRF3, or the type I IFN receptor IFNAR exhibited impaired interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and, in the case of mice deficient in IRF3 or IFNAR, improved survival after MI as compared to controls. Interruption of IRF3-dependent signaling resulted in decreased cardiac expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and decreased inflammatory cell infiltration of the heart, as well as in attenuated ventricular dilation and improved cardiac function. Similarly, treatment of mice with an IFNAR-neutralizing antibody after MI ablated the interferon response and improved left ventricular dysfunction and survival. These results identify IRF3 and the type I IFN response as a potential therapeutic target for post-MI cardioprotection."

Avoiding immune destruction is a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Hallmarks of cancer: The next generation.Cell. 2011; 144: 646-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42748) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ability of the immune system to detect and eliminate neoplastic cells is a major deterrent to tumor progression. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that the immune system is capable of eliminating tumors when the mechanisms that tumor cells employ to evade detection are countered (Brahmer et al., 2012Brahmer J.R.

This discovery has motivated new efforts to identify the characteristics of tumors that render them susceptible to immunotherapy (Rizvi et al., 2015Rizvi N.A. Hellmann M.D. Snyder A. Kvistborg P.

Molecular and genetic properties of tumors associated with local immune cytolytic activity.Cell. 2015; 160: 48-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Less attention has been directed toward the role of the immune system in shaping the tumor genome prior to immune evasion; however, such early interactions may have important implications for the characteristics of the developing tumor. The theory of cancer immunosurveillance dictates that the immune system should exert a negative selective pressure on tumor cell populations through elimination of tumor cells that harbor antigenic mutations or aberrations. Under this model, tumor precursor cells with antigenic variants would be at higher risk for immune elimination and, conversely, tumor cell populations that continue to expand should be biased toward cells that avoid producing neoantigens. In model organisms, there is accumulating experimental evidence supporting that immunosurveillance sculpts the genomes of tumors through detection and elimination of cancer cells early in tumor progression (DuPage et al., 2012DuPage M.

IFNgamma and lymphocytes prevent primary tumour development and shape tumour immunogenicity.Nature. 2001; 410: 1107-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). In humans, the observed frequency of neoantigens has been reported to be unexpectedly low in some tumor types (Rooney et al., 2015Rooney M.S. Shukla S.A. Wu C.J. Getz G. Hacohen N. Molecular and genetic properties of tumors associated with local immune cytolytic activity.Cell. 2015; 160: 48-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar), suggesting that immunoediting could be taking place. However, this phenomenon has been challenging to study systematically because of the temporality of tumor-immune interactions as well as the difficulty accounting for individual differences in antigen presentation. The binding affinity of the MHC-I complex for peptides is a major determinant of antigenicity and depends predominantly on three genes encoded at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus on chromosome 6: HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C (Sidney et al., 2008Sidney J. Peters B. Frahm N. Brander C. Sette A. HLA class I supertypes: A revised and updated classification.BMC Immunol. 2008; 9: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The HLA locus is highly polymorphic, with over 10,000 distinct alleles for the three genes documented to date (Robinson et al., 2015Robinson J. Halliwell J.A. Hayhurst J.D. Flicek P. Parham P. Marsh S.G.E. The IPD and IMGT/HLA database: Allele variant databases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D423-D431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). This diversity raises the possibility that the set of oncogenic mutations that create neoantigens may differ substantially among individuals. Indeed, neoantigens found to drive tumor regression in response to immunotherapy were almost always unique to the responding tumor (Lu and Robbins, 2016Lu Y.-C. Robbins P.F. Targeting neoantigens for cancer immunotherapy.Int. Immunol. 2016; 28: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several studies have also reported that nonsynonymous mutation burden, rather than the presence of any particular mutation, is the common factor among responsive tumors (Rizvi et al., 2015Rizvi N.A. Hellmann M.D. Snyder A. Kvistborg P. Makarov V. Havel J.J. Lee W. Yuan J. Wong P. Ho T.S. et al.Cancer immunology. Mutational landscape determines sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer.Science. 2015; 348: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5531) Google Scholar). The paucity of recurrent oncogenic mutations driving effective responses to immunotherapy is suggestive that these mutations may less frequently be antigenic, possibly as a result of selective pressure by the immune system during tumor development. These observations led us to hypothesize that antigenic oncogenic mutations are eliminated during the early stages of tumor development in a manner that is dependent on the subset of the oncogenic peptidome that can be presented by an individual’s MHC-I. To find evidence in support of our hypothesis, we set out to systematically characterize the interactions between patient MHC-I allele combinations and recurrent cancer mutations for thousands of tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Currently, existing state-of-the-art in silico tools allow prediction of HLA-specific MHC-I peptide binding affinities. We thus needed to first devise a score capable of estimating the qualitative likelihood of MHC-I-based presentation of sequences containing specific mutations based on peptide binding affinities while accounting for each individual’s 6 MHC alleles. We then used this score to study interactions between patient HLA alleles and the corresponding MHC-I binding affinities for over a thousand recurrent mutations in known oncogenes and tumor suppressors, which are likely to be enriched for driver mutations and other early events in cancer development (Bozic et al., 2010Bozic I. Antal T. Ohtsuki H. Carter H. Kim D. Chen S. Karchin R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nowak M.A. Accumulation of driver and passenger mutations during tumor progression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Clonal status of actionable driver events and the timing of mutational processes in cancer evolution.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 283ra54Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that patient MHC-I genotypes directly influence the probability that their tumor will acquire a recurrent oncogenic mutation, providing new evidence that immunoediting of oncogenic mutations occurs in humans and setting the stage for HLA-based precision strategies in cancer prevention and immunotherapy. To study the influence of MHC-I genotype in shaping the genomes of tumors, we developed a qualitative residue-centric presentation score and evaluated its potential to predict whether a sequence containing a residue will be presented on the cell surface. The score relies on aggregating MHC-I binding affinities across possible peptides that include the residue of interest. MHC-I peptide binding affinity predictions were obtained using the NetMHCPan3.0 tool (Vita et al., 2015Vita R. Overton J.A. Greenbaum J.A. Ponomarenko J. Clark J.D. Cantrell J.R. Wheeler D.K. Gabbard J.L. Hix D. Sette A. Peters B. The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) 3.0.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D405-D412Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), and following published recommendations (Nielsen and Andreatta, 2016Nielsen M. Andreatta M. NetMHCpan-3.0; improved prediction of binding to MHC class I molecules integrating information from multiple receptor and peptide length datasets.Genome Med. 2016; 8: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), peptides receiving a rank threshold <2 and <0.5 were designated MHC-I binders and strong binders respectively. For evaluation of missense mutations, we based our score on the affinities of all 38 possible peptides of length 8–11 that incorporate the amino acid position of interest (Figure 1A), while for insertions and deletions, any resulting novel peptides of length 8–11 were considered (Figure S1A).Figure S1Scoring Residue Presentation Based on Predicted Binding Affinity, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) The number of 8-11-mer peptides that differed from the native sequence for recurrent in-frame indels pan-cancer.(B–E) The distribution of residue-centric presentation scores for MS-observed peptides and randomly selected residues for (B) best rank, (C) summation (rank < 2), (D) summation (rank <0.5), and (E) best rank with cleavage.(F–I) The log of the ratio between the fraction of MS-observed residues and the fraction of random residues detected over regular score intervals for (F) best rank, (G) summation (rank < 2), (H) summation (rank <0.5), and (I) best rank with cleavage.(J) A ROC curve revealing the accuracy of classification for several different presentation scoring schemes.(K) A heatmap showing the AUCs for the 16 alleles for each presentation scoring scheme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) The number of 8-11-mer peptides that differed from the native sequence for recurrent in-frame indels pan-cancer.

We evaluated several strategies for combining peptide affinities to approximate presentation of a specific residue on the cell surface using an existing dataset of peptides bound to MHC-I molecules encoded by 16 different HLA alleles in monoallelic lymphoblastoid cell lines determined using mass spectrometry (MS) (Abelin et al., 2017Abelin J.G. Keskin D.B. Sarkizova S. Hartigan C.R. Zhang W. Sidney J. Stevens J. Lane W. Zhang G.L. Eisenhaure T.M. et al.Mass spectrometry profiling of HLA-associated peptidomes in mono-allelic cells enables more accurate epitope prediction.Immunity. 2017; 46: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), the most comprehensive database of cell surface presented peptides currently available. These strategies included assigning the best rank among peptides, the total number of peptides with rank <2, the total number of peptides with rank <0.5, and the best rank weighted by predicted proteasomal cleavage (Figures S1B–S1K). We then compared the ability of these scores to discriminate these MS-derived residues from a size-matched set of randomly selected residues (STAR Methods). The best rank score (Figure 1B) provided the most reliable prediction that a particular residue position would be included in a sequence presented by the MHC-I on the cell surface (Figure 1C); thus, this score was used for all subsequent analysis. Finally, to test the best rank score’s ability to assess the presentation of cancer-related mutations, we scored the set of expressed mutations in 5 cancer cell lines to predict which would be presented by an HLA-A∗02:01-derived MHC-I (Tables S1A–S1E). Unless a mutation affects an anchor position, a peptide harboring a single amino acid change has a modest impact on peptide binding affinity and should be presented on the cell surface provided that the corresponding native sequence is presented (Tables S1F–S1J). Indeed, analyzing a database of native peptides found in complex with an HLA-A∗02:01 MHC-I in these 5 cell lines, we found that across cell lines, 9.8% of mutations predicted to strongly bind and 4.0% of mutations predicted to bind an HLA-A∗02:01 MHC-I at any strength were also supported by MS-derived peptides (Figure 1D). These experimental results validate the ability of a score derived from MHC-I binding affinities to identify mutations with a higher likelihood of generating neoantigens and support the application of this score to evaluate MHC-I genotype as a determinant of the antigenic potential of recurrent mutations in tumors. To determine whether individual variation in MHC-I genotypes results in patient-level differences in the presentation of mutations in a large human cancer cohort, we called HLA alleles for patients in the TCGA. We successfully assigned HLA-A, -B, and -C allele pairs to 9,176 of 9,839 cancer patients using three algorithms (Figure S2A) (Jia et al., 2013Jia X. Han B. Onengut-Gumuscu S. Chen W.-M.

OptiType: Precision HLA typing from next-generation sequencing data.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30: 3310-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Most alleles were called from the consensus of Optitype and Polysolver, allowing only 1 disagreement out of 6 alleles (Figure S2B), and a minority of patients without exome sequencing data were called based on genotype data using SNP2HLA (STAR Methods; Figure S2C). The remaining patients were successfully called by either Optitype or Polysolver (Figure S2D; Table S2). Only 245 of the known HLA alleles were observed in TCGA patients, and few alleles were present in more than 10% patients (Figures S2E–S2G). Allele frequencies were highly correlated with reported frequencies among healthy individuals of matched ancestry but weakly to allele frequencies of other populations (Figures S2H–S2J). We did not observe any unexpected bias in allele frequencies among cancer patients relative to matched healthy populations. To represent a patient’s ability to present a particular mutation, we devised a score for aggregating the Best Rank scores across the patient’s six MHC-I alleles (Figure 2A). We selected the harmonic mean to combine the six best rank scores across the 6 alleles because it has the desirable property that it is dominated by the minimal value. Thus, the Patient Harmonic-mean Best Rank (PHBR) score is highly influenced by the best allele but also integrates information about presentation by the other alleles. To determine the performance of the PHBR score for predicting actual presentation, an independent MS data was used including 5 cell lines expressing 6 HLA alleles typed to the fourth digit (Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015Bassani-Sternberg M. Pletscher-Frankild S. Jensen L.J. Mann M. Mass spectrometry of human leukocyte antigen class I peptidomes reveals strong effects of protein abundance and turnover on antigen presentation.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2015; 14: 658-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar; Figure 2B). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed from the PHBR scores for each cell line as well as the aggregated scores across the cell lines (Figure 2C) and demonstrated that the PHBR score was indeed predictive of peptide presentation in a multi-allelic setting. We identified a set of 1,018 likely driver mutations based on the criteria that these mutations occur in known oncogenes and tumor suppressors (Davoli et al., 2013Davoli T. Xu A.W. Mengwasser K.E. Sack L.M. Yoon J.C. Park P.J. Elledge S.J. Cumulative haploinsufficiency and triplosensitivity drive aneuploidy patterns and shape the cancer genome.Cell. 2013; 155: 948-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) and are observed in at least 3 tumors in TCGA (STAR Methods; Tables S3A–S3E). We then constructed a matrix of PHBR scores for patients (Figure 3; rows) versus the 1,018 recurrent oncogenic mutations (Figure 3, columns). This matrix provides a high-level view of individual differences in presentation of functional mutations causally implicated in tumorigenesis. Inspection of the PHBR score matrix highlights that some recurrent oncogenic mutations are universally poorly presented by the MHC-I, while others appear to have a high likelihood of being presented in general (Tables S3F and S3G). Over 95 mutations were predicted to have PHBR scores <4 for all patients, but no mutations had PHBR scores <1 across the entire population (Figures S3A and S3B). There was no obvious clustering of mutations according to functional consequence (missense versus indel or loss of function versus gain of function; Figure 3; columns), although distinct amino acid substitutions affecting the same residue tended to be grouped. We also compared patients based on the fraction of the 1,018 recurrent oncogenic mutations that their MHC-I genotype could potentially present. Patients’ mutation coverage ranged from as high as >86% of mutations with PHBR <4 (>39% at PHBR <1) to <54% of mutations receiving a PHBR <4 (<18% at PHBR <1) (Figures S3C and S3D). If MHC-I genotype restricts the oncogenic peptidome exposed to immune surveillance, exposed mutations should be less frequently observed than masked mutations in individual tumors (Figure 4A). As an initial approach, we mapped patient mutation status onto the PHBR score matrix (Figure 3) and divided PHBR scores into two groups: those that corresponded to observed mutations and those that corresponded to unobserved mutations. Comparing PHBR scores between these groups uncovered a bias for observed mutations to have higher PHBR scores (Figure 4B), with the largest differences apparent for PHBR scores <0.5 (Figure 4C). We took two approaches to quantifying the effect of MHC-I genotype on the probability of acquiring mutations, comparing the relationship between PHBR and mutation probability within patients (rows of Figure 3) and across patients (columns of Figure 3). As the logscale PHBR score was approximately linearly related to the logit probability of a mutation (Figures S4A and S4B), we modeled their relationship with an additive logistic regression model with non-linear effects to control for variation in mutation rates among mutations and patients.Figure S4Evaluating the Association between PBR Score and Probability of Mutation, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A and B) Non-parametric estimate of the logit-mutation probability as a function of log-PHBR scores considering mutations ≥ 5 (A) Scatterplot of logit-mutation probability versus log-PHBR.

(D) Error bars denote the 1.5 IQR range. When we analyzed the relationship between log-PHBR and the logit mutation probability within patients, we found that the log-PHBR was positively associated with a significant increase in the odds of a patient acquiring a mutation, supporting that patients have a higher probability of acquiring mutations less effectively presented by their MHC-I (within-patient model; mutation frequency ≥5; odds ratio [OR] = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.25, 1.31]; p < 2e-16) (Table 1). For each unit increase in log-PHBR, the odds of a mutation increases by 28%. The influence of PHBR tended to be stronger for mutations that were observed more frequently, for example, for mutations observed at least 20 times each unit increase in log-PHBR resulted in an odds increase of 54.5% (Table S4). These results demonstrate that the PHBR score is predictive of which recurrent oncogenic mutations are likely to drive an individual’s tumor during the early stages of tumor development pan-cancer.Table 1Quantitative Estimate of the Association between PHBR Score and Mutation OccurrenceWithin ResidueWithin PatientOR95% CIp ValueOR95% CIp Value≥5 mutations1.030.997,1.060.171.281.25, 1.31<2 × 10−16Passenger mutations10.97,1.030.9510.96, 1.030.97Germline variants0.9970.994,0.9990.150.9950.993, 0.9965.8 × 10−10ORs, 95% CIs, and p values are shown for within-mutation and within-patient models relating PHBR score to mutations observed ≥5 times across tumors.

Models relating PHBR score to a set of 1,000 passenger mutations and 1,000 germline variants serve as controls. See also Table S4. The second approach analyzes the relationship between the log-PHBR and logit mutation probability across patients with the same mutation. This formulation evaluates whether the log-PHBR of a mutation has predictive power to determine which patients are at higher risk when the probability of the mutation occurring among patients is already known. This analysis revealed that PHBR was not a significant predictor of which patients would obtain a specific mutation (within-mutation model; mutation frequency ≥5; OR = 1.03; 95% CI [0.99, 1.06]; p < 0.17). The negligible effect of log-PHBR in this setting suggests that its influence is generally already captured by the random effect that models variation in mutation frequency and that incorporates the PHBR influence demonstrated by the within patients analysis. To determine whether PHBR score predictive power is distributed equally among different cancer types, we repeated the analysis within groups of at least 100 patients with a common tumor type (Figures 4D and 4E; all tumor types shown in Figures S4C and S4D). Once again, the within-mutation analysis mostly returned ORs with 95% CIs that included 1, indicating a lack of predictive power (Figure 4D, Table S5A). In clear contrast, the within-patient analysis returned multiple tumor types for which the OR was significantly greater than 1 (Figure 4E; Table S5B). While PHBR was predictive of mutation occurrence within-patient in more than 50% of the tumor types evaluated, there were clear differences in the magnitudes of the ORs, suggesting that PHBR could be more predictive in some tumor types than others. The strongest effects were observed in thyroid cancer (OR = 2.51; 95% CI [2.25, 2.8]), while no association was observed in acute myeloid leukemia, lung squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoma, or clear cell renal carcinoma. Notably, effect sizes were even larger when we considered only mutations observed >20 times across tumors (Figures S4E and S4F; T"

Yet a physiological link between fluctuations in blood oxygenation with those in neuronal signaling pathways is missing. We present evidence from studies on mouse cortex that modulation of vasomotion, i.e., intrinsic ultra-slow (0.1 Hz) fluctuations in arteriole diameter, provides this link. First, ultra-slow fluctuations in neuronal signaling, which occur as an envelope over γ-band activity, entrains vasomotion. Second, optogenetic manipulations confirm that entrainment is unidirectional. Third, co-fluctuations in the diameter of pairs of arterioles within the same hemisphere diminish to chance for separations >1.4 mm. Yet the diameters of arterioles in distant (>5 mm), mirrored transhemispheric sites strongly co-fluctuate; these correlations are diminished in acallosal mice. Fourth, fluctuations in arteriole diameter coherently drive fluctuations in blood oxygenation. Thus, entrainment of vasomotion links neuronal pathways to functional connections."

Here we describe trans-Tango, a technique for anterograde transsynaptic circuit tracing and manipulation. At the core of trans-Tango is a synthetic signaling pathway that is introduced into all neurons in the animal. This pathway converts receptor activation at the cell surface into reporter expression through site-specific proteolysis. Specific labeling is achieved by presenting a tethered ligand at the synapses of genetically defined neurons, thereby activating the pathway in their postsynaptic partners and providing genetic access to these neurons. We first validated trans-Tango in the Drosophila olfactory system and then implemented it in the gustatory system, where projections beyond the first-order receptor neurons are not fully characterized.

Neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system (Ramón y Cajal, 1888Ramón y Cajal S. No Estructura de los centros nerviosos de las aves.Rev. Trim. Histol. Norm. Pat. 1888; 1: 1-10Google Scholar, Sherrington, 1906Sherrington C.S. Observations on the scratch-reflex in the spinal dog.J. Physiol. 1906; 34: 1-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Individual neurons connect to one another via synapses to form neural circuits (De Robertis and Bennett, 1955De Robertis E.D.P. Bennett H.S. Some features of the submicroscopic morphology of synapses in frog and earthworm.J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and the concerted activities of neurons within circuits underlie all brain functions, including perception, cognition, and generation of behavior. Our limited ability to specifically map synaptically connected neurons within circuits, or to selectively manipulate their functions, therefore, poses a major obstacle to understanding the workings of the brain. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, lack the resolution and precision needed to reveal synaptic connectivity, while most molecular genetic techniques are limited to the confines of the neurons for which markers exist. Other methods for circuit mapping, such as paired recording and optogenetic-assisted circuit mapping, are labor intensive and low throughput. Serial electron microscopy is the gold standard for identifying synaptic connections within a circuit, but practical considerations limit the utility of this technique to analyzing small volumes of postmortem tissue. Further, this approach is not suitable for comprehensive analysis of variability among individuals (Briggman and Bock, 2012Briggman K.L. Bock D.D. Volume electron microscopy for neuronal circuit reconstruction.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The use of genetically introduced tracers, such as plant lectins and bacterial toxins, has been invaluable toward understanding neuronal connectivity (Huh et al., 2010Huh Y. Oh M.S. Leblanc P. Kim K.-S. Gene transfer in the nervous system and implications for transsynaptic neuronal tracing.Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2010; 10: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the utility of these tracers is limited by the lack of synaptic specificity and directionality. These tracers are further limited by their spread beyond one neuron and by the resulting dilution of the signal. The most commonly used transsynaptic tracing techniques in vertebrates rely on replication-deficient neurotropic viruses that are restricted to genetically defined neurons within a circuit (Callaway and Luo, 2015Callaway E.M. Luo L. Monosynaptic circuit tracing with glycoprotein-deleted rabies viruses.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8979-8985Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). While most neurotropic viruses transport only in the retrograde direction, some anterograde viral tracers have been developed (Lo and Anderson, 2011Lo L. Anderson D.J. A Cre-dependent, anterograde transsynaptic viral tracer for mapping output pathways of genetically marked neurons.Neuron. 2011; 72: 938-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, Zingg et al., 2017Zingg B.

AAV-mediated anterograde transsynaptic tagging: mapping corticocollicular input-defined neural pathways for defense behaviors.Neuron. 2017; 93: 33-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Two major limitations in the use of neurotropic viruses as tracers are the low efficiency of transsynaptic transport and the variability between experiments in the infected neuronal populations (Callaway and Luo, 2015Callaway E.M. Luo L. Monosynaptic circuit tracing with glycoprotein-deleted rabies viruses.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8979-8985Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Another significant problem with some viral tracers is their toxicity to the infected neurons that may lead to cell death and consequent infection of irrelevant bystander neurons (Callaway and Luo, 2015Callaway E.M. Luo L. Monosynaptic circuit tracing with glycoprotein-deleted rabies viruses.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8979-8985Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In spite of these limitations, rabies has been useful for retrograde tracing, but it is restricted to certain model organisms. By contrast, the utility of the anterograde viral tracers has been very limited. Several techniques use versions of fluorescent proteins to label synaptic connections or to trace circuits. Transsynaptic complementation of a split version of green fluorescent protein (GFP) is used in GRASP (GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners) to mark synapses (Feinberg et al., 2008Feinberg E.H. Vanhoven M.K. Bendesky A. Wang G. Fetter R.D. Shen K. Bargmann C.I.

Motor control in a Drosophila taste circuit.Neuron. 2009; 61: 373-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Each of the two complementary pieces of GFP is expressed by genetically defined neuronal populations, and functional GFP is reconstituted when both pieces are in close proximity. Modified versions of GRASP have been developed to enhance its synaptic specificity by fusing at least one of the pieces of GFP to a synaptic protein (Fan et al., 2013Fan P. Manoli D.S. Ahmed O.M. Chen Y. Agarwal N. Kwong S. Cai A.G. Neitz J. Renslo A. Baker B.S. Shah N.M. Genetic and neural mechanisms that inhibit Drosophila from mating with other species.Cell. 2013; 154: 89-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Macpherson et al., 2015Macpherson L.J. Zaharieva E.E. Kearney P.J. Alpert M.H. Lin T.-Y. Turan Z. Lee C.-H. Gallio M. Dynamic labelling of neural connections in multiple colours by trans-synaptic fluorescence complementation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 10024Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, these methods only label synapses rather than whole cells, and it is therefore difficult to relate the GRASP signal to particular neurons. Further, none of the versions of GRASP can be used for tracing the projections of postsynaptic neurons. Another method for circuit tracing uses photoactivatable GFP, which is genetically encoded and locally photoconverted to its high-fluorescence form to enable labeling of specific neural processes (Clowney et al., 2015Clowney E.J.

A dimorphic pheromone circuit in Drosophila from sensory input to descending output.Nature. 2010; 468: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This approach achieves higher spatial specificity than that afforded by genetic markers, but is invasive, can label fibers-of-passage, and does not report connectivity. Finally, a major limitation of all of these tracing techniques is that they do not provide stable genetic access to the postsynaptic partners, and therefore they cannot be used to manipulate the function of the circuit. Tango-Trace is a technique that was developed to trace projections in the fly visual system (Jagadish et al., 2014Jagadish S. Barnea G. Clandinin T.R. Axel R. Identifying functional connections of the inner photoreceptors in Drosophila using Tango-Trace.Neuron. 2014; 83: 630-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is based on Tango, an in vitro assay for recording the activation of receptors by their ligands (Barnea et al., 2008Barnea G. Strapps W. Herrada G. Berman Y. Ong J. Kloss B. Axel R. Lee K.J. The genetic design of signaling cascades to record receptor activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In Tango, a synthetic signaling pathway consisting of two fusion proteins converts the activation of a cell-surface receptor into reporter expression via site-specific proteolysis (Barnea et al., 2008Barnea G. Strapps W. Herrada G. Berman Y. Ong J. Kloss B. Axel R. Lee K.J. The genetic design of signaling cascades to record receptor activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Tango-Trace employed a configuration of Tango for detecting histamine, the excitatory neurotransmitter released from photoreceptors in the fly retina upon activation (Jagadish et al., 2014Jagadish S. Barnea G. Clandinin T.R. Axel R. Identifying functional connections of the inner photoreceptors in Drosophila using Tango-Trace.Neuron. 2014; 83: 630-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The utility of Tango-Trace has been rather limited because outside the retina histamine mostly serves as a neuromodulator rather than a neurotransmitter (Hong et al., 2006Hong S.-T. Bang S. Paik D. Kang J. Hwang S. Jeon K. Chun B. Hyun S. Lee Y. Kim J. Histamine and its receptors modulate temperature-preference behaviors in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7245-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, Nässel, 1999Nässel D.R. Histamine in the brain of insects: a review.Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 44: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further, diffusion of histamine away from the synapse and consequent labeling of non-synaptic neurons is a potential problem with Tango-Trace. Here we describe trans-Tango, a method for anterograde transsynaptic tracing. While trans-Tango is also based on the Tango assay, its design is fundamentally different than Tango-Trace in order to generate a general and flexible transsynaptic labeling system. trans-Tango employs an exogenous ligand-receptor pair for circuit labeling, so in principle it can be applied to any neural circuit regardless of the neurotransmitter that it uses and without making any assumptions about the nature of the connection. To present the ligand, we introduce a third fusion protein in which the ligand is tethered to a synaptic protein via an extracellular spacer. This configuration directs the ligand to the synapse and prevents it from diffusing away. In trans-Tango, the Tango signaling pathway is introduced into all neurons in the animal. Specific labeling is achieved by presenting the tethered ligand at the synapses of genetically defined neurons, thereby activating the signaling pathway only in their postsynaptic partners. We designed trans-Tango in a modular fashion to allow easy integration with other genetic tools for circuit dissection and manipulation. We first validated trans-Tango in the olfactory system of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where our experiments recapitulated known connections but also revealed new ones. We then used trans-Tango to identify hitherto unknown second-order neurons in the Drosophila gustatory system. Our anatomical tracing experiments revealed that second-order gustatory neurons target brain areas known to be involved in neuromodulation and in controlling feeding behaviors, providing a possible pathway for integrating gustatory signals and the regulation of feeding. trans-Tango is a transsynaptic labeling system that is based on Tango, a cellular assay for recording the activation of specific receptors by their ligands (Barnea et al., 2008Barnea G. Strapps W. Herrada G. Berman Y. Ong J. Kloss B. Axel R. Lee K.J. The genetic design of signaling cascades to record receptor activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In Tango, a synthetic signaling pathway is activated in response to ligand binding to its receptor through a specific proteolytic event that releases a membrane-tethered transcription factor, allowing it to translocate into the nucleus and induce expression of a reporter (Barnea et al., 2008Barnea G. Strapps W. Herrada G. Berman Y. Ong J. Kloss B. Axel R. Lee K.J. The genetic design of signaling cascades to record receptor activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To attain anterograde labeling by trans-Tango, we expressed the core components of the signaling pathway panneuronally and presented the ligand that activates the pathway at presynaptic sites in a neural circuit. Contact between the ligand and its receptor at synaptic sites drives expression of a reporter in postsynaptic neurons. The ligand and its receptor are exogenous to the animal in order to prevent spurious signal. To establish trans-Tango in Drosophila, we used human glucagon and its receptor as the ligand-receptor pair. The signaling pathway driving postsynaptic reporter expression consists of three components (Figure 1A). The first is a fusion protein comprising the glucagon receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, bound at its cytoplasmic tail to the transcriptional activator QF (Potter et al., 2010Potter C.J. Tasic B. Russler E.V. Liang L. Luo L. The Q system: a repressible binary system for transgene expression, lineage tracing, and mosaic analysis.Cell. 2010; 141: 536-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) via a linker containing the cleavage site for the highly specific N1a protease from the tobacco etch virus (TEV) (Barnea et al., 2008Barnea G. Strapps W. Herrada G. Berman Y. Ong J. Kloss B. Axel R. Lee K.J. The genetic design of signaling cascades to record receptor activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The second component, hArr::TEV, is a fusion between TEV and human β-arrestin2, a protein that is specifically recruited to activated G protein-coupled receptors (Barnea et al., 2008Barnea G. Strapps W. Herrada G. Berman Y. Ong J. Kloss B. Axel R. Lee K.J. The genetic design of signaling cascades to record receptor activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Panneuronal promoters drive expression of these two fusion proteins in all neurons. The third component in the pathway is a reporter, such as mtdTomato, under transcriptional control of QF. In this manner, all neurons in the fly are endowed with the capacity to express the reporter upon activation of the signaling pathway. The pathway is activated only in neurons that are postsynaptic to those that express a membrane-tethered form of glucagon at their presynaptic terminals (see below). In the absence of ligand at a given synapse, QF is sequestered to the membrane, and the reporter is not expressed (Figure 1A, top). By contrast, at synapses where the ligand is expressed, transsynaptic activation of the receptor leads to recruitment of hArr::TEV. Upon TEV cleavage in its target site, QF is released from the membrane, allowing it to enter the nucleus and induce reporter expression (Figure 1A, bottom). The inherent signal amplification by the signaling pathway renders trans-Tango very sensitive, and since the components of the signaling pathway are extrinsic to the cell, background noise can be kept low. Thus, trans-Tango should label circuits with high signal-to-noise ratios. In order to localize glucagon to the synapse and present it to postsynaptic receptors, we generated another fusion protein consisting of the cytosolic and transmembrane domains of the synaptic protein Drosophila Neurexin1, the large extracellular domain of the human cell-adhesion molecule ICAM1, a flexible linker including a myc-tag (Fortin et al., 2009Fortin J.-P. Zhu Y. Choi C. Beinborn M. Nitabach M.N. Kopin A.S. Membrane-tethered ligands are effective probes for exploring class B1 G protein-coupled receptor function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 8049-8054Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a mutated version of the glucagon peptide with high potency for glucagon receptor activation (Krstenansky et al., 1986Krstenansky J.L. Trivedi D. Johnson D. Hruby V.J. Conformational considerations in the design of a glucagon analog with increased receptor binding and adenylate cyclase potencies.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1696-1698Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and S1A). The resulting trans-Tango ligand, which is sized to extend across the average length of a synapse, is enriched in axons (Figure S1B) and targeted to axon termini (Figure S1C). By contrast, another version of the tethered ligand in which glucagon is fused to CD4, a cell surface protein that lacks synaptic localization, resulted in ligand expression throughout the neuron (data not shown). To enhance the flexibility of trans-Tango, the expression of the ligand fusion protein is controlled by the Gal4-UAS binary system (Brand and Perrimon, 1993Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Targeted gene expression as a means of altering cell fates and generating dominant phenotypes.Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the most commonly used tool for genetic access in flies. To introduce the trans-Tango components into the fly, we generated a transgenic line bearing all three fusion proteins as a single allele (trans-Tango): (1) the receptor fusion, (2) hArr::TEV, and (3) the ligand fusion (Figure S1A). We did not detect any effect of panneuronal expression of the trans-Tango components on normal lifespan, development, brain morphology, or motor behavior (data not shown). We generated a second transgenic line bearing a reporter allele containing a membrane-associated form of GFP under control of Gal4 (UAS-myrGFP) to mark presynaptic neurons, and a membrane-associated form of tdTomato under control of QF (QUAS-mtdTomato) to mark postsynaptic neurons (Figures 1A and S1A). In this manner, any circuit for which a presynaptic Gal4 driver is available can in principle be traced by trans-Tango. To achieve this, flies bearing the trans-Tango and reporter alleles are crossed to flies bearing the appropriate Gal4 driver, and offspring carrying all three alleles are analyzed. We sought to validate trans-Tango in the context of the well-characterized olfactory system. Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) express specific receptors and detect volatile odors. ORNs residing in the antenna and maxillary palp project to the antennal lobe (AL), where ORNs expressing a given receptor converge on the same neuropil structures called glomeruli. Axons from ORNs synapse with local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs) (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007Vosshall L.B. Stocker R.F. Molecular architecture of smell and taste in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 505-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). LNs project locally to other glomeruli within the AL, while PNs project from the AL to the mushroom body (MB) calyx and the lateral horn (LH) mainly via the medial, mediolateral, and lateral antennal lobe tracts (mALT, mlALT, and lALT, respectively) (Ito et al., 2014Ito K. Shinomiya K. Ito M. Armstrong J.D. Boyan G. Hartenstein V. Harzsch S. Heisenberg M. Homberg U. Jenett A. et al.Insect Brain Name Working GroupA systematic nomenclature for the insect brain.Neuron. 2014; 81: 755-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We first used Orco-Gal4, which is expressed in the majority of ORNs (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007Vosshall L.B. Stocker R.F. Molecular architecture of smell and taste in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 505-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), to drive expression of the trans-Tango ligand and myrGFP. In flies bearing the Orco-Gal4 driver and the trans-Tango components, we observed the typical innervation of the AL by GFP-expressing ORNs and robust mtdTomato labeling in LNs as well as in PNs that target the MB calyx and LH (Figure 1B and Movie S1). In addition, we observed projections descending to the subesophageal zone (SEZ), the first processing center for gustatory information in the brain (Ito et al., 2014Ito K. Shinomiya K. Ito M. Armstrong J.D. Boyan G. Hartenstein V. Harzsch S. Heisenberg M. Homberg U.

Singhvi A. Kong P. Scott K. Taste representations in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2004; 117: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We observed a total of 152 ± 6 (mean ± SD) and 182 ± 17 postsynaptic neurons per hemisphere in females and males, respectively (n = 10 ALs per group). By contrast, no signal, except two spots in the ventral SEZ, was detected in the brains of control flies bearing the trans-Tango components and no Gal4 driver, which is necessary for trans-Tango ligand expression (Figure 1C). The background noise in the ventral SEZ might be due to sporadic leaky expression known to occur in the attP40 genomic locus where we integrated the trans-Tango allele (Pfeiffer et al., 2010Pfeiffer B.D. Ngo T.T.-T.B. Hibbard K.L. Murphy C. Jenett A. Truman J.W. Rubin G.M. Refinement of tools for targeted gene expression in Drosophila.Genetics. 2010; 186: 735-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate the tight regulation of ligand-dependent QF release and the consequent high signal-to-noise ratio of trans-Tango. To examine the specificity of trans-Tango, we expressed the ligand in individual ORN classes. We started with one of the most studied olfactory circuits in flies, Or67d-expressing ORNs that target the DA1 glomeruli and mediate sexual behaviors (Datta et al., 2008Datta S.R. Vasconcelos M.L.

Expression of the trans-Tango ligand in Or67d+ ORNs resulted in an extremely dense signal in LNs innervating many glomeruli including DA1 and also led to specific labeling of PNs targeting the MB calyx and LH (Figure 2A). Additionally, we found bilateral descending projections from the AL to the SEZ (Figure 2A, arrows), as we noticed with the broadly expressed Orco-Gal4 (Figure 1B). We observed a total of 61 ± 5 and 81 ± 4 postsynaptic neurons per hemisphere in females and males, respectively (n = 10 ALs per group). In subsequent experiments, we expressed the ligand in Or42b-expressing ORNs that are important for detecting certain food odors (Root et al., 2011Root C.M. Ko K.I. Jafari A. Wang J.W.

Wang J.W. Select Drosophila glomeruli mediate innate olfactory attraction and aversion.Nature. 2009; 459: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We observed dense trans-Tango-dependent signal in LNs innervating many glomeruli, including the cognate DM1 glomerulus, as well as signal in a distinct set of PNs projecting to the MB calyx and LH (Figure 2B). We observed a total of 86 ± 7 and 92 ± 5 postsynaptic neurons per hemisphere in females and males, respectively (n = 10 ALs per group). It is noteworthy that the reporter in trans-Tango is integrated in the X chromosome, so due to dosage compensation, the signal in males is higher than in heterozygous females. Thus, while the cell number differences between males and females could reflect sexual dimorphism, they could also result from the difference in reporter levels. These results, together with trans-Tango labeling of other ORN classes (Figure S2), confirm the high degree of interconnectivity among glomeruli suggested by earlier studies (Chou et al., 2010Chou Y.-H.

While the general patterns of postsynaptic signal were similar for the various ORN populations, careful examination revealed notable differences. Namely, with ligand expressed in Or42b+ ORNs, we did not observe the neurons descending from the AL to the SEZ (Figures 2A and 2B, arrows). In addition, the targeting patterns of the two PN populations within the LH were distinct, with projections from DA1 terminating in the ventral LH and those from DM1 terminating more dorsally (Figures 2A and 2B). These projection patterns are in agreement with the literature (Jefferis et al., 2007Jefferis G.S.X.E. Potter C.J. Chan A.M. Marin E.C. Rohlfing T. Maurer Jr., C.R. Luo L.

https://openalex.org/W2951972570,"RNA Capture Long Seq (CLS) is a new method for transcript annotation that combines targeted RNA capture with long-read sequencing. CLS reannotates GENCODE lncRNAs and increases the number of validated splice junctions and transcript models for targeted loci. Accurate annotation of genes and their transcripts is a foundation of genomics, but currently no annotation technique combines throughput and accuracy. As a result, reference gene collections remain incomplete—many gene models are fragmentary, and thousands more remain uncataloged, particularly for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To accelerate lncRNA annotation, the GENCODE consortium has developed RNA Capture Long Seq (CLS), which combines targeted RNA capture with third-generation long-read sequencing. Here we present an experimental reannotation of the GENCODE intergenic lncRNA populations in matched human and mouse tissues that resulted in novel transcript models for 3,574 and 561 gene loci, respectively. CLS approximately doubled the annotated complexity of targeted loci, outperforming existing short-read techniques. Full-length transcript models produced by CLS enabled us to definitively characterize the genomic features of lncRNAs, including promoter and gene structure, and protein-coding potential. Thus, CLS removes a long-standing bottleneck in transcriptome annotation and generates manual-quality full-length transcript models at high-throughput scales."
https://openalex.org/W2767694961,"Asprosin, a recently identified secreted hormone from adipose tissue, acts centrally to promote food intake. Asprosin is a recently discovered fasting-induced hormone that promotes hepatic glucose production. Here we demonstrate that asprosin in the circulation crosses the blood–brain barrier and directly activates orexigenic AgRP+ neurons via a cAMP-dependent pathway. This signaling results in inhibition of downstream anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-positive neurons in a GABA-dependent manner, which then leads to appetite stimulation and a drive to accumulate adiposity and body weight. In humans, a genetic deficiency in asprosin causes a syndrome characterized by low appetite and extreme leanness; this is phenocopied by mice carrying similar mutations and can be fully rescued by asprosin. Furthermore, we found that obese humans and mice had pathologically elevated concentrations of circulating asprosin, and neutralization of asprosin in the blood with a monoclonal antibody reduced appetite and body weight in obese mice, in addition to improving their glycemic profile. Thus, in addition to performing a glucogenic function, asprosin is a centrally acting orexigenic hormone that is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of both obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2765951602,"The medial amygdala (MeA) plays a critical role in processing species- and sex-specific signals that trigger social and defensive behaviors. However, the principles by which this deep brain structure encodes social information is poorly understood. We used a miniature microscope to image the Ca2+ dynamics of large neural ensembles in awake behaving mice and tracked the responses of MeA neurons over several months. These recordings revealed spatially intermingled subsets of MeA neurons with distinct temporal dynamics. The encoding of social information in the MeA differed between males and females and relied on information from both individual cells and neuronal populations. By performing long-term Ca2+ imaging across different social contexts, we found that sexual experience triggers lasting and sex-specific changes in MeA activity, which, in males, involve signaling by oxytocin. These findings reveal basic principles underlying the brain's representation of social information and its modulation by intrinsic and extrinsic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2766734789,"A number of bacterial cell processes are confined functional membrane microdomains (FMMs), structurally and functionally similar to lipid rafts of eukaryotic cells. How bacteria organize these intricate platforms and what their biological significance is remain important questions. Using the pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we show here that membrane-carotenoid interaction with the scaffold protein flotillin leads to FMM formation, which can be visualized using super-resolution array tomography. These membrane platforms accumulate multimeric protein complexes, for which flotillin facilitates efficient oligomerization. One of these proteins is PBP2a, responsible for penicillin resistance in MRSA. Flotillin mutants are defective in PBP2a oligomerization. Perturbation of FMM assembly using available drugs interferes with PBP2a oligomerization and disables MRSA penicillin resistance in vitro and in vivo, resulting in MRSA infections that are susceptible to penicillin treatment. Our study demonstrates that bacteria possess sophisticated cell organization programs and defines alternative therapies to fight multidrug-resistant pathogens using conventional antibiotics."

Fluctuating states such as alertness can be governed by neuromodulation, but the underlying mechanisms and cell types involved are not fully understood. We developed a method to globally screen for cell types involved in behavior by integrating brain-wide activity imaging with high-content molecular phenotyping and volume registration at cellular resolution. We used this method (MultiMAP) to record from 22 neuromodulatory cell types in behaving zebrafish during a reaction-time task that reports alertness. We identified multiple monoaminergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic cell types linked to alertness and found that activity in these cell types was mutually correlated during heightened alertness. We next recorded from and controlled homologous neuromodulatory cells in mice; alertness-related cell-type dynamics exhibited striking evolutionary conservation and modulated behavior similarly. These experiments establish a method for unbiased discovery of cellular elements underlying behavior and reveal an evolutionarily conserved set of diverse neuromodulatory systems that collectively govern internal state."

These findings have implications for the understanding of mutational and DNA repair processes and for studying the evolution of both tumors and species. While recent studies have identified higher than anticipated heterogeneity of mutation rate across genomic regions, mutations in exons and introns are assumed to be generated at the same rate. Here we find fewer somatic mutations in exons than expected from their sequence content and demonstrate that this is not due to purifying selection. Instead, we show that it is caused by higher mismatch-repair activity in exonic than in intronic regions. Our findings have important implications for understanding of mutational and DNA repair processes and knowledge of the evolution of eukaryotic genes, and they have practical ramifications for the study of evolution of both tumors and species."
https://openalex.org/W2767323255,"Sleep deprivation is a major source of morbidity with widespread health effects, including increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart attack, and stroke. Moreover, sleep deprivation brings about vehicle accidents and medical errors and is therefore an urgent topic of investigation. During sleep deprivation, homeostatic and circadian processes interact to build up sleep pressure, which results in slow behavioral performance (cognitive lapses) typically attributed to attentional thalamic and frontoparietal circuits, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recently, through study of electroencephalograms (EEGs) in humans and local field potentials (LFPs) in nonhuman primates and rodents it was found that, during sleep deprivation, regional 'sleep-like' slow and theta (slow/theta) waves co-occur with impaired behavioral performance during wakefulness. Here we used intracranial electrodes to record single-neuron activities and LFPs in human neurosurgical patients performing a face/nonface categorization psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) over multiple experimental sessions, including a session after full-night sleep deprivation. We find that, just before cognitive lapses, the selective spiking responses of individual neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are attenuated, delayed, and lengthened. These 'neuronal lapses' are evident on a trial-by-trial basis when comparing the slowest behavioral PVT reaction times to the fastest. Furthermore, during cognitive lapses, LFPs exhibit a relative local increase in slow/theta activity that is correlated with degraded single-neuron responses and with baseline theta activity. Our results show that cognitive lapses involve local state-dependent changes in neuronal activity already present in the MTL."
https://openalex.org/W2766987769,"Eukaryotic cells have evolved extensive protein quality-control mechanisms to remove faulty translation products. Here, we show that yeast cells continually produce faulty mitochondrial polypeptides that stall on the ribosome during translation but are imported into the mitochondria. The cytosolic protein Vms1, together with the E3 ligase Ltn1, protects against the mitochondrial toxicity of these proteins and maintains cell viability under respiratory conditions. In the absence of these factors, stalled polypeptides aggregate after import and sequester critical mitochondrial chaperone and translation machinery. Aggregation depends on C-terminal alanyl/threonyl sequences (CAT-tails) that are attached to stalled polypeptides on 60S ribosomes by Rqc2. Vms1 binds to 60S ribosomes at the mitochondrial surface and antagonizes Rqc2, thereby facilitating import, impeding aggregation, and directing aberrant polypeptides to intra-mitochondrial quality control. Vms1 is a key component of a rescue pathway for ribosome-stalled mitochondrial polypeptides that are inaccessible to ubiquitylation due to coupling of translation and translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2766876983,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption alters the composition of the brain microenvironment by allowing blood proteins into the CNS. However, whether blood-derived molecules serve as extrinsic inhibitors of remyelination is unknown. Here we show that the coagulation factor fibrinogen activates the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and suppresses remyelination. Fibrinogen induces phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8 and inhibits OPC differentiation into myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) while promoting an astrocytic fate in vitro. Fibrinogen effects are rescued by BMP type I receptor inhibition using dorsomorphin homolog 1 (DMH1) or CRISPR/Cas9 activin A receptor type I (ACVR1) knockout in OPCs. Fibrinogen and the BMP target Id2 are increased in demyelinated multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. Therapeutic depletion of fibrinogen decreases BMP signaling and enhances remyelination in vivo. Targeting fibrinogen may be an upstream therapeutic strategy to promote the regenerative potential of CNS progenitors in diseases with remyelination failure."
https://openalex.org/W2765605017,"The precise neural circuitry that mediates arousal during sleep apnea is not known. We previously found that glutamatergic neurons in the external lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBel) play a critical role in arousal to elevated CO2 or hypoxia. Because many of the PBel neurons that respond to CO2 express calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), we hypothesized that CGRP may provide a molecular identifier of the CO2 arousal circuit. Here, we report that selective chemogenetic and optogenetic activation of PBelCGRP neurons caused wakefulness, whereas optogenetic inhibition of PBelCGRP neurons prevented arousal to CO2, but not to an acoustic tone or shaking. Optogenetic inhibition of PBelCGRP terminals identified a network of forebrain sites under the control of a PBelCGRP switch that is necessary to arouse animals from hypercapnia. Our findings define a novel cellular target for interventions that may prevent sleep fragmentation and the attendant cardiovascular and cognitive consequences seen in obstructive sleep apnea.

Regulation of protein stability and function by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) influences diverse aspects of eukaryotic biology. The ubiquitylation cascade involves three enzymes—E1, E2, and E3—that work successively to attach ubiquitin to substrate proteins, which results in altered protein function or proteasomal degradation (Dye and Schulman, 2007Dye B.T.

Substrate specificity is conferred by E3 ubiquitin ligases, of which the SCF family of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) is among the most intensively studied (Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009Deshaies R.J.

Cell Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M110.006460)Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Due to their substrate specificity, SCF ligases represent promising targets for therapeutic manipulation. Gain or loss of function of specific SCFs is directly implicated in tumorigenesis and other diseases (Nakayama and Nakayama, 2006Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K.

The cumulative functional output and physiological impact of all SCFs at any given time is presumably determined by the extant repertoire of SCFs. This repertoire can change dramatically as cells differentiate, as shown for CRL3 complexes (Werner et al., 2015Werner A. Iwasaki S. McGourty C.A. Medina-Ruiz S. Teerikorpi N. Fedrigo I. Ingolia N.T. Rape M. Cell-fate determination by ubiquitin-dependent regulation of translation.Nature. 2015; 525: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, a key unanswered question is, what mechanism(s) sculpts the repertoire of SCF and other CRLs? The prevailing model, which is based on biochemical studies, predicts that SR modules bind tightly to Cul1, but their interaction is rendered dynamic by Cand1, which is an SR exchange factor (SREF) that equilibrates Cul1 with the cellular pool of SR modules (Pierce et al., 2013Pierce N.W.

This exchange is controlled by Nedd8 conjugation: when substrate is bound to SCF, preservation of Nedd8 modification on Cul1 stimulates substrate ubiquitination and blocks Cand1 from dislodging the SR module. When substrate dissociates, Nedd8 is removed by isopeptidase Cop9-Signalosome (CSN), allowing Cand1 to catalyze exchange of the SR module (Bornstein et al., 2006Bornstein G. Ganoth D. Hershko A.

This model predicts that substrate availability governs the cellular landscape of SCF enzymes. This model, though attractive, is based primarily on in vitro biochemical studies with a few FBPs (Pierce et al., 2013Pierce N.W. Lee J.E. Liu X. Sweredoski M.J. Graham R.L. Larimore E.A. Rome M.

Meanwhile, Cand1 depletion yields conflicting results, with some studies reporting no effect (Bennett et al., 2010Bennett E.J. Rush J. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W.

However, we demonstrate here that prior analyses of cellular SCF complexes were confounded by rapid exchange of SR modules during immunoprecipitation from cell lysate, and this would affect prior results and their interpretation in ways that are difficult to predict. Here, we developed a multiplex affinity purification-selected reaction monitoring (SRM) platform to query the assembly state of SR modules in human cells. By suppressing exchange, we show that the cellular SCF repertoire is in a state of disequilibrium that is sustained by Nedd8 conjugation and Cand proteins and is modulated by substrate availability. Based on our finding that Cand1 is a potent SREF (Pierce et al., 2013Pierce N.W. Lee J.E. Liu X. Sweredoski M.J. Graham R.L. Larimore E.A. Rome M. Zheng N. Clurman B.E. Hess S. et al.Cand1 promotes assembly of new SCF complexes through dynamic exchange of F box proteins.Cell. 2013; 153: 206-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Cand1 might mediate exchange of SR modules in cell lysate during a conventional immunoprecipitation. To evaluate this, we developed a SILAC-based SRM exchange assay that enabled us to monitor the levels of all SCF regulators and subunits (Table S1A). In parallel, we used CRISPR technology to engineer HEK293 cells such that endogenous Cul1 was tagged with 3XFLAG at its N terminus (Figures S1A–S1D). Insertion of the 3xFLAG tag did not affect cell proliferation or steady-state levels of cyclin E, an SCFFBXW7 substrate (Figures S1D and S1E) (Koepp et al., 2001Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X.

Human F-box protein hCdc4 targets cyclin E for proteolysis and is mutated in a breast cancer cell line.Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The rationale for developing this cell line is that it enabled rapid and efficient immunodepletion of Cul1 (Figure S1F) while avoiding artifacts that are inherent to overexpression of scaffold proteins (Gibson et al., 2013Gibson T.J. Seiler M. Veitia R.A. The transience of transient overexpression.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To evaluate exchange in cell lysate, we mixed isotopically light-labeled HEK2933xFLAG-Cul1 cells 1:1 with heavy-labeled untagged HEK293 cells, lysed the cells in native lysis buffer that blocks the Nedd8 cycle (Figure S1G) and allows complete extraction of 3xFLAGCul1 into the soluble fraction (Figure S1H), immunoprecipitated 3xFLAGCul1, and measured the H:L ratio of co-precipitating factors (Figure 1A). We observed pervasive equilibration of FBPs, Skp1, Cand1, and CSN during immunoprecipitation, whereas essentially no exchange was observed for Cul1⋅Rbx1 (Figures 1B, 1C and S2A–S2C ; Table S2A). Although exchange increased over time, it was substantial even in 10′ immunoprecipitations. We surmised that this robust equilibration was due to Cand1. Because Nedd8 shields Cul1 from Cand1-mediated exchange (Pierce et al., 2013Pierce N.W. Lee J.E. Liu X. Sweredoski M.J. Graham R.L. Larimore E.A. Rome M. Zheng N. Clurman B.E. Hess S. et al.Cand1 promotes assembly of new SCF complexes through dynamic exchange of F box proteins.Cell. 2013; 153: 206-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), blocking Nedd8 conjugation should increase FBP exchange. To test this idea, HEK2933xFLAG-Cul1 cells were pretreated with the Nedd8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, MLN4924 (Figure S1I) (Brownell et al., 2010Brownell J.E. Sintchak M.D. Gavin J.M. Liao H.

MLN4924 exacerbated exchange for all FBPs (Figures 1B and S2A–S2C) but had a much greater effect on some FBPs than others (e.g., FBXO11 versus FBXO7), indicating that the wide variation in FBP exchange was due in part to differential neddylation of the respective SCF complexes (Figure S2D). Indeed, the FBPs most refractory to exchange (FBXO9 and FBXO11) exhibited near-median exchange upon MLN4924 treatment (Figures 1B, 1C, and S2A–S2C).Figure 1Post-cell Lysis Exchange of FBPs Is Rapid and Modulated by NeddylationShow full caption(A) SILAC-SRM method used to measure percent exchange of FBPs in cell lysate.

(E–G) Post-lysis FBP exchange in DKO cell lysate partitioned by FBP-subclass. Data represent 3 biological replicates (Mean ± SEM). These measurements correspond to the data points in Figure 2B. To further explore the idea that SREF activity mediates FBP exchange, we used CRISPR technology to knock out both Cand1 and its paralog Cand2 in HEK2933xFLAG-Cul1 cells to generate tagged double-knockout (DKO) cells (Figures S1C–S1E) and subjected these cells to our SILAC-SRM exchange assay (Figure 2A). In the absence of Cand1/2, exchange in cell lysate was significantly suppressed for Skp1 and all FBPs, except FBXO5/Emi1 (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2E–S2G; Table S2B). Exchange was restored back to DKO lysate upon mixing with untagged wild-type (WT) lysate. Moreover, spiking recombinant Cand1 (rCand1) into DKO lysate displaced Skp1 and FBPs from endogenous Cul1 (Figure 2D). These data demonstrate that Cand1/2-dependent post-lysis exchange has a major but previously unappreciated effect on SCF and probably other CRLs. To investigate the repertoire of cellular SCFs and how it changes in response to environmental or genetic perturbations, it was essential to suppress exchange in cell lysate. Our prior work established that binary SR⋅Cul1 and Cul1⋅Cand1 complexes are exceptionally stable, whereas ternary SR⋅Cul1⋅Cand1 complexes dissociate ∼106-fold more rapidly (Pierce et al., 2013Pierce N.W. Lee J.E. Liu X. Sweredoski M.J. Graham R.L. Larimore E.A. Rome M. Zheng N. Clurman B.E. Hess S. et al.Cand1 promotes assembly of new SCF complexes through dynamic exchange of F box proteins.Cell. 2013; 153: 206-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a large excess of recombinant Cul1⋅GSTRbx1 (rCul1GSTRbx1) added to lysis buffer prior to cell lysis would function like a molecular sponge and soak up free Cand1/2 and any SR module not bound to Cul1 to form stable binary complexes and thus prevent endogenous Cul1 from forming metastable ternary complexes in lysate that underlie exchange (Figure 3A). Indeed, this was the case. By performing a 20′ immunoprecipitation in the presence of rCul1GSTRbx1 (Figure S3A), exchange of Skp1, Cand1, and all FBPs, except FBXO5/Emi1 was greatly curbed (Figures 3B, 3C and S3B–S3D; Table S2C). Importantly, we also show that excess rCul1GSTRbx1 suppresses the ability of endogenous Cul1 to form new SCF complexes in the lysate (Figure S3E).Figure S3Addition of rCul1GSTRbx1 Preserves the In Vivo Cellular Landscape of SCF Ligases, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Purified rCul1GSTRbx1 expressed in E. coli.

Here we assessed one-dimensional spatial receptive fields of individual dendritic spines within individual layer 2/3 neuron dendrites. Spatial receptive field properties of dendritic spines were strikingly diverse, with no evidence of large-scale topographic organization. At a fine scale, organization was evident: neighboring spines separated by less than 10 μm shared similar spatial receptive field properties and exhibited a distance-dependent correlation in sensory-driven and spontaneous activity patterns. Fine-scale dendritic organization was supported by the fact that functional groups of spines defined by dimensionality reduction of receptive field properties exhibited non-random dendritic clustering. Our results demonstrate that functional synaptic clustering is a robust feature existing at a local spatial scale.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJiYjM2MmYyMjMxZjlmODUwZWMxMTY2ZGRjNjYzZjFiYyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NjA2OTkzfQ.FukBvSMUYoI304V9WX7o_EvEmnPODeb6i8lYmfNggjP1Scgyg-n_AHEBeEqmBPu9kz74KQBsdY4ldU0FDN_xRgH21cDhtvt1A2qlOL5GWpxNaq-pz2_GbOYAS9zmKABpZeEl6AsBk-fxDthTKwwQH1ygAE-29UtICLUPPSq-1uD07KE94FYG0c2yUa1Y8kI05uazi1L1_G0W01uSu9mrgAjAm0R0E_EzR_05FGYVRAKk-WvkOhVHIZvns_obNRs4KmedazO0dtBoahTgtySwE34OLmnHHAJBvwPcqQoQj-wnrCJtkcySSFGrwoM36BBWbTJfs2rTrPB3GOoxGy-HNQ(mp4, (27.73 MB) Download video"

The GSH-Cu(I) interaction is thus a key consideration for both redox and copper homeostasis in cells. However, even after nearly four decades of investigation, the nature and stability of the GSH-Cu(I) complexes formed under biologically relevant conditions remain controversial. Here, we revealed the unexpected predominance of a tetranuclear [Cu4(GS)6] cluster that is sufficiently stable to limit the effective free aquacopper(I) concentration to the sub-femtomolar regime. Combined spectrophotometric–potentiometric titrations at biologically realistic GSH/Cu(I) ratios, enabled by our recently developed Cu(I) affinity standards and corroborated by low-temperature phosphorescence studies, established cooperative assembly of [Cu4(GS)6] as the dominant species over a wide pH range, from 5.5 to 7.5. Our robust model for the glutathione-Cu(I) equilibrium system sets a firm upper limit on the thermodynamic availability of intracellular copper that is 3 orders of magnitude lower than previously estimated. Taking into account their ability to catalyze the production of deleterious superoxide, the formation of Cu(I)-glutathione complexes might be avoided under normal physiological conditions. The actual intracellular Cu(I) availability may thus be regulated a further 3 orders of magnitude below the GSH/Cu(I) affinity limit, consistent with the most recent affinity determinations of Cu(I) chaperones."

However, they also cause non-oxidative cell death because anaerobic bacteria are also killed. Here, we use differential proteomics to identify granzyme B substrates in three unrelated bacteria: Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycobacteria tuberculosis. Granzyme B cleaves a highly conserved set of proteins in all three bacteria, which function in vital biosynthetic and metabolic pathways that are critical for bacterial survival under diverse environmental conditions. Key proteins required for protein synthesis, folding, and degradation are also substrates, including multiple aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, ribosomal proteins, protein chaperones, and the Clp system.

In practice, however, lanthanide imaging techniques have provided no better sensitivity than conventional fluorescence microscopy. Here, we identified three fundamental problems that have impeded lanthanide microscopy: low photon flux, inefficient excitation, and optics-derived background luminescence. We overcame these limitations with a new lanthanide imaging modality, transreflected illumination with luminescence resonance energy transfer (trLRET), which increases the time-integrated signal intensities of lanthanide lumiphores by 170-fold and the signal-to-background ratios by 75-fold. We demonstrate that trLRET provides at least an order-of-magnitude increase in detection sensitivity over that of conventional epifluorescence microscopy when used to visualize endogenous protein expression in zebrafish embryos. We also show that trLRET can be used to optically detect molecular interactions in vivo. trLRET promises to unlock the full potential of lanthanide lumiphores for ultrasensitive, autofluorescence-free biological imaging."

This study reports the biosynthesis of a new cobamide with unsubstituted purine as the lower base and assigns unsubstituted purine a biological function by demonstrating that Coα-purinyl-cobamide (purinyl-Cba) is the native prosthetic group in catalytically active tetrachloroethene reductive dehalogenases of Desulfitobacterium hafniense. Cobamides featuring different lower bases are not functionally equivalent, and purinyl-Cba elicits different physiological responses in corrinoid-auxotrophic, organohalide-respiring bacteria.

The presynaptic mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity still remain poorly understood. Here, we have combined high temporal resolution measurements of presynaptic capacitance and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) to measure the kinetics of exocytosis. In addition, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was employed to directly visualize dynamics of single synaptic vesicles adjacent to the plasma membrane at high spatial resolution. Readily releasable vesicles mostly consisted of already-tethered vesicles in the TIRF field. Vesicle replenishment had fast and slow phases, and TIRF imaging suggests that the fast phase depends on vesicle priming from already-tethered vesicles. Application of cyclic AMP (cAMP), a molecule crucial for LTP, mainly increases the vesicular release probability rather than the number of readily releasable vesicles or their replenishment rate, likely by changing the coupling between Ca2+ channels and synaptic vesicles. Thus, we revealed dynamic properties of synaptic vesicles at hMFBs."

High-frequency loss of heterozygosity occurred in chromosome 14q11.2 in many tumors including ESCC, suggesting that one or more tumor-suppressor genes might exist within this region. In this study, we identified the tumor-suppressing role of DHRS2 (short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, member 2) at 14q11.2 in ESCCs. Downregulation of DHRS2 occurred in 30.8% of primary ESCC tumor tissues vs paired non-tumorous tissues. DHRS2 downregulation was associated significantly with ESCC invasion, lymph nodes metastasis and clinical staging (P<0.001). Survival analysis revealed that DHRS2 downregulation was significantly associated with worse outcome of patients with ESCC. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that both DHRS2 variants could suppress cell proliferation and cell motility. Moreover, we demonstrated that DHRS2 could reduce reactive oxygen species and decrease nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (oxidized/reduced), increase p53 stability and decrease Rb phosphorylation; it also decreased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase 2. In summary, these findings demonstrated that DHRS2 had an important part in ESCC development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2766382507,"Dopamine neurons in the SNc play a pivotal role in modulating motor behavior via striatum. Here, we show that the same dopamine neuron that targets striatum also sends a direct branch to the optic tectum (superior colliculus). Whenever SNc neurons are activated, both targets will therefore be affected. Visual stimuli (looming or bars) activate the dopamine neurons coding saliency and also elicit distinct motor responses mediated via tectum (eye, orienting or evasive), which are modulated by the dopamine input. Whole-cell recordings from tectal projection neurons and interneurons show that dopamine, released by SNc stimulation, increases or decreases the excitability depending on whether they express the dopamine D1 or the D2 receptor. SNc thus exerts its effects on the visuomotor system through a combined effect directly on tectum and also via striatum. This direct SNc modulation will occur regardless of striatum and represents a novel mode of motor control."

Uric acid concentrations in the blood and liver exhibit circadian oscillations in both humans and rodents; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that XOD expression and enzymatic activity exhibit circadian oscillations in the mouse liver. We found that the orphan nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-α (PPARα) transcriptionally activated the mouse XOD gene and that bile acids suppressed XOD transactivation. The synthesis of bile acids is known to be under the control of the circadian clock, and we observed that the time-dependent accumulation of bile acids in hepatic cells interfered with the recruitment of the co-transcriptional activator p300 to PPARα, thereby repressing XOD expression. This time-dependent suppression of PPARα-mediated transactivation by bile acids caused an oscillation in the hepatic expression of XOD, which, in turn, led to circadian alterations in uric acid production. Finally, we also demonstrated that the anti-hyperuricemic effect of the XOD inhibitor febuxostat was enhanced by administering it at the time of day before hepatic XOD activity increased. These results suggest an underlying mechanism for the circadian alterations in uric acid production and also underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate time of day for administering XOD inhibitors.

Circadian rhythms are ∼24-h cycles that allow the adaptation of physiological and behavioral activities to environmental cues. Rhythmic changes in physiological functions have been suggested to help organisms anticipate daily changes in environmental conditions and feeding times (1Panda S. Hogenesch J.B. Kay S.A. Circadian rhythms from flies to human.Nature. 2002; 417: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). This control is achieved through a complex program of gene expression. In mammals, the molecular clock machinery consists of interconnected transcriptional–translational feedback loops that ultimately ensure the proper oscillation of a number of genes in a tissue-specific manner (2Ueda H.R.

The circadian machinery also causes circadian alternations in the synthesis and degradation of small molecules in the body.

Uric acid transporters hiding in the intestine.Pharm. Biol. 2016; 54: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The hepatic contents and blood concentrations of uric acid show significant circadian oscillations in male rats (15O'Neill R.D.

Therefore, XOD inhibitors are more commonly used to prevent hyperuricemia than inhibitors of the tubular reabsorption of uric acid (20Gliozzi M. Malara N. Muscoli S. Mollace V.

In the present study, we demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-α (PPARα) acted as a transcriptional activator of the mouse XOD gene, and its hepatic expression exhibited circadian oscillation, which was generated by the time-dependent repression of PPARα activity by bile acids. The circadian expression of XOD affected its enzymatic activity, which appeared to cause rhythmic changes in serum uric acid levels. Because circadian variations in the expression and/or activity of drug target molecules often cause dosing time–dependent changes in the pharmacological efficacy of drugs, we also investigated how the rhythmic change in the XOD activity influences the anti-hyperuricemic effects of XOD inhibitors. During the analysis of the upstream region of the mouse XOD gene, we noted that the nucleotide sequences located from bp −1792 to −1780 and from bp −174 to −163 (+1 indicates the transcription initiation site) showed homology with PPAR response elements (PPREs) (Fig. 1A). The sequences were also identified at a similar position in the XOD genes of rats and humans. Because the expression of some PPARα target genes shows circadian oscillations (22Okamura A. Koyanagi S. Dilxiat A. Kusunose N. Chen J.J. Matsunaga N. Shibata S. Ohdo S.

Nuclear receptor expression links the circadian clock to metabolism.Cell. 2006; 126: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the mouse XOD gene was expressed in a PPARα-dependent circadian manner. As shown in Fig. 1B, the treatment of Hepa1–6 cells with 30 μm bezafibrate, a typical PPARα agonist, significantly increased XOD mRNA levels (p < 0.05). However, the bezafibrate-induced expression of XOD mRNA was dose-dependently suppressed by the PPARα antagonist GW6471, suggesting that the hepatic expression of the XOD gene is under the control of PPARα. The activity of the luciferase reporter under the control of the mouse XOD promoter containing these two PPREs (XOD (−1848)::Luc) were also enhanced by PPARα and its heterodimer partner retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα), but this reporter was unable to respond to the clock gene products CLOCK and BMAL1 or clock-controlled gene products RORα and ATF4 (Fig. 1C). Although the transactivation effect of PPARα/RXRα on XOD reporters was still observed with the elimination of the sequence up to bp −614, the deletion of the sequence from bp −614 to −158 caused a significant reduction in the transactivation effect of PPARα/RXRα by ∼60% (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the PPARα and RXRα complexes positively regulate the transcription of the mouse XOD gene through the PPRE located within the upstream region between bp −174 and −163. XOD mRNA and protein levels in the livers of wild-type mice exhibited significant circadian oscillations (p < 0.01 for mRNA, p < 0.05 for protein, Fig. 2, A and B). Their expression levels increased from the late light phase to the early dark phase. In the livers of wild-type mice, a similar circadian oscillation was also observed in the enzymatic activity of XOD, converting xanthine to uric acid (p < 0.01, Fig. 2C). Consistent with these results, the hepatic contents of uric acid and its serum concentrations fluctuated in a circadian time–dependent manner (p < 0.01 for hepatic contents; p < 0.05 for serum concentrations, Fig. 2, D and E); however, fluctuations in serum uric acid levels were delayed by ∼4–8 h with respect to the XOD circadian activity rhythm. In contrast to findings in wild-type mice, circadian oscillations in XOD expression and its enzymatic activity were dampened in PPARα-null mice (Fig. 2, A–C), where its expression and activity decreased throughout the day. Similar disruptions were also detected in the circadian rhythms of the hepatic contents of uric acid and its serum concentrations (Fig. 2, D and E). These results suggest that PPARα acts as a positive regulator of XOD expression and is also required to generate circadian changes in its enzymatic activity. Although the transcription of PPARα was shown to be under the control of the molecular circadian clock (25Oishi K. Shirai H. Ishida N. CLOCK is involved in the circadian transactivation of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) in mice.Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the strong expression of the PPARα protein was detected in the hepatic nuclear fraction of wild-type mice at all time points examined (Fig. 3A). In addition to PPARα, the protein levels of RXRα and the co-activator p300 did not appear to oscillate in the livers of wild-type mice (Fig. 3A). The results of the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis for wild-type livers also revealed that PPARα and RXRα bound consistently to PPRE (from bp −174 to −163) in the XOD gene at both light and dark phases (Fig. 3B), whereas the recruitment of p300 on PPRE in the XOD gene varied in a circadian time–dependent manner. The oscillation observed in the recruitment of p300 showed a similar phase to the XOD mRNA rhythm (Fig. 2A). Because PPARα is a ligand-activated transcription factor, its transcription activity is modulated by endogenous and exogenous compounds (26Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Hypolipidemic drugs, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and eicosanoids are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and δ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the expression of PPARα target genes, in which intestinal expression exhibits circadian oscillations, was repressed by bile acid (25Oishi K. Shirai H. Ishida N. CLOCK is involved in the circadian transactivation of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) in mice.Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings (25Oishi K. Shirai H. Ishida N. CLOCK is involved in the circadian transactivation of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) in mice.Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), the PPARα/RXRα-mediated transactivation of XOD was dose-dependently repressed by cholic acid (CA) (Fig. 3C), a major component of bile acid in rodents (27de Aguiar Vallim T.Q. Tarling E.J. Edwards P.A. Pleiotropic roles of bile acids in metabolism.Cell Metab. 2013; 17: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the treatment of Hepa1–6 cells with cholic acid interfered with the recruitment of p300 to PPRE without changing the amounts of PPARα and RXRα binding (Fig. 3D). Treatment with CA also decreased the protein levels of XOD and its enzymatic activity in hepatic cells (Fig. 3E). Because the rhythmic phase of bile acid accumulation in the livers of wild-type mice was nearly opposite that of the XOD mRNA rhythm (Fig. 3F), the time-dependent accumulation of bile acid in hepatic cells may cause circadian oscillations in XOD expression through the periodic repression of PPARα/RXRα-mediated transactivation. Because the activity of XOD showed circadian oscillations in the livers of wild-type mice, we investigated whether the anti-hyperuricemic effects of XOD inhibitors change in a manner that is dependent on the administration time. To achieve this goal, we prepared a hyperuricemia mouse model using the uricase inhibitor oxonic acid (OA). In rodents, uric acid is efficiently degraded by uricase. Therefore, the inhibition of this oxidase leads to the accumulation of uric acid in the blood and tissues (28Osada Y. Tsuchimoto M. Fukushima H. Takahashi K. Kondo S. Hasegawa M. Komoriya K.

Indeed, serum uric acid concentrations in mice fed a 2% OA-containing diet gradually increased during the duration of the experiment (Fig. 4A), whereas the feeding of this diet had negligible effects on food intake and water consumption (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, body weight gains in mice fed the 2% OA-containing diet were similar to those observed in control mice (Fig. 4D). It is reported that the chronic intake of OA sometimes causes renal dysfunction (30Mazzali M. Kanellis J. Han L. Feng L. Xia Y.Y. Chen Q. Kang D.H. Gordon K.L. Watanabe S. Nakagawa T. Lan H.Y. Johnson R.J. Hyperuricemia induces a primary renal arteriolopathy in rats by a blood pressure-independent mechanism.Am. J. Physiol.

Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F1134-F1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); however, neither the renal expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-2 (Ngal) mRNA, a marker for tubular damage, nor serum urea nitrogen (SUN), a marker for renal dysfunction, was affected by feeding the 2% OA-containing diet for 2 weeks (Fig. 4, E and F). Feeding of the 2% OA-containing diet revealed a trend toward increased serum uric acid concentrations while still exhibiting time-dependent variations (Fig. 4G). Although circadian variations in hepatic XOD activity were not affected by feeding with the 2% OA-containing diet (Fig. 4H), the chronic feeding of the uricase inhibitor increased the amount of uric acid in the mouse liver at all time points examined (Fig. 4I). The amplitude of the rhythm in hepatic uric acid contents was not significantly increased by feeding with the 2% OA-containing diet, whereas the serum uric acid oscillation in mice fed the 2% OA-containing diet was enhanced from that in mice fed the control diet (Fig. 4J). On day 14 after the initiation of 2% OA-containing diet feeding, hyperuricemic mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered 0.4, 2, or 5 mg/kg body weight of febuxostat at zeitgeber time (ZT) 2 or ZT14, times at which serum uric acid levels in 2% OA-fed mice increased and declined, respectively (Fig. 4J). Serum uric acid concentrations in hyperuricemic mice transiently decreased after the single intraperitoneal administration of febuxostat at both dosing times (Fig. 5A) but returned to the basal level within 24 h of its administration. When hyperuricemic mice were administered 5 mg/kg febuxostat i.p. at ZT2 or ZT14, hepatic XOD activity was suppressed for at least 12 h, and the inhibitory effects of febuxostat wore off within 24 h of its administration at both dosing times (Fig. 5B). The time course of serum uric acid concentrations after the administration of febuxostat paralleled its inhibitory effect on XOD activity in the liver. To compare the anti-hyperuricemic effects of febuxostat, we calculated the area under the curve of serum uric acid concentrations from 0 to 24 h after the febuxostat injection (AUC0→24). Dose-dependent reductions in the AUC0→24 of serum uric acid concentrations were observed in hyperuricemic mice after the administration of febuxostat at both dosing times; however, AUC0→24 values after the administration of the drug at ZT2 were slightly lower than those in mice given the drug at ZT14 (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that the XOD inhibitor febuxostat effectively decreased serum uric acid concentrations when administered at the time of day prior to elevations in hepatic XOD activity. Several orphan nuclear receptors have been identified, and some have been characterized as lipid sensors that respond to elevated cellular lipid levels to regulate gene expression (32Kliewer S.A.

Integration of metabolism and inflammation by lipid-activated nuclear receptors.Nature. 2008; 454: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Although a number of polyunsaturated fatty acids serve as ligands of PPARα (34Jump D.B. The biochemistry of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8755-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), transcriptional activity is also modulated by endogenous as well as exogenous compounds (30Mazzali M. Kanellis J. Han L. Feng L. Xia Y.Y. Chen Q. Kang D.H. Gordon K.L. Watanabe S. Nakagawa T. Lan H.Y. Johnson R.J.

In this study, we demonstrated that PPARα acted as a transcriptional activator of the mouse XOD gene and the PPARα-mediated transactivation of XOD was repressed by bile acids. As previous and our present studies have demonstrated that the hepatic contents of bile acids vary in a circadian time–dependent manner (35Zhang Y.K. Guo G.L. Klaassen C.D. Diurnal variations of mouse plasma and hepatic bile acid concentrations as well as expression of biosynthetic enzymes and transporters.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e16683Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Han S.

Circadian control of bile acid synthesis by a KLF15-Fgf15 axis.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the expression of XOD may have oscillated due to the time-dependent suppression of PPARα-mediated transactivation by bile acids. PPARα and its heterodimer partner RXRα activate the transcription of the XOD gene by binding to PPRE; however, their binding on PPRE in the XOD gene was unaffected by CA. Consistent with previous findings (22Okamura A. Koyanagi S. Dilxiat A. Kusunose N. Chen J.J. Matsunaga N. Shibata S. Ohdo S. Bile acid-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) activity underlies circadian expression of intestinal peptide absorption transporter PepT1/Slc15a1.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 25296-25305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), CA interfered with the recruitment of p300 on PPRE in mouse XOD genes, thereby repressing its transcription. Assembled or preassembled coactivator complexes facilitate the liganded PPARα to achieve the transcriptional activation of its target genes (37McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Minireview: Nuclear receptor coactivators–an update.Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2461-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Once p300 and also the CREB-binding protein are recruited to the liganded PPARα, they remodel the chromatin structure by intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activities. p300 interacts directly with the ligand-binding domain of PPARα (38Mochizuki K. Suruga K. Sakaguchi N. Takase S. Goda T. Major intestinal coactivator p300 strongly activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor in intestinal cell line, Caco-2.Gene. 2002; 291: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of PPARα (residues 448–468) is required for interaction with the N terminus of p300 spanning amino acids 39–117. Therefore, CA appears to interfere with the interaction between PPARα and p300, thereby suppressing XOD expression. In wild-type mice, hepatic bile acid contents fluctuated between 0.2 and 0.3 μmol/g tissue. Because the mean volume of the mouse liver was 1.33 ± 0.05 ml/g tissue (mean ± S.D.), hepatic concentrations of bile acid appear to oscillate between 154 and 231 μm. CA is a major component of bile acid in rodents. Its content is ∼42% of total bile acids (27de Aguiar Vallim T.Q. Tarling E.J. Edwards P.A. Pleiotropic roles of bile acids in metabolism.Cell Metab. 2013; 17: 657-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Therefore, hepatic concentrations of CA appear to fluctuate between 65 and 97 μm. This fluctuation is sufficient to affect XOD expression in the livers of mice because the PPARα/RXRα-induced expression of XOD mRNA in Hepa1–6 cells was significantly suppressed by CA at concentrations greater than 100 μm. A previous study reports that the expression of Pparα is under the control of the circadian clock (25Oishi K. Shirai H. Ishida N.

During thymic selection, T cells bearing T cell receptors (TCRs) with high affinity for self-antigen are eliminated. The affinity of the remaining low-avidity TCRs can be improved to increase their antitumor efficacy, but conventional saturation mutagenesis approaches are labor intensive, and the resulting TCRs may be cross-reactive. Here we describe the in vitro maturation and selection of mouse and human T cells on antigen-expressing feeder cells to develop higher-affinity TCRs. The approach takes advantage of natural Tcrb gene rearrangement to generate diversity in the length and composition of CDR3β. In vitro differentiation of progenitors transduced with a known Tcra gene in the presence of antigen drives differentiation of cells with a distinct agonist-selected phenotype. We purified these cells to generate TCRβ chain libraries pre-enriched for target antigen specificity. Several TCRβ chains paired with a transgenic TCRα chain to produce a TCR with higher affinity than the parental TCR for target antigen, without evidence of cross-reactivity."

At concentrations lower than 20 μg/ml, heparin accelerated fibrillation through transient formation of hetero-oligomeric aggregates.

Above 10 mg/ml, heparin again induced fibrillation after a long lag time preceded by oligomeric aggregate formation. Compared with studies performed using monovalent and divalent anions, the results suggest two distinct mechanisms of heparin-induced fibrillation. At low heparin concentrations, initial hen egg white lysozyme cluster formation and subsequent fibrillation is promoted by counter ion binding and screening of repulsive charges. At high heparin concentrations, fibrillation is caused by a combination of salting out and macromolecular crowding effects probably independent of protein net charge. Both fibrillation mechanisms compete against amorphous aggregation, producing a complex heparin concentration–dependent phase diagram. Moreover, the results suggest an active role for amorphous oligomeric aggregates in triggering fibrillation, whereby breakdown of supersaturation takes place through heterogeneous nucleation of amyloid on amorphous aggregates.

https://openalex.org/W2767541101,"NUAK1 is a member of the AMPK-related family of kinases. Recent evidence suggests that NUAK1 is an important regulator of cell adhesion and migration, cellular and organismal metabolism, and regulation of TAU stability. As such, NUAK1 may play key roles in multiple diseases ranging from neurodegeneration to diabetes and metastatic cancer. Previous work revealed a crucial role for NUAK1 in supporting viability of tumour cells specifically when MYC is overexpressed. This role is surprising, given that NUAK1 is activated by the tumour suppressor LKB1. Here we show that, in tumour cells lacking LKB1, NUAK1 activity is maintained by an alternative pathway involving calcium-dependent activation of PKCα. Calcium/PKCα-dependent activation of NUAK1 supports engagement of the AMPK-TORC1 metabolic checkpoint, thereby protecting tumour cells from MYC-driven cell death, and indeed, MYC selects for this pathway in part via transcriptional regulation of PKCα and ITPR. Our data point to a novel role for calcium in supporting tumour cell viability and clarify the synthetic lethal interaction between NUAK1 and MYC."

Analysis of hepatic glutathione (GSH) metabolism in a mouse model of HCU demonstrated significant depletion of cysteine, GSH, and GSH disulfide independent of the block in trans- sulfuration compared with wild-type controls. HCU induced the expression of the catalytic and regulatory subunits of γ-glutamyl ligase, GSH synthase (GS), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 1, 5-oxoprolinase (OPLAH), and the GSH- dependent methylglyoxal detoxification enzyme, glyoxalase-1. Multiple components of the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant-response regulatory axis were induced without any detectable activation of Nrf2. Metabolomic analysis revealed the accumulation of multiple γ-glutamyl amino acids and that plasma ophthalmate levels could serve as a noninvasive marker for hepatic redox stress. Neither cysteine, nor betaine treatment was able to reverse the observed enzyme inductions. Taurine treatment normalized the expression levels of γ-glutamyl ligase C/M, GS, OPLAH, and glyoxalase-1, and reversed HCU- induced deficits in protein glutathionylation by acting to double GSH levels relative to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that the perturbation of the γ-glutamyl cycle could contribute to multiple sequelae in HCU and that taurine has significant therapeutic potential for both HCU and other diseases for which GSH depletion is a critical pathogenic factor.—Maclean, K.

TCRαβ recognizes “foreign” peptides derived from proteins unique to a pathogenic process such as a viral protein or mutated host gene product within a transformed cell. A key feature of this recognition is that a peptide is presented in the context of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules on the surface of the abnormal cell or cross-presented on dedicated antigen-presenting cells that acquire the protein and surface-array the peptide. The pathogenically derived foreign pMHCs must be recognized in the context of tens of thousands of self-pMHCs generated as a result of the breakdown of endogenous proteins that are displayed on the same host cell. This discrimination is tuned through the harnessing of external cellular forces generated as a T cell scans its environment for foreign pMHC during immune surveillance as well as through the actuation of intracellular cytoskeletal forces that dynamically tune immune recognition (1Kim S.T.

The requirement for exquisite ligand discrimination, to selectively sense foreign pMHC over self-pMHC, drives selection processes in thymocyte development to eliminate αβTCRs with excess self-reactivity without removing those harboring the potential to bind foreign peptides. This is no simple task as a protective αβTCR should recognize self-MHC molecules while distinguishing foreign peptides from self-peptides in the groove of the self-MHC molecule.

We first added unlabeled VSV8/Kb to a purified 15N-labeled sample of N30β and acquired 1H-15N HSQC spectra with transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) selection of the mixture and compared it with a spectrum of N30β. Utilizing the backbone assignments of N30β (18Mallis R.J. Reinherz E.L. Wagner G. Arthanari H. Backbone resonance assignment of N15, N30 and D10 T cell receptor β subunits.Biomol.

The largest chemical shift changes were not localized to any single site on the surface of N30β but did cluster in the C domain at the conserved Cα- or pTα-Cβ interface (19Liu J. Tse A.G. Chang H.C.

Additional changes were seen in the C domain AB and EF helices, which are located proximal to the C terminus of the TCR. There were some scattered changes within the V domain, but these were not clustered as tightly as those identified in the C domain. This result suggested that any V domain interaction was weaker than the nonspecific interactions within the C domain, which is not known to interact with pMHC in the TCRαβ, making it unlikely that we were observing physiologically relevant interactions. To understand whether the C domain–mediated nonspecific interactions were a general phenomenon, we next studied the interaction of pMHC with N15β. Because N15β is known to self-associate (15Zhou B. Chen Q. Mallis R.J. Zhang H. Liu J.-H. Reinherz E.L. Wang J.-H. A conserved hydrophobic patch on Vβ domains revealed by TCRβ chain crystal structures: implications for pre-TCR dimerization.Front.

In CST experiments, the observed protein is 15N-labeled and perdeuterated, which implies that it will have no resonances in the aliphatic region of the 1H NMR spectrum. The binding partner, in this case pMHC, will be protonated and will harbor resonances in the aliphatic region, but because this protein is not 15N-labeled it will be invisible in a 15N HSQC spectrum. In CST experiments, we selectively magnetize the unlabeled protein and monitor transfer of magnetization to the labeled protein, which will reveal the direct interaction interface. In the case of N15β, we found a significant CST effect in the Vβ as well as Cβ (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the pre-TCR contains a pTα subunit that lacks a Vα-like subunit (Fig. 2A), we posit that the changes seen in the V domain were more physiologically relevant than those seen in the C domain (20Pang S.S.

https://openalex.org/W2766257079,"Diapause hormone (DH) is a 24-aa amidated neuropeptide that elicits the embryonic diapause of the silkworm, Bombyx mori (Bommo), via sensitive and selective interaction with its receptor, Bommo DH receptor (Bommo-DHR). Previous studies of the structure-activity relationship of Bommo-DH were all based on an in vivo diapause-induction bioassay, which has provided little information on the structure of Bommo-DHR or its iteration with DH. Here, to unveil the interaction of Bommo-DH with its receptor, N-terminally truncated analogs and alanine-scanning mutants of Bommo-DH were chemically synthesized and functionally evaluated by using a Cy5.5- labeled Bommo-DH competitive binding assay and Bommo-DHR-based functional assays, including cAMP assay and Ca2+ mobilization assay. Our study demonstrates that the C-terminal residues of Arg23 and Leu24 of Bommo- DH are essential for the binding and activation of Bommo-DHR, and that Trp19 and Phe20 also contribute to the functional activity of Bommo-DH. In contrast, when Gly21 or Pro22 were replaced with alanine, both mutants exhibited binding and signaling activities that were indistinguishable from the wild-type peptide. Furthermore, our homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, together with experimental validations, have identified the residues of Glu89, Phe172, Phe194, and Tyr299 in Bommo-DHR that are critically involved in the interaction with Bommo-DH. These results may deepen our understanding of the interactions of class-A GPCRs with their peptidic ligands, particularly those between pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide/DH family neuropeptides and their cognate receptors.—Shen, Z., Jiang, X., Yan, L., Chen, Y., Wang, W., Shi, Y., Shi, L., Liu, D., Zhou, N.

https://openalex.org/W2765391631,"Blood type B-specific Streptomyces sp. 27S5 hemagglutinin (SHA) was discovered and characterized in the 1970s. Although strain 27S5 has been lost, the purified SHA protein survived intact under frozen conditions and retained its activity. Using modern techniques, here we further characterized SHA. Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance MS analysis determined the average molecular mass of SHA as 13,314.67 Da. MS of digested SHA peptides, Streptomyces genomic database matching, and N-terminal sequencing solved the 131-residue amino acid sequence of SHA. We found that SHA is homologous to N-terminally truncated hypothetical proteins encoded by the genomes of Streptomyces lavendulae, Streptomyces sp. Mg1, and others. The gene of the closest homologue in S. lavendulae, a putative polysaccharide deacetylase (PDSL), encodes 68 additional N-terminal amino acids, and its C terminus perfectly matched the SHA sequence, except for a single Ala-to-Glu amino acid difference. We expressed recombinant SHA(PDSL-A108E) (rSHA) as an enzymatically cleavable fusion protein in Escherichia coli, and glycan microarray analyses indicated that refolded rSHA exhibits the blood type B– and l-rhamnose–specific characteristics of authentic SHA, confirming that rSHA is essentially identical with SHA produced by Streptomyces sp. 27S5. We noted that SHA comprises three similar domains, representing 70% of the protein, and that these SHA domains partially overlap with annotated clostridial hydrophobic with conserved W domains. Furthermore, examination of GFP-tagged SHA revealed binding to microbial surfaces. rSHA may be useful both for studying the role of SHA/clostridial hydrophobic with conserved W domains in carbohydrate binding and for developing novel diagnostics and therapeutics for l-rhamnose–containing microorganisms."
