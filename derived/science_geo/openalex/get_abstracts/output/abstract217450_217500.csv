https://openalex.org/W106414659,"There are a number of enzymes present in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli which can degrade deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and smaller polynucleotides derived from it (l-3). One of these enzymes, although unable to hydrolyze high molecular-weight DNA at an appreciable rate, will rapidly hydrolyze DNA which has undergone some prior degradation; it is in this respect analogous to the classical phosphodiesterase of snake venom (4). The purpose of this report is to describe in detail the purification and properties of this enzyme which will be referred to as the Escherichia coli phosphodiesterase. This diesterase has been found to hydrolyze E. coli and calf thymus DNA’s to their constituent 5’-mononucleotides once these polymers have undergone some degradation as a result either of heating or limited treatment with pancreatic DNase. The E. coli phosphodiesterase is also capable of degrading appropriately pretreated bacteriophage DNA’s bearing glucosylated hydroxymethyl cytosine to their constituent mononucleotides. In this respect, it differs from the venom diesterase, which is unable to catalyze the cleavage of most of the linkages in which glucosylated hydroxymethyl cytosine is involved (5-7). In further contrast to the venom diesterase, the E. coli phosphodiesterase cannot hydrolyze either free dinucleotides or the 5’-terminal dinucleotide portion of a polydeoxynucleotide chain."

https://openalex.org/W2080807813,"MELATONIN is a hormone, isolated from beef pineal glands, that lightens the colour of frog melanocytes either after injection into the frog or after in vitro incubation with pieces of frog skin1. In addition, this hormone can block and reverse the darkening actions of the melanocyte-stimulating hormones and also of adrenocorticotrophic hormone. Melatonin is a 5-hydroxyindole derivative in which the hydroxy group is blocked2. Its melanocyte-lightening properties are more than ten thousand times greater than those of noradrenaline, which previously was considered to be the most potent lightening agent known3. In our early experiments melatonin could be detected only in extracts from pineal glands and not from other tissues. With improvement in extraction techniques we have been able to identify the presence of a lightening agent that is most likely melatonin in peripheral nerves of man, monkey and cow. A detailed mapping of the location of melatonin in the nervous system has not been completed."

These three types of inhibition were reversed instantaneously by the addition of calcium ions."

https://openalex.org/W153372015,"In a recent report from these laboratories (2), an in situ perfusion method was described which could be used to measure the transfer of substances in either direction across the guinea pig placenta. When the procedure was applied to the estrogens, it was found that the unconjugated hormones, estrone, estradiol170, and estriol were transferred quickly under conditions in which the placenta posed an effective barrier to their glucuronide conjugates. However, it was found that when estrogens were administered to the mother, conjugates other than glucosiduronates were detected in the umbilical circulation. In the present report, evidence is presented indicating that these conjugates are estrogen sulfates, that the placenta is impermeable to these conjugates, but that the placenta can sulfurylate estrogens and release them into the umbilical circulation."

https://openalex.org/W2059011343,Flicker waveform has been found to have a slight but specific effect upon fusion threshold. A depression of threshold amplitude of about 30 percent occurs if a second harmonic of near-threshold amplitude is added to the fundamental. The magnitude of the depression depends critically on the relative phase of the two components of the waveform.

This report presents an analysis of their results which indicates the likelihood that at fusion threshold all but one of the Fourier components of their presentation are imperceptible.

This relationship, of which the well-known moon illusion is a special case, is interpreted to be a consequence of the normal development of size constancy."

Addition of a sublethal chemical to the culture produced a higher correlation coefficient, whereas growth of the culture in an electric field reduced the correlation well below the level of significance. The electric field appeared to have a protective action."

In galactose-fed animals this inhibition occurs prior to the apparent inhibition of soluble protein synthesis in the ocular lens."
https://openalex.org/W2037236768,Culturing of embryonic bone in vitro showed that both chick and rat bone could discriminate against strontium in favor of calcium. The ends of the bones showed a lower Sr/sup 89//Ca/sup 45/ ratio than the shafts. The degree of selection was not dependent upon the species of origin of the serum used in the medium or upon the age of the bones. Heat-treating of the bones destroyed the ability to select against strontium; for live bone the mechanism functioned at 37 deg but not at 4 deg and 25 deg . Selection occurred at some point after the initial entry of the alkaline earth metals into the bone and was associated with the incorporation of the radioisotopes into a less labile form of bone mineral. Loss of radioactivity from this less labile fraction occurred only with viable bone at 37 deg . The Sr/sup 89/Ca/sup 45/ ratio of the bones relative to the same ratio for the medium as well as the total uptake of radioisotopes could be varied by incorporating enzyme inhibitors into the medium.

https://openalex.org/W2116441570,"SUMMARY Cells cultured directly from various rabbit organs (liver, kid- ney, lung), unlike the permanently cultivatable mammalian cells studied, require relatively large concentrations of folic acid for growth or to attain a maximal rate of growth. The defect in the primary cultures may be related to the reduction of folic acid. Consistent is the observation that 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid is about 30 times more active than the unreduced vitamins tested. With the liver cells, the folic acid requirement is satisfied by a mixture of thymidme, adenine, and glycine. The rate of growth of the liver cells can be readily manipulated with the vitamin, whereas cell yields can be controlled by the availability of thy- midine and adenine. Contrary to the behavior of bacteria, liver cells incorporate thymidine even under conditions of gratuity. Thymidine cannot be replaced with thymine or with any of the other pyrimidines, purines, and derivatives examined. On the other hand, all the purines and derivatives tested, except guanine, appear to be capable of substituting for adenine."

https://openalex.org/W2065575150,A highly specific adenosine triphosphatase has been found to be localized in the contractile apparatus of vorticellids. It is most prominent in the cilia as well as in the myonemes which course the latitudes and longitudes of the cell and spiral in the flat peristome. The stalk displays more activity in the spasmoneme sheath than in the spasmoneme itself. The spasmoneme canal appears negative. A delicate fiber coils around the outside of the stalk in a helix. All these structures may be seen in the living protozoan by phasecontrast microscopy.

Two analogous compounds derived from phenol are depressor. None is a potent anticholinesterase. Further investigation is desirable because of the possibility of a relatively specific action on sympathetic ganglia."
