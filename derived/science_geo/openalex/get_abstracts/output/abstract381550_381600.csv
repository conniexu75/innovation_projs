https://openalex.org/W2068256216,"Background Insulin resistance is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease progression. Current diagnostic tests, such as glycemic indicators, have limitations in the early detection of insulin resistant individuals. We searched for novel biomarkers identifying these at-risk subjects. Methods Using mass spectrometry, non-targeted biochemical profiling was conducted in a cohort of 399 nondiabetic subjects representing a broad spectrum of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (based on the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and oral glucose tolerance testing, respectively). Results Random forest statistical analysis selected α-hydroxybutyrate (α–HB) as the top-ranked biochemical for separating insulin resistant (lower third of the clamp-derived MFFM = 33 [12] µmol·min−1·kgFFM−1, median [interquartile range], n = 140) from insulin sensitive subjects (MFFM = 66 [23] µmol·min−1·kgFFM−1) with a 76% accuracy. By targeted isotope dilution assay, plasma α–HB concentrations were reciprocally related to MFFM; and by partition analysis, an α–HB value of 5 µg/ml was found to best separate insulin resistant from insulin sensitive subjects. α–HB also separated subjects with normal glucose tolerance from those with impaired fasting glycemia or impaired glucose tolerance independently of, and in an additive fashion to, insulin resistance. These associations were also independent of sex, age and BMI. Other metabolites from this global analysis that significantly correlated to insulin sensitivity included certain organic acid, amino acid, lysophospholipid, acylcarnitine and fatty acid species. Several metabolites are intermediates related to α-HB metabolism and biosynthesis. Conclusions α–hydroxybutyrate is an early marker for both insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation. The underlying biochemical mechanisms may involve increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2029575024,"Using pair-end transcriptome sequencing, this study provides the identification of Raf pathway gene rearrangements in a small proportion of prostate and gastric cancers and in melanomas. The fusion proteins show tumorigenic potential and represent a unique activating alteration of this oncogenic pathway, which seems to be mutually exclusive from known cancer-associated Raf mutations. This suggests that therapeutic Raf inhibition can be expanded to this fusion-harboring subset of solid tumors. Although recurrent gene fusions involving erythroblastosis virus E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factors are common in prostate cancer, their products are considered 'undruggable' by conventional approaches. Recently, rare targetable gene fusions involving the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) gene, have been identified in 1–5% of lung cancers1, suggesting that similar rare gene fusions may occur in other common epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer. Here we used paired-end transcriptome sequencing to screen ETS rearrangement–negative prostate cancers for targetable gene fusions and identified the SLC45A3-BRAF (solute carrier family 45, member 3–v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1) and ESRP1-RAF1 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein-1–v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog-1) gene fusions. Expression of SLC45A3-BRAF or ESRP1-RAF1 in prostate cells induced a neoplastic phenotype that was sensitive to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAP2K1) inhibitors. Screening a large cohort of patients, we found that, although rare, recurrent rearrangements in the RAF pathway tend to occur in advanced prostate cancers, gastric cancers and melanoma. Taken together, our results emphasize the key role of RAF family gene rearrangements in cancer, suggest that RAF and MEK inhibitors may be useful in a subset of gene fusion–harboring solid tumors and demonstrate that sequencing of tumor transcriptomes and genomes may lead to the identification of rare targetable fusions across cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W2043642851,"Background Ergosterol has been considered the “fungal sterol” for almost 125 years; however, additional sterol data superimposed on a recent molecular phylogeny of kingdom Fungi reveals a different and more complex situation. Methodology/Principal Findings The interpretation of sterol distribution data in a modern phylogenetic context indicates that there is a clear trend from cholesterol and other Δ5 sterols in the earliest diverging fungal species to ergosterol in later diverging fungi. There are, however, deviations from this pattern in certain clades. Sterols of the diverse zoosporic and zygosporic forms exhibit structural diversity with cholesterol and 24-ethyl -Δ5 sterols in zoosporic taxa, and 24-methyl sterols in zygosporic fungi. For example, each of the three monophyletic lineages of zygosporic fungi has distinctive major sterols, ergosterol in Mucorales, 22-dihydroergosterol in Dimargaritales, Harpellales, and Kickxellales (DHK clade), and 24-methyl cholesterol in Entomophthorales. Other departures from ergosterol as the dominant sterol include: 24-ethyl cholesterol in Glomeromycota, 24-ethyl cholest-7-enol and 24-ethyl-cholesta-7,24(28)-dienol in rust fungi, brassicasterol in Taphrinales and hypogeous pezizalean species, and cholesterol in Pneumocystis. Conclusions/Significance Five dominant end products of sterol biosynthesis (cholesterol, ergosterol, 24-methyl cholesterol, 24-ethyl cholesterol, brassicasterol), and intermediates in the formation of 24-ethyl cholesterol, are major sterols in 175 species of Fungi. Although most fungi in the most speciose clades have ergosterol as a major sterol, sterols are more varied than currently understood, and their distribution supports certain clades of Fungi in current fungal phylogenies. In addition to the intellectual importance of understanding evolution of sterol synthesis in fungi, there is practical importance because certain antifungal drugs (e.g., azoles) target reactions in the synthesis of ergosterol. These findings also invalidate use of ergosterol as an indicator of biomass of certain fungal taxa (e.g., Glomeromycota).

https://openalex.org/W1993846065,"miRNAs have been shown to be essential for normal cartilage development in the mouse. However, the role of specific miRNAs in cartilage function is unknown. Using rarely available healthy human chondrocytes (obtained from 8 to 50 year old patients), we detected a most highly abundant primary miRNA H19, whose expression was heavily dependent on cartilage master regulator SOX9. Across a range of murine tissues, expression of both H19- and H19-derived miR-675 mirrored that of cartilage-specific SOX9. miR-675 was shown to up-regulate the essential cartilage matrix component COL2A1, and overexpression of miR-675 rescued COL2A1 levels in H19- or SOX9-depleted cells. We thus provide evidence that SOX9 positively regulates COL2A1 in human articular chondrocytes via a previously unreported miR-675-dependent mechanism. This represents a novel pathway regulating cartilage matrix production and identifies miR-675 as a promising new target for cartilage repair."
https://openalex.org/W2073164616,"Gossypol, a natural Bcl-2 homology domain 3 mimetic compound isolated from cottonseeds, is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Here, we provide evidence that gossypol induces autophagy followed by apoptotic cell death in both the MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma and HeLa cell lines. We first show that knockdown of the Bcl-2 homology domain 3-only protein Beclin 1 reduces gossypol-induced autophagy in MCF-7 cells, but not in HeLa cells. Gossypol inhibits the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2), antagonizes the inhibition of autophagy by Bcl-2, and hence stimulates autophagy. We then show that knockdown of Vps34 reduces gossypol-induced autophagy in both cell lines, and consistent with this, the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein WIPI-1 is recruited to autophagosomal membranes. Further, Atg5 knockdown also reduces gossypol-mediated autophagy. We conclude that gossypol induces autophagy in both a canonical and a noncanonical manner. Notably, we found that gossypol-mediated apoptotic cell death was potentiated by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor wortmannin or with small interfering RNA against essential autophagy genes (Vps34, Beclin 1, and Atg5). Our findings support the notion that gossypol-induced autophagy is cytoprotective and not part of the cell death process induced by this compound."
https://openalex.org/W2045028907,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act in post-transcriptional gene silencing and are proposed to function in a wide spectrum of pathologies, including cancers and viral diseases. Currently, to our knowledge, no detailed mechanistic characterization of small molecules that interrupt miRNA pathways have been reported. In screening a small chemical library, we identified compounds that suppress RNA interference activity in cultured cells. Two compounds were characterized; one impaired Dicer activity while the other blocked small RNA-loading into an Argonaute 2 (AGO2) complex. We developed a cell-based model of miRNA-dependent tumorigenesis, and using this model, we observed that treatment of cells with either of the two compounds effectively neutralized tumor growth. These findings indicate that miRNA pathway-suppressing small molecules could potentially reverse tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964394222,"Heart muscle is metabolically versatile, converting energy stored in fatty acids, glucose, lactate, amino acids, and ketone bodies. Here, we use mouse models in ketotic nutritional states (24 h of fasting and a very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet) to demonstrate that heart muscle engages a metabolic response that limits ketone body utilization. Pathway reconstruction from microarray data sets, gene expression analysis, protein immunoblotting, and immunohistochemical analysis of myocardial tissue from nutritionally modified mouse models reveal that ketotic states promote transcriptional suppression of the key ketolytic enzyme, succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT; encoded by Oxct1), as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-dependent induction of the key ketogenic enzyme HMGCS2. Consistent with reduction of SCOT, NMR profiling demonstrates that maintenance on a ketogenic diet causes a 25% reduction of myocardial 13C enrichment of glutamate when 13C-labeled ketone bodies are delivered in vivo or ex vivo, indicating reduced procession of ketones through oxidative metabolism. Accordingly, unmetabolized substrate concentrations are higher within the hearts of ketogenic diet-fed mice challenged with ketones compared with those of chow-fed controls. Furthermore, reduced ketone body oxidation correlates with failure of ketone bodies to inhibit fatty acid oxidation. These results indicate that ketotic nutrient environments engage mechanisms that curtail ketolytic capacity, controlling the utilization of ketone bodies in ketotic states.

https://openalex.org/W2073642561,"The ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is also induced under different pathological and physiological conditions. Studies including ours have shown that CYP2E1 is bimodally targeted to both the endoplasmic reticulum (microsomes) (mc CYP2E1) and mitochondria (mt CYP2E1). In this study we investigated the role of mtCYP2E1 in ethanol-mediated oxidative stress in stable cell lines expressing predominantly mt CYP2E1 or mc CYP2E1. The ER+ mutation (A2L, A9L), which increases the affinity of the nascent protein for binding to the signal recognition particle, preferentially targets CYP2E1 to the endoplasmic reticulum. The Mt+ (L17G) and Mt++ (I8R, L11R, L17R) mutant proteins, showing progressively lower affinity for signal recognition particle binding, were targeted to mitochondria at correspondingly higher levels. The rate of GSH depletion, used as a measure of oxidative stress, was higher in cells expressing Mt++ and Mt+ proteins as compared with cells expressing ER+ protein. In addition, the cellular level of F(2)-isoprostanes, a direct indicator of oxidative stress, was increased markedly in Mt++ cells after ethanol treatment. Notably, expression of Mt++ CYP2E1 protein in yeast cells caused more severe mitochondrial DNA damage and respiratory deficiency than the wild type or ER+ proteins as tested by the inability of cells to grow on glycerol or ethanol. Additionally, liver mitochondria from ethanol-fed rats containing high mt CYP2E1 showed higher levels of F(2)-isoprostane production. These results strongly suggest that mt CYP2E1 induces oxidative stress and augments alcohol-mediated cell/tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W2068094427,"The pannexins (Panx1, -2, and -3) are a mammalian family of putative single membrane channels discovered through homology to invertebrate gap junction-forming proteins, the innexins. Because connexin gap junction proteins are known regulators of neural stem and progenitor cell proliferation, migration, and specification, we asked whether pannexins, specifically Panx2, play a similar role in the postnatal hippocampus. We show that Panx2 protein is differentially expressed by multipotential progenitor cells and mature neurons. Both in vivo and in vitro, Type I and IIa stem-like neural progenitor cells express an S-palmitoylated Panx2 species localizing to Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Protein expression is down-regulated during neurogenesis in neuronally committed Type IIb and III progenitor cells and immature neurons. Panx2 is re-expressed by neurons following maturation. Protein expressed by mature neurons is not palmitoylated and localizes to the plasma membrane. To assess the impact of Panx2 on neuronal differentiation, we used short hairpin RNA to suppress Panx2 expression in Neuro2a cells. Knockdown significantly accelerated the rate of neuronal differentiation. Neuritic extension and the expression of antigenic markers of mature neurons occurred earlier in stable lines expressing Panx2 short hairpin RNA than in controls. Together, these findings describe an endogenous post-translational regulation of Panx2, specific to early neural progenitor cells, and demonstrate that this expression plays a role in modulating the timing of their commitment to a neuronal lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2034929112,"Background The etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is largely determined by different genetic factors of variable impact. This genetic heterogeneity could be a factor to explain the clinical heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorders. Here, a first attempt is made to assess whether genetically more homogeneous ASD groups are associated with decreased phenotypic heterogeneity with respect to their autistic symptom profile. Methodology The autistic phenotypes of ASD subjects with 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) and ASD subjects with Klinefelter Syndrome (KS) were statistically compared to the symptom profile of a large (genetically) heterogeneous ASD sample. Autism diagnostic interview-revised (ADI-R) variables were entered in different statistical analyses to assess differences in symptom homogeneity and the feasibility of discrimination of group-specific ASD-symptom profiles. Principal Findings The results showed substantially higher symptom homogeneity in both the genetic disorder ASD groups in comparison to the heterogeneous ASD sample. In addition, a robust discrimination between 22q11-ASD and KS-ASD and idiopathic ASD phenotypes was feasible on the basis of a reduced number of autistic scales and symptoms. The lack of overlap in discriminating subscales and symptoms between KS-ASD and 22q11DS-ASD suggests that their autistic symptom profiles cluster around different points in the total diagnostic space of profiles present in the general ASD population. Conclusion The findings of the current study indicate that the clinical heterogeneity of ASDs may be reduced when subgroups based on a specific genotype are extracted from the idiopathic ASD population. The current strategy involving the widely used ADI-R offers a relatively straightforward possibility for assessing genotype-phenotype ASD relationships. Reverse phenotype strategies are becoming more feasible, given the accumulating evidence for the existence of genetic variants of large effect in a substantial proportion of the ASD population."
https://openalex.org/W2090518780,"In humans, mutations in fibrillin-1 result in a variety of genetic disorders with distinct clinical phenotypes. While most of the known mutations in fibrillin-1 cause Marfan syndrome, a number of other mutations lead to clinical features unrelated to Marfan syndrome. Pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome is currently thought to be driven by mechanisms due to haploinsufficiency of wild-type fibrillin-1. However, haploinsufficiency-driven mechanisms cannot explain the distinct phenotypes found in other fibrillinopathies. To test the hypothesis that mutations in fibrillin-1 cause disorders through primary effects on microfibril structure, two different mutations were generated in Fbn1 in mice. One mutation leads to a truncated fibrillin-1 molecule that is tagged with green fluorescent protein, allowing visualization of mutant fibrillin-1 incorporated into microfibrils. In heterozygosity, these mutant mice demonstrate progressive fragmentation of the aortic elastic lamellae and also display fragmentation of microfibrils in other tissues. Fibrillin-2 epitopes are also progressively revealed in these mice, suggesting that fibrillin-2 immunoreactivity can serve as a marker for microfibril degradation. In contrast, a second mutation (in-frame deletion of the first hybrid domain) in fibrillin-1 results in stable microfibrils, demonstrating that fibrillin-1 molecules are not required to be in perfect register for microfibril structure and function and that the first hybrid domain is dispensable for microfibril assembly. Taken together, these results suggest that perturbation of microfibril structure may underlie one of the major features of the Marfan syndrome: fragmentation of aortic elastic lamellae.

https://openalex.org/W2160475557,"Coral animals harbor diverse microorganisms in their tissues, including archaea, bacteria, viruses, and zooxanthellae. The extent to which coral-bacterial associations are specific and the mechanisms for their maintenance across generations in the environment are unknown. The high diversity of bacteria in adult coral colonies has made it challenging to identify species-specific patterns. Localization of bacteria in gametes and larvae of corals presents an opportunity for determining when bacterial-coral associations are initiated and whether they are dynamic throughout early development. This study focuses on the early onset of bacterial associations in the mass spawning corals Montastraea annularis, M. franksi, M. faveolata, Acropora palmata, A. cervicornis, Diploria strigosa, and A. humilis. The presence of bacteria and timing of bacterial colonization was evaluated in gametes, swimming planulae, and newly settled polyps by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using general eubacterial probes and laser-scanning confocal microscopy. The coral species investigated in this study do not appear to transmit bacteria via their gametes, and bacteria are not detectable in or on the corals until after settlement and metamorphosis. This study suggests that mass-spawning corals do not acquire, or are not colonized by, detectable numbers of bacteria until after larval settlement and development of the juvenile polyp. This timing lays the groundwork for developing and testing new hypotheses regarding general regulatory mechanisms that control bacterial colonization and infection of corals, and how interactions among bacteria and juvenile polyps influence the structure of bacterial assemblages in corals."
https://openalex.org/W2059274863,"Three groups of male Wistar rats were pair fed NIH-31 diets for 14 days to which were added 30% of calories as corn starch, palm oil, or R-3-hydroxybutyrate-R-1,3-butanediol monoester (3HB-BD ester). On the 14th day, animal brains were removed by freeze-blowing, and brain metabolites measured. Animals fed the ketone ester diet had elevated mean blood ketone bodies of 3.5 mm and lowered plasma glucose, insulin, and leptin. Despite the decreased plasma leptin, feeding the ketone ester diet ad lib decreased voluntary food intake 2-fold for 6 days while brain malonyl-CoA was increased by about 25% in ketone-fed group but not in the palm oil fed group. Unlike the acute effects of ketone body metabolism in the perfused working heart, there was no increased reduction in brain free mitochondrial [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio nor in the free energy of ATP hydrolysis, which was compatible with the observed 1.5-fold increase in brain uncoupling proteins 4 and 5. Feeding ketone ester or palm oil supplemented diets decreased brain L-glutamate by 15-20% and GABA by about 34% supporting the view that fatty acids as well as ketone bodies can be metabolized by the brain."

IntroductionEnamel development can be subdivided into three major functional stages: presecretion, secretion, and maturation (1Nanci A. Ten Cate's Oral Histology Development, Structure and Function. 7th Ed. Mosby Elsevier, St Louis, Missouri2008: 147Google Scholar). Crystal nucleation and growth involve the release of hydrogen ions, which results in a decrease of the local pH to very acidic levels and could lead to demineralization of the crystals (2Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 84-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Mineral deposition in amelogenesis requires tight control of pH via specific H+/base transport processes. The SLC4 family of bicarbonate transport proteins plays an important role in regulating intra- and extracellular pH and are arguably considered the most important buffer system in eukaryotic cells (3Pushkin A. Kurtz I. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F580-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Two members of the SLC4 (solute carrier bicarbonate transport family) have been identified in ameloblasts (4Lyaruu D.M. Bronckers A.L. Mulder L. Mardones P. Medina J.F. Kellokumpu S.

However, there is no information regarding the requirement of NBCe1 in tooth and enamel formation in part because extensive analysis of the dentition of patients with NBCe1 mutations is lacking. In the present study, ameloblasts cells dissected from the late secretory stage of amelogenesis were analyzed to investigate our hypothesis that NBCe1 plays an important role in tooth formation. NBCe1−/− and wild-type mice were used as a model system. Our results demonstrate for the first time that enamel development in mammals requires NBCe1 and more specifically the NBCe1-B variant.DISCUSSIONOne of the earliest reports of congenital renal and dental disease being present together is from Winsnes et al.

A genetic explanation of this association between renal disease and enamel malformations only recently has been established. Patients with SLC4A4 mutations encoding NBCe1 have enamel abnormalities (7Dinour D. Chang M.H. Satoh J. Smith B.L. Angle N. Knecht A. Serban I. Holtzman E.J. Romero M.F. J. Biol.

Therefore, although there are some case reports supporting a connection between pRTA and dental disease in a human population, the number of reports is limited, and because of this, the genetic and biochemical basis has not been forthcoming until recently (5Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Wang H.J. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Liu W. Kao L.Y. Wall S.M. Kim Y.H. Kurtz I. J. Dent. Res. 2008; 87: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In this study, we have focused on the dental phenotype in animals with a targeted disruption to the Slc4a4 gene locus resulting in no NBCe1 protein expression (6Gawenis L.R. Bradford E.M. Prasad V. Lorenz J.N. Simpson J.E. Clarke L.L. Woo A.L. Grisham C. Sanford L.P. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9042-9052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Slc4a4 encodes for the protein NBCe1 that has three variants differing in their N and C termini. Our previous data identified NBCe1 as being expressed during enamel formation, and further, our data suggest that the NBCe1-B is the unique variant in ameloblast cells in vivo (Fig. 1) (5Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Wang H.J. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Liu W. Kao L.Y. Wall S.M. Kim Y.H. Kurtz I. J. Dent. Res. 2008; 87: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the model presented by Paine et al. (5Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Wang H.J. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Liu W. Kao L.Y. Wall S.M. Kim Y.H. Kurtz I. J. Dent. Res. 2008; 87: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it was shown that the expression of NBCe1 was restricted to the basolateral membrane of ameloblasts, suggesting that this membrane protein plays an important role in regulating pH during amelogenesis. Our results demonstrate that the enamel of NBCe1−/− animals is abnormal, as it is hypoplastic, extremely hypomineralized, and weak. Western blotting did not reveal any significant difference in amelogenin expression among the various groups (Fig. 5). The phenotype observed on NBCe1−/− animals is similar to that previously described as “amelogenesis imperfecta.”Maintenance of a near physiological pH is thus important critically for normal enamel formation during the secretory and maturation stages because of the large production of hydrogen ions generated during hydroxyapatite formation (2Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 84-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 26Smith C.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Here, disrupting NBCe1 activity in ameloblasts, as seen in the NBCe1−/− animals, results in an extremely hypomineralized and weak enamel with clearly visible alterations to the expected prismatic architecture. The role of NBCe1 in amelogenesis is to allow for the passage of extracellular bicarbonate into the ameloblast cell cytoplasm from the basal or basolateral membrane, being up-regulated during the later phases of enamel formation (5Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Wang H.J. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Liu W. Kao L.Y. Wall S.M. Kim Y.H. Kurtz I. J. Dent. Res. 2008; 87: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Bicarbonate is, in turn, secreted across the apical membrane via the anion exchanger AE2 (5Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Wang H.J. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Liu W. Kao L.Y. Wall S.M. Kim Y.H. Kurtz I. J. Dent. Res. 2008; 87: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As pointed out however, the sequence of events regulating pH homeostasis and bicarbonate transport during amelogenesis still are being defined (5Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Wang H.J. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Liu W. Kao L.Y. Wall S.M. Kim Y.H. Kurtz I. J. Dent. Res. 2008; 87: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whereas it generally has been considered that bicarbonate act as a pH buffering mechanism in response to the release of hydrogen ion during crystal nucleation (2Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 84-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 26Smith C.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), it may be the case that bicarbonate ions are instead transported by ameloblasts prior to the early phases of crystal nucleation (9Lacruz R.S. Nanci A. Kurtz I. Wright J.T. Paine M.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2010; 86: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this scenario, ameloblasts specifically regulate the magnitude of bicarbonate secretion as a primary event (independent of changes in extracellular pH) promoting crystal nucleation by creating a microenvironment that decreases the solubility of calcium phosphate, a crystal growth inhibitor.In addition to having this capacity for trans-cellular bicarbonate transport, ameloblasts have the capacity to generate intracellular bicarbonate efficiently during the secretory as well as in the rough-ended stage of maturation when the cells are tightly bound and intracellular movement of ions is impeded (9Lacruz R.S. Nanci A. Kurtz I. Wright J.T. Paine M.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2010; 86: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Smith C.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In rodents, carbonic anhydrases have been identified in enamel-producing cells (ameloblasts) (11Lacruz R.S. Hilvo M. Kurtz I. Paine M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 393: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Toyosawa S. Ogawa Y. Inagaki T. Ijuhin N.

Oral Sci. 2006; 114: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and a number of reports demonstrated that Car2 (carbonic anhydrase II) (27Toyosawa S. Ogawa Y. Inagaki T. Ijuhin N. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 285: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Lin H.M. Nakamura H. Noda T. Ozawa H. Calcif.

Oral Sci. 2006; 114: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) are expressed more highly by maturation stage ameloblasts. No doubt that similar carbonic anhydrase expression profiles are evident in higher mammals. Thus, carbonic anhydrases, as well as NBCe1 and AE2, Cftr are part of the known pH regulation pathways used by ameloblasts to maintain pH homeostasis (9Lacruz R.S. Nanci A. Kurtz I. Wright J.T. Paine M.L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2010; 86: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), although further details of their spatiotemporal localization are yet to be fully resolved. With respect to Cftr expression in ameloblasts, it has been shown recently that Cftr localizes to the apical or secretory pole of polarized ameloblasts and is clearly up-regulated in later stages of amelogenesis (30Bronckers A. Kalogeraki L. Jorna H.J. Wilke M. Bervoets T.J. Lyaruu D.M. Zandieh-Doulabi B. Denbesten P. de Jonge H. Bone. 2010; 46: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).NBCe1 immunoreactivity in odontoblasts suggests that NBCe1 also is expressed during dentin formation (Fig. 4, G and H). This appears confirmed by dentin hardness testing, which shows significantly softer dentin in NBCe1−/− animals (Table 1), although in the backscattered images of the dentin in NBCe1−/− animals, this is not so clearly discerned. Dentin hardness is much less affected than enamel.In summary, NBCe1 plays an essential role in normal tooth formation during development. The biophysical properties of enamel are highly perturbed as a direct consequence of abnormal development due to the loss of NBCe1 function. Thus, although it is widely appreciated that the acidity of ingested foods, drinks, or acidic salivary pH can affect enamel once fully formed teeth are exposed to these factors in the oral cavity, the results of this study demonstrate the importance of “internal” acid-base homeostasis in the normal development of enamel in mammals. IntroductionEnamel development can be subdivided into three major functional stages: presecretion, secretion, and maturation (1Nanci A. Ten Cate's Oral Histology Development, Structure and Function. 7th Ed. Mosby Elsevier, St Louis, Missouri2008: 147Google Scholar). Crystal nucleation and growth involve the release of hydrogen ions, which results in a decrease of the local pH to very acidic levels and could lead to demineralization of the crystals (2Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 84-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Mineral deposition in amelogenesis requires tight control of pH via specific H+/base transport processes. The SLC4 family of bicarbonate transport proteins plays an important role in regulating intra- and extracellular pH and are arguably considered the most important buffer system in eukaryotic cells (3Pushkin A. Kurtz I. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F580-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Two members of the SLC4 (solute carrier bicarbonate transport family) have been identified in ameloblasts (4Lyaruu D.M. Bronckers A.L. Mulder L. Mardones P. Medina J.F. Kellokumpu S. Oude Elferink R.P. Everts V. Matrix Biol. 2008; 27: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Wang H.J. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Liu W. Kao L.Y. Wall S.M. Kim Y.H.

Kurtz I. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F580-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Paine et al. (2008) investigated the expression of AE2 and NBCe1 in ameloblasts by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcribed-PCR (RT-PCR) (5Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Wang H.J. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Liu W. Kao L.Y. Wall S.M. Kim Y.H. Kurtz I. J. Dent. Res. 2008; 87: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AE2 was expressed apically, whereas NBCe1 was expressed on the basolateral membrane (5Paine M.L. Snead M.L. Wang H.J. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Liu W. Kao L.Y. Wall S.M. Kim Y.H. Kurtz I. J. Dent. Res. 2008; 87: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additional RT-PCR experiments showed that ameloblasts express the AE2a and NBCe1-B variants.Mice with a targeted disruption to the Slc4a4 gene locus (NBCe1−/− mice) have a severe and fatal phenotype (6Gawenis L.R.

However, there is no information regarding the requirement of NBCe1 in tooth and enamel formation in part because extensive analysis of the dentition of patients with NBCe1 mutations is lacking. In the present study, ameloblasts cells dissected from the late secretory stage of amelogenesis were analyzed to investigate our hypothesis that NBCe1 plays an important role in tooth formation. NBCe1−/− and wild-type mice were used as a model system. Our results demonstrate for the first time that enamel development in mammals requires NBCe1 and more specifically the NBCe1-B variant."

In mammals, the sperm acrosomal protein zonadhesin is a rapidly evolving molecule with species-specific binding activity for the egg zona pellucida (ZP). Here we show using null mice produced by targeted disruption of Zan that zonadhesin confers species specificity to sperm-ZP adhesion. Sperm capacitation selectively exposed a partial von Willebrand D domain of mouse zonadhesin on the surface of living, motile cells. Antibodies to the exposed domain inhibited adhesion of wild-type spermatozoa to the mouse ZP but did not inhibit adhesion of spermatozoa lacking zonadhesin. Zan−/− males were fertile, and their spermatozoa readily fertilized mouse eggs in vitro. Remarkably, however, loss of zonadhesin increased adhesion of mouse spermatozoa to pig, cow, and rabbit ZP but not mouse ZP. We conclude that zonadhesin mediates species-specific ZP adhesion, and Zan−/− males are fertile because their spermatozoa retain adhesion capability that is not species-specific. Mammalian sperm-ZP adhesion is therefore molecularly robust, and species-specific egg recognition by a protein in the sperm acrosome is conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates, even though the adhesion molecules themselves are unrelated.

Mammalian sperm-ZP adhesion is therefore molecularly robust, and species-specific egg recognition by a protein in the sperm acrosome is conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates, even though the adhesion molecules themselves are unrelated. Sperm adhesion to the egg extracellular coat is a key cell recognition event in animal reproduction. This essential interaction represents the first direct, physical contact between the gametes, and in diverse animals confers species specificity to fertilization (1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Sperm-egg recognition in externally fertilizing marine invertebrates such as sea urchin (phylum Echinodermata, class Echinoidea) and abalone (phylum Mollusca, class Gastropoda) occurs by species-specific binding of single proteins in the acrosome, a secretory organelle on the apical head of spermatozoa, to complementary molecules on the egg (2Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Although species-specific gamete recognition in these two taxa is mediated by a conserved subcellular interaction (the sperm acrosome with the egg vitelline layer), the abalone and sea urchin gamete recognition proteins are structurally unrelated to each other (2Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in both taxa rapid molecular evolution by positive selection produced the structural diversity underlying the recognition proteins' species-specific binding activities (2Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and the species specificity of fertilization conferred by these proteins contributes to the reproductive isolation of their constituent species (2Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar).

One challenge is that the mammalian fertilization environment in vivo cannot easily be reproduced in vitro. In addition, mammalian sperm populations are functionally heterogeneous because the cells undergo progressive, asynchronous physiological changes during transport and capacitation in the female tract that alter their adhesion activity prior to interaction with the egg at the site of fertilization (1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar).

Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003Google Scholar). Germ line-transmitting chimeras for ES cell clones ZV1-B9 (“B9”) and ZV1-E5 (“E5”) identified by agouti coat color and black eyes of offspring from crosses with CD-1 mice were then bred to 129S2/SvPasCrl (Charles River Laboratory) to establish mouse lines on a relatively uniform genetic background similar to that of the 129S1/Sv ES cells used for Zan targeting. Natural mating studies were performed with 129S2/SvPas mouse lines derived from both ES cell clones and also with 129S2/SvPas lines intercrossed with C57BL/6Crl mice to examine fertility on a more fecund background. Zonadhesin function in vitro was characterized using spermatozoa from littermates bred 5–6 generations to the C57BL/6Crl background. The short arm Southern blot probe (336 bp) was amplified by PCR using Zan_202574F and Zan_202940R (primer sequences listed in supplemental Table S1). The long arm Southern probe (333 bp) was generated using primers Zan_long_F3 and Zan_long_R1. PCR genotyping of DNA from proteinase K-digested ear punches using primers Zan_195666F and Zan_195891 amplified a 225-bp band that is absent in the recombined Zan locus. Zan_199946R and the vector-derived primer ZV1_inloxF amplified a 357-bp band to detect the modified Zan locus. RNA (2 μg) isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) from mouse testes flash-frozen in N2(l) was reverse-transcribed with 200 units of murine-Maloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 25 ng/ml oligo(dT)15. Two PCR primers sets (11F/13R and D3F/D3R2) amplified a 372-bp product encoded by exons 11–13 (5 kb downstream of the deletion) and a 329-bp product encoded by exons 33–35 (37 kb downstream of the deletion) using the first strand cDNA template (25 μg RNA equivalent). A third primer set (MAMF/R) amplified a 310-bp product in the region deleted by gene targeting and served as a negative control for cDNA from null animals. Positive control primer sets amplified 222-bp β2-microglobulin and 983-bp G3pdh products. Domain-specific antibodies to mouse zonadhesin and control antibodies to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were affinity-purified from rabbit antisera as for preparation of antibodies to pig zonadhesin (18Hickox J.R. Bi M. Hardy D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41502-41509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Antigenic regions (see Fig. 1A) of von Willebrand D3 (Ile2168–Thr2270) and D3p18 (Cys4502–Lys4621) domains (accession number AAL04416) encoded by nucleotides 6680–6989 and 13,669–14,050, respectively, of the mouse zonadhesin transcript (accession number U97068) were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 as recombinant GST fusion proteins using pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Zonadhesin polypeptides were detected (18Hickox J.R. Bi M. Hardy D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41502-41509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using anti-D3 or anti-D3p18 (80 or 40 ng/ml overnight, respectively) on blots of disulfide-reduced (25 mm dithiothreitol) proteins extracted from cauda epididymal spermatozoa (1 × 106 sperm cells/lane) (21Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tardif S. Dubé C. Chevalier S. Bailey J.L. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and resolved on 4–10% gradient gels. Sperm antigens were detected in methanol-fixed and permeabilized mouse spermatozoa (18Hickox J.R. Bi M. Hardy D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41502-41509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using anti-D3 (2 μg/ml) or anti-D3p18 (1 μg/ml) affinity-purified antibodies or anti-hyaluronidase antiserum (1:400). Bound antibody was visualized with Alexa Fluor 594®-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (3 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Acrosomes were then labeled with biotinylated lectin from peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin (PNA; 0.1 mg/ml; Sigma) detected with Alexa Fluor 488®-conjugated streptavidin (3 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). Cells were viewed by epifluorescence and phase contrast microscopy at 600× magnification. Zonadhesin on living, motile spermatozoa was detected by incubating cells in suspension with anti-D3 (2 μg/ml) or anti-D3p18 (1 μg/ml) antibodies (37 °C, 30 min). After centrifugation (500 × g, 3 min), bound antibody was detected either on cells in suspension or on cells smeared and dried on slides as for immunofluorescence on fixed cells, with simultaneous detection of acrosomes using PNA. Capacitation was inferred by assessing sperm cells’ exocytotic response to 10 μm calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma), as only capacitated spermatozoa undergo acrosomal exocytosis induced by the ZP or by subthreshold concentrations of A23187 (23Tardif S. Sirard M.A. Sullivan R. Bailey J.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 54: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Spermatozoa were incubated 15–135 min in modified-Tyrode’s medium (24Fraser L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and then an additional 15 min with or without ionophore. Acrosomes were detected with PNA, and the percentage of capacitation was calculated as the difference in the number of cells lacking acrosomes with and without ionophore addition per 100 cells total (23Tardif S. Sirard M.A. Sullivan R. Bailey J.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 54: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mouse fertilization in vitro was also performed in modified-Tyrode’s medium (24Fraser L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using 5000 capacitated spermatozoa incubated 3 h with 15–20 cumulus-intact oocytes per 50-μl drop. Fertilization was scored by detection of Hoechst 33258-stained sperm nuclei in the egg cytoplasm and by expulsion of the second polar body. Effects of antibodies on fertilization in vitro were tested by including anti-D3, anti-D3p18, or anti-GST (1.5 μg/ml) during capacitation and transferring the diluted antibodies with spermatozoa when oocytes were inseminated. Mouse sperm-ZP adhesion was assessed by gamete co-incubation as for fertilization in vitro, except that cumulus cells were first removed from oocytes with hyaluronidase (0.25 mg/ml, ≤10 min), 10–15 oocytes were incubated 30 min with 2500 spermatozoa per 50-μl drop, and sperm-oocyte complexes were washed twice by pipetting (65–75-mm mouth diameter). Two-cell mouse embryos recovered 28 h after overnight mating were included with oocytes, and oocytes were pipette-washed until all loosely attached spermatozoa were removed from the embryos. Spermatozoa were counted on ZP viewed by differential interference contrast microscopy. Antibody inhibition of mouse sperm-ZP adhesion was determined as for testing antibody effects on fertilization in vitro. Pig, rabbit, and bovine oocytes were aspirated from mature follicles of fresh ovaries, cumulus cells were removed with hyaluronidase, and sperm adhesion to their ZP was assessed the same as for mouse oocytes. Pig sperm capacitation was induced by a 3-h incubation in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium (22Tardif S. Dubé C. Chevalier S. Bailey J.L. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In co-insemination experiments comparing species specificity of Zan+/+ and Zan−/− sperm adhesion to the ZP simultaneously on the same oocytes, spermatozoa from the two genotypes were separately capacitated 75 min at 1 × 107 cells/ml and labeled with Hoechst 33258 or MitoTracker (Invitrogen) for the final 15 min of capacitation. The differentially labeled cells were mixed in defined ratios (25:75 or 50:50% null:wild type), and adhesion of the mixed cells to ZP of mouse, pig, rabbit, or bovine oocytes was tested as for ZP adhesion using unlabeled cells. Neither dye affected sperm motility, and both were used alternately on the two Zan genotypes in the ZP adhesion assays. 2500 sperm cells were added to each drop containing 10–15 eggs, representing a 400-fold total dilution of the sperm suspension. Differences in litter sizes, surface exposure of zonadhesin, antibody inhibition of fertilization, and sperm-ZP adhesion were tested for significance by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using general linear model procedures (SAS software). The Fisher’s protected least significant difference (LSD) test was conducted when the main effect was significant (p < 0.05). The Z-test was used to compare the ratio of inseminated spermatozoa with the ratio of ZP-adherent cells in co-insemination ZP adhesion assays. To produce spermatozoa lacking zonadhesin, we disrupted the mouse zonadhesin gene by homologous recombination (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). Of seven targeted ES cell clones verified by Southern blotting (Fig. 1), two (B9 and E5) were used to make aggregation chimeras with Crl:(CD-1) ICR embryos. Germ line-transmitting, chimeric male founders for both lines were crossed to wild-type mice to produce Zan+/− and Zan−/− males and females (Fig. 1). Loss of expression from the targeted allele was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 2A) to detect zonadhesin mRNA in testes and by Western blotting (Fig. 2B) and indirect immunofluorescence to detect zonadhesin protein in spermatozoa. On permeabilized spermatozoa from Zan+/+ and Zan+/− males, affinity-purified antibodies specific for the zonadhesin von Willebrand D3 and D3p18 domains detected zonadhesin in 100% of cells by immunofluorescence, but no zonadhesin immunoreactivity was detected in spermatozoa from Zan−/− males (more than 20 individuals tested; not shown). Both antibodies also recognized an Mr 340,000 zonadhesin polypeptide (p340) in extracts of cauda epididymal spermatozoa from Zan+/+ and Zan+/− males (Fig. 2B), but not in sperm proteins from Zan−/− males (more than 100 individuals tested), thereby confirming that the targeting strategy produced a null allele and that zonadhesin was absent from spermatozoa of null males. To test fertility of null mice on a relatively uniform genetic background related to the 129S1/Sv ES cells used for Zan targeting, we initially bred founders to 129S2/SvPasCrl. In brother-sister intercrosses on the 129S2/SvPasCrl background, null males from the two independent ES cell lines were equally fertile (B9 line: mean = 7.4 pups/litter, S.D. ±1.2, n = 8; E5 line: mean = 6.0 pups/litter, S.D. ±2.5, n = 13; p = 0.16). Overall, fertility of Zan−/− males from the two lines on the 129S2/SvPasCrl background (mean = 6.5 pups/litter, S.D. ±2.2, n = 21) did not differ (p = 0.17) from that of wild-type males (mean = 5.5 pups/litter, S.D. ±2.8, n = 23). To examine fertility in a more fecund strain and generate animals for in vitro studies, we bred 129S2/SvPasCrl mice from both ES cell lines to C57/BL6Crl. In brother-sister intercrosses on the C57BL/6Crl background, null males from the two lines were equally fertile (B9: mean = 9.6 pups/litter, S.D. ±2.0, n = 19; E5: mean = 8.6 pups/litter, S.D. ±2.3, n = 5; p = 0.6), and litter sizes produced by Zan−/− males were the same as those of heterozygous null and wild-type males in this more fecund mouse strain (Fig. 2C). The Zan genotype of females did not affect fertility on either genetic background. In vitro, spermatozoa from Zan+/+ and Zan−/− males possessed identical ability to fertilize mouse oocytes (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the equivalent fertility of wild-type and zonadhesin-null spermatozoa, Zan genotype did not affect total or progressive motility (supplemental Fig. S2). Progeny from heterozygote crosses showed no deviation (χ2 (2, n = 135) = 4.29, p = 0.25) from the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio. Likewise, male offspring from backcrosses between Zan+/− males and wild-type females (129S2/SvPasCrl and C57BL/6Crl data combined) revealed no deviation from the expected 1:1 heterozygote to wild-type ratio (χ2 (1, n = 59) = 2.05, p = 0.25), indicating that the ability of an individual sperm cell to fertilize the egg was not affected by its Zan allele genotype. This finding could not be attributed to a lack of competition between sperm genotypes because immunofluorescence localization revealed that zonadhesin was present in all spermatozoa from Zan+/− males, although Zan is not transcribed until developing male germ cells become haploid spermatids (8Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bi M. Hickox J.R. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Hardy D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Bi M. Hardy D.M. NagDas S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 1128-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because zonadhesin is an acrosomal protein, we determined whether it is exposed on living, motile cells capable of interacting productively with the ZP. In immunofluorescence, affinity-purified antibodies to the D3p18 or D3 domains of mouse zonadhesin (Fig. 1A) labeled 100% of fixed, permeabilized spermatozoa from wild-type males (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). Neither antibody labeled significant numbers of living, non-capacitated spermatozoa from Zan+/+ males, nor did they label any spermatozoa from Zan−/− males (Fig. 3, B and C). However, after optimal sperm capacitation in vitro (Fig. 3D), anti-D3p18 labeled the apical heads of some but not all wild-type cells (Fig. 3, A and D). Surface exposure of the D3p18 domain closely tracked the kinetics of sperm capacitation (Fig. 3D). In contrast, anti-D3 immunoreactivity did not increase with sperm capacitation (Fig. 3B). Loss of zonadhesin did not affect PH-20/hyaluronidase immunoreactivity (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3), nor did it substantially affect the profiles of other gamete recognition proteins of spermatozoa, including SED-1, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, proacrosin, ZP3R/sp56, ADAM 2, or ADAM 3, or alter the pattern of sperm phospho-proteins or total protein (supplemental Fig. S3), consistent with the fertility of Zan−/− males. Exposure of the D3p18 domain on living, motile spermatozoa was dependent on incubation in capacitating medium (Fig. 3E). No comparable capacitation-dependent increase in surface exposure of the D3 domain occurred (Fig. 3E), suggesting that this zonadhesin domain remains masked, while the D3p18 domain becomes exposed. To examine the gamete adhesion activity of surface-exposed zonadhesin, we tested the effects of the D3 and D3p18 antibodies on fertilization and ZP interaction. The D3p18 antibody partially inhibited fertilization of cumulus intact mouse eggs by wild-type spermatozoa in vitro (Fig. 4A). The partial inhibition was consistent with the surface exposure of zonadhesin on only 25–35% of cells and was significant in comparison with the effect of affinity-purified control antibody to GST (anti-D3p18: 14.3% inhibition; anti-GST: 3.2%; S.E. ±2.8%; p < 0.05). The D3p18 antibody did not inhibit fertilization by spermatozoa from Zan−/− males (1.9% inhibition cf. 2.7% by anti-GST). The anti-D3p18 antibody also inhibited ZP adhesion. Under conditions where no spermatozoa adhere to the ZP of two-cell embryos (Fig. 4B), adhesion of wild-type spermatozoa to the ZP of cumulus-free mouse eggs averaged 15–16 spermatozoa/oocyte either in the absence of added antibody or in the presence of anti-GST or anti-D3 (Fig. 4C) but was inhibited by 50% to 7.5 spermatozoa/oocyte by anti-D3p18 (S.E. ±2.30 spermatozoa/oocyte; p < 0.05). The D3p18 antibody did not inhibit ZP adhesion by spermatozoa from Zan−/− males (20 spermatozoa/oocyte; Fig. 4C). None of the antibodies affected sperm motility (supplemental Fig. S4). To determine whether zonadhesin contributes to species specificity of ZP adhesion, we compared the ability of spermatozoa from wild-type or Zan-null males to recognize heterologous ZP. Zan genotype did not affect the relatively low adhesion (4–6 cells/ZP) of non-capacitated spermatozoa to pig or rabbit ZP (Fig. 5, A and B). With capacitation, adhesion of wild-type spermatozoa to the pig ZP did not increase, but adhesion of Zan-null spermatozoa increased 3-fold, to more than 15 cells/ZP (Fig. 5A). This capacitation-dependent adhesion of Zan-null mouse spermatozoa to pig ZP was comparable to the adhesion of homologous, capacitated pig spermatozoa (Fig. 5A). Loss of zonadhesin also increased sperm adhesion to rabbit ZP (Fig. 5B); with sperm capacitation, adhesion of Zan-null spermatozoa increased by more than 4-fold, to nearly 25 per rabbit ZP, but adhesion of wild-type spermatozoa did not increase significantly (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, when defined mixtures of sperm cells ranging from 100% wild-type to 100% Zan-null cells were incubated with pig or rabbit oocytes, ZP adhesion progressively increased with increasing proportion of Zan-null spermatozoa in the mixture (not shown). We also directly compared adhesion of wild-type and Zan-null spermatozoa to ZP by co-inseminating oocytes with sperm cells from the two genotypes. Capacitated spermatozoa from Zan−/− and Zan+/+ males were alternately labeled with different dyes (MitoTracker or Hoechst 33258), mixed in defined ratios, and then incubated with cumulus-free oocytes. When mouse oocytes were co-inseminated with equal numbers of mouse spermatozoa from wild-type and Zan-null males, ZP adhesion by the two cell types was identical (Fig. 5C). In contrast, co-insemination of pig, rabbit, or bovine oocytes resulted in preferential adhesion of Zan-null spermatozoa to the heterologous ZP (Fig. 5C). This loss of species specificity was most dramatic in interactions with pig ZP, where adhesion of spermatozoa lacking zonadhesin was nearly 5-fold higher than adhesion of wild-type spermatozoa on co-insemination with equal numbers of the two cell types. Even when pig oocytes were co-inseminated with three times more wild-type than Zan-null spermatozoa, two-thirds of the ZP-adherent cells were Zan-null (Fig. 5D). At all tested ratios, adhesion of Zan-null spermatozoa to heterologous ZP was disproportionately high in comparison with the fraction of those cells in the insemination mixture (Z-test p < 0.001). The fertility of Zan-null mice is reminiscent of the fully or partially fertile phenotypes observed on ablation of other ZP adhesion molecules (5Baba T. Azuma S. Kashiwabara S. Toyoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31845-31849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lu Q. Shur B.D. Development. 1997; 124: 4121-4131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Baba D. Kashiwabara S. Honda A. Yamagata K. Wu Q. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30310-30314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, null alleles of other sperm proteins do not appear to result in decreased species specificity of sperm-ZP recognition. Our loss-of-specificity phenotype was not a consequence of generally increased adhesiveness of Zan-null spermatozoa because adhesion to mouse ZP did not increase. The detection of zonadhesin protein on the surface of some but not all live, capacitated spermatozoa and commensurate inhibition of ZP adhesion by zonadhesin antibodies support prior results implicating zonadhesin as a ZP adhesion molecule that functions during the initial stages of acrosomal exocytosis (12Bi M. Hickox J.R. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Hardy D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). From these findings, we conclude that zonadhesin in the acrosome becomes exposed on the apical head of spermatozoa, probably coincident with membrane fusion at the onset of acrosomal exocytosis, whereupon it mediates species-specific adhesion of mouse spermatozoa to the mouse ZP. We further conclude that loss of zonadhesin does not result in sterility because null spermatozoa retain capacity for ZP adhesion that is not species-specific. Mammalian fertilization is not strictly species-specific, as shown vividly by the existence of natural (27Hailer F. Leonard J.A. PloS One. 2008; 3: e3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and anthropogenic (19Tardif S. Brady H.A. Breazeale K.R. Bi M. Thompson L.D. Bruemmer J.E. Bailey L.B. Hardy D.M. Biol. Reprod. 2010; 82: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) hybrids between closely related species. Some studies have raised questions about the extent and significance of species specificity in sperm-ZP adhesion (28O'Rand M.G. Gamete Res. 1988; 19: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Dean J. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and discrepancies in existing evidence cannot be resolved easily because of species differences in conditions for optimal capacitation and fertilization in vitro (23Tardif S. Sirard M.A. Sullivan R. Bailey J.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 54: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Jaiswal B.S. Eisenbach M. Hardy D.M. Fertilization. Academic Press, San Diego2002: 57-117Google Scholar). Nevertheless, here we overcame the inherent difficulties of such studies by directly comparing adhesion of Zan-null and wild-type mouse spermatozoa simultaneously on the same oocytes. Species specificity of ZP adhesion was readily observed when oocytes were co-inseminated with relatively low numbers of optimally capacitated spermatozoa that included cells with surface-exposed zonadhesin. The loss of ZP adhesion specificity in Zan-null mouse spermatozoa not only shows unequivocally that mammalian gamete interactions occur with some degree of species specificity, but together with results on species variation of zonadhesin (15Gasper J. Swanson W.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 79: 820-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Herlyn H. Zischler H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2008; 52: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 19Tardif S. Brady H.A. Breazeale K.R. Bi M. Thompson L.D. Bruemmer J.E. Bailey L.B. Hardy D.M. Biol. Reprod. 2010; 82: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), also suggests that variation in zonadhesin is a primary determinant of species specificity during egg recognition. The robustness that multiple adhesion molecules confers to sperm-ZP recognition (31Shur B.D. Rodeheffer C. Ensslin M.A. Lyng R. Raymond A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 250: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) should perhaps be expected in a process such as fertilization that is vital to species survival. Furthermore, transient, sequential binding of multiple adhesion molecules during ZP interactions might also be expected because spermatozoa must sustain adhesion as they shed membranes and acrosomal contents during acrosomal exocytosis and then penetrate through the ZP (10Bi M. Wassler M.J. Hardy D.M. Hardy D.M. Fertilization. Academic Press, San Diego2002: 153-180Google Scholar). Our results support a model of sperm-ZP interactions (Fig. 6) that includes degenerate/overlapping activities of multiple ZP adhesion molecules, including β-1,4-galactosyltransferase and SED-1 on the sperm cell surface and zonadhesin, proacrosin, and ZP3R/sp56 in the acrosome. In Zan-null cells, the two likely acrosomal mediators of ZP adhesion are proacrosin and ZP3R/sp56. Both of these proteins are prominent components of the sperm acrosomal matrix (32Gerton G.L. Hardy D.M. Fertilization. Academic Press, San Diego2002: 265-302Google Scholar). Proacrosin ZP binding activity is well documented (33Honda A. Siruntawineti J. Baba T. Hum. Reprod. Update. 2002; 8: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and promiscuous (8Hardy D.M. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19000-19004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ZP3R/sp56 possesses ZP3 binding activity (6Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5563-5567Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and can mediate ZP adhesion (7Buffone M.G. Zhuang T. Ord T.S. Hui L. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12438-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although the species specificity of its binding activity has not been reported. Because zonadhesin-null males are fertile, it should be feasible to breed animals with multiple null alleles and thereby identify the other proteins that individually or collectively compensate for its loss. Reproductive processes are extraordinarily diverse among animal species. Although exocytosis of the acrosome must occur before a sperm cell can penetrate the egg (1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar), the content of the acrosome varies dramatically between marine invertebrates and mammals. The egg recognition molecules bindin and lysin are predominant components of the sea urchin (34Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 2456-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and abalone (35Vacquier V.D. Carner K.R. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5792-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) acrosome, respectively. In these organisms, the primary function of the acrosome is to mediate species-specific gamete recognition when exocytosis is induced by female-derived factors surrounding the egg, and thereby prevent formation of sterile hybrids during external fertilization (2Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Mammalian sperm cells also release and expose acrosomal components in response to egg factors (1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar), but the mammalian acrosome contains hundreds of proteins, including hydrolases (36Kim E. Yamashita M. Kimura M. Honda A. Kashiwabara S. Baba T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2008; 52: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and relatively abundant matrix components (32Gerton G.L. Hardy D.M. Fertilization. Academic Press, San Diego2002: 265-302Google Scholar, 37Hardy D.M. Oda M.N. Friend D.S. Huang Jr., T.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that presumably support a more complex function of the acrosome during internal fertilization in mammals. Our finding that zonadhesin mediates species-specific ZP recognition shows that at least one function of the acrosome in fertilization is conserved between mammals and marine invertebrates. This conservation of acrosome function seems remarkable considering that the egg recognition proteins (lysin, bindin, and zonadhesin) are evolutionarily unrelated in these diverse species. Because mating barriers limit cross-species fertilization in animals that fertilize internally, potentially relieving the need for species-specific gamete recognition to prevent formation of sterile hybrids (28O'Rand M.G. Gamete Res. 1988; 19: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the function of zonadhesin in species-specific ZP adhesion may reflect a contribution in ancestral mammals to the speciation process itself (2Swanson W.J.

https://openalex.org/W2005596569,"Background Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease, predominantly affects women of childbearing age. Moreover, increased serum levels of interferon-α (IFN-α) are associated with the disease. Although, the female sex hormone estrogen (E2) is implicated in sex bias in SLE through up-regulation of IFN-γ expression, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report that activation of IFN (α or γ)-signaling in immune cells up-regulates expression of estrogen receptor-α (ERα; encoded by the Esr1 gene) and stimulates expression of target genes. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that treatment of mouse splenic cells and mouse cell lines with IFN (α or γ) increased steady-state levels of ERα mRNA and protein. The increase in the ERα mRNA levels was primarily due to the transcriptional mechanisms and it was dependent upon the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) factor by IFN. Moreover, the IFN-treatment of cells also stimulated transcription of a reporter gene, expression of which was driven by the promoter region of the murine Esr1 gene. Notably, splenic cells from pre-autoimmune lupus-prone (NZB × NZW)F1 female mice had relatively higher steady-state levels of mRNAs encoded by the IFN and ERα-responsive genes as compared to the age-matched males. Conclusions/Significance Our observations identify a novel mutually positive regulatory feedback loop between IFNs and ERα in immune cells in mice and support the idea that activation of this regulatory loop contributes to sex bias in SLE."

IntroductionPseudomonas putida is a ubiquitous soil bacterium that shows great metabolic versatility and the ability to live under a wide range of environmental conditions (1Dos Santos V.A. Heim S. Moore E.R. Strätz M. Timmis K.N. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 1264-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Its biotechnological potential and its ability to degrade many aromatic compounds that generate pollution problems have led to the detailed study of its metabolism. A number of global regulation networks carefully control the numerous catabolic pathways of P. putida. Some of these regulatory systems orchestrate a carbon catabolite repression (CCR) 3The abbreviations used are: CCRcarbon catabolite repression3MBA3-methylbenzyl alcoholBADHbenzyl alcohol dehydrogenaseBZDHbenzaldehyde dehydrogenaseC23Ocatechol-2,3-dioxygenaseTOL pathwaytoluene/xylene assimilation pathwayntnucleotide(s)PTSNtrnitrogen phosphotransferase system. process, which allows the sequential and hierarchical assimilation of different carbon sources when several are available at non-growth-limiting concentrations (for reviews, see Refs. 2Görke B. Stülke J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 3Deutscher J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 4Rojo F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2010; (DOI: 10.1111/j.1574–6976.2010.00218.x March 10)PubMed Google Scholar). In Pseudomonas, catabolite repression is not well understood. Available evidence shows that in this bacterial group, certain organic acids and amino acids are the most strongly preferred compounds, whereas hydrocarbons are less preferred; the preference for glucose lies somewhere in between (5Hester K.L. Madhusudhan K.T. Sokatch J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1150-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Morales G. Linares J.F. Beloso A. Albar J.P. Martínez J.L. Rojo F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Moreno R. Martínez-Gomariz M. Yuste L. Gil C. Rojo F. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 2910-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For this reason, the potential of P. putida to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons is frequently compromised by CCR when in addition to the aromatic substrates, other more readily degradable compounds are present. Understanding CCR in P. putida may help to improve biodegradation rates and the usefulness of this bacterium in biotechnology and in bioremediation.The CCR imposed on the assimilation of hydrocarbons has been studied with particular emphasis on the pathway for toluene and xylene assimilation specified by the genes carried by the P. putida pWW0 plasmid (8Williams P.A. Murray K. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 416-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Greated A. Lambertsen L. Williams P.A. Thomas C.M. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 856-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This pathway has become a model system to understand how recalcitrant aromatic compounds are biodegraded in nature. The genes coding for the enzymes that transform toluene into benzoate and xylenes into methylbenzoates are clustered in the “upper operon,” whereas those that convert benzoate or methylbenzoates into Krebs cycle intermediates are grouped in the “meta operon” (Fig. 1) (reviewed in Refs. 9Greated A. Lambertsen L. Williams P.A. Thomas C.M. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 856-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar and 10Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The xylR and xylS genes, located downstream of the meta operon, encode the specific transcriptional regulators that activate expression of the pathway genes. Benzoate or methylbenzoates, the substrates of the meta pathway enzymes, induce transcription of the meta operon from promoter Pm by acting as effectors of the XylS transcriptional activator. Toluene and xylenes induce transcription of the upper operon from promoter Pu by interacting with the XylR transcriptional activator. Toluene and xylenes also induce expression of the meta operon without the need of their conversion into benzoate or methylbenzoates (11Inouye S. Nakazawa A. Nakazawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 5182-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Ramos J.L. Mermod N. Timmis K.N. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This occurs because xylS can be transcribed from two promoters. Promoter PS2 provides for low level constitutive expression, allowing for XylS levels that can activate Pm only in the presence of effectors. However, in the presence of toluene or xylene, XylR activates the expression of xylS from another promoter, PS1, which considerably increases xylS transcription and generates an mRNA translated 10 times more efficiently than that originating at PS2. XylS is then synthesized at levels high enough to activate Pm even in the absence of effectors (13Gallegos M.T. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14González-Pérez M.M. Ramos J.L. Marqués S. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1898-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Domínguez-Cuevas P. González-Pastor J.E. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11981-11991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The xylR gene, in turn, is expressed from two contiguous promoters, PR1 and PR2. The XylR protein negatively controls these promoters (16Inouye S. Nakazawa A. Nakazawa T. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).When in addition to the pathway substrates, the growth medium contains preferred compounds such as succinate or glucose or when a complete medium is used, the induction of the toluene/xylene assimilation (TOL) pathway is inhibited by a CCR phenomenon. Repression is primarily directed to reduce XylR activation of the Pu and PS1 promoters (17Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Köhler T. Rekik M. Harayama S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6651-6660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18de Lorenzo V. Cases I. Herrero M. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6902-6907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Duetz W.A.

Repression of the meta pathway genes also occurs, although this is milder. Two global regulation systems participate in this CCR effect. One involves the PTSNtr proteins, and the other one involves the Crc regulatory protein. The repression exerted on Pu activity by succinate or glucose depends mainly on the PTSNtr system (25Aranda-Olmedo I. Marín P. Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 7418-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The repression induced by the components of a complete medium on the Pu and PS1 promoters depends on both PTSNtr and Crc (26Aranda-Olmedo I. Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The PTSNtr system acts by interfering, directly or indirectly, with the ability of XylR to activate transcription from promoter Pu (26Aranda-Olmedo I. Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how Crc inhibits the induction of the TOL genes. The present work addresses this issue.The Crc protein is a global regulator of carbon metabolism that inhibits the expression of genes involved in the assimilation of certain sugars (27MacGregor C.H. Wolff J.A. Arora S.K. Phibbs Jr., P.V. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7204-7212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), aromatic compounds (6Morales G. Linares J.F. Beloso A. Albar J.P. Martínez J.L. Rojo F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), hydrocarbons (28Yuste L. Rojo F. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6197-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and amino acids (5Hester K.L. Madhusudhan K.T. Sokatch J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1150-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Moreno R. Martínez-Gomariz M. Yuste L. Gil C. Rojo F.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) when preferred substrates are present. The final role of this regulator is to optimize metabolism, improving bacterial fitness (7Moreno R. Martínez-Gomariz M. Yuste L. Gil C. Rojo F. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 2910-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Crc is an RNA-binding protein that recognizes specific sites located at the translation initiation regions of target mRNAs, inhibiting translation (30Moreno R. Ruiz-Manzano A. Yuste L. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Moreno R. Rojo F. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Moreno R. Marzi S. Romby P. Rojo F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 7678-7690Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the levels of free Crc in the cell are regulated by a small RNA named CrcZ, which binds to and sequesters Crc (33Sonnleitner E. Abdou L. Haas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21866-21871Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). CrcZ expression in turn varies depending on the medium composition.Footprinting and mutagenesis techniques have shown that Crc specifically recognizes a short unpaired AA(C/U)AA(C/U)AA motif (32Moreno R. Marzi S. Romby P. Rojo F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 7678-7690Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Sonnleitner E. Abdou L. Haas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21866-21871Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Several TOL pathway genes show sequences similar to the Crc motif close to their translation start site. The present work analyzes whether Crc can bind these sequences and examines the effect of this global regulator on the expression of the TOL pathway genes. The results show that Crc modulates the expression of these genes by directly interfering with the translation of the transcriptional regulators of the pathway and with that of some structural genes encoding proteins involved in the uptake and assimilation of aromatic substrates. This is a remarkable example of how the global regulation networks of a host cell can interfere with and control the expression of genes carried by a conjugative plasmid, the final aim being the improvement of the metabolic efficiency and fitness of the bacterium.DISCUSSIONThe present results indicate that Crc regulates the expression of the TOL genes by acting at two different levels. First, it inhibits the expression of the two transcriptional activators of the pathway, which is reflected in a 2–3 times lower level of the upper and meta polycistronic mRNAs. Second, Crc inhibits the translation of some key structural genes of the pathway. Most notably, Crc targets were found not only at the 5′-end of the regulated mRNAs, as observed for other Crc-regulated genes (31Moreno R. Rojo F. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Moreno R. Marzi S. Romby P. Rojo F.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21866-21871Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), but also at internal positions in the upper and meta polycistronic mRNAs. Fig. 7 provides a diagram showing the global effect of Crc on the TOL pathway genes.FIGURE 7Crc-mediated regulation of the TOL pathway genes.A, the structural genes (in gray), the regulatory genes xylS and xylR (in white), and the Pu, Pm, PS1, PS2, PR1, and PR2 promoters of the TOL pathway are shown at the top of the figure.

The Crc binding sites at these mRNAs are indicated by filled arrowheads (strong sites) or open arrowheads (weak sites).

Ramos J.L. Marqués S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The results show that the effect of Crc on the activity of the Pu and PS1 promoters is indirect, the direct target being XylR, which activates transcription from these two promoters. Although Crc had no measurable influence on the levels of xylR mRNA, it bound to a target that overlaps the xylR translation initiation region, leading to a clear reduction in the levels of the XylR protein. The Crc-dependent reduction of XylR levels was paralleled by a 2–3-fold decrease in the levels of the upper and meta pathway mRNAs. This can be explained if it is assumed that Crc reduces XylR levels below those needed for the full induction of the Pu promoter. In addition, transcription of the meta pathway genes depends on the action of the XylS transcriptional activator, which can be expressed from two promoters, PS1 and PS2. In the presence of an upper pathway inducer such as 3MBA, xylS is transcribed mainly from promoter PS1, a XylR-dependent promoter that leads to a transcript translated much more efficiently than that originating at PS2 (14González-Pérez M.M. Ramos J.L. Marqués S. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1898-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The transcript originating at PS1, but not that originating at PS2, contains a target for Crc. The present results indicate that Crc reduces xylS mRNA levels by half, which can be explained if it is assumed that the XylR levels in the presence of Crc are insufficient to attain the full induction of the PS1 promoter. In addition, the binding of Crc to the target present at the xylS mRNA originating at PS1 should reduce the translation of XylS. Therefore, it is here proposed that in the presence of an upper pathway inducer such as 3MBA, the effect of Crc on the mRNA levels of the genes that belong to the meta operon is due to the combined action of Crc on the translation of XylR (which determines xylS mRNA levels and which of the two xylS mRNAs will be more abundant) and on the translation of the xylS mRNA originating at promoter PS1.This work provides evidence showing that the effect of Crc on the expression of the TOL genes is not limited to reducing the levels of the XylR and XylS regulatory proteins. The translation initiation regions of eight structural genes contained sequences similar to the previously characterized Crc targets. The ability of Crc to recognize these sequences was confirmed by band-shift assays with purified protein. Two of these Crc targets were located at the 5′-ends of the upper and meta transcripts, overlapping the translation initiation regions of the xylU and xylX genes, respectively. The other six Crc targets, however, mapped to internal positions within these polycistronic mRNAs, overlapping the translation initiation regions of the xylM, xylA, xylB, xylN, xylL, and xylQ genes. The functionality of these internal sites is supported by the observation that Crc reduced the activity of the BADH enzyme nine times, whereas the effect on the BZDH enzyme was only to reduce its activity by three times. These two enzymes are encoded by xylB and xylC, respectively, two genes located on the same polycistronic mRNA but that differ in that xylB contains a target for Crc, although xylC does not. The reduction of BZDH (xylC) activity can be explained by the Crc-dependent reduction of XylR levels, which in turn reduces Pu activity by 2–3 times. The higher reduction of BADH (xylB) levels probably derives from the additive effect of Crc on the translation of xylR and xylB. Post-transcriptional regulation of BADH has earlier been suggested in cells growing under phosphorous, sulfur, or nitrogen limitation but containing succinate in excess (23Duetz W.A. Marqués S. Wind B. Ramos J.L. van Andel J.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 601-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulator responsible for this control was not identified at the time.The presence of internal sites for Crc at polycistronic mRNAs, reported here for the first time, implies that this translational regulator can differentially modulate the expression of certain genes within polycistronic mRNAs, presumably optimizing the levels of each component of a given catabolic pathway. Some other translational regulators follow a similar strategy, selectively inhibiting the translation of internal genes carried by a polycistronic mRNA. This is the case of some E. coli ribosomal proteins (43Dean D. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Cerretti D.P. Mattheakis L.C. Kearney K.R. Vu L. Nomura M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 309-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and of several small antisense RNAs (45Møller T. Franch T. Udesen C. Gerdes K. Valentin-Hansen P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1696-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 46Urban J.H. Vogel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1018-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).It is worth noting that five of the seven genes of the upper operon contained a strong binding site for Crc, whereas among the 13 meta operon genes, only three contained a target for Crc, two of which were weak. This suggests a tighter regulation of the genes involved in the first steps of the pathway, i.e. those transforming toluene/xylenes into benzoate/methylbenzoates. The benzoate generated from toluene can be degraded through the pWW0-encoded meta pathway genes or through the chromosomally encoded benzoate ortho pathway because this “chromosomal” pathway is also induced in the presence of upper pathway substrates (15Domínguez-Cuevas P. González-Pastor J.E. Marqués S. Ramos J.L. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11981-11991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 47Cowles C.E. Nichols N.N. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6339-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, Crc also exerts a strong repressing effect on expression of the chromosomal ortho pathway for benzoate (6Morales G. Linares J.F. Beloso A. Albar J.P. Martínez J.L. Rojo F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1337-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Moreno R. Rojo F. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).One of the genes that showed a target for Crc was xylN, which encodes an outer membrane protein involved in xylene uptake (48Kasai Y. Inoue J. Harayama S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6662-6666Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although aromatic compounds can diffuse across bacterial membranes, particularly when present in high (millimolar) concentrations, high specificity transport systems increase the efficiency and rate of substrate uptake. These become particularly important when the aromatic compound in question is present in low (micromolar) concentrations, as commonly occurs in natural environments (49Nichols N.N. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5056-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Díaz E. Ferrández A. Prieto M.A. García J.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 523-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Reducing the levels of the XylN porin would therefore diminish the uptake and the internal concentration of the aromatic compounds that act as effectors of the XylR transcriptional regulator, thereby generating a multiplicative effect on the repression of the pathway. The overall effect of Crc reducing the uptake of the pathway substrates, the transcriptional activation of the pathway genes, and the translation of some of the pathway enzymes probably assures a very fast repressive response if cells metabolizing an aromatic substrate suddenly find that a preferred compound has become available. In fact, translational regulation is generally believed to provide a rapid response to changes in environmental or physiological conditions and is therefore an important step in the regulation of gene expression (51Romby P. Springer M. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 155-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The regulatory processes that control the expression of the TOL pathway have been studied in depth. Earlier efforts were directed to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the pathway genes. The results presented in this work show the presence of an additional and complex layer of regulation that occurs at the post-transcriptional level in response to the presence of a preferred carbon source and that depends on the Crc protein. Interestingly, the two layers of regulation are connected because Crc reduces the levels of the XylR and XylS transcriptional regulators and, presumably, the entry of the pathway substrates that act as effectors of these regulators. The final effect is a reduced, but not abolished, expression of the TOL pathway genes when preferred compounds are present. This emphasizes the complexity of the regulation of the TOL pathway and its finely tuned integration into cell physiology.

For this reason, the potential of P. putida to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons is frequently compromised by CCR when in addition to the aromatic substrates, other more readily degradable compounds are present. Understanding CCR in P. putida may help to improve biodegradation rates and the usefulness of this bacterium in biotechnology and in bioremediation.The CCR imposed on the assimilation of hydrocarbons has been studied with particular emphasis on the pathway for toluene and xylene assimilation specified by the genes carried by the P. putida pWW0 plasmid (8Williams P.A.

Lineage tracing studies indicate that replication of existing β-cells is important for β-cell proliferation in adult animals. In rat pancreatic β-cell lines (RIN5F), treatment with 100 nm thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) enhances cell proliferation. This result suggests that T3 is required for β-cell proliferation or replication. To identify the role of thyroid hormone receptor α (TRα) in the processes of β-cell growth and cell cycle regulation, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus vector, AdTRα. Infection with AdTRα to RIN5F cells increased the expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein. Overexpression of the cyclin D1 protein in AdTRα-infected cells led to activation of the cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase/retinoblastoma protein/E2F pathway, along with cell cycle progression and cell proliferation following treatment with 100 nm T3. Conversely, lowering cellular cyclin D1 by small interfering RNA knockdown in AdTRα-infected cells led to down-regulation of the cyclin D1/CDK/Rb/E2F pathway and inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, in immunodeficient mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, intrapancreatic injection of AdTRα led to the restoration of islet function and to an increase in the β-cell mass. These results support the hypothesis that liganded TRα plays a critical role in β-cell replication and in expansion of the β-cell mass during postnatal development.

https://openalex.org/W2031441444,"The process by which the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) conical core dissociates is called uncoating, but not much is known about this process. Here, we show that the uncoating process requires the interaction of the capsid (CA) protein with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated serine/threonine residue followed by proline. We found that the HIV-1 core is composed of some isoforms of the CA protein with different isoelectric points, and one isoform is preferentially phosphorylated in the Ser(16)-Pro(17) motif. The mutant virus S16A/P17A shows a severely attenuated HIV-1 replication and an impaired reverse transcription. The S16A/P17A change increased the amount of particulate CA cores in the cytosol of target cells and correlated with the restriction of HIV-1 infection. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays demonstrated a direct interaction between Pin1 and the HIV-1 core via the Ser(16)-Pro(17) motif. Suppression of Pin1 expression by RNA interference in a target cell results in an attenuated HIV-1 replication and increases the amount of particulate CA cores in the cytosol of target cells. Furthermore, heat-inactivated, inhibitor-treated, or W34A/K63A Pin1 causes an attenuated in vitro uncoating of the HIV-1 core. The Pin1-dependent uncoating is inhibited by antisera raised against a CA peptide phosphorylated at Ser(16) or treatment of the HIV-1 core with alkaline phosphatase. These findings provide insights into this obscure uncoating process in the HIV-1 life cycle and a new cellular target for HIV-1 drug development."

IntroductionMost environmental sulfur exists in the oxidized form, primarily SO42−, which is reduced and assimilated by plants. Assimilation of exogenous SO42− by plants involves its transport into cells through a H+/SO42− symporter, reduction of internalized SO42− to sulfide (S2−), and then the covalent bonding of S2− to O-acetylserine (OAS) 2The abbreviations used are: OASO-acetylserineOASTLO-acetylserine (thiol)lyaseMBPmaltose-binding proteinNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidBiFCbimolecular fluorescence complementationLlinking regionSATserine acetyltransferaseMOPSO2-hydroxy-3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid. to form cysteine. Because SO42− uptake consumes energy and the cells have a limited ability to store sulfur-containing compounds, the uptake and assimilation of SO42− must be coordinated with cell growth and metabolic activities and would likely be responsive to rapid changes in environmental conditions. However, regulatory mechanisms that modulate the activity of SO42− uptake over short time scales are not known. Over longer periods of time, specific regulatory mechanisms control the transcription of SO42− transporter genes (1Rouached H. Wirtz M. Alary R. Hell R. Arpat A.B. Davidian J.C. Fourcroy P.

Arabidopsis thaliana has two high affinity, root-localized SO42− transporters, SULTR1;1 and SULTR1;2, that take up SO42− from the rhizosphere. SULTR1;2 transcript levels are high in sulfur-rich conditions and increase slightly upon sulfur deprivation, whereas the SULTR1;1 transcript levels increase by >100-fold during sulfur deprivation (1Rouached H.

The SO42− transporters (SLC26A family) are structurally conserved with a large N-terminal catalytic domain, an ∼30 amino acid linking region (L), and a C-terminal, cytosolic STAS domain (7Aravind L. Mazumder R. Vasudevan S. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The SULTR1;2 STAS domain is essential for proper transporter localization and influences its stability and catalytic characteristics (8Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22964-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This domain, present on SLC26A family transporters in plants and animals, likely interacts with other proteins as it has significant similarity to the Bacillus subtilis anti-σ-factor antagonist SpoIIAA, which binds SpoIIAB to regulate σ-factor activity (10Ho M.S. Carniol K. Losick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20898-20905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In fact, the STAS domain of SLC26A3, a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger, interacts with the regulatory domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to control bicarbonate secretion by epithelial cells (11Ko S.B. Zeng W. Dorwart M.R. Luo X. Kim K.H. Millen L. Goto H. Naruse S. Soyombo A. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar).Based on the findings discussed above, we hypothesized that SULTR1;2 activity may be modulated by interactions of its STAS domain with other proteins. To identify potential SULTR1;2 partner proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of an A. thaliana cDNA library using the SULTR1;2 LSTAS domain as bait. A cDNA identified in the screen encodes an isoform of cysteine synthase (O-acetylserine (thiol)lyase or OASTL) that is expressed in the cytosol of root cortex cells (12Gotor C. Cejudo F.J. Barroso C. Vega J.M. Plant J. 1997; 11: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); like this OASTL isoform, SULTR1;2 is also expressed in root cortex cells where SO42− is taken up from the soil solution (6Shibagaki N. Rose A. McDermott J.P. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Davies J.P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The interaction between SULTR1;2 and OASTL was further demonstrated by various in vivo and in vitro assays and was shown to affect the activities of both partner proteins. Our results are discussed in the context of interactions among component proteins involved in SO42− acquisition and assimilation, and we introduce a model that suggests a potential role of this interaction in controlling the sulfur homeostasis in roots.DISCUSSIONThe levels of many transport proteins are subject to regulation by ubiquitination and complex signals that influence endocytic sorting (27Tanaka N.

Martín Y. Siverio J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13268-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, both the levels and activities of transport proteins may be regulated by protein modifications and interactions, including phosphorylation (31Navarro F.J. Martín Y. Siverio J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31208-31217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Martín Y. Navarro F.J. Siverio J.M. Plant Mol.

Here, we report a novel example in which transporter activity may be regulated by interactions with an enzyme involved in assimilation of the substrate of the transporter. SULTR1;2 transports SO42− into roots of A. thaliana (6Shibagaki N. Rose A. McDermott J.P. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Davies J.P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Both in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrate that this transporter interacts with OASTL, the enzyme involved in bonding S2− to OAS to form cysteine.Interaction through the STAS DomainAs demonstrated by the yeast two-hybrid results, the STAS domain of SULTR1;2 is essential for the interaction between SULTR1;2 and OASTL. Using the BiFC technique in tobacco cells, we demonstrated analogous interactions in planta. The interaction between SULTR1;2 and OASTL based on BiFC analysis was shown to depend on the STAS domain (Fig. 3). A truncated SULTR1;2 polypeptide, deleted for most of the STAS domain, accumulates in cells, as demonstrated by the positive signal from homomeric interaction analysis (interaction between catalytic domains of SULTR1;2, see Fig. 3E), but shows no interaction with OASTL (Fig. 3D). A more extensive C-terminal truncation of SULTR1;2 was previously shown to destabilize the transporter protein (8Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Region in OASTL Involved in the InteractionThe loop located between β8 and β9 appears to be the site on OASTL that interacts with the STAS domain (Fig. 1B). This loop is also essential for SAT-OASTL interaction. Although an H221A substitution in this loop disrupted SAT-OASTL interaction (19Bonner E.R. Cahoon R.E. Knapke S.M. Jez J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38803-38813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), it did not appear to alter the interaction between the STAS domain and OASTL (supplemental Fig. 2). Furthermore, it did not eliminate suppression of transport activity elicited by SULTR1;2-OASTL interaction (Fig. 4B). These results raise the possibility that the STAS domain competes for SAT binding to OASTL at the loop between β8 and β9 but that this binding does not require His-221.Interaction Is Enhanced by OASThe in vitro binding of the STAS domain to OASTL was significantly promoted when OAS was added to the reaction, although the interaction was observed even without OAS (Fig. 2A). The concentration of OAS needed to generate the most pronounced interaction is ∼2 mm, which is high considering that the OAS concentration in root cells of sulfur-starved plants is reported to be 60 nmol/g fresh weight for A. thaliana (34Hirai M.Y. Fujiwara T. Awazuhara M. Kimura T. Noji M. Saito K. Plant J. 2003; 33: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and 200 nmol/g fresh weight for potato (35Hopkins L. Parmar S. Błaszczyk A. Hesse H. Hoefgen R. Hawkesford M.J. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reason that OAS may need to be added to the assay at a relatively high concentration to observe an effect may reflect a number of factors. The OAS concentrations that have been reported are from bulk measurements in disrupted tissue; local concentrations may be much higher, especially in the proximity of the enzyme SAT, which synthesizes OAS. Furthermore, OAS is not stable and is rapidly converted to N-acetylserine in vitro (36Flavin M. Slaughter C. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the amount of OAS in the reaction mixture may decline significantly over the course of the assay.Functional Relevance of the InteractionThere are only a few other instances that have been reported in which a soluble protein in plants interacts with an integral membrane protein transporter. The SOS1 protein, a plasma membrane-localized Na+/H+ antiporter, prevents Na+ toxicity by facilitating its extrusion from cells, and under oxidative stress conditions, the C terminus of the transporter interacts with the soluble RCD1 protein, a regulator of oxidative stress responses (37Katiyar-Agarwal S. Zhu J. Kim K. Agarwal M. Fu X. Huang A. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18816-18821Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the precise functional and regulatory consequences of this interaction are not known.SULTR1;2 Activity and InteractionWe demonstrated that co-expression of OASTL with SULTR1;2 in yeast cells decreased SO42− transport activity of SULTR1;2 (Fig. 4). There are a number of ways in which the transport of SO42− into cells may be regulated. These ways would include modulation of the rate of substrate translocation or alteration in the number of transporter molecules that are present at their site of function. The total accumulation of SULTR1;2 in yeast cells expressing OASTL, based on immunological analyses, does not appear to be different in the presence or absence of OASTL. These results suggest that the stability and biogenesis of SULTR1;2 is similar in transformants expressing only SULTR1;2 and those expressing both OASTL and SULTR1;2, although we do not know if the level of the transporter at the site of function on the plasma membrane is the same in the two transformants. SULTR1;2 may also interact with cysteine, and elevated intracellular cysteine levels may retard transport. Because a high cellular cysteine concentration can be toxic to cells (38Sørensen M.A. Pedersen S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5244-5246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this type of regulation would likely require the generation of a cysteine-rich microenvironment in the neighborhood of the SO42− transporters. Such a situation could occur as a consequence of interaction of OASTL with SULTR1;2; cysteine would be synthesized at the site of SO42− transport. However, based on our results, there appears to be a direct effect of OASTL-SULTR1;2 interaction on SO42− transport activity rather than an effect of the cysteine synthesized by OASTL. This conclusion is based on the finding that OASTL with a K46A mutation, which was previously shown to be catalytically inactive (19Bonner E.R. Cahoon R.E. Knapke S.M. Jez J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38803-38813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), can still bind SULTR1;2 and negatively impact SO42− transport activity in yeast cells. However, even the wild-type enzyme may not have high activity in yeast as yeast does not synthesize high levels of OAS (39Mulet J.M. Alemany B. Ros R. Calvete J.J. Serrano R. Yeast. 2004; 21: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the addition of external OAS prior to the in vivo assay does not modify uptake activity, possibly because supplemental OAS is rapidly metabolized by the cells or because endogenous levels of OAS or O-acetylhomoserine are already sufficient to saturate the repressive interaction.The mode by which the OASTL-SULTR1;2 interaction alters SO42− transport activity is not known, but it is possible that direct contact between the proteins causes a change in the SULTR1;2 conformation that results in decreased transport rates. It is also possible that the altered activity is an indirect consequence of the interaction. For example, OASTL-SULTR1;2 interaction might influence the binding of other proteins that catalyze post-translational modifications.OASTL ActivityThe interaction between OASTL and SULTR1;2 appeared to cause increased OASTL activity, an effect specific for the SULTR1;2 STAS domain; no change in activity was observed when the SULTR1;1 STAS domain was used in the assay (Fig. 5). Because the efficiency of in vitro binding is generally not high (Fig. 2), and the interaction between the proteins is probably only transient, an equimolar addition of the SULTR1;2 STAS domain and OASTL is not sufficient for activating OASTL. However, an ∼2-fold activation was evident when the STAS domain was added to the assay at a 12-fold molar excess relative to OASTL. Interestingly, when the L region was maintained at the N terminus of the STAS domain, the OASTL activity enhancing effect of the STAS domain was diminished. When the L region is present on the LSTAS polypeptide but not connected to the catalytic domain of the transporter, it may be highly mobile; attachment to the catalytic domain would likely restrict LSTAS domain mobility, which could strongly affect its interactions with partner proteins.ModelVascular plants have a number of OASTL and SAT proteins that differentially localize to plastids, mitochondria, and the cytosol. Although the mitochondrial OASTL/SAT was shown to be most important for cysteine synthesis (40Heeg C. Kruse C. Jost R. Gutensohn M. Ruppert T. Wirtz M. Hell R. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 168-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 41Watanabe M. Kusano M. Oikawa A. Fukushima A. Noji M. Saito K. Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 42Watanabe M. Mochida K. Kato T. Tabata S. Yoshimoto N. Noji M. Saito K. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 2484-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the cytosolic isoforms may be regulatory. Based on the results reported here, we propose a model for the regulation of SO42− assimilation by roots that incorporates the consequences of the interaction between SULTR1;2 and the root cytosolic OASTL (Fig. 6). At high SO42− concentrations, when SULTR1;2 is the dominant transporter responsible for SO42− uptake from the soil, direct interaction of SULTR1;2 and OASTL helps coordinate SO42− transport with S2− production and cysteine synthesis. Availability of S2− in the cytoplasm of the root cells would be a major control feature of this model.OASTL would associate with the STAS domain of SULTR1;2 when OAS rises, and this interaction inhibits transporter activity (Fig. 6A). This relationship may seem counter-intuitive as OAS has been suggested to be a positive regulator of SO42− assimilation, at least at the transcriptional level, because OAS accumulation is indicative of diminished sulfur levels (34Hirai M.Y. Fujiwara T. Awazuhara M. Kimura T. Noji M. Saito K. Plant J. 2003; 33: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, OAS can also be temporarily and locally in excess when the supply of S2−, and not the supply of SO42−, is limited, which may be a relatively common situation in the environment. Most S2− is derived from SO42− reduction in root plastids and catabolism of organic sulfur-containing compounds. SO42− reduction requires ATP and reducing equivalents that are generated by photosynthetic electron transport and respiration; thus, the reduction of SO42− in the root would depend on the level of carbon fixation in leaves and the transport of fixed carbon to roots, where it can be used for reductive assimilation of SO42−. Therefore, even when SO42− is abundant in the environment, if metabolic activity and the generation of reducing power are low, which might occur under conditions where photosynthetic activity slows or stops, the cytosolic S2− concentration would decline leading to accumulation of OAS. Under such circumstances, it would be advantageous to repress transporter-dependent SO42− uptake activity as it is an energy-consuming process, and even if the anion were taken into the cell, reductive assimilation would be limited. An elevated level of OAS combined with reduced S2− availability would favor sustained binding of OAS to OASTL, which in turn would promote the interaction of “OAS-loaded” OASTL with SULTR1;2. This interaction would limit SULTR1;2 activity, despite high environmental SO42− levels. As OAS is consumed in the synthesis of cysteine, under conditions where S2− production begins to keep pace with OAS generation, OASTL would dissociate from SULTR1;2 releasing the transporter from inhibition (Fig. 6B). Repeated cycles of binding and release may help maintain a level of SO42− transport that is coordinated with the capabilities of the plant to generate S2− and cysteine, as governed by intracellular reductant and energy levels.The model presented above would also integrate with our understanding of the control of the cysteine synthase complex, which is composed of SAT and OASTL. Various transgenic experiments have shown that SAT, and not OASTL, catalyzes the limiting reaction in the synthesis of cysteine (35Hopkins L. Parmar S. Błaszczyk A. Hesse H. Hoefgen R.

Amino Acids. 2003; 24: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The level of OAS appears to modulate cysteine synthase complex activity and the generation of OAS; high OAS levels cause dissociation of the complex, and the free SAT tends to aggregate and exhibit a lower affinity for its substrates. In contrast, the dissociated OASTL has elevated activity because its affinity for OAS and S2− increases (47Kredich N.M. Becker M.A. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2428-2439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Droux M. Ruffet M.L. Douce R. Job D. Eur. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 30629-30634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Also, SAT activity and OAS levels may be modulated by l-cysteine feedback inhibition (50Noji M. Saito K. Amino Acids. 2002; 22: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the model that we propose, as the OAS levels rise locally in the cells, the cysteine synthase complex would dissociate and SAT activity would decline as OASTL activity increases. Indeed, the activity of OASTL may be further stimulated because it would bind OAS and interact with SULTR1;2, an interaction that also inhibits the transport of SO42− into the root cells. However, because the cellular level of OASTL is high (51Hell R. Jost R. Berkowitz O. Wirtz M. Amino Acids. 2002; 22: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the regulatory function of the SULTR1;2-OASTL interaction is likely to have a greater impact on SULTR1;2-dependent SO42− transport than on overall OASTL activity and cysteine biosynthesis.The impact of the regulatory mechanism proposed above during sulfur deprivation (Fig. 6C), when the organism would require efficient acquisition and utilization of both external and internal sulfur resources, would not be severe for two reasons as follows: (i) inhibition of SULTR1;2 activity as a consequence of OASTL binding is less under sulfur-depleted than under sulfur-replete conditions (Fig. 4B) as suggested from the SO42− transport activity assay in yeast cells, and (ii) there is a second transporter that is synthesized in A. thaliana roots in response to sulfur deprivation, SULTR1;1, that becomes the major SO42− transporter in root cells of sulfur-deprived plants, and this transporter protein does not appear to interact with OASTL nearly as strongly as SULTR1;2 (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2B). Although other cytosolic OASTL isoforms are present in A. thaliana (40Heeg C. Kruse C. Jost R. Gutensohn M. Ruppert T. Wirtz M. Hell R. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 168-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the potential for these isoforms to interact with sulfate transporters and modulate their activities remains to be explored.In sum, we describe a potential novel regulatory mechanism controlling SO42− transport into root cells that involves OAS/S2−-modulated interaction of OASTL with SULTR1;2. Similar regulatory mechanisms may exist for other nutrient transporters, and the proposed model may be one example of a more general mode by which cells coordinate activities of metabolic pathways with physically distinct transport processes. IntroductionMost environmental sulfur exists in the oxidized form, primarily SO42−, which is reduced and assimilated by plants. Assimilation of exogenous SO42− by plants involves its transport into cells through a H+/SO42− symporter, reduction of internalized SO42− to sulfide (S2−), and then the covalent bonding of S2− to O-acetylserine (OAS) 2The abbreviations used are: OASO-acetylserineOASTLO-acetylserine (thiol)lyaseMBPmaltose-binding proteinNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidBiFCbimolecular fluorescence complementationLlinking regionSATserine acetyltransferaseMOPSO2-hydroxy-3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid. to form cysteine. Because SO42− uptake consumes energy and the cells have a limited ability to store sulfur-containing compounds, the uptake and assimilation of SO42− must be coordinated with cell growth and metabolic activities and would likely be responsive to rapid changes in environmental conditions. However, regulatory mechanisms that modulate the activity of SO42− uptake over short time scales are not known. Over longer periods of time, specific regulatory mechanisms control the transcription of SO42− transporter genes (1Rouached H. Wirtz M. Alary R. Hell R. Arpat A.B. Davidian J.C. Fourcroy P.

Takahashi H. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis thaliana has two high affinity, root-localized SO42− transporters, SULTR1;1 and SULTR1;2, that take up SO42− from the rhizosphere. SULTR1;2 transcript levels are high in sulfur-rich conditions and increase slightly upon sulfur deprivation, whereas the SULTR1;1 transcript levels increase by >100-fold during sulfur deprivation (1Rouached H. Wirtz M. Alary R. Hell R. Arpat A.B. Davidian J.C. Fourcroy P. Berthomieu P. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Yoshimoto N. Takahashi H. Smith F.W.

Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The SO42− transporters (SLC26A family) are structurally conserved with a large N-terminal catalytic domain, an ∼30 amino acid linking region (L), and a C-terminal, cytosolic STAS domain (7Aravind L. Mazumder R. Vasudevan S. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The SULTR1;2 STAS domain is essential for proper transporter localization and influences its stability and catalytic characteristics (8Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30791-30799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Shibagaki N. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22964-22973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This domain, present on SLC26A family transporters in plants and animals, likely interacts with other proteins as it has significant similarity to the Bacillus subtilis anti-σ-factor antagonist SpoIIAA, which binds SpoIIAB to regulate σ-factor activity (10Ho M.S. Carniol K. Losick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20898-20905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In fact, the STAS domain of SLC26A3, a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger, interacts with the regulatory domain of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to control bicarbonate secretion by epithelial cells (11Ko S.B. Zeng W. Dorwart M.R. Luo X. Kim K.H. Millen L. Goto H. Naruse S. Soyombo A. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar).Based on the findings discussed above, we hypothesized that SULTR1;2 activity may be modulated by interactions of its STAS domain with other proteins. To identify potential SULTR1;2 partner proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of an A. thaliana cDNA library using the SULTR1;2 LSTAS domain as bait. A cDNA identified in the screen encodes an isoform of cysteine synthase (O-acetylserine (thiol)lyase or OASTL) that is expressed in the cytosol of root cortex cells (12Gotor C. Cejudo F.J. Barroso C. Vega J.M. Plant J. 1997; 11: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); like this OASTL isoform, SULTR1;2 is also expressed in root cortex cells where SO42− is taken up from the soil solution (6Shibagaki N. Rose A. McDermott J.P. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Yoneyama T. Davies J.P. Plant J. 2002; 29: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The interaction between SULTR1;2 and OASTL was further demonstrated by various in vivo and in vitro assays and was shown to affect the activities of both partner proteins. Our results are discussed in the context of interactions among component proteins involved in SO42− acquisition and assimilation, and we introduce a model that suggests a potential role of this interaction in controlling the sulfur homeostasis in roots."

In this work, we show that mycobacterial MazG from either the virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv (MtMazG) or the fast-growing Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsMazG) is a potent NTP-PPase capable of hydrolyzing all canonical (d)NTPs, as well as the mutagenic dUTP and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-dGTP. However, this hydrolysis activity is diminished by the MtMazG[A219E] mutation. Moreover, deletion of mazG in M. smegmatis rendered the mycobacteria defective in response to oxidative stress. Importantly, expression of the wild-type MtMazG, but not the A219E mutant, restored cell viability under oxidative stress. Intriguingly, under oxidative stress, both the mazG-null and MtMazG[A219E]-expressing M. smegmatis strains failed to elevate relA, while retaining their ability to up-regulate sigE, suggesting a specific role for the MazG NTP-PPase activity in oxidative stress-triggered, transcriptional activation of relA. The MtMazG is a homotetramer with each subunit containing a single MazG core domain flanked by two regions, both of which are essential for NTP-PPase activity.

Our work implicates a role for the MazG activity in the virulence of M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra is an avirulent relative of the typical laboratory strain H37Rv, both of which are derived from the parent strain H37 that was originally isolated from a 19-year-old patient with chronic pulmonary tuberculosis by Edward R. Baldwin in 1905 (1Streeken JR, W. Gardner L.U. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1946; 54: 62-66PubMed Google Scholar). Our systematic comparison of the complete genomic sequences of H37Rv and H37Ra identified multiple H37Ra-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting about 30 genes including the virulence determinants phoP, nrp, and pks12 (2Zheng H. Lu L. Wang B. Pu S. Zhang X. Zhu G. Shi W. Zhang L. Wang H. Wang S. Zhao G. Zhang Y. PLoS One. 2008; 3e2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), consistent with the widely accepted notion (3Brosch R. Philipp W.J. Stavropoulos E. Colston M.J. Cole S.T. Gordon S.V.

Behr M.A. Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that the virulence attenuation of H37Ra is due to multiple mutations. One of these mutations, the A219E substitution located in a highly conserved sequence of H37Ra MazG, prompted the current study aiming to reveal the function of the corresponding prototype enzyme in M. tuberculosis (MtMazG) and compare its role with that of Escherichia coli (EcMazG) in adaptation to stress response (8Gross M. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The MazG protein belongs to the all-α nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (NTP-PPase, 3The abbreviations used are: NTP-PPasenucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolasePPipyrophosphateCDcircular dichroismTAtoxin-antitoxin8-oxo-dGTP8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphateMtM. tuberculosisMsM. smegmatisEcE. coliWTwild type. EC 3.6.1.8) superfamily that hydrolyzes in vitro all canonical nucleoside triphosphates into monophosphate derivatives and pyrophosphate (PPi). The physiological substrates of MazG, however, remain elusive (9Galperin M.Y. Moroz O.V. Wilson K.S. Murzin A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 10Moroz O.V. Murzin A.G. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Wilson K.S. Galperin M.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on the resolved structure of MazG derived from Sulfolobus solfataricus and substrate modeling, it is proposed that the MazG family enzymes might perform house-cleaning function by degrading abnormal (d)NTPs, such as dUTP, 2-hydroxy-dATP, and 8-oxo-dGTP (9Galperin M.Y. Moroz O.V. Wilson K.S. Murzin A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 10Moroz O.V. Murzin A.G. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Wilson K.S. Galperin M.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These modified nucleotides are usually produced under oxidative damage and are mutagenic, i.e. their incorporation into genomic DNA causes mispairing and subsequently leads to increased mutation rates. However, to date, this house-cleaning function of MazG remains to be validated experimentally because of the lack of physiological substrates (9Galperin M.Y. Moroz O.V. Wilson K.S. Murzin A.G. Mol.

Accumulating evidence suggests a role for EcMazG in protecting cells from certain toxins. EcMazG regulated programmed cell death by interfering with the function of the MazEF complex, a well characterized toxin-antitoxin (TA) module (8Gross M. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Lee S. Kim M.H. Kang B.S. Kim J.S. Kim G.H. Kim Y.G. Kim K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15232-15240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MazEF was the first identified chromosomal TA module, characterized by the labile antitoxin, MazE, and its cognate stable toxin, MazF (12Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). MazF is an ACA sequence-specific mRNA endoribonuclease that can selectively degrades mRNA via cleavage between the nucleotide residues A and C, thereby inducing a programmed cell death process under stress conditions (13Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 14Engelberg-Kulka H. Hazan R. Amitai S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4327-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In E. coli, mazG is cotranscribed with mazEF, while the MazEF proteins inhibit the MazG enzymatic activity both in vivo and in vitro (8Gross M. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the EcMazG regulates the MazEF TA module by lowering the cellular (p)ppGpp level, thus protecting the cell from the toxicity of MazF (8Gross M. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 590-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be answered how MazG regulates the cellular (p)ppGpp level and whether such regulation concerns relA, which encodes the (p)ppGpp synthetase. By employing the transposon insertion approaches, previous mouse model studies observed attenuated infection from an H37Rv mazG mutant, thereby implicating a role for MtMazG in virulence (15Sassetti C.M. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12989-12994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Despite such advance, however, little is known concerning the enzymatic and physiological functions of MtMazG. In this work, we show that mycobacterial MazG is a potent NTP-PPase capable of hydrolyzing the mutagenic dUTP and 8-oxo-dGTP and is required to maintain Mycobacterium smegmatis full capacity to respond to oxidative stress, supporting the previously proposed “house cleaning” function of this family protein. However, these functions are diminished in the spontaneous A219E mutant found in H37Ra. Furthermore, mycobacterial mazG is an oxidative stress-inducible gene and its NTP-PPase activity is involved in transcriptional activation of relA in response to oxidative stress. In contrast to EcMazG, mycobacterial MazG is not involved in starvation response. Unlike mycobacterial MazG, the EcMazG cannot complement for M. smegmatis mazG under oxidative stress condition. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that MtMazG is distinct from EcMazG with respect to the properties of enzymes and the possible function in stress response. MtMazG is the first MazG of its kind to be thoroughly characterized, and might be relevant to the virulence of M. tuberculosis. Restriction enzymes and Pfu DNA polymerase were purchased from Fermentas. T4 DNA ligase, calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and nucleoside triphosphates were obtained from New England Biolabs. The 8-oxo-dGTP was purchased from Trilink BioTechnologies, Inc. PiPer pyrophosphate assay kit from Molecular Probes, Inc. was chosen for pyrophosphate detection. Using the genomic DNA as template, the prototype mazG gene from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its mutant type from H37Ra were PCR-amplified with primer TBF22 and TBR22. (All primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1.) The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into the corresponding site of pET22b(+) with a fused hexahistidine tag at the C-terminal end of MazG. The resulting vector pET22b-mazG was used to transform competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking to A600 of 0.7 in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression of MazG was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 12 h at 22 °C. The mazG of E. coli, M. smegmatis, and the truncated variants, including its site mutants introduced by overlapping PCR, were cloned and expressed in the same way. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells from 200 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation (7000 × g, 20 min) and resuspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris and insoluble fraction. The resulting supernatant was applied to a 10-ml column with 1 ml of Ni-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with binding buffer. MazG protein eluted with 100 and 200 mm imidazole was pooled and concentrated by a 30-kDa cutoff ultrafilter (Millipore). The concentrated product was loaded onto Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 perp grade column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and eluted with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The final product was concentrated to 5 mg/ml maintained in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, with 20% glycerol, divided into small aliquots, and stored at −30 °C. The protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (16Walker J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 32: 5-8PubMed Google Scholar). The NTP-PPase activity of MazG was assayed by measuring the hydrolyzed product, PPi, by an enzyme-coupled colorimetric assay (Molecular Probes) with detection limit of 0.2 μm (17Payandeh J. Fujihashi M. Gillon W. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6070-6078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The standard NTP-PPase assay was carried out in 20 μl reaction buffer (50 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm Mg2+) containing 1 μg of MtMazG and appropriate amount of nucleoside triphosphates at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by heating at 70 °C for 10 min, and 5 μl of reaction product was applied for PiPer pyrophosphate assay (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions in the “Assaying for Pyrophosphate” setting. The reaction without MtMazG or substrates was carried out as a background control. Reaction conditions including temperature, pH, Mg2+ concentration, amount of MtMazG and reaction time, were optimized (supplemental Fig. S1). To optimize the pH, both the Tris-HCl buffer for pH 6.8–8.8, and the glycine-NaOH buffer for pH 9.2–11.0 were used. The CD (circular dichroism) spectra were measured on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter in the far-ultraviolet region (260–190 nm) in steps of 1 nm. Records on protein solutions (20 μg/ml in H2O) employing a cell with path length of 1 cm at 18 °C were obtained. The mean residue ellipticity, represented in millidegrees, was calculated using a mean residue molecular mass of 110 Da. To see the CD spectra changes upon addition of Mg2+, MgCl2 solution was added to the protein samples immediately before measurement. Each spectrum reported is an average of five scans. Blank spectra of aqueous buffer were used to correct the observed spectra. The following procedures were carried out to construct the ΔmazG::hyg null mutation in M. smegmatis mc2 155 (18Bardarov S. Bardarov Jr., S. Pavelka Jr., M.S. Sambandamurthy V. Larsen M. Tufariello J. Chan J. Hatfull G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Two homology arms (0.83 kb and 0.99 kb for left and right arm, respectively) overlapping the mazG gene at its 75 and 99 extremities were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA by using primers MKO1/MKO2 and MKO3/MKO4, respectively. The PCR products were digested and cloned into the cosmid vector pYUB854 in their original genome orientation separated by the res-hyg-res cassette. The resulting cosmid was digested by PacI and inserted into the genome of mycobacteriophage phAE87 and was subsequently packaged by the Packagene® Lambda DNA Packaging System (Promega). The recombinant transducing phage was used to construct the mazG-null mutant. The dUTP-biotin labeled probe (Fermentas) was used for Southern blot analysis of the PstI digested chromosomal DNA on the Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (GE Amersham Biosciences), according to the standard method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For complementation of the mazG mutant in M. smegmatis, mazG gene from H37Rv, H37Ra, M. smegmatis and E. coli were PCR-amplified using the primers CTBF/CTBR (for both H37Rv and H37Ra), CMSF/CMSR, and CECF/CECR, respectively. The native promoter region (425 bp region from 5509332 to 5509756 of M. smegmatis genome, see supplemental Fig. S2) of the mazG operon was amplified with the primers ProF/ProR. The PCR products were enzyme digested and subsequently cloned into the integrative plasmid pMV306. The resulting plasmids containing the mazG gene under control of its native promoter were used to complement the M. smegmatis mazG-null mutant. M. smegmatis strains were grown in 7H9 broth supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80 at 37 °C. For determination of survival following hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure, log phase cultures (A600 at 0.4–0.5) were diluted in fresh medium to an A600 of 0.2, and exposed to 5 mm hydrogen peroxide (20Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Voskuil M.I. Liu Y. Mangan J.A. Monahan I.M. Dolganov G. Efron B. Butcher P.D. Nathan C. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated by rolling at 37 °C, and aliquots were removed from each culture for plating at the indicated time points. Colonies were counted after 3 days by plating in triplicate at three dilutions onto 7H11 plates containing appropriate antibiotics. RNA was extracted from H2O2-treated and untreated log phase cultures (A600∼0.5) using the RiboPure-Bacteria kit (Ambion). cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First Strand kit (Invitrogen) with random hexamers primer. Target gene transcript levels in H2O2-treated log phase cultures were measured by quantitative real-time PCR with SYBR Green as label, normalized to sigA transcript levels (21Manganelli R. Dubnau E. Tyagi S. Kramer F.R. Smith I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and expressed as a fold change from untreated cultures. Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 perp grade column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was employed to determine the molecular mass of MazG. The sample was eluted by 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, flow rate was set to 1 ml/min and elution of the protein was monitored at 280 nm. Aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) were taken for calibration. The mazG genes containing the sequence of either the prototype H37Rv (Rv1021) or the mutated H37Ra (MRA_1029) were cloned into plasmid pET22b(+) and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The His-tagged MazG proteins (36.3 kDa) eluted from the nickel-affinity column were subsequently purified by Superdex 200 chromatography to nearly SDS-PAGE homogeneity. The EcMazG and the MsMazG (MSMEG_5422), including the truncated variants of MtMazG (see following), were all similarly expressed and purified (Fig. 1A). The NTP-PPase activity was assayed by measuring the PPi product, which was first converted to Pi by inorganic pyrophosphatase, and the Pi level was subsequently quantified by an enzyme coupled colorimetric method (see “Experimental Procedures”). Like other characterized MazG proteins (10Moroz O.V. Murzin A.G. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Wilson K.S. Galperin M.Y. J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5323-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), MtMazG was found to maintain more than 70% of its NTP-PPase activities between pH 7.8 and 10.5, with the optimum pH at 9.6 (Fig. 1B). Mg2+ acted as an optimal cofactor among the 7 divalent cations tested in our assay (supplemental Fig. S1A). The NTP-PPase activity of MtMazG was the highest at 37 °C and nearly abolished at 70 °C. The effects of pH and temperature on protein stability were also examined. Incubation of the enzyme in pH 9.6 at 37 °C for 10 min did not affect its NTP-PPase activity (supplemental Fig. S1B). The general kinetic parameters of MtMazG were determined using 8 canonical (d)NTPs as the substrates (Table 1). It was found that MtMazG converted all of the tested substrates into their nucleoside monophosphate derivatives and PPi. No detectable Pi formed because the reaction strictly depended on inorganic pyrophosphatase. Of (d)NTPs examined, GTP and dGTP were the most preferred substrates for MtMazG (Fig. 1C), with Km values of 0.4 ± 0.06 mm for either of them, which is 1.5–4 times lower than that of other substrates. On the other hand, the CTP and dCTP hydrolysis activities of MtMazG were too low to allow for determination of their kinetic parameters (Fig. 1C). As shown, MsMazG exhibited the same optimal reaction conditions and substrate spectrum relative to MtMazG (Tables 1 and supplemental Table S2), indicating that MsMazG is functionally similar to MtMazG.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of MazG proteins analyzed in this studySpeciesEnzymeMg2+SubstrateVmaxkcatKmkcat/kmmmnm/min/μgmin−1mmmin−1mm−1MtWT5GTP1.5 ± 0.155.2 ± 3.10.4 ± 0.1139WT5dGTP1.4 ± 0.151.8 ± 2.10.4 ± 0.1130WT5dATP1.7 ± 0.260.4 ± 7.21.2 ± 0.352WT5dTTP1.6 ± 0.158.4 ± 3.91.3 ± 0.244WT5dUTP1.2 ± 0.245.3 ± 6.01.1 ± 0.343WT5ATP1.3 ± 0.148.4 ± 5.11.6 ± 0.331WT5UTP0.5 ± 0.0416.8 ± 1.50.6 ± 0.226E2195GTP0.08 ± 0.012.8 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.110WT20GTP2.3 ± 0.285.5 ± 6.40.6 ± 0.1134E21920GTP0.8 ± 0.130.7 ± 3.71.2 ± 0.329WT58-oxo-dGTP0.14 ± 0.015.2 ± 0.20.11 ± 0.0247E21958-oxo-dGTPNDaND, nondetectable.NDNDNDMsWT5GTP3.1 ± 0.2115 ± 6.20.9 ± 0.1127E2225GTP0.11 ± 0.024.1 ± 0.60.9 ± 0.34WT58-oxo-dGTP0.16 ± 0.015.9 ± 0.20.16 ± 0.0236E22258-oxo-dGTPNDNDNDNDEcWT5dATP1.9 ± 0.159.8 ± 2.30.34 ± 0.05174E1415dATP1.8 ± 0.157.8 ± 2.40.37 ± 0.05156WT5dUTP1.9 ± 0.160.3 ± 3.10.71 ± 0.185WT58-oxo-dGTP0.23 ± 0.017.2 ± 0.40.36 ± 0.0520E14158-oxo-dGTP0.22 ± 0.016.9 ± 0.30.42 ± 0.0617a ND, nondetectable. Open table in a new tab It is noteworthy that MtMazG and MsMazG are able to hydrolyze dUTP (Table 1), the most common mutagenic NTP produced as a byproduct during thymine nucleotide biosynthesis (9Galperin M.Y. Moroz O.V. Wilson K.S. Murzin A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 24Kouzminova E.A. Kuzminov A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1279-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both enzymes exhibited a moderate affinity toward dUTP with a Km of ∼1 mm, similar to most of their tested canonical NTP substrates and of their homolog from Thermotoga maritima (23Zhang J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5323-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Zhang J. Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21408-21414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). EcMazG is capable of hydrolyzing dUTP as well. Although it exhibits lower substrate affinity (with a Km of 0.7 mm) than that with canonical NTP substrates (Table 1), it is comparable to or better than that of MtMazG. Given that MtMazG can hydrolyze dUTP, we subsequently tested the hydrolysis activity of MtMazG toward 8-oxo-dGTP, a major mutagenic substrate for DNA synthesis arising from oxidative damage (Table 1) (26Pursell Z.F. McDonald J.T. Mathews C.K. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2174-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Tassotto M.L. Mathews C.K. J. Biol.

It was found that both MtMazG and MsMazG exhibited substantially high substrate affinity to 8-oxo-dGTP, with a Km of 0.11 and 0.16 mm, respectively. The Km value for 8-oxo-dGTP hydrolysis reaction of EcMazG was 0.36 mm, which is not significantly different from that with other substrates (Table 1). The order of kcat/Km for Mt-, Ms, and EcMazG is: 47, 36, and 20 min−1 mm−1, respectively. Under the aforementioned optimal conditions for MtMazG, the hydrolytic activities of MtMazG[A219E] were examined using various substrates (Table 1 and Fig. 1C). MtMazG[A219E] hydrolyzed GTP with kcat that is 20-fold lower than that of the wild type. However, the mutant enzyme Km is reduced about 25% relative to that of MtMazG. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of MtMazG[A219E] is down to 7% of the wild-type level (Fig. 2B and Table 1). The same results were obtained from the experiments performed at a range of pH 6.8–11 (Fig. 1B). In addition, the corresponding mutation (A222E) in MsMazG resulted in a decrease of the hydrolysis activity to levels similar to those observed with the A219E mutation in MtMazG, suggesting that MsMazG and MtMazG share similar catalytic mechanism. No detectable 8-oxo-dGTP hydrolysis activities were observed with either MtMazG[A219E] or MsMazG[A222E], indicating that this mutation reduced 8-oxo-dGTP hydrolysis activity by a factor of greater than 35 times (Table 1). Residue Ala-141 of the EcMazG (corresponding to Ala-219 of MtMazG) is located near the catalytic center motif for Mg2+ and substrate binding (11Lee S. Kim M.H. Kang B.S. Kim J.S. Kim G.H. Kim Y.G. Kim K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15232-15240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the A219 → E substitution of MtMazG might result in an increase of negative charge that alters Mg2+ binding. As revealed by the Mg2+ titration experiments, Mg2+ activated both MtMazG and MtMazG[A219E] (supplemental Fig. S3), while the MtMazG[A219E] exhibited a Kact for Mg2+ of 17.4 ± 4 mm, which is six times higher than that for MtMazG (2.8 ± 0.3 mm) (Fig. 2A). Increasing Mg2+ concentration from 5 to 20 mm enhanced the MtMazG[A219E] Vmax for the formation of PPi by nearly 10-fold (Fig. 2B and Table 1). However, even at 20 mm Mg2+, A219E exhibited the catalytic efficiency at levels no more than 25% of the wild type (Fig. 2B). Given that MtMazG A219 is essential for catalysis but is unlikely located in the catalytic center, we suspect that it may play an important role in determining the overall conformation of the protein. To address this possibility, we performed CD spectra analysis with purified MtMazG and MtMazG[A219E] in the presence or absence of Mg2+. In the absence of Mg2+, both the wild type and the mutant enzyme exhibited a similar pattern of α-helices and β-strands (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the CD spectra pattern observed with the MazG family proteins in the previous studies (10Moroz O.V. Murzin A.G. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Wilson K.S. Galperin M.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Zhang J. Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21408-21414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting that MtMazG and MtMazG[A219E] share nearly identical structures in the absence of Mg2+. However, whereas the addition of 5 mm Mg2+ resulted in minor changes in the CD spectra of the wild-type enzyme, it induced significant alterations to the A219E protein (Fig. 2C). Similar observations were made with the wild type and A219E in the presence of 10 or 15 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). These results suggest that upon Mg2+ binding, the negative charge of the E219 side chain induces rather drastic alterations in the secondary structures of MtMazG, and this altered conformation may explain the severe deficiency of MtMazG[A219E] in hydrolysis. To explore the in vivo function of MtMazG and evaluate the physiological effect of A219E mutation, we constructed a ΔmazG::hyg null mutation in the fast-growing M. smegmatis mc2 155, which was confirmed by Southern blot (Fig. 3B). The wild-type and mazG-null strains were subject to oxidative stress, elicited by exposure to 5 mm H2O2 (20Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Voskuil M.I. Liu Y. Mangan J.A. Monahan I.M. Dolganov G. Efron B.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nearly 80% of the wild-type bacteria were viable after the treatment for 1 h, whereas only 40% of the mutant bacteria survived under the same condition (Fig. 3C), revealing a defect for the mazG-null mutant in response to oxidative stress. This 2-fold decrease in viability by the mazG mutant under oxidative stress is significant, as comparable effect was observed on mycobacterial sigJ, sigE and ppk mutants in previous publications (29Wu Q.L.

Importantly, the attenuated phenotype in the mazG-null mutant can be fully complemented by the expression of the wild-type mazG gene of M. smegmatis under its native promoter (the characterization of the mazG operon and its promoter region is shown in supplemental Fig. S2). Of note, the mazG-null mutant showed no growth defects in vitro (supplemental Fig. S4). Moreover, no difference was observed between the wild-type and mazG-null M. smegmatis under starvation conditions (log-phase bacteria were placed in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 days (32Primm T.P.

We found that the PDGFRβ is shed from cells by a metalloproteinase and used loss-of-function experiments to identify ADAM10 as the sheddase responsible for constitutive and ionomycin-stimulated processing of the PDGFRβ. Moreover, we showed that ligand-dependent activation of the PDGFRβ does not trigger its own shedding by ADAM10, but instead it stimulates ADAM17 and shedding of substrates of ADAM17, including tumor necrosis factor α and transforming growth factor α. Finally, we demonstrated that treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with PDGF-B triggers a metalloproteinase-dependent cross-talk between the PDGFRβ and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERK1/2 signaling axis that is also critical for PDGF-B-stimulated cell migration, most likely via ADAM17-dependent release and activation of ligands of the EGFR.

https://openalex.org/W1980612794,"Dorsal ruffles are apical protrusions induced in response to many growth factors, yet their function is poorly understood. Here we report that downstream from the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), Met, dorsal ruffles function as both a localized signaling microdomain as well as a platform from which the Met RTK internalizes and traffics to a degradative compartment. In response to HGF, colonies of epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells form dorsal ruffles for up to 20 min. Met is transcytosed from the basolateral membrane on Rab4 endosomes, to the apical surface where Met, as well as a Met substrate and scaffold protein, Gab1, localize to the dorsal ruffle membrane. This results in activation of downstream signaling proteins, as evidenced by localization of phospho-ERK1/2 to dorsal ruffles. As dorsal ruffles collapse, Met is internalized into EEA1- and Rab5-positive endosomes and is targeted for degradation through delivery to an Hrs-positive sorting compartment. Enhancing HGF-dependent dorsal ruffle formation, through overexpression of Gab1 or activated Pak1 kinase, promotes more efficient degradation of the Met RTK. Conversely, the ablation of dorsal ruffle formation, by pre-treatment with SITS (4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyabatostilbene-2′,2-disulfonic acid) or expression of a Gab1 mutant, impairs Met degradation. Taken together, these data support a function for dorsal ruffles as a biologically relevant signaling microenvironment and a mechanism for Met receptor internalization and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1968640655,"Beside their health benefits, dietary omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) might impair host resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by creating an immunosuppressive environment. We hypothesized that incorporation of n-3 PUFA suppresses activation of macrophage antimycobacterial responses and favors bacterial growth, in part, by modulating the IFNgamma-mediated signaling pathway.Murine macrophage-like J774A.1 cells were incubated with bovine serum albumin (BSA)-conjugated docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) or BSA alone, activated with recombinant IFNgamma, and infected with a virulent strain (H37Rv) of M. tuberculosis. The fatty acid composition of macrophage membranes was modified significantly by DHA treatment. DHA-treated macrophages were less effective in controlling intracellular mycobacteria and showed impaired oxidative metabolism and reduced phagolysosome maturation. Incorporation of DHA resulted in defective macrophage activation, as characterized by reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-6 and MCP-1), and lower expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD40 and CD86). DHA treatment impaired STAT1 phosphorylation and colocalization of the IFNgamma receptor with lipid rafts, without affecting surface expression of IFNgamma receptor.We conclude that DHA reduces the ability of J774A.1 cells to control M. tuberculosis in response to activation by IFNgamma, by modulation of IFNgamma receptor signaling and function, suggesting that n-3 PUFA-enriched diets may have a detrimental effect on host immunity to tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2023852437,"Evolutionary theory predicts that different resource utilization and behaviour by alternative phenotypes may reduce competition and enhance productivity and individual performance in polymorphic, as compared with monomorphic, groups of individuals. However, firm evidence that members of more heterogeneous groups benefit from enhanced survival has been scarce or lacking. Furthermore, benefits associated with phenotypic diversity may be counterbalanced by costs mediated by reduced relatedness, since closely related individuals typically are more similar. Pygmy grasshoppers (Tetrix subulata) are characterized by extensive polymorphism in colour pattern, morphology, behaviour and physiology. We studied experimental groups founded by different numbers of mothers and found that survival was higher in low than in high density, that survival peaked at intermediate colour morph diversity in high density, and that survival was independent of diversity in low density where competition was less intense. We further demonstrate that survival was enhanced by relatedness, as expected if antagonistic and competitive interactions are discriminately directed towards non-siblings. We therefore also performed behavioural observations and staged encounters which confirmed that individuals recognized and responded differently to siblings than to non-siblings. We conclude that negative effects associated with competition are less manifest in diverse groups, that there is conflicting selection for and against genetic diversity occurring simultaneously, and that diversity and relatedness may facilitate the productivity and ecological success of groups of interacting individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2016508006,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) are more frequent in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients than in subjects with normal glucose metabolism. The mechanisms underlying this higher prevalence of UTI are unknown. However, cytokine levels are altered in diabetic patients and may thus contribute to the development of UTI. Increased levels of free fatty acids (FFA), as observed in obese patients, can induce IL-6 production in various cell types. Therefore we studied the effects of the free fatty acid palmitate and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and secretion in cultured human bladder smooth muscle cells (hBSMC).Biopsies were taken from patients undergoing cystectomy due to bladder cancer. Palmitate or LPS stimulated hBSMC were analysed for the production and secretion of the IL-6, gp80, gp80soluble, gp130, MCP-1, pSTAT3, SOCS3, NF-kappaB and SHP2 by quantitative PCR, ELISA, Western blotting, and confocal immunofluorescence. In signal transduction inhibition experiments we evaluated the involvement of NF-kappaB and MEK1 in IL-6 and MCP-1 regulation. Palmitate upregulates IL-6 mRNA expression and secretion via NF-kappaB dependent pathways in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. MCP-1 was moderately upregulated by palmitate but was strongly upregulated by LPS involving NF-kappaB and MEK1 dependent pathways. Soluble IL-6 receptor (gp80soluble) was downregulated by palmitate and LPS, while membrane-bound gp80 was moderately upregulated. LPS increased SOCS3 and SHP2, whereas palmitate only induced SOCS3. Secondary finding: most of the IL-6 is secreted.Bacterial infection (LPS) or metabolic alterations (palmitate) have distinct effects on IL-6 expression in hBSMC, (i) short term LPS induced autocrine JAK/STAT signaling and (ii) long-term endocrine regulation of IL-6 by palmitate. Induction of IL-6 in human bladder smooth muscle cells by fatty acids may represent a pathogenetic factor underlying the higher frequency and persistence of urinary tract infections in patients with metabolic diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2003661630,"The proton pumping activity of the eukaryotic vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is regulated by a unique mechanism that involves reversible enzyme dissociation. In yeast, under conditions of nutrient depletion, the soluble catalytic V<sub>1</sub> sector disengages from the membrane integral V<sub>o</sub>, and at the same time, both functional units are silenced. Notably, during enzyme dissociation, a single V<sub>1</sub> subunit, C, is released into the cytosol. The affinities of the other V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>o</sub> subunits for subunit C are therefore of particular interest. The C subunit crystal structure shows that the subunit is elongated and dumbbell-shaped with two globular domains (C<sub>head</sub> and C<sub>foot</sub>) separated by a flexible helical neck region (Drory, O., Frolow, F., and Nelson, N. (2004) <i>EMBO Rep.</i> 5, 1148–1152). We have recently shown that subunit C is bound in the V<sub>1</sub>-V<sub>o</sub> interface where the subunit is in contact with two of the three peripheral stators (subunit EG heterodimers): one via C<sub>head</sub> and one via C<sub>foot</sub> (Zhang, Z., Zheng, Y., Mazon, H., Milgrom, E., Kitagawa, N., Kish-Trier, E., Heck, A.

R., and Böttcher, B. (2005) <i>Biochemistry</i> 44, 15906–15914), implying that EG has different affinities for the two domains of the C subunit. To determine which subunit C domain binds EG with high affinity, we have generated C<sub>head</sub> and C<sub>foot</sub> and characterized their interaction with subunit EG heterodimer. Our findings indicate that the high affinity site for EGC interaction is C<sub>head</sub>. In addition, we provide evidence that the EGC<sub>head</sub> interaction greatly stabilizes EG heterodimer."
https://openalex.org/W2037506637,"Recent findings have established a role for the ST6Gal-1 sialyltransferase in modulating inflammatory cell production during Th1 and Th2 responses. ST6Gal-1 synthesizes the Sia(α2,6) to Gal(β1,4)GlcNAc linkage on glycoproteins on cell surfaces and in systemic circulation. Engagement of P1, one of six promoter/regulatory regions driving murine ST6Gal-1 gene expression, generates the ST6Gal-1 for myelopoietic regulation. P1 utilization, however, is restricted to the liver and silent in hematopoietic cells. We considered the possibility that myelopoiesis is responsive to the sialylation of liver-derived circulatory glycoproteins, such that reduced α2,6-sialylation results in elevated myelopoiesis. However, 2-dimensional differential in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) analysis disclosed only minimal alterations in the sialylation of sera glycoproteins of ST6Gal-1-deficient mice when compared with wild-type controls, either at baseline or during an acute phase response when the demand for sialylation is greatest. Furthermore, sera from ST6Gal-1-deficient animals did not enhance myelopoietic activity in ex vivo colony formation assays. Whereas there was only minimal consequence to the α2,6-sialylation of circulatory glycoproteins, ablation of the P1 promoter did result in strikingly depressed levels of ST6Gal-1 released into systemic circulation. Therefore, we considered the alternative possibility that myelopoiesis may be regulated not by the hepatic sialyl glycoproteins, but by the ST6Gal-1 that was released directly into circulation. Supporting this, ex vivo colony formation was notably attenuated upon introduction of physiologic levels of ST6Gal-1 into the culture medium. Our data support the idea that circulatory ST6Gal-1, mostly of hepatic origin, limits myelopoiesis by a mechanism independent of hepatic sialylation of serum glycoproteins. Recent findings have established a role for the ST6Gal-1 sialyltransferase in modulating inflammatory cell production during Th1 and Th2 responses. ST6Gal-1 synthesizes the Sia(α2,6) to Gal(β1,4)GlcNAc linkage on glycoproteins on cell surfaces and in systemic circulation. Engagement of P1, one of six promoter/regulatory regions driving murine ST6Gal-1 gene expression, generates the ST6Gal-1 for myelopoietic regulation. P1 utilization, however, is restricted to the liver and silent in hematopoietic cells. We considered the possibility that myelopoiesis is responsive to the sialylation of liver-derived circulatory glycoproteins, such that reduced α2,6-sialylation results in elevated myelopoiesis. However, 2-dimensional differential in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) analysis disclosed only minimal alterations in the sialylation of sera glycoproteins of ST6Gal-1-deficient mice when compared with wild-type controls, either at baseline or during an acute phase response when the demand for sialylation is greatest. Furthermore, sera from ST6Gal-1-deficient animals did not enhance myelopoietic activity in ex vivo colony formation assays. Whereas there was only minimal consequence to the α2,6-sialylation of circulatory glycoproteins, ablation of the P1 promoter did result in strikingly depressed levels of ST6Gal-1 released into systemic circulation.

https://openalex.org/W2063778796,"The superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase complex of resting phagocytes includes cytochrome b(559), a membrane-associated heterodimer composed of two subunits (Nox2 and p22(phox)), and four cytosolic proteins (p47(phox), p67(phox), Rac, and p40(phox)). Upon stimulation, the cytosolic components translocate to the membrane, as the result of a series of interactions among the cytosolic components and among the cytosolic components and cytochrome b(559) and its phospholipid environment. We described the construction of a tripartite chimera (trimera) consisting of strategic domains of p47(phox), p67(phox), and Rac1, in which interactions among cytosolic components were replaced by fusion (Berdichevsky, Y., Mizrahi, A., Ugolev, Y., Molshanski-Mor, S., and Pick, E. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 22122-22139). We now fused green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the N terminus of the trimera and found the following. 1) The GFP-p47(phox)-p67(phox)-Rac1 trimera activates the oxidase in amphiphile-dependent and -independent (anionic phospholipid-enriched membrane) cell-free systems. 2) Geranylgeranylation of the GFP-trimera makes it a potent oxidase activator in unmodified (native) membranes and in the absence of amphiphile. 3) Prenylated GFP-trimera binds spontaneously to native membranes (as assessed by gel filtration and in-line fluorometry), forming a tight complex capable of NADPH-dependent, activator-independent superoxide production at rates similar to those measured in canonical cell-free systems. 4) Prenylation of the GFP-trimera supersedes completely the dependence of oxidase activation on the p47(phox) phox homology domain and, partially, on the Rac1 polybasic domain, but the requirement for Trp(193) in p47(phox) persists. Prenylated GFP-p47(phox)-p67(phox)-Rac1 trimera acts as a quintessential single molecule oxidase activator of potential use in high throughput screening of inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2021743270,"Industrial melanism in the peppered moth (Biston betularia) is an iconic case study of ecological genetics but the molecular identity of the gene determining the difference between the typical and melanic (carbonaria) morphs is entirely unknown. We applied the candidate gene approach to look for associations between genetic polymorphisms within sixteen a priori melanisation gene candidates and the carbonaria morph. The genes were isolated and sequence characterised in B. betularia using degenerate PCR and from whole-transcriptome sequence. The list of candidates contains all the genes previously implicated in melanisation pattern differences in other insects, including aaNAT, DOPA-decarboxylase, ebony, tan, tyrosine hydroxylase, yellow and yellow2 (yellow-fa). Co-segregation of candidate gene alleles and carbonaria morph was tested in 73 offspring of a carbonaria male-typical female backcross. Surprisingly, none of the sixteen candidate genes was in close linkage with the locus controlling the carbonaria-typical polymorphism. Our study demonstrates that the ‘carbonaria gene’ is not a structural variant of a canonical melanisation pathway gene, neither is it a cis-regulatory element of these enzyme-coding genes. The implication is either that we have failed to characterize an unknown enzyme-coding gene in the melanisation pathway, or more likely, that the ‘carbonaria gene’ is a higher level trans-acting factor which regulates the spatial expression of one or more of the melanisation candidates in this study to alter the pattern of melanin production."
https://openalex.org/W2144012920,"Background hERG channels are physiologically important ion channels which mediate cardiac repolarization as a result of their unusual gating properties. These are very slow activation compared with other mammalian voltage-gated potassium channels, and extremely rapid inactivation. The mechanism of slow activation is not well understood and is investigated here using fluorescence as a direct measure of S4 movement and pore opening. Methods and Findings Tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMRM) fluorescence at E519 has been used to track S4 voltage sensor movement, and channel opening and closing in hERG channels. Endogenous cysteines (C445 and C449) in the S1–S2 linker bound TMRM, which caused a 10 mV hyperpolarization of the V½ of activation to −27.5±2.0 mV, and showed voltage-dependent fluorescence signals. Substitution of S1–S2 linker cysteines with valines allowed unobstructed recording of S3–S4 linker E519C and L520C emission signals. Depolarization of E519C channels caused rapid initial fluorescence quenching, fit with a double Boltzmann relationship, F-VON, with V½,1 = −37.8±1.7 mV, and V½,2 = 43.5±7.9 mV. The first phase, V½,1, was ∼20 mV negative to the conductance-voltage relationship measured from ionic tail currents (G-V½ = −18.3±1.2 mV), and relatively unchanged in a non-inactivating E519C:S620T mutant (V½ = −34.4±1.5 mV), suggesting the fast initial fluorescence quenching tracked S4 voltage sensor movement. The second phase of rapid quenching was absent in the S620T mutant. The E519C fluorescence upon repolarization (V½ = −20.6±1.2, k = 11.4 mV) and L520C quenching during depolarization (V½ = −26.8±1.0, k = 13.3 mV) matched the respective voltage dependencies of hERG ionic tails, and deactivation time constants from −40 to −110 mV, suggesting they detected pore-S4 rearrangements related to ionic current flow during pore opening and closing. Conclusion The data indicate: 1) that rapid environmental changes occur at the outer end of S4 in hERG channels that underlie channel activation gating, and 2) that secondary slower changes reflect channel pore opening during sustained depolarizations, and channel closing upon repolarization. 3) No direct evidence was obtained of conformational changes related to inactivation from fluorophores attached at the outer end of S4."

A recent crystal structure showed that bound CaM engages in a bridging interaction with the NOS FMN subdomain. We investigated its importance in neuronal NOS (nNOS) by mutating the two residues that primarily create the bridging interaction (Arg752 in the FMN subdomain and Glu47 in CaM). Mutations designed to completely destroy the bridging interaction prevented bound CaM from increasing electron flux through the FMN subdomain and diminished the FMN-to-heme electron transfer by 90%, whereas mutations that partly preserve the interaction had intermediate effects. The bridging interaction appeared to control FMN subdomain interactions with both its electron donor (NADPH-FAD subdomain) and electron acceptor (heme domain) partner subdomains in nNOS. We conclude that the Arg752–Glu47 bridging interaction is the main feature that enables CaM to activate nNOS.

https://openalex.org/W2046429254,"Background Few data concern the pathophysiology of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), which is associated with alveolar hypoxia/reoxygenation. This study tested the hypothesis that PSP is associated with oxidative stress in lung macrophages. We analysed expression of the oxidative stress marker 4-HNE; the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory proteins heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), biliverdin reductase (BVR) and heavy chain of ferritin (H-ferritin); and the transcription factors controlling their expression Nrf2 and HIF-1α, in lung samples from smoker and nonsmoker patients with PSP (PSP-S and PSP-NS), cigarette smoke being a risk factor of recurrence of the disease. Methodology/Principal Findings mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR and proteins by western blot, immunohistochemistry and confocal laser analysis. 4-HNE, HO-1, BVR and H-ferritin were increased in macrophages from PSP-S as compared to PSP-NS and controls (C). HO-1 increase was associated with increased expression of HIF-1α mRNA and protein in alveolar macrophages in PSP-S patients, whereas Nrf2 was not modified. To understand the regulation of HO-1, BVR and H-ferritin, THP-1 macrophages were exposed to conditions mimicking conditions in C, PSP-S and PSP-NS patients: cigarette smoke condensate (CS) or air exposure followed or not by hypoxia/reoxygenation. Silencing RNA experiments confirmed that HIF-1α nuclear translocation was responsible for HO-1, BVR and H-ferritin induction mediated by CS and hypoxia/reoxygenation. Conclusions/Significance PSP in smokers is associated with lung macrophage oxidative stress. The response to this condition involves HIF-1α-mediated induction of HO-1, BVR and H-ferritin."
https://openalex.org/W1971527407,"CC2D1A is an evolutionarily conserved protein that contains four DM14 domains at the N terminus and a C2 domain at the C terminus. Loss-of-function mutations in CC2D1A have been linked to mental retardation in human, but the biochemical function of this protein is largely unknown. Here, we show that CC2D1A is a potent activator of NF-kappaB. The activation of NF-kappaB by CC2D1A requires its C2 domain. CC2D1A activates NF-kappaB in a manner that depends on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13, TNF receptor-associated factor TRAF2, the protein kinase TAK1, and the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. In addition, the deubiquitination enzyme Cylindromatosis (CYLD) negatively regulates the activity of CC2D1A. These results suggest that CC2D1A activates NF-kappaB through the canonical IKK pathway."

We aimed to identify whether these variants may have an effect on cancer risk in general versus a specific effect on prostate cancer only.In a collaborative analysis, we collected data from GWAS of cancer phenotypes for the frequently reported variants of HNF1B, rs4430796 and rs7501939, which are in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.76, HapMap CEU). Overall, the analysis included 16 datasets on rs4430796 with 19,640 cancer cases and 21,929 controls; and 21 datasets on rs7501939 with 26,923 cases and 49,085 controls. Malignancies other than prostate cancer included colorectal, breast, lung and pancreatic cancers, and melanoma. Meta-analysis showed large between-dataset heterogeneity that was driven by different effects in prostate cancer and other cancers. The per-T2D-risk-allele odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for rs4430796 were 0.79 (0.76, 0.83)] per G allele for prostate cancer (p<10(-15) for both); and 1.03 (0.99, 1.07) for all other cancers. Similarly for rs7501939 the per-T2D-risk-allele odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.80 (0.77, 0.83) per T allele for prostate cancer (p<10(-15) for both); and 1.00 (0.97, 1.04) for all other cancers. No malignancy other than prostate cancer had a nominally statistically significant association.The examined HNF1B variants have a highly specific effect on prostate cancer risk with no apparent association with any of the other studied cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W2024785153,"Molecular interactions between the VAR2CSA protein, expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, and placental chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) are primarily responsible for pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM). Interrupting these interactions may prevent or ameliorate the severity of PAM. Several of the Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains of VAR2CSA, including the DBL3x domain, have been shown to bind CSA in vitro, but a more detailed understanding of how DBL domains bind CSA is needed. In this study, we demonstrate that subdomain 3 (S3), one of the three subdomains of VAR2CSA DBL3x by itself, is the major contributor toward CSA binding. NMR spectroscopy and flow cytometry analyses show that S3 and the intact DBL3x domain bind CSA similarly. Mutations within the S3 portion of DBL3x markedly affect CSA binding. Both recombinant molecules, S3 and DBL3x, are recognized by antibodies in the plasma of previously pregnant women living in malaria-endemic regions of Mali, but much less so by plasma from men of the same regions. As the S3 sequence is highly conserved in all known VAR2CSA proteins expressed by different parasite isolates obtained from various malaria endemic areas of the world, the identification of S3 as an independent CSA-binding region provides a compelling molecular basis for designing interventions against PAM."

The activated form of FVIII, FVIIIa, functions as a cofactor for FIXa in catalyzing the membrane-dependent activation of FX. Whereas the FVIII C2 domain is believed to anchor FVIIIa to the phospholipid surface, recent x-ray crystal structures of FVIII suggest that the C1 domain may also contribute to this function. We constructed a FVIII variant lacking the C2 domain (designated ΔC2) to characterize the contributions of the C1 domain to function. Binding affinity of the ΔC2 variant to phospholipid vesicles as measured by energy transfer was reduced ∼14-fold. However, the activity of ΔC2 as measured by FXa generation and one-stage clotting assays retained 76 and 36%, respectively, of the WT FVIII value. Modest reductions (∼4-fold) were observed in the functional affinity of ΔC2 FVIII for FIXa and rates of thrombin activation. On the other hand, deletion of C2 resulted in significant reductions in FVIIIa stability (∼3.6-fold). Thrombin generation assays showed peak thrombin and endogenous thrombin potential were reduced as much as ∼60-fold. These effects likely result from a combination of the intermolecular functional defects plus reduced protein stability.

A similar alignment was noted for factor Vai, the activated protein C-inactivated form of the homologous protein, factor Va (9Adams T.E. Hockin M.F. Mann K.G. Everse S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8918-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recent results comparing isolated FVIII C2 domain with a C1C2 protein showed enhanced affinity of the latter in platelet binding suggesting direct and/or indirect roles for C1 in this interaction (10Hsu T.C. Pratt K.P. Thompson A.R. Blood. 2008; 111: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was also reported that the C1 domain of FVa contributed to binding on phospholipid vesicles and played a role in the activity and assembly of the prothrombinase complex (11Saleh M. Peng W.

Blood. 2008; 112: 2795-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that FVIII without the C2 domain results in a marked reduction in affinity but still retains the capacity to bind phospholipid membranes, supporting a direct role for the C1 domain in this interaction. Furthermore, deletion of C2 does not grossly alter the rate of procofactor activation by thrombin, the affinity of FVIIIa for FIXa, Km of FXase for substrate FX, or kcat for FXa generation. However, this deletion does significantly destabilize the cofactor, such that when combined with several modest defects in various intermolecular interactions, it results in a significant reduction in the thrombin-generating capacity of this FVIII variant. Overall, these observations show pronounced membrane-dependent, cofactor activity in the absence of C2 domain yet indicate this domain is essential in contributing to maximal cofactor function. Recombinant FVIII (KogenateTM) and the monoclonal antibody 2D2 were generous gifts from Dr. Lisa Regan of Bayer Corporation (Berkeley, CA).

The primary contaminant in the FVIII preparations was albumin. FVIII concentration was measured using an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbant assay (ELISA), and FVIII activity was determined by one-stage clotting and two-stage chromogenic FXa generation assays described below. A sandwich ELISA was performed as previously described (15Wakabayashi H. Su Y.C. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Fay P.J.

FVIII capture used the anti-A1 monoclonal antibody (GMA8002, Green Mountain Antibody) and the anti-A2 monoclonal antibody (R8B12, Green Mountain Antibody) was employed for FVIII detection following its biotinylation. FVIII proteins or FVIIIa proteins (activated by 20 nm thrombin for 30 min at 23 °C) (0.34 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis under reducing (0.1 m dithiothreitol) conditions using 10% polyacrylamide gels at constant voltage (150 V). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, probed with an anti-A3 monoclonal antibody (2D2), and protein bands were visualized by chemifluorescence (570 nm) using a Storm 860 phosphorimager (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Phospholipid vesicles (large unilamellar vesicles) containing 20% PC, 50% PE, and 30% PS (or 100% PC) were prepared using octylglucoside as described previously (16Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y.

OR concentration was determined by absorbance at 564 nm (molar extinction coefficient = 95,400). The number of OR molecules per unit phospholipid area (Å2) was estimated to be 2.7 × 10−4 OR molecules/Å2 based on the criterion that each phospholipid occupies an area of 70 Å2 (17Yegneswaran S.

Labeled FVIII proteins (0.34 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis under reducing conditions using 10% polyacrylamide gels at constant voltage and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Protein bands were visualized by Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR+ System. (Bio-Rad) by converting the UV light source to blue light with an Xcitablue Conversion Screen and detecting emission using the Qdots 525 mode. Titration of PyMPO maleimide-labeled WT or −ΔC2 FVIII (25 nm) was performed by adding OR-containing phospholipid vesicles (0–15 μm for WT and 0–50 μm for ΔC2 FVIII) in the presence or absence of 500 nm WT (competitor) in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.01% BSA, 5 mm CaCl2 (buffer A). In addition, 500 μm PC vesicles in the above buffer was added to reactions to prevent nonspecific binding. Binding was monitored by donor (PyMPO) emission quenching resulting from energy transfer to the acceptor (OR) as described (17Yegneswaran S. Wood G.M. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25013-25021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 titrations were performed including one where labeled FVIII was titrated with phospholipid vesicles without OR (sample-0), a labeled FVIII titrated with phospholipid vesicles containing OR (sample-1), and an unlabeled FVIII titrated with phospholipid vesicles with OR (sample-2). After addition of phospholipid vesicles, samples were incubated for 10 min prior to determining emission fluorescence (540–546 nm; bandwidth 16 nm) by exciting at 417 nm (bandwidth: 2 nm) using an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY). Actual fluorescence after quenching by OR (F) was calculated by subtracting sample-2 fluorescence (F2) from sample-1 fluorescence (F1). Relative fluorescence (F/F0), which is the ratio of F to control sample-0 fluorescence (F0) was plotted against phospholipid concentration. One-stage clotting assays were performed using substrate plasma chemically depleted of FVIII (19Over J. Scand. J. Haematol. Suppl. 1984; 41: 13-24PubMed Google Scholar) and assayed using a Diagnostica Stago clotting instrument. Plasma was incubated with APTT reagent (General Diagnostics) for 6 min at 37 °C after which a dilution of FVIII was added to the cuvette. After 1 min, the mixture was recalcified, and clotting time was determined and compared with a pooled normal plasma standard. The rate of conversion of FX to FXa was monitored in a purified system (20Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) according to methods previously described (18Wakabayashi H. Koszelak M.E. Mastri M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10293-10300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Wakabayashi H. Schmidt K.M. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8485-8492Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). FVIII (1 nm) in buffer A, containing 20 μm PSPCPE vesicles was activated with 20 nm α-thrombin for 10 s. The reaction was stopped by adding hirudin (10 units/ml) and the resulting FVIIIa was reacted with FIXa (40 nm) for 10 s. FX (300 nm) was added to initiate reactions, which were quenched after 1 min by the addition of 50 mm EDTA. FXa generated was determined following reaction with the chromogenic substrate Pefachrome Xa (0.46 mm final concentration). All reactions were run at 23 °C. WT and ΔC2 (1.5 nm) in buffer A containing 20 μm PSPCPE vesicles were activated using 20 nm thrombin for 10 s at 23 °C. Reactions were immediately quenched by hirudin (10 units/ml) to inactivate thrombin, aliquots removed at the indicated times, and activity was determined using the FXa generation assay following addition of FIXa (40 nm) and FX (300 nm). The amount of thrombin generated in plasma was measured by Calibrated Automated Thrombography (22Hemker H.C. Giesen P. Al Dieri R. Regnault V. de Smedt E. Wagenvoord R. Lecompte T. Béguin S. Pathophysiol. Haemost. Thromb. 2003; 33: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 23Hemker H.C. Béguin S. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In a 96-well plate, 80 μl of FVIII-deficient plasma (<1% residual activity, platelet-poor) from a severe hemophilia A patient lacking FVIII inhibitor (George King Bio-Medical, Overland Park, KS) was mixed with FVIII samples (20 μl, 6 nm) in HEPES-BSA buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.35, 0.15 m NaCl, 6% BSA) containing 6 pm TF (TF stock concentration was determined by FXa generation assay using known concentrations of FVIIa), PSPCPE vesicles (24 μm) or 20 μl of thrombin calibrator (630 nm), and reactions were immediately started by mixing with 20 μl of fluorogenic substrate (2.5 mm, Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC) in HEPES-BSA buffer including 0.1 m CaCl2. All reagents were prewarmed at 37 °C. Final concentrations of reagents were 0.25–32 nm FVIII,1 pm TF, 4 μm PSPCPE vesicles, 433 μm fluorogenic substrate, 13.3 mm CaCl2, and 105 nm thrombin calibrator. The development of a fluorescent signal at 37 °C was monitored at 8-s intervals using a Microplate Spectrofluorometer (Spetramax Gemini, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with a 355 nm (excitation)/460 nm (emission) filter set. Fluorescent signals were corrected by the reference signal from the thrombin calibrator samples (22Hemker H.C. Giesen P. Al Dieri R. Regnault V. de Smedt E. Wagenvoord R. Lecompte T. Béguin S. Pathophysiol. Haemost. Thromb. 2003; 33: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), and actual thrombin generation in nm was calculated as previously described (23Hemker H.C. Béguin S. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). FVIII (1 nm) in buffer A containing 10 μm PSPCPE vesicles was activated by 20 nm thrombin for 10 s, immediately reacted with hirudin (10 units/ml) and 40 nm FIXa, and FXa generation was initiated by adding the indicated concentrations of FX. For the measurement of FIXa binding affinity, FVIII (1 nm) in buffer A containing 20 μm PSPCPE was activated by 20 nm thrombin for 10 s, immediately reacted with hirudin (10 units/ml), and the indicated concentration of FIXa, and FXa generation was initiated by adding 300 nm FX as described above. Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine kinetic parameter values or a quadratic equation to assess FIXa affinity by non-linear least squares regression. Various concentrations of FVIII (0–200 nm) in buffer A were activated by 0.5 nm thrombin for 10 s, and FVIIIa activity generated was determined by FXa generation assays. The concentration of FVIIIa was calculated from the FVIIIa activity value (250 nm/min and 190 nm/min for WT and ΔC2 FVIII) obtained when 1 nm FIXa was saturated with FVIIIa. The kinetics of thrombin cleavage of FVIII was determined as described (24Newell J.L. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11080-11089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 nm FVIII in buffer A was activated by 2 nm thrombin for various times (0–30 min), quenched by SDS-PAGE buffer, and subjected to Western blot probed by R8B12 (anti-A2) and 2D2 (anti-A3) antibodies. The visualized band density was quantified by ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Because the total concentration of the A2-domain or A3-domain containing substrates and products totals 200 nm in each lane, the amounts of each species were calculated from a ratio of the band density value in each lane. For factor VIII-phospholipid binding kinetics we used Equation 1,(F/F0)=1−QmaxA⋅(A+Kd+X/n)2−(A+Kd+X/n)2−4⋅A⋅X/n2(Eq. 1) where F/F0 is relative fluorescence, A is the concentration of factor VIII (25 nm), X is the concentration of phospholipid vesicles, Kd is a dissociation constant, n is a ratio of binding stoichiometry (phospholipid:factor VIII), and Qmax is the maximum quenching value. The value of n was estimated by titration using high concentrations of factor VIII (200 and 300 nm). Based on the phospholipid concentration at the inflection points (20 μm for 200 nm factor VIII and 30 μm for 300 nm factor VIII titration), we determined that the value of n equals 100 (data not shown). FVIIIa activity values as a function of time were fitted to a single exponential decay curve by non-linear least squares regression using Equation 2,A=A0⋅e−kt(Eq. 2) where A is residual FVIIIa activity (nm/min/nm FVIII), A0 is the initial activity, k is the apparent rate constant, and t is the time after FVIII activation when thrombin was quenched. Michaelis-Menten kinetics using Equation 3,A=Vmax⋅XKm+X(Eq. 3) where A is initial velocity (FXa generation in nm/min/nm FVIII or FVIII activation by thrombin in nm/min/nm thrombin), X is the concentration of enzyme substrate (FX or FVIII) in nm, Km is the Michaelis constant, and Vmax is the maximum activity at saturation. FIXa-FVIII binding affinity used Equation 4,A=VmaxB⋅(B+Kd+X)2−(B+Kd+X)2−4⋅B⋅X2(Eq. 4) where A is initial velocity (nm/min/nm FVIII), X is the concentration of FIXa in nm, Kd is the dissociation constant, B is the FVIIIa concentration, and Vmax is the maximum activity at saturation. Thrombin cleavage data of FVIII as a function of time were fitted to a single exponential decay curve by non-linear least squares regression using Equation 5,A=A0⋅e−k⋅t(Eq. 5) where A is the amount of single chain FVIII (sFVIII in nm), A0 is the initial sFVIII (nm), k is the apparent rate constant, and t is the time (min), or Equation 6,A=A0(1−e−k⋅t)(Eq. 6) where A is the amount of A2 or A3C1C2 (A3C1 in the case of ΔC2 FVIII) in nm, A0 is the initial subunit amount (nm), k is the apparent rate constant, and t is the time (min). Cleavage rates were calculated as A0 × k. Nonlinear least-squares regression analysis was performed by Kaleidagraph (Synergy, Reading, PA). For statistical analysis, a logarithmic scale parameter was used in place of the decay rate constant, and average values were compared by the Student's t test. The ΔC2 FVIII variant was constructed and expressed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified WT and ΔC2 FVIII were examined by Western blot before and after thrombin activation. As shown in Fig. 1, WT FVIII probed using an anti-A3 domain antibody (2D2), was visualized as a single chain FVIII (∼170 kDa) and ∼80 kDa light chain (lane 1). The ΔC2 single chain FVIII migrated at a slightly lower Mr position (∼150 kDa, lane 2) compared with WT, and ΔC2 light chain migrated at ∼60 kDa, consistent with deletion of the ∼20 kDa C2 domain. After thrombin cleavage, the A3C1C2 subunit from WT FVIII migrated at ∼70 kDa (lane 3), and the A3C1 band from ΔC2 FVIII appeared as an ∼50-kDa band (lane 4). The light chain of WT FVIII appears as a doublet while that of ΔC2 LC appears as a triplet. The reason for this is not clear, although one of the triplet bands in ΔC2 LC (likely the highest Mr band) may be visualized because of the better resolution of the gel at the lower Mr position. The presence of residual uncleaved light chain seen in lane 4 may result from reduced thrombin cleavage efficiency of ΔC2 (see below). PyMPO maleimide was incorporated into FVIII. Fig. 1 (lanes 5 and 6) show the PyMPO-labeled WT and ΔC2 FVIII, respectively, with bands detected by the bound fluorophor. Single chain FVIII (∼170 kDa for WT and ∼150 kDa for ΔC2), HC (∼90 kDa), and LC (∼80 kDa for WT and ∼60 kDa for C2) bands were the predominant components accounting for >90% of the fluorescence in the FVIII preparations. The PyMPO fluorophor was selected as the fluorescence donor for the fluorescence acceptor, OR used to label the phospholipid vesicles, because the fluorescence overlap between donor emission (550 nm) and acceptor excitation (555 nm) maxima was satisfactory and the latter was far removed from the donor excitation maxima (417 nm). Results from phospholipid vesicle titration of WT and ΔC2 FVIII as detected by fluorescence energy transfer are shown in Fig. 2. Relative fluorescence from PyMPO-labeled WT as well as from the ΔC2 FVIII variant decreased in a hyperbolic fashion as the concentration of phospholipid containing OR increased. While fluorescence of the WT protein was reduced to ∼0.7 at 5 μm phospholipid vesicles (open circles), ΔC2 fluorescence remained at ∼0.95 (open triangles). The presence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled WT FVIII (500 nm) during WT FVIII titration showed ∼90 and ∼70% reduced quenching at 5 and 15 μm OR phospholipid, respectively (closed circles). Similarly, in the case of ΔC2 FVIII titration the reduction of quenching in the presence of unlabeled WT FVIII (500 nm) was 70 and 50% at 5 μm and 15 μm, respectively (closed triangles). A Kd value for WT FVIII binding to OR-phospholipid vesicles was estimated as 3.2 ± 0.5 nm. The increase in ΔC2 fluorescence quenching showed a biphasic pattern with an inflection occurring at ∼15 μm OR-phospholipid. Curve fitting for ΔC2 FVIII binding to OR-phospholipid using the initial portion of the curve (0–15 μm) yielded a Kd value of 43.6 ± 5.6 nm. This result suggested that the phospholipid binding affinity for ΔC2 FVIII was reduced by ∼14-fold compared with WT. Titration of the FVIIIa WT and variant with OR-phospholipid in the presence of FIXa (50 nm) resulted in no appreciable effect on membrane binding affinity (data not shown). ΔC2 FVIII showed 76% of WT specific activity as measured by a chromogenic FXa generation assay (Table 1) whereas the specific activity as measured by the one-stage clotting assay was more reduced (36% of WT activity). These results suggested that the reduced affinity for the interaction of FVIII with phospholipid vesicles caused by C2 domain deletion still yielded a protein with appreciable cofactor activity under these assay conditions.TABLE 1Specific activity and kinetic parameters for FXase complexes of WT and ΔC2 FVIIISpecific activityKinetic parametersOne-stageFXa GenerationMichaelis constant KmFIXa binding Kdunit/μgnm FXa/min/nm FVIIInmnmWT4.53 ± 0.04 (1)49.9 ± 1.3 (1)15.7 ± 2.2 (1.0)0.27 ± 0.05 (1)ΔC21.63 ± 0.06 (0.36)ap < 0.001.37.9 ± 1.9 (0.76)bp < 0.05 compared to the value for WT.25.7 ± 2.1 (1.6)bp < 0.05 compared to the value for WT.1.25 ± 0.04 (4.5)ap < 0.001.a p < 0.001.b p < 0.05 compared to the value for WT. Open table in a new tab Thrombin generation parameter values were examined by calibrated thrombin generation assay using FVIII-deficient plasma. The reaction was initiated by 1 pm TF added in the presence of 4 μm PSPCPE vesicles. After incubation of both WT and ΔC2 FVIII, an increase in thrombin generation was observed at ∼5–7 min (Fig. 3) and reached the maximum at ∼17–21 min. The peak thrombin and ETP (area under the curve) values obtained with 32 nm ΔC2 FVIII (62.9 nm and 1573 nm·min, respectively) were similar to those obtained using 0.5 nm WT FVIII (65.5 nm and 1558 nm·min). At a concentration of 16 nm ΔC2 FVIII, the peak and ETP values were similar to 0.25 nm WT FVIII (46.6 nm and 1196 nm·min for ΔC2 FVIII, and 41.6 nm and 1121 nm·min for WT FVIII). Therefore, we estimated that the thrombin generation potential of ΔC2 FVIII was reduced ∼64-fold compared with WT FVIII. This result was more dramatic than the activity reductions observed using clotting and FXa generation assays. To investigate a potential reason(s) for this disparity we examined FXa generation kinetics, FIXa affinity, procofactor activation by thrombin and factor VIIIa stability of the ΔC2 FVIII. The capacity of the ΔC2 FVIII mutants to serve as a cofactor for FIXa and the functional affinity for this interaction were examined by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Results from the kinetics study (Fig. 4A) showed a saturable increase in activity as substrate FX concentration increases. The Km value for reactions using ΔC2 FVIII estimated from non-linear least squares regression was increased by only ∼1.6-fold as compared with the WT value (Table 1). Binding kinetics of FVIIIa with FIXa were examined by titrating FVIII (1 nm) after thrombin activation with various concentrations of FIXa (Fig. 4B). The hyperbolic increase in activity with increasing FIXa concentration was observed with near saturation achieved at 5 nm FIXa. The estimated affinity for FIXa, shown in Table 1, was moderately reduced as judged by an ∼3.9-fold increase in apparent Kd as compared with WT. Michaelis-Menten analysis of FVIII activation by thrombin was performed by measuring the concentration of FVIIIa using FXa generation assays. Initial velocity of FVIIIa generation was measured by the amount formed during a limited reaction time (10 s). As WT or ΔC2 FVIII substrate concentration increased, an increase in initial velocity was observed with saturation achieved at >200 nm (Fig. 5). Estimated Km values (Table 2) for both FVIII proteins were similar, with the ΔC2 FVIII variant showing a 30% increase in this parameter. However, the Vmax for ΔC2 FVIII was significantly lower (∼2-fold, Table 2), suggesting some contribution of C2 domain to effectively orient the enzyme-substrate complex for efficient catalysis. Overall, conversion of the ΔC2 FVIII showed an ∼2.8-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) compared with the WT protein.TABLE 2Parameter values for thrombin activation and cleavage of FVIIIMichaelis-Menten analysisReaction rateKmVmaxsFVIII disappearanceA2 appe"
https://openalex.org/W2085821267,"Lamin A (LaA) is a component of the nuclear lamina, an intermediate filament meshwork that underlies the inner nuclear membrane (INM) of the nuclear envelope (NE). Newly synthesized prelamin A (PreA) undergoes extensive processing involving C-terminal farnesylation followed by proteolysis yielding non-farnesylated mature lamin A. Different inhibitors of these processing events are currently used therapeutically. Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is most commonly caused by mutations leading to an accumulation of a farnesylated LaA isoform, prompting a clinical trial using farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) to reduce this modification. At therapeutic levels, HIV protease inhibitors (PI) can unexpectedly inhibit the final processing step in PreA maturation. We have examined the dynamics of LaA processing and associated cellular effects during PI or FTI treatment and following inhibitor washout. While PI reversibility was rapid, with respect to both LaA maturation and associated cellular phenotype, recovery from FTI treatment was more gradual. FTI reversibility is influenced by both cell type and rate of proliferation. These results suggest a less static lamin network than has previously been observed."

We created deletion mutants to study the importance of PAPS transporter activity. The pst-1 deletion mutant exhibited defects in cuticle formation, post-embryonic seam cell development, vulval morphogenesis, cell migration, and embryogenesis. The pst-2 mutant exhibited a wild-type phenotype. The defects observed in the pst-1 mutant could be rescued by transgenic expression of pst-1 and hPAPST1 but not pst-2 or hPAPST2. Moreover, the phenotype of a pst-1;pst-2 double mutant were similar to those of the pst-1 single mutant, except that larval cuticle formation was more severely defected. Disaccharide analysis revealed that heparan sulfate from these mutants was undersulfated.

https://openalex.org/W2001158990,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces angiogenesis and regulates endothelial function via production and release of nitric oxide (NO), an important signaling molecule. The molecular basis leading to NO production involves phosphatidylinositiol-3 kinase (PI3K), Akt, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) activation. In this study, we have examined whether small GTP-binding proteins of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family act as molecular switches to regulate signaling cascades activated by VEGF in endothelial cells. Our results show that this growth factor can promote the rapid and transient activation of ARF1. In endothelial cells, this GTPase is present on dynamic plasma membrane ruffles. Inhibition of ARF1 expression, using RNA interference, markedly impaired VEGF-dependent eNOS phosphorylation and NO production by preventing the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling axis. Furthermore, our data indicate that phosphorylation of Tyr(801), on VEGF receptor 2, is essential for activating Src- and ARF1-dependent signaling events leading to NO release from endothelial cells. Lastly, this mediator is known to regulate a broad variety of endothelial cell functions. Depletion of ARF1 markedly inhibits VEGF-dependent increase of vascular permeability as well as capillary tubule formation, a process important for angiogenesis. Taken together, our data indicate that ARF1 is a novel modulator of VEGF-stimulated NO release and signaling in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030895168,"RNA helicases are proteins essential to almost every facet of RNA metabolism, including the gene-silencing pathways that employ small RNAs. A phylogenetically related group of helicases is required for the RNA-silencing mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans. Dicer-related helicase 3 (DRH-3) is a Dicer-RIG-I family protein that is essential for RNA silencing and germline development in nematodes. Here we performed a biochemical characterization of the ligand binding and catalytic activities of DRH-3 in vitro. We identify signature motifs specific to this family of RNA helicases. We find that DRH-3 binds both single-stranded and double-stranded RNAs with high affinity. However, the ATPase activity of DRH-3 is stimulated only by double-stranded RNA. DRH-3 is a robust RNA-stimulated ATPase with a k(cat) value of 500/min when stimulated with short RNA duplexes. The DRH-3 ATPase may have allosteric regulation in cis that is controlled by the stoichiometry of double-stranded RNA to enzyme. We observe that the DRH-3 ATPase is stimulated only by duplexes containing RNA, suggesting a role for DRH-3 during or after transcription. Our findings provide clues to the role of DRH-3 during the RNA interference response in vivo."

Few smolts were recorded on marine arrays. Freshwater survival rates of the tagged smolts during their downstream migration were 0.0-5.6% (0.0-9.0% s.e.) in 2004, 7.0% (6.2% s.e.) in 2005, and 50.9% (18.6% s.e.) in 2006. Overall smolt-to-adult return rates exhibited a similar pattern, which suggests that low freshwater survival rates of out-migrating smolts may be a primary reason for the poor conservation status of this endangered coho salmon population."

https://openalex.org/W2072401240,"Thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor (Mpl) have long been associated with megakaryocyte proliferation, differentiation, and platelet formation. However, studies have also shown that the extracellular domain of Mpl (Mpl-EC) interacts with human (h) NUDC, a protein previously characterized as a human homolog of a fungal nuclear migration protein. This study was undertaken to further delineate the putative binding domain on the Mpl receptor. Using the yeast two-hybrid system assay and co-immunoprecipitation, we identified that within the Mpl-EC domain 1 (Mpl-EC-D1), amino acids 102–251 were strongly involved in ligand binding. We subsequently expressed five subdomains within this region with T7 phage display. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assays identified a short stretch of peptide located between residues 206 and 251 as the minimum binding domain for both TPO and hNUDC. A series of sequential Ala replacement mutations in the region were subsequently used to identify the specific residues most involved in ligand binding. Our results point to two hydrophobic residues, Leu228 and Leu230, as having substantial effects on hNUDC binding.

Hematoxylin & Eosin-stained slides were used to re-classify the histological subtypes according to the WHO classification. EBV status was determined by visualization of EBERs in tumor cells using in situ hybridization. Membranous expression of HLA molecules was detected by immunohistochemistry using antibodies HC-10 (class I heavy chain) and anti-beta2-microglobulin for HLA class I, and CR3/43 for HLA class II. EBV+ tumor cells were observed in 40% (58/145) of the cHL patients. As expected, the percentage of EBV+ cases was much higher in the mixed cellularity subtype (71%) than in the nodular sclerosis subtype (16%) (p<0.001). Expression of HLA class I was observed in 79% of the EBV+ cHL cases and in 30% of the EBV-cases (p<0.001). For HLA class II, 52% of EBV+ cHL cases were positive, compared to 43% in EBV- cases (p = 0.28).The results in the Northern China population were similar to those in the Caucasian population for HLA class I, but not for HLA class II."
https://openalex.org/W2045460867,"IbeA (invasion of brain endothelium), which is located on a genomic island termed GimA, is involved in the pathogenesis of several extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) pathotypes, including newborn meningitic E. coli (NMEC) and avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC). To unravel the phylogeny of GimA and to investigate its island character, the putative insertion locus of GimA was determined via Long Range PCR and DNA-DNA hybridization in 410 E. coli isolates, including APEC, NMEC, uropathogenic (UPEC), septicemia-associated E. coli (SEPEC), and human and animal fecal isolates as well as in 72 strains of the E. coli reference (ECOR) collection. In addition to a complete GimA (approximately 20.3 kb) and a locus lacking GimA we found a third pattern containing a 342 bp remnant of GimA in this strain collection. The presence of GimA was almost exclusively detected in strains belonging to phylogenetic group B2. In addition, the complete GimA was significantly more frequent in APEC and NMEC strains while the GimA remnant showed a higher association with UPEC strains. A detailed analysis of the ibeA sequences revealed the phylogeny of this gene to be consistent with that obtained by Multi Locus Sequence Typing of the strains. Although common criteria for genomic islands are partially fulfilled, GimA rather seems to be an ancestral part of phylogenetic group B2, and it would therefore be more appropriate to term this genomic region GimA locus instead of genomic island. The existence of two other patterns reflects a genomic rearrangement in a reductive evolution-like manner."
https://openalex.org/W2171883070,"We have identified an operon and characterized the functions of two genes from the severe food-poisoning bacterium, Bacillus cereus subsp. cytotoxis NVH 391-98, that are involved in the synthesis of a unique UDP-sugar, UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxyxylose (UDP-N-acetyl-xylosamine, UDP-XylNAc). UGlcNAcDH encodes a UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine 6-dehydrogenase, converting UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to UDP-N-acetyl-glucosaminuronic acid (UDP-GlcNAcA). The second gene in the operon, UXNAcS, encodes a distinct decarboxylase not previously described in the literature, which catalyzes the formation of UDP-XylNAc from UDP-GlcNAcA in the presence of exogenous NAD+. UXNAcS is specific and cannot utilize UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-galacturonic acid as substrates. UXNAcS is active as a dimer with catalytic efficiency of 7 mm−1 s−1. The activity of UXNAcS is completely abolished by NADH but unaffected by UDP-xylose. A real-time NMR-based assay showed unambiguously the dual enzymatic conversions of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GlcNAcA and subsequently to UDP-XylNAc. From the analyses of all publicly available sequenced genomes, it appears that UXNAcS is restricted to pathogenic Bacillus species, including Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus thuringiensis. The identification of UXNAcS provides insight into the formation of UDP-XylNAc. Understanding the metabolic pathways involved in the utilization of this amino-sugar may allow the development of drugs to combat and eradicate the disease.

https://openalex.org/W1987540364,"Poxvirus morphogenesis is a complex process that involves the successive wrapping of the virus in host cell membranes. We screened by plaque assay a focused library of kinase inhibitors for those that caused a reduction in viral growth and identified several compounds that selectively inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Previous studies demonstrated that PI3Ks mediate poxviral entry. Using growth curves and electron microscopy in conjunction with inhibitors, we show that that PI3Ks additionally regulate morphogenesis at two distinct steps: immature to mature virion (IMV) transition, and IMV envelopment to form intracellular enveloped virions (IEV). Cells derived from animals lacking the p85 regulatory subunit of Type I PI3Ks (p85α−/−β−/−) presented phenotypes similar to those observed with PI3K inhibitors. In addition, VV appear to redundantly use PI3Ks, as PI3K inhibitors further reduce plaque size and number in p85α−/−β−/− cells. Together, these data provide evidence for a novel regulatory mechanism for virion morphogenesis involving phosphatidylinositol dynamics and may represent a new therapeutic target to contain poxviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2105138305,"Background Images are important for conveying information, but there is no empirical evidence on whether imaging figures are properly selected and presented in the published medical literature. We therefore evaluated the selection and presentation of radiological imaging figures in major medical journals. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed articles published in 2005 in 12 major general and specialty medical journals that had radiological imaging figures. For each figure, we recorded information on selection, study population, provision of quantitative measurements, color scales and contrast use. Overall, 417 images from 212 articles were analyzed. Any comment/hint on image selection was made in 44 (11%) images (range 0–50% across the 12 journals) and another 37 (9%) (range 0–60%) showed both a normal and abnormal appearance. In 108 images (26%) (range 0–43%) it was unclear whether the image came from the presented study population. Eighty-three images (20%) (range 0–60%) had any quantitative or ordered categorical value on a measure of interest. Information on the distribution of the measure of interest in the study population was given in 59 cases. For 43 images (range 0–40%), a quantitative measurement was provided for the depicted case and the distribution of values in the study population was also available; in those 43 cases there was no over-representation of extreme than average cases (p = 0.37). Significance The selection and presentation of images in the medical literature is often insufficiently documented; quantitative data are sparse and difficult to place in context."
