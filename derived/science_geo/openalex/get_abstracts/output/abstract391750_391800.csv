https://openalex.org/W2166236051,"Epigenetic information can be inherited through the mammalian germline and represents a plausible transgenerational carrier of environmental information. To test whether transgenerational inheritance of environmental information occurs in mammals, we carried out an expression profiling screen for genes in mice that responded to paternal diet. Offspring of males fed a low-protein diet exhibited elevated hepatic expression of many genes involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis and decreased levels of cholesterol esters, relative to the offspring of males fed a control diet. Epigenomic profiling of offspring livers revealed numerous modest (∼20%) changes in cytosine methylation depending on paternal diet, including reproducible changes in methylation over a likely enhancer for the key lipid regulator Ppara. These results, in conjunction with recent human epidemiological data, indicate that parental diet can affect cholesterol and lipid metabolism in offspring and define a model system to study environmental reprogramming of the heritable epigenome."

Here, we report that Wnt signaling triggers the sequestration of GSK3 from the cytosol into multivesicular bodies (MVBs), so that this enzyme becomes separated from its many cytosolic substrates. Endocytosed Wnt colocalized with GSK3 in acidic vesicles positive for endosomal markers. After Wnt addition, endogenous GSK3 activity decreased in the cytosol, and GSK3 became protected from protease treatment inside membrane-bounded organelles. Cryoimmunoelectron microscopy showed that these corresponded to MVBs. Two proteins essential for MVB formation, HRS/Vps27 and Vps4, were required for Wnt signaling. The sequestration of GSK3 extended the half-life of many other proteins in addition to β-Catenin, including an artificial Wnt-regulated reporter protein containing GSK3 phosphorylation sites. We conclude that multivesicular endosomes are essential components of the Wnt signal-transduction pathway.

A cytoplasmic destruction complex consisting of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3, which has α and β isoforms), Casein Kinase 1 (CK1), Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), and Axin mediates the phosphorylation of β-Catenin. Phosphorylation targets β-Catenin for polyubiquitinylation and subsequent degradation in proteasomes. In the presence of Wnt, the destruction complex becomes inactivated in ways that are incompletely understood. Wnt triggers signaling by binding to Frizzled and LDL-receptor related protein 6 (LRP6), causing the aggregation of Dishevelled (Dvl) and Axin on the plasma membrane (Bilic et al., 2007Bilic J.

The key step in the canonical pathway is the inactivation of GSK3, as evidenced by the fact that pharmacological inhibition of this enzyme elicits a typical Wnt signal. The molecular mechanism of GSK3 inhibition remains one of the main open questions in the Wnt field (Wu and Pan, 2010Wu D. Pan W. GSK3: a multifaceted kinase in Wnt signaling.Trends Biochem.

Activated Wnt receptors recruit Axin and GSK3, which phosphorylates five critical PPPS/TP sequences in the intracellular domain of LRP6 (Zeng et al., 2008Zeng X. Huang H. Tamai K. Zhang X. Harada Y.

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the inhibition of GSK3 (Kimelman and Xu, 2006Kimelman D.

For example, the LRP6 tail may act as a direct inhibitor of GSK3 (Mi et al., 2006Mi K. Dolan P.J. Johnson G.V.W.

The LRP6 PPPSP repeats serve both as substrates and binding sites for GSK3 and may act as competitive inhibitors of this enzyme, although at low affinity (Ki of 1.3 × 10−5 M; Cselenyi et al., 2008Cselenyi C.S.

USA. 2008; 105: 8032-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). GSK3 has many substrates in addition to β-Catenin, including Dvl, Axin, and APC (Jope and Johnson, 2004Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. The glamour and gloom of glycogen synthase kinase-3.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). This promiscuous enzyme phosphorylates serine or threonine at position −4 of sites primed by phosphorylation (S/TXXXS/T[PO3]) (Cohen and Frame, 2001Cohen P. Frame S. The renaissance of GSK3.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). We reported that the transcription factor Smad1 is polyubiquitinylated and degraded after GSK3 phosphorylation and is stabilized by canonical Wnt signaling, resulting in the integration of BMP and Wnt signaling (Fuentealba et al., 2007Fuentealba L.C. Eivers E. Ikeda A. Hurtado C. Kuroda H. Pera E.M. De Robertis E.M. Integrating patterning signals: Wnt/GSK3 regulates the duration of the BMP/Smad1 signal.Cell. 2007; 131: 980-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Additional substrates destabilized by GSK3 phosphorylation have since been identified (Kim et al., 2009Kim N.G. Xu C. Gumbiner B.M. Identification of targets of the Wnt pathway destruction complex in addition to β-catenin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 5165-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). During our investigations on signaling integration, we measured GSK3 enzyme activity in Wnt-treated cell extracts (prepared in the presence of Triton X-100) and were surprised to find that Wnt did not change GSK3 activity (data not shown), even though in the direct GSK3 inhibition model one would have predicted inhibition. How could this be? Upon reflection, we realized that following ligand binding and endocytosis, growth factor receptors are incorporated into multivesicular endosomes within 15 min (Gruenberg and Stenmark, 2004Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. The biogenesis of multivesicular endosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Multivesicular body (MVB) formation is an obligatory step before degradation in lysosomes can take place (Katzmann et al., 2002Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Receptor downregulation and multivesicular-body sorting.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). As first discovered for EGF receptor, the topology is such that the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane corresponds to the lumen of the small MVB vesicles (McKanna et al., 1979McKanna J.A. Haigler H.T. Cohen S. Hormone receptor topology and dynamics: Morphological analysis using ferritin-labeled epidermal growth factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1979; 76: 5689-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, Wnt-induced MVB formation would cause GSK3 bound to phosphorylated LRP6 cytoplasmic tails (and other GSK3 substrates such as Axin, APC, β-Catenin, and Dvl) to become sequestered from its cytosolic substrates by two layers of membrane (see model in Figure 7), effectively inhibiting its activity. In this study, we tested the GSK3 sequestration hypothesis of Wnt signaling. Fluorescence microscopy showed that Wnt signaling caused the relocalization of cytoplasmic GSK3 to vesicles that colocalized with endocytosed xWnt8-Venus protein, and with the MVB and lysosomal markers Rab7 and LysoTracker. Wnt signal transduction was blocked by depletion of Hrs/Vps27 or expression of dominant-negative Vps4, two proteins essential for intralumenal vesicle formation in MVBs (Katzmann et al., 2002Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Receptor downregulation and multivesicular-body sorting.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, Wollert and Hurley, 2010Wollert T. Hurley J.H. Molecular mechanism of multivesicular body biogenesis by ESCRT complexes.Nature. 2010; 464: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Moreover, Wnt treatment decreased cytosolic GSK3 activity levels (measured in Digitonin-permeabilized cells), yet full enzyme activity was recovered after solubilization of all membranes with Triton X-100. Similarly, Wnt caused endogenous GSK3β to become partially protected from Proteinase K digestion, but only in the absence of Triton X-100. Finally, cryoimmunoelectron microscopy showed that GSK3 was indeed translocated from the cytosol into MVBs after Wnt pathway activation. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that 20% of the human proteome contains multiple putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites. Total protein half-life was extended by Wnt treatment or GSK3 inhibition. The addition of GSK3 phosphorylation sites was sufficient to place the stability of a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) biosensor under the control of Wnt. We conclude that canonical Wnt signaling sequesters GSK3 inside MVBs, reducing its cytosolic levels and extending the half-life of many GSK3 substrates. We first asked whether Wnt treatment changed the subcellular localization of GSK3. Human 293T cells expressing xWnt8-Venus (Mii and Taira, 2009Mii Y. Taira M. Secreted Frizzled-related proteins enhance the diffusion of Wnt ligands and expand their signaling range.Development. 2009; 136: 4083-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were cultured together with mouse 3T3 cells transfected with GSK3-RFP. Remarkably, endocytosed Wnt-Venus and GSK3-RFP accumulated in the same vesicular structures (arrows in Figure 1F ), while GSK3-RFP levels decreased in the cytosol (Figures 1A–1F). Relocalization of endogenous GSK3β was also observed in these cocultures (Figures S1A–S1C available online). Wnt-Venus puncta were counted in each responding cell (n = 80), and 56% ± 9% of them colocalized with GSK3-RFP puncta (see histogram in Figure 1C′). Thus, cytosolic GSK3 decreases and becomes relocalized to the same endosomes as the internalized Wnt ligand.Figure S1Wnt8-Venus or CA-LRP6 Sequester GSK3 in Dynamin-Dependent Signalosomes; GSK3 Mutated in Its Axin-Binding Site Can Accumulate in MVBs, but Catalytically Inactive DN-GSK3 Does not, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Control 3T3 cells (minus Wnt) stained with an anti-GSK3β antibody.(B) Coculture with 293T secreting Wnt8-Venus caused the relocalization of endogenous GSK3β in 3T3 cells that endocytosed Wnt.

Transfection of constitutively active LRP6 lacking its extracellular domain, designated CA-LRP6, causes a potent Wnt signal (Tamai et al., 2004Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. A mechanism for Wnt coreceptor activation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) . CA-LRP6 cytoplasmic signalosome formation (Bilic et al., 2007Bilic J. Huang Y.L. Davidson G. Zimmermann T. Cruciat C.M. Bienz M. Niehrs C. Wnt induces LRP6 Signalosomes and promotes Dishevelled-dependent LRP6 phosphorylation.Science. 2007; 316: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) required Dynamin and caused a striking relocalization of GSK3β from the cytosol into prominent cytoplasmic puncta (Figures 1G–1L′ and Figures S1D–S1O). Treatment of 3T3 cells with LysoTracker, a dye that becomes concentrated in acidic organelles such as MVBs and lysosomes, showed that endogenous GSK3β relocated to these compartments (Figure 1G–1L′). In addition, GSK3β colocalized with Dvl, Axin, and LysoTracker, as well as the PI3P probe FYVE-GFP, when Wnt signaling was activated by overexpression of Dvl (Figures S2A–S2O). Remarkably, a protein consisting of the DIX domain of Dvl fused to the LRP6 cytoplasmic tail (DIX > Ctail-GFP), which triggers a very strong Wnt signal (Metcalfe et al., 2010Metcalfe C. Mendoza-Topaz C. Mieszczanek J. Bienz M. Stability elements in the LRP6 cytoplasmic tail confer efficient signalling upon DIX-dependent polymerization.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 1588-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), also formed signalosomes colocalizing with acidic vesicles that sequestered cytosolic GSK3β (Figures S2P–S2Aa). CA-LRP6 signalosomes colocalized with the late endosomal marker Rab7-GFP (Figures 1M–1R) in 62% ± 7% of the GSK3 puncta, indicating that GSK3-RFP relocated to MVBs or lysosomes (Bucci et al., 2000Bucci C. Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Rab7: a key to lysosomes biogenesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). About 40% of GSK3-RFP vesicles colocalized with Vps4-GFP (see Figures 3L–3N′), a marker of the final stages of intralumenal vesicle formation in endosomes (Bishop and Woodman, 2000Bishop N. Woodman P. ATPase-defective mammalian VPS4 localizes to aberrant endosomes and impairs cholesterol trafficking.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, Gruenberg and Stenmark, 2004Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. The biogenesis of multivesicular endosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In untransfected 3T3 cells the number and size of endogenous GSK3β puncta increased after treatment with Wnt3a conditioned medium (Figures 1S–1U) in cells permeabilized with Digitonin (which facilitates the visualization of intracellular organelles; Bishop and Woodman, 2000Bishop N. Woodman P. ATPase-defective mammalian VPS4 localizes to aberrant endosomes and impairs cholesterol trafficking.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that Wnt signaling causes the relocalization of cytosolic GSK3 to the endosomal compartment. To determine whether Wnt3a treatment sequesters GSK3 kinase activity from cytosol, endogenous cytosolic kinase activity was measured in untransfected L cells permeabilized with Digitonin through the incorporation of phosphate from [γ32P]-ATP into a phospho-glycogen synthase peptide substrate (Ryves et al., 1998Ryves W.J. Fryer L. Dale T. Harwood A.J. An assay for glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) for use in crude cell extracts.Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Digitonin solubilizes cholesterol-rich patches in the plasma membrane, leaving MVBs and other intracellular organelles intact (Dunn and Holz, 1983Dunn L.A. Holz R.W. Catecholamine secretion from digitonin-treated adrenal medullary chromaffin cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4989-4993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of Wnt3a for 4 hr decreased cytosolic GSK3 activity levels by 66% ± 5% (Figure 2A , lanes 1 and 2), and the missing GSK3 activity was recovered when all membranes were dissolved with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Figure 2A, compare lanes 2 and 4). The gold standard to determine the localization of a protein inside a membrane-bounded compartment is the protease protection assay. GSK3 protein became protected from Proteinase K digestion (Vanlandingham and Ceresa, 2009Vanlandingham P.A. Ceresa B.P. Rab7 regulates late endocytic trafficking downstream of multivesicular body biogenesis and cargo sequestration.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12110-12124Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) after Wnt3a treatment (Figure 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4) in untransfected L cells permeabilized with Digitonin. This Wnt-dependent protease protection of GSK3 was eliminated when membranes were solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Figure 2B, lanes 4 and 6). As a negative control, we used α-tubulin, which is not contained in vesicular organelles and was not protected from Proteinase K digestion (Figure 2B). These experiments strongly suggest that GSK3 becomes sequestered within membrane-bounded organelles upon Wnt treatment. The relocalization of GSK3 to multivesicular endosomes in Wnt3a-treated cells was visualized by cryoimmunoelectron microscopy. In untransfected 3T3 cells treated with control conditioned medium, endogenous GSK3β was found almost exclusively in the cytosol, whereas in Wnt3a-treated cells a substantial fraction was found inside MVBs (Figures 2C and 2D). In HeLa cells cotransfected with CA-LRP6 and GSK3-GFP, an anti-GFP antibody revealed colloidal Gold particles in MVBs (Figure 2E). In some cases Gold particles were observed on the cytoplasmic surface of vesicles fusing with multivesicular endosomes (Figure 2F), as well as within the small vesicles that fill MVBs (arrows with asterisks in Figure 2F), supporting the topology shown in Figure 7. In the absence of CA-LRP6, Gold-labeled GSK3-GFP was located in the cytosol (Figure 2G). To confirm the cryoimmuno localization results in a quantitative way, we resorted to an activated mutant of Rab5. Rab5-Q79L causes the formation of giant multivesicular endosomes containing large numbers of intralumenal vesicles (Wegener et al., 2010Wegener C.S. Malerod L. Pedersen N.M. Prodiga C. Bakke O. Stenmark H. Brech A. Ultrastructural characterization of giant endosomes induced by GTPase-deficient Rab5.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 133: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These MVBs are so large that the outer membrane (outlined by Rab5-QL-DsRed) can be readily distinguished from its internal contents by light microscopy. As shown in Figures 2H–2M, GSK3β translocated from the cytoplasm into the interior of Rab5-QL multivesicular endosomes (arrows, 77% ± 9% colocalization) when CA-LRP6 was coexpressed, but not in its absence. Cytosolic depletion of GSK3-GFP was very clear (compare Figures 2J and 2M). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the GSK3 enzyme becomes translocated from the cytosol into membrane-bounded multivesicular endosomes when Wnt signals. The molecular machinery that forms endosomal intralumenal vesicles has been well characterized (Wollert and Hurley, 2010Wollert T. Hurley J.H. Molecular mechanism of multivesicular body biogenesis by ESCRT complexes.Nature. 2010; 464: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Several endosomal sorting complexes required for transport, or ESCRTs, have been identified through yeast genetics (designated Vacuolar Protein Sorting, Vps, mutants) and biochemistry (Katzmann et al., 2002Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Receptor downregulation and multivesicular-body sorting.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). The GSK3 sequestration hypothesis predicts that ESCRT proteins essential for vesicle invagination should be required for Wnt signaling. Therefore, we tested two ESCRT proteins essential for vesicle formation (Figure 3A). HRS/Vps27 (hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine-kinase substrate) initiates formation of the ESCRT-0 complex. Depletion of HRS by siRNA blocked the accumulation of β-Catenin observed after 2 hr of Wnt3a treatment in 293T cells, whereas control scrambled siRNA had no effect (Figure 3B, lanes 1–4). Total GSK3 levels increased by about 70% when HRS was depleted (Figure 3B compare lanes 1 and 3, three independent experiments; see also Figure S3), suggesting that GSK3 is normally partially degraded by the endosomal machinery; however, Wnt addition did not significantly change GSK3 levels in these experiments. We were expecting a decrease in total GSK3 levels in western blots because MVBs are usually targeted to the lysosome and degradation. Many reasons might explain this result. For example GSK3 may have a long half-life, it may be replenished by translational regulation, or GSK3 may have a long time of residency in MVBs induced by Wnt signaling before lysosomal degradation takes place (Wnt might even affect the rate of MVB processing globally). In addition there is recent evidence that intralumenal MVB vesicles may be recycled back into the cytosol by “back-fusion” to the late endosome-limiting membrane (Falguieres et al., 2009Falguieres T. Luyet P. Gruenberg J. Molecular assemblies and membrane domains in multivesicular endosome dynamics.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 1567-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of change in total levels, the relocation of GSK3 from the cytosol into MVBs is clearly documented in the figures above, providing the basis for the sequestration model for Wnt signaling presented in Figure 7. The requirement of HRS for Wnt signal transduction was demonstrated directly in these cultures by measuring the expression of the SuperTopFlash-Luciferase reporter, which contains multiple TCF-binding sites (Figure 3C, brackets). In addition we observed that relocalization of GSK3 into vesicle-like structures in CA-LRP6 transfected cells was blocked by HRS siRNA and was not affected by control scrambled siRNA (Figures 3D–3E′). In animal cap explants the activation of TCF-Luciferase by CA-LRP6 mRNA was blocked by HRS antisense morpholino (Figure 3F, brackets). In Xenopus embryos, injection of CA-LRP6 mRNA into a single ventral blastomere at the eight-cell stage caused complete axis duplications, which were eliminated by coinjection of HRS MO (Figures 3G–3I and Figure S4N ). HRS depletion did not affect cell viability or proliferation until neurula stage (Figures S4A–S4M). The effects of HRS MO could be partially rescued by human HRS mRNA (Figures 4C and 4O ).Figure 4β-Catenin Is Required for GSK3 Localization in Multivesicular EndosomesShow full caption(A and B) β-Catenin siRNA inhibited GSK3β relocalization in CA-LRP6 signalosomes (in 86% ± 7% of transfected HeLa cells, n = 300).(C) HRS MO blocks the induction of TCF reporter expression (brackets) by β-Catenin mRNA (four injections of 80 pg) in Xenopus animal cap explants, and this was partially rescued by human HRS mRNA.(D–F′) Endogenous phospho-β-Catenin"

This holds true for physiological stimuli, such as exercise, as well as for pathological provocations, including hypertension. Though the earliest stages appear quite similar at a morphological level, pathological cardiac hypertrophy leads to cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and arrhythmia, whereas physiological hypertrophy does not. Thus, understanding the mechanistic distinction between these two types of cardiac growth has very important clinical implications. Numerous prior reports document transcription factors involved in pathological hypertrophy (Akazawa and Komuro, 2003Akazawa H. Komuro I. Roles of cardiac transcription factors in cardiac hypertrophy.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Frey and Olson, 2003Frey N. Olson E.N. Cardiac hypertrophy: the good, the bad, and the ugly.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 45-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), but relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling physiological hypertrophy. Cardiomyocytes in adult mammals retain a limited ability to proliferate in response to specific stimuli (Bergmann et al., 2009Bergmann O. Bhardwaj R.D. Bernard S. Zdunek S. Barnabé-Heider F. Walsh S.

Res. 2010; 107: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This has potential importance because cardiomyocyte proliferation could serve as a basis for regeneration of an injured heart if it could be enhanced and harnessed. However, whether this process can be modulated through physiological interventions remains unclear. Moreover, whereas recent studies have implicated some signal transduction pathways involved in adult cardiomyocyte proliferation (Bersell et al., 2009Bersell K. Arab S. Haring B. Kühn B. Neuregulin1/ErbB4 signaling induces cardiomyocyte proliferation and repair of heart injury.Cell. 2009; 138: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), little is known about the detailed molecular mechanisms and particularly the transcriptional components that are decisive in this process. Furthermore, there is little data available on factors that control cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult heart. One of few known regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation is Gata4, which was recently reported to mark proliferative cells during cardiac regeneration in the zebrafish (Kikuchi et al., 2010Kikuchi K. Holdway J.E. Werdich A.A. Anderson R.M. Fang Y. Egnaczyk G.F. Evans T. Macrae C.A. Stainier D.Y. Poss K.D. Primary contribution to zebrafish heart regeneration by gata4(+) cardiomyocytes.Nature. 2010; 464: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). This factor is also a well-known regulator of cardiomyocyte differentiation in adult hypertrophy, together with SRF, Nkx2.5, Tbx5, and Gata6 (Akazawa and Komuro, 2003Akazawa H. Komuro I. Roles of cardiac transcription factors in cardiac hypertrophy.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Here, we studied a murine model of physiological hypertrophy induced by endurance exercise, using a method termed Quanttrx, which we recently developed for genome-wide, quantitative measurement of the expression of all transcriptional components (Gupta et al., 2010Gupta R.K. Arany Z. Seale P. Mepani R.J. Ye L. Conroe H.M. Roby Y.A. Kulaga H. Reed R.R. Spiegelman B.M. Transcriptional control of preadipocyte determination by Zfp423.Nature. 2010; 464: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The database underlying this method includes all known transcription factors, transcriptional coregulatory proteins, and all proteins that contain a motif that has been associated with transcriptional components, whether their function is known or not. We report here that endurance exercise effected a hypertrophic and proliferative program in cardiomyocytes, which was dependent on a reduction in the expression of the transcription factor C/EBPβ, and a linked increase in the expression of CITED4. Furthermore, mice with genetically reduced C/EBPβ levels recapitulated many of the cardiac phenotypes seen in exercised mice. Importantly, mice with reduced C/EBPβ were resistant to the development of cardiac dysfunction in response to pressure overload on the heart. To study transcriptional regulators of physiological cardiac hypertrophy, a ramp swimming exercise model was used (Taniike et al., 2008Taniike M. Yamaguchi O. Tsujimoto I. Hikoso S. Takeda T. Nakai A. Omiya S. Mizote I. Nakano Y. Higuchi Y. et al.Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/p38 signaling pathway negatively regulates physiological hypertrophy.Circulation. 2008; 117: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure S1 (available online), mild cardiac hypertrophy was induced without alterations in the expression of pathological gene markers such as ANP and BNP. There was also a 45% increase in cardiomyocyte cell size (Figure S1) without any detectable difference in fibrosis or angiogenesis (Figure S1). Hence, we may conclude that healthy physiological cardiac hypertrophy occurred in these animals. Further characterization revealed that expression of the cell proliferation marker PCNA was increased in the hearts from exercised mice (Figure 1A ). To establish the cellular origin of the increased proliferation markers, confocal microscopy was employed in cardiac tissue stained for both the cardiomyocyte-selective protein α-actinin and the proliferation marker ki67. Robust ki67 staining was seen in 1%–5% of cardiomyocytes (Figure 1B). Importantly, there was a significant increase in cardiomyocyte ki67 staining in the exercised mice compared to the nonexercised controls, as judged from blinded analyses of histological sections using digital software. The more specific mitosis marker, phospho-Histone3 (pH3), was also elevated (Figure 1C), though the absolute number of positive cells was relatively low. Figure S1 shows pH3-positive cardiomyocytes in the different stages of mitosis. Thus, markers of both cell size and proliferation are elevated in the cardiomyocytes of mice in this model of physiological hypertrophy. Previous studies have utilized the density of cardiomyocyte nuclei as an indicator of cardiomyocyte proliferation (Bersell et al., 2009Bersell K. Arab S. Haring B. Kühn B. Neuregulin1/ErbB4 signaling induces cardiomyocyte proliferation and repair of heart injury.Cell. 2009; 138: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). We could detect a small increase in nuclear density (100% and 132% in controls versus exercised mice, respectively; p = 0.07), but this did not reach statistical significance. However, it is worth noting that the observed increase in cardiomyocyte size would be expected to confound/dilute the calculated changes in nuclear density. DNA biosynthesis was therefore assayed using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injections in mice undergoing this exercise protocol. We could detect double-α-actinin and BrdU-positive cardiomyocytes at a frequency of 1%–6% in exercised mice. Figure 1D shows a substantial increase in BrdU-positive cardiomyocytes in the hearts of exercised mice compared to the controls. Importantly, Z stack visualization of positive cells clearly demonstrates a distinct cardiomyocyte localization of the BrdU (Figure S1). Finally, staining for the cytokinesis marker Aurora B kinase was used to demonstrate that the exercise protocol did indeed promote completed cardiomyocyte cell division (Figure 1E). Conversely, we could not detect any of these changes in proliferation markers in a murine model of pathological hypertrophy (data not shown). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that adult cardiomyocytes increase in both size and proliferation rate in response to this form of endurance exercise. To investigate the transcriptional basis of physiological cardiac hypertrophy, we utilized Quanttrx, a qPCR-based screen that we recently developed against all known and predicted transcriptional components (Gupta et al., 2010Gupta R.K. Arany Z. Seale P. Mepani R.J. Ye L. Conroe H.M. Roby Y.A. Kulaga H. Reed R.R. Spiegelman B.M. Transcriptional control of preadipocyte determination by Zfp423.Nature. 2010; 464: 619-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We used cardiac samples from the mice characterized (above) together with cardiac samples from mice subjected to transaortic constriction (TAC) for 2 weeks. As shown in Figure S1, the TAC procedure induced a similar degree of hypertrophy as seen in the exercised animals but with elevation of ANP/BNP, thus indicating pathological hypertrophy. There were no signs of heart failure or other pathological changes in the mice subjected to TAC at this time point. The Quanttrx screen identified 175 genes significantly regulated in the exercise model and 96 in the pathological (TAC) model (Table S1 and Table S2). Importantly, there was little overlap in the expression profile between the two models. In fact, there was a significant, negative correlation between the changes induced in the respective model (Figure S2; r = −0.32; p < 0.001). Thus, these models of pathological and physiological hypertrophy express distinct programs of transcriptional components. Of the 175 transcription factors regulated by physiological hypertrophy, 47 (27%) had no known function (no PubMed annotation). However, 10 transcription factors with known functions in cardiac differentiation and/or adult hypertrophy were differentially regulated in the swim model. These included well-known genes such as Nkx2.5, Gata4, Tbx5, Mef2c, and Gata6. Furthermore, 13% of the differentially expressed factors had known or suggested roles in cellular proliferation. Less than 1% of the genes regulated in the pathological model had any known role in cellular proliferation. Based on the magnitude of expression changes and absolute cardiac expression, we chose 30 genes out of this preliminary list of 272 and performed qPCR analyses in completely new samples of either physiological (endurance exercise) or pathological (TAC) hypertrophy. Eight out of these 30 showed robust validation (Figure S2 and Figure 2A ), and these were further analyzed for cardiomyocyte-specific expression. Figure S2 shows expression of these genes in cardiomyocytes and noncardiomyocytes after density gradient separation. Five out of eight were expressed primarily in the cardiomyocyte fraction, and these were subsequently analyzed using adenoviral-mediated forced expression and/or siRNA-mediated knockdown, using changes in cell size of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes as our endpoint. Gbx2, Cited4, Mlx, and Meox1 failed to demonstrate any effect on cardiomyocyte sizes (Figure S2), but reduction of C/EBPβ caused a clear increase in cell size (Figure 3A ).Figure 3Reduction of C/EBPβ in Primary Cardiomyocytes Results in Hypertrophic Cell Growth and ProliferationShow full captionPrimary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes treated with either a C/EBPβ siRNA or a C/EBPβ-expressing adenovirus with respective controls.

C/EBPβ is a member of the bHLH gene family of DNA-binding transcription factors and has known roles in cell proliferation and differentiation in other tissues (Sebastian and Johnson, 2006Sebastian T. Johnson P.F. Stop and go: anti-proliferative and mitogenic functions of the transcription factor C/EBPbeta.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 953-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), including adipose cells and liver. However, it has not been studied in the context of the cardiomyocyte. C/EBPβ mRNA expression was reduced by 61% in hearts in the exercise model when assayed in new samples, but this effect was not observed in a model of pathological hypertrophy using transverse banding (TAC) performed in parallel (Figure 2A). Downregulation of C/EBPβ was also seen in response to the exercise training at the protein level (Figure 2B). Expression of the short LIP C/EBPβ isoform that is inhibitory toward C/EBPβ function was undetectable in these cardiac samples (Figure 2B). Confocal microscopy illustrated that it was indeed cardiomyocyte-specific expression of C/EBPβ that was reduced with exercise (Figure 2C). Consistent with this, C/EBPβ expression was enriched in the cardiomyocyte fraction, versus noncardiomyocyte cells, following gradient purification of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (Figure 2D and Figure S2). Two additional mouse models of exercise were tested for effects on C/EBPβ expression: acute and low-intensity treadmill running. Neither treatment resulted in cardiac hypertrophy (data not shown), but reduction of C/EBPβ expression occurred in the acute setting (40 min of treadmill running), as seen in Figure 2E. Thus, C/EBPβ expression is reduced relatively early in endurance exercise. The functional consequences of experimental reduction of C/EBPβ were assessed in detail in primary rat cardiomyocytes. An siRNA was used to reduce C/EBPβ levels to approximately the levels of mRNA observed after endurance exercise (43%) (Figure S3). As demonstrated in Figures 3A and 3B, the forced decrease in C/EBPβ mRNA was sufficient to drive an increase in cell size and in the rate of protein biosynthesis. No statistically significant change in cell size or protein biosynthesis was seen with forced C/EBPβ expression (p = 0.42 and p = 0.054, respectively). The reduction of C/EBPβ expression was also sufficient to ablate the increase in ANP levels seen with pathological provocation (Figure S3). Interestingly, the C/EBPβ reduction via siRNA also led to an increase in cell number (Figure 3C). This was accompanied by increased PCNA expression and increased BrdU incorporation into DNA, highly suggestive of cardiomyocyte proliferation (Figures 3D and 3E). These data indicate that a reduction in C/EBPβ expression is sufficient to induce hypertrophy and proliferation in cultured cardiomyocytes. The initial Quanttrx screen revealed a specific set of regulated genes with known functions in cardiomyocyte differentiation and hypertrophy (Figure 4A and Table S1). Examples of such genes were Gata4, Tbx5, and Nkx2.5, which all induce hypertrophy (Akazawa and Komuro, 2003Akazawa H. Komuro I. Roles of cardiac transcription factors in cardiac hypertrophy.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Beyond these 11 genes, we also investigated expression levels of the genes that are well known to be altered in cardiac hypertrophy or differentiation, including α-MHC, TnI, and TnT, which were all upregulated in the hearts of exercised mice (Figure 4A). The transcriptional coregulator PGC-1α has previously been demonstrated to have an important role in preventing cardiac dysfunction after the development of hypertrophy (Arany et al., 2006Arany Z. Novikov M. Chin S. Ma Y. Rosenzweig A. Spiegelman B.M. Transverse aortic constriction leads to accelerated heart failure in mice lacking PPAR-gamma coactivator 1alpha.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10086-10091Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and exercised mice indeed displayed increased cardiac expression levels of PGC-1α together with its downstream targets VEGF, Ndufs1, Ndufv2, and ATP5o (Figure 4A). Thus, by combining the Quanttrx screen hits with markers of hypertrophy and the PGC-1α, as well as its downstream targets, we defined an exercise-induced gene set of 19 genes (Figure 4A). The changes in mRNA expression for Nkx2.5, Tbx5, Mef2c, Gata4, and PGC-1α following TAC surgery are shown in Figure S4.Figure S4AKT Overexpression In Vitro and Its Effect on C/EBPβ and Target Genes, Related to Figure 4Show full captionExpression levels of exercise-induced genes after TAC surgery.

Error bars represent standard error of mean. As shown in Figure 4B, reduction in C/EBPβ levels in primary cardiomyocytes resulted in a strikingly similar expression pattern. In fact, 11/19 of these genes were regulated in the same manner as in the exercise model (p < 0.001 using chi-square statistics). Furthermore, adenoviral expression of C/EBPβ induced essentially the reverse expression pattern (Figure S4). These data strongly suggest that C/EBPβ acts upstream of other transcriptional components that are also regulated in physiological hypertrophy. Especially interesting was the C/EBPβ-dependent regulation of Gata4, which has recently been demonstrated to play a major role in zebrafish cardiomyocyte proliferation during myocardial regeneration (Kikuchi et al., 2010Kikuchi K. Holdway J.E. Werdich A.A. Anderson R.M. Fang Y. Egnaczyk G.F. Evans T. Macrae C.A. Stainier D.Y. Poss K.D. Primary contribution to zebrafish heart regeneration by gata4(+) cardiomyocytes.Nature. 2010; 464: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Many of the genes regulated by both endurance exercise and the siRNA-mediated C/EBPβ reduction are known to be transcriptional targets of the transcription factor SRF, with SRE elements in their promoters (Akazawa and Komuro, 2003Akazawa H. Komuro I. Roles of cardiac transcription factors in cardiac hypertrophy.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ has been demonstrated to physically interact with SRF (Hanlon and Sealy, 1999Hanlon M. Sealy L. Ras regulates the association of serum response factor and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14224-14228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but the functional consequences of this interaction are not clear, especially in cardiomyocytes in which the role of C/EBPβ is unknown. Previous reports on the C/EBPβ-SRF interaction have suggested a positive effect on SRE-dependent elements, but the increased expression levels of Gata4 and α-MHC (Figure 4A) following C/EBPβ siRNA here suggested a negative regulation of SRE-dependent genes in cardiomyocytes. A physical interaction between the SRF and C/EBPβ proteins was indeed observed using coimmunoprecipitation from primary cardiomyocytes (Figure 4C). Next, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed, examining the binding of SRF to the Gata4 and α-MHC promoters following gain and loss of the C/EBPβ protein. As shown in Figure 4D, CEBPβ reduction using siRNA dramatically increased SRF binding to the promoters of both α-MHC and Gata4, in which SRF is known to play a positive regulatory role. Conversely, adenoviral expression of C/EBPβ reduced SRF binding to these promoters. Thus, C/EBPβ interferes with SRF binding to the promoters of critical cardiac genes (Figure 4E). The recent discovery of the ErbB4 pathway in cardiomyocyte proliferation led us to investigate whether C/EBPβ could be affected by such signaling. This was especially interesting as ErbB4 signals via AKT1, a kinase known to function in physiological hypertrophy (DeBosch et al., 2006DeBosch B. Treskov I. Lupu T.S. Weinheimer C. Kovacs A. Courtois M. Muslin A.J. Akt1 is required for physiological cardiac growth.Circulation. 2006; 113: 2097-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the connection of this pathway to C/EBPβ using both forced expression of wild-type AKT1 and a dominant-negative AKT1 (Nagoshi et al., 2005Nagoshi T. Matsui T. Aoyama T. Leri A. Anversa P. Li L. Ogawa W. del Monte F. Gwathmey J.K. Grazette L. et al.PI3K rescues the detrimental effects of chronic Akt activation in the heart during ischemia/reperfusion injury.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2128-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Figure S4, increasing AKT1 activity did indeed reduce C/EBPβ expression levels together with an expression profile resembling what was observed with exercise with increased expression of Tbx5, Gata4, TnI, and α-MHC. Conversely, the dominant-negative AKT1 mutant increased C/EBPβ in parallel with decreased mRNA levels of Tbx5, Gata4, TnI, TnT, and α-MHC. We could thus conclude that AKT1 activity evokes the same gene expression profile as seen in exercise. We next used C/EBPβ adenovirus together with AKT1 overexpression to establish whether C/EBPβ indeed act downstream on AKT1 in the regulation of these target genes. As demonstrated in Figure S4, C/EBPβ overexpression ablated the positive expression effects of AKT1 on Tbx5, Gata4, TnI, TnT, and α-MHC. Taken together, these data suggest that AKT1 regulates C/EBPβ expression, connecting C/EBPβ to a previously characterized physiological growth pathway in the heart. The SRF-dependent gene set described above includes well-known regulators of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but apart from Gata4, they are not known to participate in a proliferative phenotype, such as we see with C/EBPβ reduction. We thus analyzed the list of exercise-induced cardiac genes (Figure S2) for those controlled by C/EBPβ that might influence or control cardiomyocyte proliferation. Preliminary studies using gain and loss of function for six factors apparently downstream of CEBPβ led us to focus on CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich carboxy-terminal domain 4 (CITED4). Indeed, CITED4 showed a robust increase in exercised hearts (Figure 5A ), and its expression level was markedly altered with C/EBPβ gain or loss of function in vitro (Figure 5B). Strikingly, forced CITED4 expression (Figure S5) increased cardiomyocyte cell numbers together with an increased percentage of ki67-positive cells (Figures 5C and 5D). Conversely, siRNA directed against CITED4 (Figure S5C) reduced both cell numbers and ki67 staining (Figures 5C and 5D). Gene expression analysis also revealed a gene set of proproliferative genes increased in endurance exercise (Figure S5), in which the important cell cycle/proliferation factors CyclinD1 and n-myc also displayed increased expression with forced CITED4 expression together with SRF (Figure S5). To investigate the functional relationship between C/EBPβ and CITED4, we used siRNA directed against CITED4 together with C/EBPβ siRNA. As shown in Figure 5E, CITED4 knockdown could completely abolish the effect of cellular proliferation seen with the C/EBPβ reduction. Thus, C/EBPβ is likely to mediate its antiproliferative effects, at least in part, via CITED4 expression. We next tested the role of C/EBPβ reduction in zebrafish, a simple and experimentally accessible in vivo system. Anti-C/EBPβ morpholino oligonucleotides were injected into zebrafish embryos transgenic for cmlc2-GFP at the one-cell stage (Figure 6A ). Figure 6B shows zebrafish hearts dissected at 36 hr and stained for nuclei (DAPI, blue) and plasma membrane (integrin, red).

Peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis is controlled from outside the sacculus by LpoA and LpoB Each regulator is specific to one PG synthase in E. coli and vital for its function Each regulator stimulates the transpeptidation activity of its cognate PG synthase Each regulator has coevolved with a docking domain in its cognate PG synthase The stress-bearing peptidoglycan (PG) sacculus is essential for maintaining the shape and osmotic stability of almost all bacteria, and its biosynthetic machinery is one of the most common targets of numerous antibiotics (Vollmer et al., 2008aVollmer W. Blanot D. de Pedro M.A. Peptidoglycan structure and architecture.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). The net-like sacculus is made of glycan strands crosslinked by short peptides and forms a continuous layer surrounding the inner membrane (IM). Gram-positive bacteria have a multilayered sacculus with covalently attached anionic cell wall polymers and cell surface proteins. In Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, the predominantly single-layered sacculus is firmly connected to the outer membrane (OM) by covalent and noncovalent interactions with various OM proteins. Enlarging this thin sacculus is a highly dynamic but poorly understood process. The PG layer must maintain structural integrity during a growth process that involves insertion/attachment of new glycan strands/patches and concomitant release of old material, also known as PG turnover (Park and Uehara, 2008Park J.T. Uehara T. How bacteria consume their own exoskeletons (turnover and recycling of cell wall peptidoglycan).Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 211-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Additionally, PG synthesis and turnover must be spatially controlled to maintain cell shape and temporally coordinated with the synthesis of other cell envelope layers for a successful cell cycle. To generate and maintain proper morphology, rod-shaped bacteria engage in at least two different modes of PG synthesis (Vollmer and Bertsche, 2008Vollmer W. Bertsche U. Murein (peptidoglycan) structure, architecture and biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1714-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Small, newly divided cells exhibit a constant diameter and undertake an “elongation” mode of PG synthesis that increases the length of the lateral wall of the cell. As the cells grow longer, PG synthesis concentrates at midcell, eventually switching to a “constrictive” mode that allows cell division. Bacterial cytoskeletal proteins guide each of these processes (Shih and Rothfield, 2006Shih Y.L. Rothfield L. The bacterial cytoskeleton.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 729-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The bacterial actin homolog MreB is essential for elongation in many rod-shaped bacteria. Assisted by scaffolding and anchoring proteins (MreC, MreD, RodZ, and RodA), MreB forms a membrane-associated helical filament that positions and/or controls PG “elongasome” complexes along the sidewall to facilitate dispersive PG synthesis (Daniel and Errington, 2003Daniel R.A. Errington J. Control of cell morphogenesis in bacteria: two distinct ways to make a rod-shaped cell.Cell. 2003; 113: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The bacterial structural homolog of tubulin, FtsZ, is required for PG synthesis at the septum. FtsZ forms a ring structure at midcell. The “Z ring” recruits 12 or more additional cell division proteins to form the dynamic, IM-localized divisome, which governs the synthesis of the two new poles of the daughter cells during cell division (Adams and Errington, 2009Adams D.W. Errington J. Bacterial cell division: assembly, maintenance and disassembly of the Z ring.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). FtsZ also drives a preseptal phase of cell elongation at midcell (Aaron et al., 2007Aaron M. Charbon G. Lam H. Schwarz H. Vollmer W. Jacobs-Wagner C. The tubulin homologue FtsZ contributes to cell elongation by guiding cell wall precursor synthesis in Caulobacter crescentus.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 938-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, de Pedro et al., 1997de Pedro M.A. Quintela J.C. Höltje J.-V. Schwarz H. Murein segregation in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2823-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). MreB and FtsZ and their associated proteins nucleate an assemblage of IM-localized or -associated enzymes that make the PG building block and control PG synthesis. There is some specialization of the localization of PG synthases in E. coli (Vollmer and Bertsche, 2008Vollmer W. Bertsche U. Murein (peptidoglycan) structure, architecture and biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1714-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The essential PBP2 and PBP3 transpeptidases (TPases) are localized, respectively, at MreB or FtsZ sites. PBP1B, one of the two major bifunctional glycosyltransferases (GTase)-TPases (class A PBPs) is recruited to the divisome (Bertsche et al., 2006Bertsche U. Kast T. Wolf B. Fraipont C. Aarsman M.E. Kannenberg K. von Rechenberg M. Nguyen-Distèche M. den Blaauwen T. Höltje J.-V. Vollmer W. Interaction between two murein (peptidoglycan) synthases, PBP3 and PBP1B, in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas PBP1A has a preference for the sidewall of elongating cells (M.B., B.v.d.B.v.S., J.V., T.d.B., and W.V., unpublished data). However, PBP1A and PBP1B can substitute for each other, indicating that specificity is not complete (Yousif et al., 1985Yousif S.Y. Broome-Smith J.K. Spratt B.G. Lysis of Escherichia coli by beta-lactam antibiotics: deletion analysis of the role of penicillin-binding proteins 1A and 1B.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 2839-2845PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to many redundant synthases, bacteria also possess a large suite of PG hydrolases (amidases, endopeptidases, lytic tranglycosylases, and carboxypeptidases; Vollmer et al., 2008bVollmer W. Joris B. Charlier P. Foster S. Bacterial peptidoglycan (murein) hydrolases.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Some of these PG hydrolases, as well as their newly identified activators, have been reported to localize at division sites in E. coli (Uehara et al., 2010Uehara T. Parzych K.R. Dinh T. Bernhardt T.G. Daughter cell separation is controlled by cytokinetic ring-activated cell wall hydrolysis.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1412-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and it is likely that other hydrolases are present at MreB elongation sites, as is LytE in B. subtilis (Carballido-López et al., 2006Carballido-López R. Formstone A. Li Y. Ehrlich S.D. Noirot P. Errington J. Actin homolog MreBH governs cell morphogenesis by localization of the cell wall hydrolase LytE.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that OM-anchored hydrolases form multienzyme complexes with IM-localized synthases to spatiotemporally coordinate their actions and provide safe enlargement of the sacculus and cell septation (Höltje, 1998Höltje J.-V. Growth of the stress-bearing and shape-maintaining murein sacculus of Escherichia coli.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model is supported by several interactions detected between PG enzymes (summarized in Vollmer and Bertsche, 2008Vollmer W. Bertsche U. Murein (peptidoglycan) structure, architecture and biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1714-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), but direct evidence for such complexes is still missing. Gram-negative bacteria must also coordinate OM invagination with septal cleavage. Long thought to be a passive consequence of constriction, current work suggests that the five-member Tol-Pal complex may facilitate OM invagination by a repeated sequence of events that first tether and then release OM to PG and OM to IM (Gerding et al., 2007Gerding M.A. Ogata Y. Pecora N.D. Niki H. de Boer P.A. The trans-envelope Tol-Pal complex is part of the cell division machinery and required for proper outer-membrane invagination during cell constriction in E. coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 1008-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). As Tol-Pal is not essential, other systems may also facilitate OM invagination. The overall emerging picture is that PG synthesis is controlled both spatially and functionally by cytoskeletal elements from the inside of the cell, whereas hydrolysis is controlled from outside of the sacculus. Our work challenges that view for Gram-negative bacteria. We identified two OM lipoproteins, LpoA and LpoB, which are absolutely required for the in vivo function of PBP1A and PBP1B, respectively. Each Lpo protein interacts specifically with its cognate PG synthase and stimulates its TPase in vitro. LpoB, like PBP1B, is recruited to the divisome but also to the lateral wall, whereas LpoA concentrates more at the sidewall of elongating cells. PBP1B/LpoB may also play a second role in division, working in tandem with the Tol-Pal complex to facilitate OM constriction. Moreover, we provide evidence that the Lpo proteins and their docking domains in PBPs show similar evolutionary distribution and are confined to the γ-proteobacteria. Modification of PG synthase activity in different bacterial groups might permit the lifestyle diversification necessary for expansion of ecological niches. In toto, our data indicate that, in at least some Gram-negative bacteria, the enlargement of the PG layer requires control or activation of PG synthases not only from inside of the cell (by the cytoskeleton), but also from outside by proteins associated with the OM. An independent parallel study by Paradis-Bleau et al. in this issue of Cell corroborates this notion (Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010Paradis-Bleau C. Markovski M. Uehara T. Lupoli T.J. Walker S. Kahne D.E. Bernhardt T.G. Lipoprotein cofactors located in the outer membrane activate bacterial cell wall polymerases.Cell. 2010; 143 (this issue): 1110-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We employed two global approaches to identify proteins important for PBP1A and PBP1B function. First, as part of a broader chemical genomic screen (Nichols et al., 2011Nichols R.J. Sen S. Choo Y.J. Beltrao P. Zietek M. Chaba R. Lee S. Kazmierczak K.M. Lee K.J. Wong A. et al.Phenotypic landscape of a bacterial cell.Cell. 2011; (Published online December 23, 2010)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (488) Google Scholar), we identified gene deletions whose phenotypes closely mirrored those exhibited by loss of PBP1B (mrcB−). The E. coli single-gene knockout library was grown in sublethal concentrations of numerous drugs covering a broad spectrum of cellular targets and environmental stresses, reflecting the challenges that E. coli faces in its natural environment. Analysis of the responses to all 324 conditions indicated that the growth phenotypes of ycfM−, encoding a putative OM lipoprotein, and mrcB− were highly correlated (Figure 1A , top; correlation coefficient of 0.9, p < 10−116) as a result of shared sensitivity to many β-lactams and to the MreB-specific inhibitor A22 (Figure 1A, bottom). ycfM− phenotypes were complemented by in trans expression of ycfM (data not shown). Second, we used a proteomic approach to identify interaction partners of PG synthases. Following application of a membrane fraction to agarose bead-coupled PBP1A or PBP1B, we identified one predicted OM lipoprotein with specific affinity for each PBP. YcfM was present only in the PBP1B eluate, whereas YraM was identified only in that from PBP1A (data not shown). Subsequent experiments confirmed that each PBP required its OM protein interaction partner for function. We renamed these proteins LpoA (YraM) and LpoB (YcfM) for lipoprotein activator of PBP from the outer membrane A and B. Although PBP1A and PBP1B have partially distinct roles in PG synthesis, the presence of one suffices for normal growth, but the absence of both PBPs (mrcA−mrcB−) leads to synthetic lethality despite the presence of a third, nonessential class A PBP (PBP1C) of unknown role. If LpoA and LpoB were essential for the function of their cognate PBP, then lpoA− and lpoB− should be synthetically lethal both with each other and with their noncognate PBP, thereby mirroring the synthetic lethality of mrcA− and mrcB−. We tested these and other double-mutant phenotypes (Figures 1B and 1C and Figure S1 available online) using GIANT-coli, our recently developed high-throughput methodology for generating double mutants en masse (Typas et al., 2008Typas A. Nichols R.J. Siegele D.A. Shales M. Collins S.R. Lim B. Braberg H. Yamamoto N. Takeuchi R. Wanner B.L. et al.High-throughput, quantitative analyses of genetic interactions in E. coli.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A 12 × 12 genetic interaction miniarray was generated by mating each Hfr donor (carrying a cat-marked gene deletion) to recipient cells (carrying kan-marked gene deletions) arrayed on agar plates; double-mutant recombinants were selected by repinning cells onto double-antibiotic plates. The double-mutant growth phenotypes resulting from mating with pseudo Hfr lpoB−, displayed in Figure 1B and quantified in Figure 1C, reveal that, in addition to synthetic lethality with lpoA− and mrcA−, lpoB− had specific negative interactions with gene deletions of the Tol-Pal system. We also quantified the genetic interaction of each lpo with its cognate PBP using drug conditions in which the single mutants exhibited a partial growth defect so that the double-mutant growth phenotypes could be accurately assessed. As expected for proteins working together, the double mutants exhibited epistatic interactions: removal of PBP in the absence of its cognate Lpo protein did not increase sensitivity to the β-lactams tested (Figures 1D and 1E and Figure S1). mrcB− cells grew worse than lpoB− or lpoB−mrcB− cells (Figure 1D), suggesting that LpoB is deleterious in the absence of PBP1B, possibly due to additional interactions with other proteins (e.g., PG hydrolases; see Discussion). The in vivo synthetic and epistatic interactions summarized in Figure 1F indicate that LpoA/PBP1A and LpoB/PBP1B work together and that each PBP absolutely requires its cognate Lpo protein for being functional in vivo. Using specific antisera, we confirmed that LpoA and LpoB were located almost exclusively in purified OM rather than in IM vesicles (Figure S2A ), as predicted by their N-terminal signal peptide for lipid modification and OM sorting (Figure S2B). Interestingly, both proteins interacted with isolated PG sacculi in a pull-down experiment (Figure S2C). These results suggest that the Lpo proteins are OM-attached lipoproteins that reach into the periplasm to interact with the PG layer. To test whether the Lpo proteins interact specifically with PG synthases, we performed affinity chromatography under stringent conditions. An E. coli membrane fraction, which contains a large excess of other proteins over low-abundance PBPs, was applied at 400 mM NaCl to columns containing either immobilized LpoA or LpoB. PBP1A interacted only with LpoA, whereas PBP1B interacted specifically with LpoB (Figures 2A and 2B ). Conversely, LpoA and LpoB interacted with their immobilized cognate PBP (Figures 2C and 2D), and the C-terminal domain of LpoA interacted with PBP1A (Figure 2E). Importantly, we also detected LpoA-PBP1A and LpoB-PBP1B interactions in living cells with a crosslinking/immunoprecipitation approach (Figures 2F and 2G). Together, these results indicate direct interactions between LpoA and PBP1A and between LpoB and PBP1B, confirming our genetic and chemical genetic inferences. We monitored the effects of depleting either LpoA or LpoB in cells lacking the noncognate PBP (mrcB− or mrcA−, respectively) by placing each lpo under the tightly controlled arabinose promoter. Cell lysis was observed upon Lpo depletion (Figures 3A and 3B ) and confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy (Figure 3C). Moreover, lysis was accompanied by formation of bulges at the cellular periphery, often at or near the midcell division sites (Figures 3D and 3E), which appear similar to those seen upon treatment with PBP inhibitors like penicillin (Chung et al., 2009Chung H.S. Yao Z. Goehring N.W. Kishony R. Beckwith J. Kahne D. Rapid beta-lactam-induced lysis requires successful assembly of the cell division machinery.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 21872-21877Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or overexpression of catalytically inactive versions of PBP1B (Meisel et al., 2003Meisel U. Höltje J.-V. Vollmer W. Overproduction of inactive variants of the murein synthase PBP1B causes lysis in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5342-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These cellular morphologies and the sensitivity of lpoB− to numerous β-lactams that target the TPase domain of active PG synthases suggested that Lpo proteins might stimulate the TPase activity of their cognate PBP. To test the hypothesis that Lpo proteins stimulate the activities of their cognate PBPs, we directly probed the enzymatic consequences of Lpo association with PBPs with a recently developed in vitro PG synthesis assay that uses radioactively labeled lipid II as a substrate and purified PBP1A or PBP1B (Bertsche et al., 2005Bertsche U. Breukink E. Kast T. Vollmer W. In vitro murein peptidoglycan synthesis by dimers of the bifunctional transglycosylase-transpeptidase PBP1B from Escherichia coli.J. Biol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 26985-26993Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with or without their cognate Lpo. HPLC analysis of the muramidase-digested PG product allowed detection and quantification of both monomeric (uncrosslinked) and multimeric (crosslinked) products of the GTase and TPase activities of these PBPs (Figure S3A ). Although PBP1B and PBP1A themselves are highly active, each cognate Lpo enhanced transpeptidation (Figure 3F and Figure S3B). LpoB increased the percentage of crosslinked peptides in the PBP1B product from 53% to 73%, whereas LpoA increased the crosslinkage in the PBP1A product from 41% to 67%. The C-terminal domain of LpoA (LpoAC) alone stimulated the TPase activity of PBP1A (Figure 3F), consistent with its interaction with the enzyme (Figure 2E). The cognate Lpo proteins stimulate PBP1A and PBP1B to produce not only dimeric, but also trimeric and tetrameric structures in which three and four peptides are connected (Figure S3C). Although tetrameric peptides exist in isolated sacculi, they have never been observed in PBP reactions in vitro. Finally, using a separate assay, we found that LpoA, but not the truncated LpoAC or LpoAN, stimulated the capacity of PBP1A to attach in vitro synthesized, new PG to sacculi by transpeptidation reactions from 44% to 66% (p = 0.057; Figure S4). Thus, each Lpo stimulates the TPase activity of its cognate PBP.Figure S4LpoA Stimulates the Attachment of Newly Synthesized PG to Sacculi In Vitro, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Schematic representation of the attachment reaction in which radioactively labeled lipid II substrate is polymerized by the GTase and TPase activities of the bifunctional PBP1A.

Both Lpo proteins stimulate the TPase activity of their cognate PBP in the absence of sacculi (Figure 3F). We used immunolabeling and fluorescence microscopy to detect the position of LpoA and LpoB, employing a nonperturbing protocol for fixing cells and permeabilizing their OM and PG (see Figure S5A and Extended Experimental Procedures). The data are displayed both as representative single-cell images (Figures 4A–4D ) and as fluorescence profiles across > 1000 size-selected cells (Figures 4E–4H). The low background signal in the absence of the cognate protein shown by examination of images (Figures 4C and 4D), quantitative analysis (Figures 4E–4H), and western blot analysis (data not shown) indicated that both primary antibodies were specific. LpoA and LpoB were each detected as foci in the peripheral part of the cell, with LpoB and, to a lower degree, LpoA also exhibiting relatively intense labeling at the midcell of dividing cells (Figures 4A and 4B). The quantified fluorescence intensity profiles validated our qualitative observations and further established that LpoB and, to a lower degree, LpoA have stronger midcell labeling intensity in the longer (i.e., dividing) cells (Figures 4E and 4F) than in the shorter cells (Figures 4G and 4H). The localization of both Lpo proteins was maintained in the absence of the cognate/noncognate PBP and in the absence of the other Lpo protein (Figures 4E–4H), indicating that LpoA/B localize independently of these proteins. Immunoblot analysis indicated that cellular amounts of LpoA and LpoB remained constant in all mutants (data not shown).Figure 4LpoA and LpoB Localize as Distinct Foci in the Lateral Wall and at Constriction Sites of Dividing CellsShow full caption(A–D) E. coli wild-type (TB28) (A) and its lpoA− derivative (C) were immunolabeled with antibodies against LpoA.

The fluorescence profiles of LpoA and LpoB in cells of different length classes indicated that localization to the septum began at 60% of the cell cycle (Figure S5). As this coincides with proteins that localize in the second step in divisome maturation (Aarsman et al., 2005Aarsman M.E. Piette A. Fraipont C. Vinkenvleugel T.M. Nguyen-Distèche M. den Blaauwen T. Maturation of the Escherichia coli divisome occurs in two steps.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1631-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), localization of Lpo proteins might depend on FtsZ and/or FtsI (PBP3). Indeed, in the FtsZ temperature-sensitive strain ftsZ84(ts), the LpoB midcell localization observed at 28°C was abolished two mass doublings after shift to the nonpermissive temperature of 42°C (Figures S6D–S6F). Likewise, midcell localization of LpoB was abolished when a strain expressing the temperature-sensitive variant of PBP3 ftsI2158(ts) was shifted to 42°C for two mass doublings (Figures S6J–S6L). On the other hand, LpoA was poorly localized overall in the FtsZ(ts) and PBP3(ts) strains (Figures S6A–S6C and S6G–S6I). This phenotype is consistent with the weaker midcell localization of LpoA in wild-type cells (Figure 4A). At the nonpermissive temperature, PBP3(ts) cells filament and have blunt co"

Because they are the targets of penicillin and related antibiotics, the structure and biochemical functions of the PBPs have been extensively studied. Despite this, we still know surprisingly little about how these enzymes build the PG layer in vivo. Here, we identify the Escherichia coli outer-membrane lipoproteins LpoA and LpoB as essential PBP cofactors. We show that LpoA and LpoB form specific trans-envelope complexes with their cognate PBP and are critical for PBP function in vivo. We further show that LpoB promotes PG synthesis by its partner PBP in vitro and that it likely does so by stimulating glycan chain polymerization. Overall, our results indicate that PBP accessory proteins play a central role in PG biogenesis, and like the PBPs they work with, these factors are attractive targets for antibiotic development."

By analyzing sequences of interaction partners of these proteins, we discovered a recurrent presence of coiled-coil domains both in the partners and in segments that flank or overlap Q/N-rich and polyQ domains. Since coiled coils can mediate protein interactions and multimerization, we studied their possible involvement in Q/N-rich and polyQ aggregations. Using circular dichroism and chemical crosslinking, we found that Q/N-rich and polyQ peptides form α-helical coiled coils in vitro and assemble into multimers. Using structure-guided mutagenesis, we found that coiled-coil domains modulate in vivo properties of two Q/N-rich prions and polyQ-expanded huntingtin. Mutations that disrupt coiled coils impair aggregation and activity, whereas mutations that enhance coiled-coil propensity promote aggregation. These findings support a coiled-coil model for the functional switch of Q/N-rich prions and for the pathogenesis of polyQ-expansion diseases.

Many interactors of Q/N-rich prions and polyQ proteins contain coiled-coil domains Q/N-rich and polyQ domains have sequence features of α-helical coiled-coil structures α-Helical Q/N-rich and polyQ peptides form oligomers and multimers in vitro Q/N-rich and polyQ coiled-coils promote protein aggregation and activity in vivo Prions were initially identified as protein-only infectious agents causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob and related neurological diseases by misfolding from their native conformation to a self-propagating, aggregation-prone, and β sheet-rich secondary structure (Prusiner, 1987Prusiner S.B. Prions causing degenerative neurological diseases.Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 381-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies delineated a group of prion proteins in yeast, characterized by glutamine/asparagine-rich (Q/N-rich) domains (Wickner et al., 2007Wickner R.B. Edskes H.K. Shewmaker F. Nakayashiki T. Prions of fungi: inherited structures and biological roles.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins are thought to be nonpathogenic and to propagate epigenetic information through a loss of function upon aggregation (Alberti et al., 2009Alberti S. Halfmann R. King O. Kapila A. Lindquist S. A systematic survey identifies prions and illuminates sequence features of prionogenic proteins.Cell. 2009; 137: 146-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). More recently, a Q/N-rich prion protein has been found that serves a physiological function in the nervous system of Aplysia. Here, the neurotransmitter serotonin controls a prion-like switch that results in a self-perpetuating form that mediates the long-term maintenance of synaptic plasticity and memory storage (Si et al., 2003Si K. Lindquist S. Kandel E.R. A neuronal isoform of the aplysia CPEB has prion-like properties.Cell. 2003; 115: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, Si et al., 2010Si K. Choi Y.B.

Aplysia CPEB can form prion-like multimers in sensory neurons that contribute to long-term facilitation.Cell. 2010; 140: 421-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The existence of nonpathogenic and functionally regulated Q/N-rich prions raises questions about the mechanisms by which low-complexity Q/N-rich domains can regulate the physiological function of these proteins in a tightly controlled manner and in response to specific cellular signaling events (Si et al., 2010Si K. Choi Y.B. White-Grindley E. Majumdar A. Kandel E.R. Aplysia CPEB can form prion-like multimers in sensory neurons that contribute to long-term facilitation.Cell. 2010; 140: 421-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of Q/N-rich proteins make them rather insoluble and difficult to study by conventional structural techniques. As a result, full atomic-level structures have not yet been determined, and many studies focused instead on peptide fragments (e.g., Perutz et al., 2002Perutz M.F. Pope B.J. Owen D. Wanker E.E. Scherzinger E. Aggregation of proteins with expanded glutamine and alanine repeats of the glutamine-rich and asparagine-rich domains of Sup35 and of the amyloid beta-peptide of amyloid plaques.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, Nelson et al., 2005Nelson R. Sawaya M.R. Balbirnie M. Madsen A.Ø. Riekel C. Grothe R. Eisenberg D. Structure of the cross-beta spine of amyloid-like fibrils.Nature. 2005; 435: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Based on such studies, Q/N-rich prions are thought to undergo a conformational change analogous to that of pathogenic prions and amyloids, by misfolding into β sheet-rich, aggregating structures (Wickner et al., 2007Wickner R.B. Edskes H.K. Shewmaker F. Nakayashiki T. Prions of fungi: inherited structures and biological roles.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Alberti et al., 2009Alberti S. Halfmann R. King O. Kapila A. Lindquist S. A systematic survey identifies prions and illuminates sequence features of prionogenic proteins.Cell. 2009; 137: 146-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). However, the structural transitions of functional prions, which must be regulated, are not easily conceivable as an uncontrolled misfolding process, suggesting that structural mechanisms besides β sheet misfolding might underlie the prion-like behavior of these proteins. Indeed, experimental observations do indicate involvement of other structures (e.g., Bousset et al., 2002Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. The yeast prion Ure2p retains its native α-helical conformation upon assembly into protein fibrils in vitro.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Narayanan et al., 2006Narayanan S. Walter S. Reif B. Yeast prion-protein, sup35, fibril formation proceeds by addition and substraction of oligomers.ChemBioChem. 2006; 7: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since studies of Q/N-rich prions revealed that their structural changes involve chaperones and other interacting proteins (Wickner et al., 2007Wickner R.B. Edskes H.K. Shewmaker F. Nakayashiki T. Prions of fungi: inherited structures and biological roles.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we wondered whether identifying common structural features among these interactors might provide clues about the structure and regulation of the Q/N-rich proteins themselves. We therefore undertook an analysis of their interactomes, which revealed the overrepresentation of coiled-coil domains. A similar overrepresentation was found in the interactomes of nonprionic proteins containing polyQ stretches that have a physiological function as the wild-type form (e.g., Harada et al., 2010Harada N. Mitani T. Higashimura Y. Yamaji R. Okamoto K. Nakano Y. Inui H. Involvement of three glutamine tracts in human androgen receptor transactivation.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 118: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but acquire dysfunctional properties when genetic mutations increase their length above a critical threshold where they assume a pathogenic form that causes inherited disorders such as Huntington's disease (Orr and Zoghbi, 2007Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Trinucleotide repeat disorders.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 575-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Coiled coils (CCs) are α-helical supersecondary structures mediating protein-protein interactions, oligomerization, and other functions through the coiling of helices belonging to the same or different polypeptide chains (Parry et al., 2008Parry D.A. Fraser R.D. Squire J.M. Fifty years of coiled-coils and α-helical bundles: a close relationship between sequence and structure.J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 163: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The finding of CC proteins in the interactomes prompted us to search for CC regions in the Q/N-rich and the polyQ proteins themselves, which could serve both as substrates of interaction with other CCs and mediators of aggregation. This analysis revealed heptad repeats typical of CCs in regions flanking or overlapping Q/N-rich domains and polyQ stretches. We used circular dichroism and chemical crosslinking to study properties of Q/N-rich and polyQ-containing peptides in vitro, and found signatures of α-helical CC multimers. To investigate the role of CCs in the aggregation and activity of Q/N-rich and polyQ proteins in vivo, we performed structure-guided mutagenesis of the Q/N-rich yeast prion Ure2, the Aplysia prion CPEB, and the human polyQ protein huntingtin. We found that CC domains regulate aggregation, insolubility and activity of these proteins. Based on these findings, we propose a novel model in which CCs have a critical role in the structural dynamics of Q/N-rich prions and polyQ proteins. The ubiquitin ligase CHIP, the chaperone Hsp104, the polyQ tract-binding protein-1 (PQBP-1), and the Htt-interacting protein (HIP-1) interact with Q/N-rich or polyQ proteins modulating their aggregation (Orr and Zoghbi, 2007Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Trinucleotide repeat disorders.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 575-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, Wickner et al., 2007Wickner R.B. Edskes H.K. Shewmaker F. Nakayashiki T. Prions of fungi: inherited structures and biological roles.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In search of shared features among them, we discovered the common occurrence of CC domains, as previously found in three of them (e.g., Niu and Ybe, 2008Niu Q. Ybe J.A. Crystal structure at 2.8 A of Huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) coiled-coil domain reveals a charged surface suitable for HIP1 protein interactor (HIPPI).J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and as predicted with high probability for PQBP-1 (Figure 1A ). We extended our analysis to other interactors of the Q/N-rich prion Ure2 and the polyQ protein Htt listed in the BioGrid database, and found that 54% and 63% of Ure2 and Htt interactors, respectively, have or are predicted to have CC domains (Figure 1B). The apCPEB interactome is not well known, but two recently identified homologous or heterologous interactors, Hsp104 and Aplysia CHIP are CC proteins (Si et al., 2003Si K. Lindquist S. Kandel E.R. A neuronal isoform of the aplysia CPEB has prion-like properties.Cell. 2003; 115: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar; F.F. and E.R.K., unpublished). Taking into account interactors of CPEBs listed in the IntAct database, 84% of the putative apCPEB interactors are CC proteins (Figure 1B). Eukaryotic proteomes are estimated to contain only 6%–8% CC proteins (Odgren et al., 1996Odgren P.R. Harvie Jr., L.W. Fey E.G. Phylogenetic occurrence of coiled coil proteins: implications for tissue structure in metazoa via a coiled coil tissue matrix.Proteins. 1996; 24: 467-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings indicate that CC proteins are overrepresented among the interactors of these Q/N-rich and polyQ proteins. Our interactome findings prompted us to search for CCs in the Q/N-rich prions and polyQ proteins themselves, as potential mediators of interaction. Using Coils (Lupas et al., 1991Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences.Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3381) Google Scholar) and Paircoil2 (McDonnell et al., 2006McDonnell A.V. Jiang T.

We found that all of these proteins contain heptad repeats and are predicted with high probability (0.8–1) to contain CC domains that flank/overlap with Q/N-rich regions and polyQ stretches (Figures 1B–1C and Figure S1 available online). Heptad repeats are within prion domains (PrDs) of the yeast and Aplysia proteins. In Ure2 and apCPEB, the CC region overlaps entirely with the regions defined as prion domains (Figures 1B and 1C and Figure S1C; Ure2 residues 1–95, Bousset et al., 2002Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R.

Swi1, Rnq-1, and Cyc8 display numerous regions of high CC propensity within their Q/N-rich domains (Figure S1 and Figure S2). Sup35 shows CC propensity within the M section of its NM prion domain (residues 124–253; Krammer et al., 2009Krammer C. Kryndushkin D. Suhre M.H. Kremmer E. Hofmann A. Pfeifer A. Scheibel T. Wickner R.B. Schätzl H.M. Vorberg I. The yeast Sup35NM domain propagates as a prion in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar; Figure S1 and Figure S2), which is crucial for prion propagation and Sup35 interactions with Hsp104 (Liu et al., 2002Liu J.J. Sondheimer N. Lindquist S.L. Changes in the middle region of Sup35 profoundly alter the nature of epigenetic inheritance for the yeast prion [PSI+].Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Effects of mutations in yeast prion [PSI+] on amyloid toxicity manifested in Escherichia coli strain BL21.Prion. 2008; 2: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Moreover, ∼80% of the 19 candidate yeast prions identified by Alberti et al., 2009Alberti S. Halfmann R. King O. Kapila A. Lindquist S. A systematic survey identifies prions and illuminates sequence features of prionogenic proteins.Cell. 2009; 137: 146-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar are predicted to have CC propensity (0.8–1, Paircoil2; Figure 1B and Figure S2). All nine polyQ proteins show CC propensity in regions that contain polyQ stretches (Figures 1B and 1C, and Figure S1). For some of them, the CC propensity of the wild-type (WT) polyQ regions is not high, but increases strongly upon polyQ expansion (Figure S1B). For comparison, we analyzed prions and amyloids devoid of Q/N-rich or polyQ stretches, such as the mammalian prion protein (PrP), β-amyloid(1–42), tau, and α-synuclein (Figure 1C and Figure S1). Except for α-synuclein, already known to form CCs (Bussell and Eliezer, 2003Bussell Jr., R. Eliezer D. A structural and functional role for 11-mer repeats in alpha-synuclein and other exchangeable lipid binding proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), these proteins do not show high CC propensity, suggesting that CC domains might represent a defining feature of the subgroup of Q/N-rich prions and polyQ proteins. Figure 1C and Figure S1A show predictions for proteins with known CC crystal structures, including short CCs (c-Fos), long CCs (tropomyosin), and Q/N-enriched (>15%) CCs from the SIV protein gp41 and the Mycoplasma protein MPN010 (Yang et al., 1999Yang Z.N. Mueser T.C. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Hyde C.C. The crystal structure of the SIV gp41 ectodomain at 1.47 A resolution.J. Struct.

Crystal structure of the DUF16 domain of MPN010 from Mycoplasma pneumoniae.Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We compared the features of predicted Q/N-rich and poly-Q CCs with known CCs (Figure 2). Coiled-coil heptads are repeats of seven residues (a-b-c-d-e-f-g), in which hydrophobic residues (mostly L, I, V, M or F) often occupy positions a/d, creating a hydrophobic layer between coiling helices (Figures 2A–2C). Polar/charged residues are instead in solvent-exposed positions, and charged residues in e/g can form CC-stabilizing salt bridges. Repeats of hydrophobic residues with heptad spacing are a hallmark of CCs, and are often discontinuous (Parry et al., 2008Parry D.A. Fraser R.D. Squire J.M. Fifty years of coiled-coils and α-helical bundles: a close relationship between sequence and structure.J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 163: 258-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, Figure 2D, Figure S2G). Moreover, as seen in helical nets (e.g., gp41; Figure 2D), hydrophobic residues in positions a/d may be interspersed with certain nonhydrophobic ones such as Qs, also considered ambivalent hydrophobes (Sodek et al., 1972Sodek J. Hodges R.S. Smillie L.B. Jurasek L. Amino-acid sequence of rabbit skeletal tropomyosin and its coiled-coil structure.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1972; 69: 3800-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Q and N in position a/d may specify the oligomeric state of CCs (Gonzalez et al., 1996Gonzalez Jr., L. Brown R.A. Richardson D. Alber T. Crystal structures of a single coiled-coil peptide in two oligomeric states reveal the basis for structural polymorphism.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 1002-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The putative Q/N-rich and polyQ CCs (Figure 2D and Figure S2G) contain a/d clusters of hydrophobes alternating mostly with Q/Ns, with few charged residues in e/g. Thus, predicted Q/N-rich and polyQ CCs have features comparable with known CCs, and suggest that they may be unstable and conformationally flexible (Li et al., 2003Li Y. Brown J.H. Reshetnikova L. Blazsek A. Farkas L. Nyitray L. Cohen C. Visualization of an unstable coiled coil from the scallop myosin rod.Nature. 2003; 424: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, Kwok and Hodges, 2004Kwok S.C. Hodges R.S. Stabilizing and destabilizing clusters in the hydrophobic core of long two-stranded α-helical coiled-coils.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21576-21588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A recurrent feature of these domains is the quite neat segregation of proline/glycine (P/G) residues outside of the CC-prone regions (Figure S1C and Figures S2D and S2E). We studied further the CC domains of Ure2, apCPEB, and human Htt, the determinant of Huntington's disease upon polyQ expansion. We found that the N-terminal portions of Ure2, apCPEB and polyQ-expanded Htt exon-1 (Htt-72Q), contain 10, 11, and 12 heptad repeats, respectively, as indicated by Paircoil2 (Figures S3A and S3B ). Some heptads display a conventional amino acid composition, while others are quite atypical in this respect, being mostly formed by Q/N residues, either associated or not with hydrophobic residues in a/d. Orthologs of these proteins are also predicted to form CCs, suggesting that these structures are evolutionarily conserved because of their functional relevance (Figures S3C and S3D).Figure S4Supplemental CD Spectra of Q/N-rich and PolyQ Peptides, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) CD spectra of ccQQ, ccQL, and ccQP peptides in the presence of 50% TFE.

To study the role of CCs in the aggregation and activity of Ure2, apCPEB and Htt exon-1, we used structure-guided mutagenesis to modulate the stability of putative CC domains. We designed several mutants (Figure 3A ) and estimated CC disruption/enhancement for each using Paircoil2 (Figure 3B). In coiled-coil–defective (CC-) mutants, we substituted some residues, mostly in a/d, with single or tandem prolines (Figure 3A), a commonly used strategy for CC disruption, impairing CC formation partially or completely (Chang et al., 1999Chang D.K. Cheng S.F. Trivedi V.D. Lin K.L. Proline affects oligomerization of a coiled coil by inducing a kink in a long helix.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar; Figure 3B). Given the neat separation of conventional and Q heptads in Htt-72Q, we used this protein as a suitable model to modulate CC propensity also in the opposite direction. We generated CC-promoting mutants (cc+) predicted to (1) induce aggregation of the soluble Htt-25Q, (2) enhance Htt-72Q aggregation, and (3) rescue aggregation of cc- mutants. Thus, we replaced 4–6 Qs with hydrophobic residues in the a-d frame of heptads #1-2, thereby generating mutants Htt-25Q/cc+, Htt-72Q/cc+, and Htt-72Q/cc+R (Figure 3A). Since prolines in the CC- mutants may also affect β sheet formation, we generated control mutants predicted to maintain propensity for CC (cc0), but in which the possible β sheet formation would be impaired by replacing multiple Qs with β sheet-breaking, charged or polar residues (Colloc'h and Cohen, 1991Colloc'h N. Cohen F.E. Beta-breakers: an aperiodic secondary structure.J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We used glutamate (E), lysine (K), and asparagine (N), up to four each, in various combinations (Figure 3A). To test the efficacy of these mutations in preventing β sheet formation, we generated Aβ (1–42) mutants containing E, K, and N substitutions (β- mutants) with similar spacing as in the cc0 mutants (Figure 3A). These mutations disrupted the β strand propensity of Aβ(1–42) (Figure S3E and Figures S5B and S5C). As a further control for the proline mutagenesis, we generated the Htt-72Q/cc-/W mutant (Figure 3A) in which four tryptophans (Ws) replaced the L-L-F-L pattern in a/d. Tryptophan in a/d is mildly CC destabilizing (Figures S5E and S5F;Kwok and Hodges, 2004Kwok S.C. Hodges R.S. Stabilizing and destabilizing clusters in the hydrophobic core of long two-stranded α-helical coiled-coils.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21576-21588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but it has greater β sheet propensity than leucine (L) (Pawar et al., 2005Pawar A.P. Dubay K.F. Zurdo J. Chiti F. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M. Prediction of “aggregation-prone” and “aggregation-susceptible” regions in proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, this mutant would be expected to have preserved β sheet-mediated aggregation but reduced CC-mediated aggregation. To test the prediction that Q/N-rich and polyQ stretches can be part of α-helical CC structures, and to assess effects of the CC mutations, we used circular dichroism (CD) to analyze the secondary structure of three sets of peptides (Figure 4A ). CD is used extensively to study the folding and stability of CCs. Distinctive signatures permit differentiating between single and coiled helices, based on the ratio between 222 and 208 nm ellipticities (>1 for CCs), its inversion induced by trifluoroethanol (TFE), and the thermal stability of the folding (see Extended Experimental Procedures). The first set of peptides is based on a four-heptad CC model (Hicks et al., 2002Hicks M.R. Walshaw J. Woolfson D.N. Investigating the tolerance of coiled-coil peptides to nonheptad sequence inserts.J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) into which we inserted two central heptads of Qs (peptide ccQQ), or Qs with either CC-stabilizing (I-L-I-L) or -destabilizing (P-P-P-P) residues in a/d (ccQL and ccQP, respectively). In benign buffer, ccQQ and ccQL displayed α-helical CD spectra with minima at 208 and 222 nm, whereas ccQP showed a minimum at ∼200 nm as for random coils (Figure 4B). Both ccQQ and ccQL had θ222/θ208 ratios > 1, indicating CC formation. In 50% TFE, which favors CC dissociation, the θ222/θ208 ratio of ccQQ and ccQL went below 1 (Figure 4C and Figure S4A), as typically observed for CCs. TFE also induced helical folding of ccQP, likely by stabilizing its proline-flanking parts (Figure S4A). Expected CC stabilization in ccQL versus ccQQ was realized; ccQL remained folded up to 75°C, whereas ccQQ lost most of its structure already at 25°C (Figures 4D and 4E). We conclude that polyQ stretches can be part of CC structures, and that Q-rich CCs gain stabilization by hydrophobic residues with heptad spacing. We similarly analyzed Ure2 and Htt peptides. Ure2(70–98), comprising heptads #7–10 (Figure S3A), is only partially helical at 4°C, and becomes even more unstructured above 25°C (Figure 4F and Figure S4B). Difference spectra (37°C versus 4°C) revealed more clearly that the structured component is α-helical and coiled, as indicated by a θ222/θ208 ratio ∼1 (Figure 4F). This conclusion is also supported by the inversion of the ratio in 50% TFE, which also strongly enhanced α-helical folding (Figure S4B). Htt-17Q (1–40), designed by reference to the only form of Htt that has been crystallized (Kim et al., 2009Kim M.W. Chelliah Y. Kim S.W. Otwinowski Z. Bezprozvanny I. Secondary structure of Huntingtin amino-terminal region.Structure. 2009; 17: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), generated CD spectra similar to Ure2(70–98), being only partially helical at 4°C, consistent with the crystal structure (Kim et al., 2009Kim M.W.

Secondary structure of Huntingtin amino-terminal region.Structure. 2009; 17: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar; Figures S4C and S4D). Interestingly, unlike the other peptides, the CD spectra of Htt-17Q changed with time, showing a reduction in ellipticity at 208 nm and a progressively increasing θ222/θ208 ratio. After some hours at 4°C, the CD spectra showed a helical profile with θ222/θ208 > 1, indicative of the CC formation, and moderate thermal stability (Figures 4F and 4G). Subsequently, θ208 decreased further and the 222 nm minimum was red-shifted toward 225"
https://openalex.org/W2134866355,"Following pilus-mediated adhesion to human brain endothelial cells, meningococcus (N. meningitidis), the bacterium causing cerebrospinal meningitis, initiates signaling cascades, which eventually result in the opening of intercellular junctions, allowing meningeal colonization. The signaling receptor activated by the pathogen remained unknown. We report that N. meningitidis specifically stimulates a biased β2-adrenoceptor/β-arrestin signaling pathway in endothelial cells, which ultimately traps β-arrestin-interacting partners, such as the Src tyrosine kinase and junctional proteins, under bacterial colonies. Cytoskeletal reorganization mediated by β-arrestin-activated Src stabilizes bacterial adhesion to endothelial cells, whereas β-arrestin-dependent delocalization of junctional proteins results in anatomical gaps used by bacteria to penetrate into tissues. Activation of β-adrenoceptor endocytosis with specific agonists prevents signaling events downstream of N. meningitidis adhesion and inhibits bacterial crossing of the endothelial barrier. The identification of the mechanism used for hijacking host cell signaling machineries opens perspectives for treatment and prevention of meningococcal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2100440797,"Apart from its natural relevance to cognition, music provides a window into the intimate relationships between production, perception, experience, and emotion. Here, emotional responses and neural activity were observed as they evolved together with stimulus parameters over several minutes. Participants listened to a skilled music performance that included the natural fluctuations in timing and sound intensity that musicians use to evoke emotional responses. A mechanical performance of the same piece served as a control. Before and after fMRI scanning, participants reported real-time emotional responses on a 2-dimensional rating scale (arousal and valence) as they listened to each performance. During fMRI scanning, participants listened without reporting emotional responses. Limbic and paralimbic brain areas responded to the expressive dynamics of human music performance, and both emotion and reward related activations during music listening were dependent upon musical training. Moreover, dynamic changes in timing predicted ratings of emotional arousal, as well as real-time changes in neural activity. BOLD signal changes correlated with expressive timing fluctuations in cortical and subcortical motor areas consistent with pulse perception, and in a network consistent with the human mirror neuron system. These findings show that expressive music performance evokes emotion and reward related neural activations, and that music's affective impact on the brains of listeners is altered by musical training. Our observations are consistent with the idea that music performance evokes an emotional response through a form of empathy that is based, at least in part, on the perception of movement and on violations of pulse-based temporal expectancies."
https://openalex.org/W2019690396,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have garnered significant attention as an important grouping of developmental brain disorders. Recent genomic studies have revealed that inherited or de novo copy number variations (CNVs) are significantly involved in the pathophysiology of ASDs. In a previous report from our laboratory, we generated mice with CNVs as a model of ASDs, with a duplicated mouse chromosome 7C that is orthologous to human chromosome 15q11-13. Behavioral analyses revealed paternally duplicated (patDp/+) mice displayed abnormal behaviors resembling the symptoms of ASDs. In the present study, we extended these findings by performing various behavioral tests with C57BL/6J patDp/+ mice, and comprehensively measuring brain monoamine levels with ex vivo high performance liquid chromatography. Compared with wild-type controls, patDp/+ mice exhibited decreased locomotor and exploratory activities in the open field test, Y-maze test, and fear-conditioning test. Furthermore, their decreased activity levels overcame increased appetite induced by 24 hours of food deprivation in the novelty suppressed feeding test. Serotonin levels in several brain regions of adult patDp/+ mice were lower than those of wild-type control, with no concurrent changes in brain levels of dopamine or norepinephrine. Moreover, analysis of monoamines in postnatal developmental stages demonstrated reduced brain levels of serotonin in young patDp/+ mice. These findings suggest that a disrupted brain serotonergic system, especially during postnatal development, may generate the phenotypes of patDp/+ mice."
https://openalex.org/W1973801304,"Background and Aim Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is classified radiologically based on the findings of central bronchiectasis (CB) and other radiologic features (ORF). However, the long-term clinical significance of these classifications remains unknown. We hypothesized that the immunological activity and outcomes of ABPA could be predicted on HRCT chest finding of high-attenuation mucus (HAM), a marker of inflammatory activity. In this study, we evaluate the severity and clinical outcomes of ABPA with different radiological classifications. Methods Patients were classified based on CT chest findings as: (a) serologic ABPA (ABPA-S) and ABPA-CB; (b) ABPA-S, ABPA-CB, and ABPA-CB-ORF; and, (c) ABPA-S, ABPA-CB and ABPA-CB-HAM. The clinical, spirometric and serological (total and A fumigatus specific IgE levels, eosinophil count) severity of the disease and clinical outcomes in various classifications were analyzed. Results Of the 234 (123 males, 111 females; mean age, 34.1 years) patients, 55 (23.5%) had normal HRCT, 179 (76.5%) had CB, 49 (20.9%) had HAM, and 27 (11.5%) had ORF. All immunological markers were consistently higher in the HAM classification, while in other classifications these findings were inconsistent. On multivariate analysis, the factors predicting frequent relapses were presence of HAM (OR 7.38; 95% CI, 3.21–17.0) and CB (OR 3.93; 95% CI, 1.63–9.48) after adjusting for ORF. Conclusions The classification scheme based on HAM most consistently predicts immunological severity in ABPA. Central bronchiectasis and HAM are independent predictors of recurrent relapses in ABPA. Hence, HAM should be employed in the radiological classification of ABPA."

However, the mechanisms underlying formation of these structures and their pathological consequences are still largely unknown. We found that microRNAs 103 and 107 repress translation of cofilin, and that reduced levels of miR-103 or miR-107 are associated with elevated cofilin protein levels and formation of rod-like structures in a transgenic mouse model of AD. These results suggest that microRNAs may play an important role in cytoskeletal pathology in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2065134299,"Background Cancer cells present a sustained de novo fatty acid synthesis with an increase of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) production. This change in fatty acid metabolism is associated with overexpression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1), which catalyses the transformation of saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid). Several reports demonstrated that inhibition of Scd1 led to the blocking of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Nevertheless, mechanisms of cell death activation remain to be better understood. Principal Findings In this study, we demonstrated that Scd1 extinction by siRNA triggered abolition of de novo MUFA synthesis in cancer and non-cancer cells. Scd1 inhibition-activated cell death was only observed in cancer cells with induction of caspase 3 activity and PARP-cleavage. Exogenous supplementation with oleic acid did not reverse the Scd1 ablation-mediated cell death. In addition, Scd1 depletion induced unfolded protein response (UPR) hallmarks such as Xbp1 mRNA splicing, phosphorylation of eIF2α and increase of CHOP expression. However, the chaperone GRP78 expression, another UPR hallmark, was not affected by Scd1 knockdown in these cancer cells indicating a peculiar UPR activation. Finally, we showed that CHOP induction participated to cell death activation by Scd1 extinction. Indeed, overexpression of dominant negative CHOP construct and extinction of CHOP partially restored viability in Scd1-depleted cancer cells. Conclusion These results suggest that inhibition of de novo MUFA synthesis by Scd1 extinction could be a promising anti-cancer target by inducing cell death through UPR and CHOP activation."
https://openalex.org/W2050766460,"Neural synchronization is a mechanism whereby functionally specific brain regions establish transient networks for perception, cognition, and action. Direct addition of weak noise (fast random fluctuations) to various neural systems enhances synchronization through the mechanism of stochastic resonance (SR). Moreover, SR also occurs in human perception, cognition, and action. Perception, cognition, and action are closely correlated with, and may depend upon, synchronized oscillations within specialized brain networks. We tested the hypothesis that SR-mediated neural synchronization occurs within and between functionally relevant brain areas and thus could be responsible for behavioral SR. We measured the 40-Hz transient response of the human auditory cortex to brief pure tones. This response arises when the ongoing, random-phase, 40-Hz activity of a group of tuned neurons in the auditory cortex becomes synchronized in response to the onset of an above-threshold sound at its ""preferred"" frequency. We presented a stream of near-threshold standard sounds in various levels of added broadband noise and measured subjects' 40-Hz response to the standards in a deviant-detection paradigm using high-density EEG. We used independent component analysis and dipole fitting to locate neural sources of the 40-Hz response in bilateral auditory cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex and left superior frontal gyrus. We found that added noise enhanced the 40-Hz response in all these areas. Moreover, added noise also increased the synchronization between these regions in alpha and gamma frequency bands both during and after the 40-Hz response. Our results demonstrate neural SR in several functionally specific brain regions, including areas not traditionally thought to contribute to the auditory 40-Hz transient response. In addition, we demonstrated SR in the synchronization between these brain regions. Thus, both intra- and inter-regional synchronization of neural activity are facilitated by the addition of moderate amounts of random noise. Because the noise levels in the brain fluctuate with arousal system activity, particularly across sleep-wake cycles, optimal neural noise levels, and thus SR, could be involved in optimizing the formation of task-relevant brain networks at several scales under normal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2065714966,"Brain accumulation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and oxidative stress underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hexokinase (HK), a key glycolytic enzyme, plays important pro-survival roles, reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and preventing apoptosis in neurons and other cell types. Brain isozyme HKI is mainly associated with mitochondria and HK release from mitochondria causes a significant decrease in enzyme activity and triggers oxidative damage. We here investigated the relationship between Aβ-induced oxidative stress and HK activity. We found that Aβ triggered HKI detachment from mitochondria decreasing HKI activity in cortical neurons. Aβ oligomers further impair energy metabolism by decreasing neuronal ATP levels. Aβ-induced HKI cellular redistribution was accompanied by excessive ROS generation and neuronal death. 2-deoxyglucose blocked Aβ-induced oxidative stress and neuronal death. Results suggest that Aβ-induced cellular redistribution and inactivation of neuronal HKI play important roles in oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2048940686,"Malaria, an Anopheles-borne parasitic disease, remains a major global health problem causing illness and death that disproportionately affects developing countries. Despite the incidence of malaria, which remains one of the most severe infections of human populations, there is no licensed vaccine against this life-threatening disease. In this context, we decided to explore the expression of Plasmodium vaccine antigens fused to the granule bound starch synthase (GBSS), the major protein associated to the starch matrix in all starch-accumulating plants and algae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.We describe the development of genetically engineered starch granules containing plasmodial vaccine candidate antigens produced in the unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that the C-terminal domains of proteins from the rodent Plasmodium species, Plasmodium berghei Apical Major Antigen AMA1, or Major Surface Protein MSP1 fused to the algal granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) are efficiently expressed and bound to the polysaccharide matrix. Mice were either immunized intraperitoneally with the engineered starch particles and Freund adjuvant, or fed with the engineered particles co-delivered with the mucosal adjuvant, and challenged intraperitoneally with a lethal inoculum of P. Berghei. Both experimental strategies led to a significantly reduced parasitemia with an extension of life span including complete cure for intraperitoneal delivery as assessed by negative blood thin smears. In the case of the starch bound P. falciparum GBSS-MSP1 fusion protein, the immune sera or purified immunoglobulin G of mice immunized with the corresponding starch strongly inhibited in vitro the intra-erythrocytic asexual development of the most human deadly plasmodial species.This novel system paves the way for the production of clinically relevant plasmodial antigens as algal starch-based particles designated herein as amylosomes, demonstrating that efficient production of edible vaccines can be genetically produced in Chlamydomonas."
https://openalex.org/W2125963558,"Background Malaria is a major public health problem in Bangladesh, frequently occurring as epidemics since the 1990s. Many factors affect increases in malaria cases, including changes in land use, drug resistance, malaria control programs, socioeconomic issues, and climatic factors. No study has examined the relationship between malaria epidemics and climatic factors in Bangladesh. Here, we investigate the relationship between climatic parameters [rainfall, temperature, humidity, sea surface temperature (SST), El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)], and malaria cases over the last 20 years in the malaria endemic district of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). Methods and Principal Findings Monthly malaria case data from January 1989 to December 2008, monthly rainfall, temperature, humidity sea surface temperature in the Bay of Bengal and ENSO index at the Niño Region 3 (NIÑO3) were used. A generalized linear negative binomial regression model was developed using the number of monthly malaria cases and each of the climatic parameters. After adjusting for potential mutual confounding between climatic factors there was no evidence for any association between the number of malaria cases and temperature, rainfall and humidity. Only a low NDVI was associated with an increase in the number of malaria cases. There was no evidence of an association between malaria cases and SST in the Bay of Bengal and NIÑO3. Conclusion and Significance It seems counterintuitive that a low NDVI, an indicator of low vegetation greenness, is associated with increases in malaria cases, since the primary vectors in Bangladesh, such as An. dirus, are associated with forests. This relationship can be explained by the drying up of rivers and streams creating suitable breeding sites for the vector fauna. Bangladesh has very high vector species diversity and vectors suited to these habitats may be responsible for the observed results."
https://openalex.org/W2085927277,"Celiac disease is caused by an uncontrolled immune response to gluten, a heterogeneous mixture of wheat storage proteins, including the α-gliadins. It has been shown that α-gliadins harbor several major epitopes involved in the disease pathogenesis. A major step towards elimination of gluten toxicity for celiac disease patients would thus be the elimination of such epitopes from α-gliadins. We have analyzed over 3,000 expressed α-gliadin sequences from 11 bread wheat cultivars to determine whether they encode for peptides potentially involved in celiac disease. All identified epitope variants were synthesized as peptides and tested for binding to the disease-associated HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules and for recognition by patient-derived α-gliadin specific T cell clones. Several specific naturally occurring amino acid substitutions were identified for each of the α-gliadin derived peptides involved in celiac disease that eliminate the antigenic properties of the epitope variants. Finally, we provide proof of principle at the peptide level that through the systematic introduction of such naturally occurring variations α-gliadins genes can be generated that no longer encode antigenic peptides. This forms a crucial step in the development of strategies to modify gluten genes in wheat so that it becomes safe for celiac disease patients. It also provides the information to design and introduce safe gluten genes in other cereals, which would exhibit improved quality while remaining safe for consumption by celiac disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W2097524113,"The common zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter coli is an important cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide but its evolution is incompletely understood. Using multilocus sequence type (MLST) data of 7 housekeeping genes from a national survey of Campylobacter in Scotland (2005/6), and a combined population genetic-phylogenetics approach, we investigated the evolutionary history of C. coli. Genealogical reconstruction of isolates from clinical infection, farm animals and the environment, revealed a three-clade genetic structure. The majority of farm animal, and all disease causing genotypes belonged to a single clade (clade 1) which had comparatively low synonymous sequence diversity, little deep branching genetic structure, and a higher number of shared alleles providing evidence of recent clonal decent. Calibration of the rate of molecular evolution, based on within-species genetic variation, estimated a more rapid rate of evolution than in traditional estimates. This placed the divergence of the clades at less than 2500 years ago, consistent with the introduction of an agricultural niche having had an effect upon the evolution of the C. coli clades. Attribution of clinical isolate genotypes to source, using an asymmetric island model, confirmed that strains from chicken and ruminants, and not pigs or turkeys, are the principal source of human C. coli infection. Taken together these analyses are consistent with an evolutionary scenario describing the emergence of agriculture-associated C. coli lineage that is an important human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2065511827,"Several studies suggest that dogs, as well as primates, utilize a mental representation of the signaler after hearing its vocalization and can match this representation with other features provided by the visual modality. Recently it was found that a dogs' growl is context specific and contains information about the caller's body size. Whether dogs can use the encoded information is as yet unclear. In this experiment, we tested whether dogs can assess the size of another dog if they hear an agonistic growl paired with simultaneous video projection of two dog pictures. One of them matched the size of the growling dog, while the other one was either 30% larger or smaller. In control groups, noise, cat pictures or projections of geometric shapes (triangles) were used. The results showed that dogs look sooner and longer at the dog picture matching the size of the caller. No such preference was found with any of the control stimuli, suggesting that dogs have a mental representation of the caller when hearing its vocalization."
https://openalex.org/W2088605145,"Background Ophiocordyceps sinensis (syn. Cordyceps sinensis), which is a parasite of caterpillars and is endemic to alpine regions on the Tibetan Plateau, is one of the most valuable medicinal fungi in the world. “Natural O. sinensis specimens” harbor various other fungi. Several of these other fungi that have been isolated from natural O. sinensis specimens have similar chemical components and/or pharmaceutical effects as O. sinensis. Nevertheless, the mycobiota of natural O. sinensis specimens has not been investigated in detail. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on the technique of PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), the mycobiota of three different sections (stromata, sclerotia, and mycelial cortices) from natural O. sinensis specimens were investigated using both culture-dependent and -independent methods. For the culture-dependent method, 572 fungal strains were isolated, and 92 putative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified from 226 sequenced strains with the threshold of 97%. For the culture-independent method, 490 fungal clones were identified from about 3000 clones of ITS fragments from the whole-community DNA; based on PCR-SSCP analyses, 266 of these clones were selected to be sequenced, and 118 putative OTUs were detected. The overwhelming majority of isolates/clones and OTUs were detected from mycelial cortices; only a few were detected from stromata and sclerotia. The most common OTUs detected with both methods belonged to Ascomycota; however, only 13 OTUs were detected simultaneously by both methods. Potential novel lineages were detected by each of the two methods. Conclusions/Significance A great number of fungal species present in the mycobiota of naturally-occurring O. sinensis specimens were detected, and many of them may represent undescribed lineages. That only a few of the same OTUs were detected by both methods indicated that different methods should be used. This study increased our understanding about the fungal community structure of this valuable medicinal herb."

Some forms of PCO have been associated with autoimmunity. We, therefore, investigated in multiple regression analyses associations of ovary-specific FMR1 genotypes with autoimmunity and pregnancy chances (with in vitro fertilization, IVF) in 339 consecutive infertile women (455 IVF cycles), 75 with PCO-like phenotype, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, medication dosage and number of oocytes retrieved. Patients included 183 (54.0%) with normal (norm) and 156 (46%) with heterozygous (het) FMR1 genotypes; 133 (39.2%) demonstrated laboratory evidence of autoimmunity: 51.1% of het-norm/low, 38.3% of norm and 24.2% het-norm/high genotype and sub-genotypes demonstrated autoimmunity (p = 0.003). Prevalence of autoimmunity increased further in PCO-like phenotype patients with het-norm/low genotype (83.3%), remained unchanged with norm (34.0%) and decreased in het-norm/high women (10.0%; P<0.0001). Pregnancy rates were significantly higher with norm (38.6%) than het-norm/low (22.2%, p = 0.001). FMR1 sub-genotype het-norm/low is strongly associated with autoimmunity and decreased pregnancy chances in IVF, reaffirming the importance of the distal long arm of the X chromosome (FMR1 maps at Xq27.3) for autoimmunity, ovarian function and, likely, pregnancy chance with IVF."
https://openalex.org/W2000867924,"Background CD44 is a polymorphic proteoglycan and functions as the principal cell-surface receptor for hyaluronate (HA). Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) activation of keratinocyte erbB receptors has been proposed to mediate retinoid-induced epidermal hyperplasia. We have recently shown that intermediate size HA fragments (HAFi) reverse skin atrophy by a CD44-dependent mechanism. Methodology and Principal Findings Treatment of primary mouse keratinocyte cultures with retinaldehyde (RAL) resulted in the most significant increase in keratinocyte proliferation when compared with other retinoids, retinoic acid, retinol or retinoyl palmitate. RAL and HAFi showed a more significant increase in keratinocyte proliferation than RAL or HAFi alone. No proliferation with RAL was observed in CD44−/− keratinocytes. HA synthesis inhibitor, 4-methylumbelliferone inhibited the proliferative effect of RAL. HB-EGF, erbB1, and tissue inhibitor of MMP-3 blocking antibodies abrogated the RAL- or RAL- and HAFi-induced keratinocyte proliferation. Topical application of RAL or RAL and HAFi for 3 days caused a significant epidermal hyperplasia in the back skin of wild-type mice but not in CD44−/− mice. Topical RAL and HAFi increased epidermal CD44 expression, and the epidermal and dermal HA. RAL induced the expression of active HB-EGF and erbB1. However, treatment with RAL and HAFi showed a more significant increase in pro-HB-EGF when compared to RAL or HAFi treatments alone. We then topically applied RAL and HAFi twice a day to the forearm skin of elderly dermatoporosis patients. After 1 month of treatment, we observed a significant clinical improvement. Conclusions and Significance Our results indicate that (i) RAL-induced in vitro and in vivo keratinocyte proliferation is a CD44-dependent phenomenon and requires the presence of HA, HB-EGF, erbB1 and MMPs, (ii) RAL and HAFi show a synergy in vitro and in vivo in mouse skin, and (iii) the combination of RAL and HAFi seems to have an important therapeutic effect in dermatoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2057521728,"Production of type I interferons, consisting mainly of multiple IFNα subtypes and IFNβ, represents an essential part of the innate immune defense against invading pathogens. While in most situations, namely viral infections, this class of cytokines is indispensable for host survival they mediate a detrimental effect during infection with L. monocytogenes by rendering macrophages insensitive towards IFNγ signalling which leads to a lethal bacterial pathology in mice. Due to a lack of suitable analytic tools the precise identity of the cell population responsible for type I IFN production remains ill-defined and so far these cells have been described to be macrophages. As in general IFNβ is the first type I interferon to be produced, we took advantage of an IFNβ fluorescence reporter-knockin mouse model in which YFP is expressed from a bicistronic mRNA linked by an IRES to the endogenous ifnb mRNA to assess the IFNβ production on a single cell level in situ. Our results showed highest frequencies and absolute numbers of IFNβ+ cells in the spleen 24 h after infection with L. monocytogenes where they were located predominately in the white pulp within the foci of infection. Detailed FACS surface marker analyses, intracellular cytokine stainings and T cell proliferation assays revealed that the IFNβ+ cells were a phenotypically and functionally further specialized subpopulation of TNF and iNOS producing DCs (Tip-DCs) which are known to be essential for the early containment of L. monocytogenes infection. We proved that the IFNβ+ cells exhibited the hallmark characteristics of Tip-DCs as they produced iNOS and TNF and possessed T cell priming abilities. These results point to a yet unappreciated ambiguous role for a multi-effector, IFNβ producing subpopulation of Tip-DCs in controlling the balance between containment of L. monocytogenes infection and effects detrimental to the host driven by IFNβ."
https://openalex.org/W2047727462,"Background Febrile malaria is the most common clinical manifestation of P. falciparum infection, and is often the primary endpoint in clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Subjective and objective fevers are both used to define the endpoint, but have not been carefully compared, and the relative incidence of clinical malaria by active and passive case detection is unknown. Methods We analyzed data from cohorts under active and passive surveillance, including 19,462 presentations with fever and 5,551 blood tests for asymptomatic parasitaemia. A logistic regression model was used to calculate Malaria Attributable Fractions (MAFs) for various case definitions. Incidences of febrile malaria by active and passive surveillance were compared in a subset of children matched for age and location. Results Active surveillance identified three times the incidence of clinical malaria as passive surveillance in a subset of children matched for age and location. Objective fever (temperature≥37.5°C) gave consistently higher MAFs than case definitions based on subjective fever. Conclusion The endpoints from active and passive surveillance have high specificity, but the incidence of endpoints is lower on passive surveillance. Subjective fever had low specificity and should not be used in primary endpoint. Passive surveillance will reduce the power of clinical trials but may cost-effectively deliver acceptable sensitivity in studies of large populations."
https://openalex.org/W2100411267,"Individual variability in emotion processing may be associated with genetic variation as well as with psychological predispositions such as dispositional affect styles. Our previous fMRI study demonstrated that amygdala reactivity was independently predicted by affective-cognitive styles (phobic prone or eating disorders prone) and genotype of the serotonin transporter in a discrimination task of fearful facial expressions. Since the insula is associated with the subjective evaluation of bodily states and is involved in human feelings, we explored whether its activity could also vary in function of individual differences. In the present fMRI study, the association between dispositional affects and insula reactivity has been examined in two groups of healthy participants categorized according to affective-cognitive styles (phobic prone or eating disorders prone). Images of the faces of partners and strangers, in both painful and neutral situations, were used as visual stimuli. Interaction analyses indicate significantly different activations in the two groups in reaction to a loved one's pain: the phobic prone group exhibited greater activation in the left posterior insula. These results demonstrate that affective-cognitive style is associated with insula activity in pain empathy processing, suggesting a greater involvement of the insula in feelings for a certain cohort of people. In the mapping of individual differences, these results shed new light on variability in neural networks of emotion."
https://openalex.org/W2059879137,"Assemblages associated with intertidal rocky shores were examined for large scale distribution patterns with specific emphasis on identifying latitudinal trends of species richness and taxonomic distinctiveness. Seventy-two sites distributed around the globe were evaluated following the standardized sampling protocol of the Census of Marine Life NaGISA project (www.nagisa.coml.org). There were no clear patterns of standardized estimators of species richness along latitudinal gradients or among Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs); however, a strong latitudinal gradient in taxonomic composition (i.e., proportion of different taxonomic groups in a given sample) was observed. Environmental variables related to natural influences were strongly related to the distribution patterns of the assemblages on the LME scale, particularly photoperiod, sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall. In contrast, no environmental variables directly associated with human influences (with the exception of the inorganic pollution index) were related to assemblage patterns among LMEs. Correlations of the natural assemblages with either latitudinal gradients or environmental variables were equally strong suggesting that neither neutral models nor models based solely on environmental variables sufficiently explain spatial variation of these assemblages at a global scale. Despite the data shortcomings in this study (e.g., unbalanced sample distribution), we show the importance of generating biological global databases for the use in large-scale diversity comparisons of rocky intertidal assemblages to stimulate continued sampling and analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2021919859,"Background Griffithsin, a 121-residue protein isolated from a red algal Griffithsia sp., binds high mannose N-linked glycans of virus surface glycoproteins with extremely high affinity, a property that allows it to prevent the entry of primary isolates and laboratory strains of T- and M-tropic HIV-1. We used the sequence of a portion of griffithsin's sequence as a design template to create smaller peptides with antiviral and carbohydrate-binding properties. Methodology/Results The new peptides derived from a trio of homologous β-sheet repeats that comprise the motifs responsible for its biological activity. Our most active antiviral peptide, grifonin-1 (GRFN-1), had an EC50 of 190.8±11.0 nM in in vitro TZM-bl assays and an EC50 of 546.6±66.1 nM in p24gag antigen release assays. GRFN-1 showed considerable structural plasticity, assuming different conformations in solvents that differed in polarity and hydrophobicity. Higher concentrations of GRFN-1 formed oligomers, based on intermolecular β-sheet interactions. Like its parent protein, GRFN-1 bound viral glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 via the N-linked glycans on their surface. Conclusion Its substantial antiviral activity and low toxicity in vitro suggest that GRFN-1 and/or its derivatives may have therapeutic potential as topical and/or systemic agents directed against HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W1975420361,"Reverse transcriptase is a major drug target in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) against HIV, which typically comprises two nucleoside/nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTIs) in combination with a non-nucleoside RT inhibitor or a protease inhibitor. Unfortunately, HIV is capable of escaping the therapy by mutating into drug-resistant variants. Computational models that correlate HIV drug susceptibilities to the virus genotype and to drug molecular properties might facilitate selection of improved combination treatment regimens.We applied our earlier developed proteochemometric modeling technology to analyze HIV mutant susceptibility to the eight clinically approved NRTIs. The data set used covered 728 virus variants genotyped for 240 sequence residues of the DNA polymerase domain of the RT; 165 of these residues contained mutations; totally the data-set covered susceptibility data for 4,495 inhibitor-RT combinations. Inhibitors and RT sequences were represented numerically by 3D-structural and physicochemical property descriptors, respectively. The two sets of descriptors and their derived cross-terms were correlated to the susceptibility data by partial least-squares projections to latent structures. The model identified more than ten frequently occurring mutations, each conferring more than two-fold loss of susceptibility for one or several NRTIs. The most deleterious mutations were K65R, Q151M, M184V/I, and T215Y/F, each of them decreasing susceptibility to most of the NRTIs. The predictive ability of the model was estimated by cross-validation and by external predictions for new HIV variants; both procedures showed very high correlation between the predicted and actual susceptibility values (Q2=0.89 and Q2ext=0.86). The model is available at www.hivdrc.org as a free web service for the prediction of the susceptibility to any of the clinically used NRTIs for any HIV-1 mutant variant.Our results give directions how to develop approaches for selection of genome-based optimum combination therapy for patients harboring mutated HIV variants."
https://openalex.org/W2011056838,"In a previous study we proposed that the depolarized state of the wake-promoting hypocretin/orexin (hcrt/orx) neurons was independent of synaptic inputs as it persisted in tetrodotoxin and low calcium/high magnesium solutions. Here we show first that these cells are hyperpolarized when external sodium is lowered, suggesting that non-selective cation channels (NSCCs) could be involved. As canonical transient receptor channels (TRPCs) are known to form NSCCs, we looked for TRPCs subunits using single-cell RT-PCR and found that TRPC6 mRNA was detectable in a small minority, TRPC1, TRPC3 and TRPC7 in a majority and TRPC4 and 5 in the vast majority (∼90%) of hcrt/orx neurons. Using intracellular applications of TRPC antibodies against subunits known to form NSCCs, we then found that only TRPC5 antibodies elicited an outward current, together with hyperpolarization and inhibition of the cells. These effects were blocked by co-application of a TRPC5 antigen peptide. Voltage-clamp ramps in the presence or absence of TRPC5 antibodies indicated the presence of a current with a reversal potential close to −15 mV. Application of the non-selective TRPC channel blocker, flufenamic acid, had a similar effect, which could be occluded in cells pre-loaded with TRPC5 antibodies. Finally, using the same TRPC5 antibodies we found that most hcrt/orx cells show immunostaining for the TRPC5 subunit. These results suggest that hcrt/orx neurons are endowed with a constitutively active non-selective cation current which depends on TRPC channels containing the TRPC5 subunit and which is responsible for the depolarized and active state of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2003433881,"Background The need for new therapies for cholangiocarcinoma is highlighted by their poor prognosis and refractoriness to chemotherapy. Increased production of Interleukin-6 promotes cholangiocarcinoma growth and contributes to chemoresistance by activating cell survival mechanisms. We sought to identify biologically active compounds capable of ameliorating the phenotypic effects of IL-6 expression and to explore their potential therapeutic use for cholangiocarcinoma. Methodology A genomic signature associated with Interleukin-6 expression in Mz-ChA-1 human malignant cholangiocytes was derived. Computational bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify compounds that induced inverse gene changes to the signature. The effect of these compounds on cholangiocarcinoma growth was then experimentally verified in vitro and in vivo. Interactions with other therapeutic agents were evaluated using median effects analysis. Principal Findings A group of structurally related compounds, nitrendipine, nifedipine and felodipine was identified. All three compounds were cytotoxic to Mz-ChA-1 cells with an IC50 for felodipine of 26 µM, nitrendipine, 44 µM and nifedipine, 15 µM. Similar results were observed in KMCH-1, CC-LP-1 and TFK-1 cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. At a fractional effect of 0.5, all three agents were synergistic with either camptothecin or gemcitabine in Mz-ChA-1 cells in vitro. Co-administration of felodipine and gemcitabine decreased the growth of Mz-ChA-1 cell xenografts in nude athymic mice. Conclusions Computational bioinformatics analysis of phenotype-based genomic expression can be used to identify therapeutic agents. Using this drug discovery approach based on targeting a defined tumor associated phenotype, we identified compounds with the potential for therapeutic use in cholangiocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2017535503,"Background Several studies point to a role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated if genetic variants in TLR genes are associated with RA and response to tumour necrosis factor blocking (anti-TNF) medication. Methodology and Principal Findings 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven TLR genes were genotyped in a Dutch cohort consisting of 378 RA patients and 294 controls. Significantly associated variants were investigated in replication cohorts from The Netherlands, United Kingdom and Sweden (2877 RA patients and 2025 controls). 182 of the Dutch patients were treated with anti-TNF medication. Using these patients and a replication cohort (269 Swedish patients) we analysed if genetic variants in TLR genes were associated with anti-TNF outcome. In the discovery phase of the study we found a significant association of SNPs rs2072493 in TLR5 and rs3853839 in TLR7 with RA disease susceptibility. Meta-analysis of discovery and replication cohorts did not confirm these findings. SNP rs2072493 in TLR5 was associated with anti-TNF outcome in the Dutch but not in the Swedish population. Conclusion We conclude that genetic variants in TLRs do not play a major role in susceptibility for developing RA nor in anti-TNF treatment outcome in a Caucasian population."
https://openalex.org/W1985213036,"Patterning and differentiation of developing musculatures require elaborate networks of transcriptional regulation. In Drosophila, significant progress has been made into identifying the regulators of muscle development and defining their interactive networks. One major family of transcription factors involved in these processes consists of homeodomain proteins. In flies, several members of this family serve as muscle identity genes to specify the fates of individual muscles, or groups thereof, during embryonic and/or adult muscle development. Herein, we report on the expression and function of a new Drosophila homeobox gene during both embryonic and adult muscle development.The newly described homeobox gene, termed lateral muscles scarcer (lms), which has yet uncharacterized orthologs in other invertebrates and primitive chordates but not in vertebrates, is expressed exclusively in subsets of developing muscle tissues. In embryos, lms is expressed specifically in the four lateral transverse (LT) muscles and their founder cells in each hemisegment, whereas in larval wing imaginal discs, it is expressed in myoblasts that develop into direct flight muscles (DFMs), which are important for proper wing positioning. We have analyzed the regulatory inputs of various other muscle identity genes with overlapping or complementary expression patterns towards the cell type specific regulation of lms expression. Further we demonstrate that lms null mutants exhibit reduced numbers of embryonic LT muscles, and null mutant adults feature held-out-wing phenotypes. We provide a detailed description of the pattern and morphology of the direct flight muscles in the wild type and lms mutant flies by using the recently-developed ultramicroscopy and show that, in the mutants, all DFMs are present and present normal morphologies.We have identified the homeobox gene lms as a new muscle identity gene and show that it interacts with various previously-characterized muscle identity genes to regulate normal formation of embryonic lateral transverse muscles. In addition, the direct flight muscles in the adults require lms for reliably exerting their functions in controlling wing postures."
https://openalex.org/W2075568923,"Background Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome mutations can lead to energy and respiratory-related disorders like myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fiber disease (MERRF), mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke (MELAS) syndrome, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). It is not well understood what effect the distribution of mutated mtDNA throughout the mitochondrial matrix has on the development of mitochondrial-based disorders. Insight into this complex sub-cellular heterogeneity may further our understanding of the development of mitochondria-related diseases. Methodology This work describes a method for isolating individual mitochondria from single cells and performing molecular analysis on that single mitochondrion's DNA. An optical tweezer extracts a single mitochondrion from a lysed human HL-60 cell. Then a micron-sized femtopipette tip captures the mitochondrion for subsequent analysis. Multiple rounds of conventional DNA amplification and standard sequencing methods enable the detection of a heteroplasmic mixture in the mtDNA from a single mitochondrion. Significance Molecular analysis of mtDNA from the individually extracted mitochondrion demonstrates that a heteroplasmy is present in single mitochondria at various ratios consistent with the 50/50 heteroplasmy ratio found in single cells that contain multiple mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2072831337,"The genetic basis of phenotypic variation can be partially explained by the presence of copy-number variations (CNVs). Currently available methods for CNV assessment include high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays that have become an indispensable tool in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, insufficient concordance rates between different CNV assessment methods call for cautious interpretation of results from CNV-based genetic association studies. Here we provide a cross-population, microarray-based map of copy-number variant regions (CNVRs) to enable reliable interpretation of CNV association findings. We used the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 to scan the genomes of 1167 individuals from two ethnically distinct populations (Europe, N = 717; Rwanda, N = 450). Three different CNV-finding algorithms were tested and compared for sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility. Two algorithms were subsequently used to construct CNVR maps, which were also validated by processing subsamples with additional microarray platforms (Illumina 1M-Duo BeadChip, Nimblegen 385K aCGH array) and by comparing our data with publicly available information. Both algorithms detected a total of 42669 CNVs, 74% of which clustered in 385 CNVRs of a cross-population map. These CNVRs overlap with 862 annotated genes and account for approximately 3.3% of the haploid human genome. We created comprehensive cross-populational CNVR-maps. They represent an extendable framework that can leverage the detection of common CNVs and additionally assist in interpreting CNV-based association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2061545113,"Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is an important crop plant that is widely grown to produce both natural textile fibers and cottonseed oil. Cotton fibers, the economically more important product of the cotton plant, are seed trichomes derived from individual cells of the epidermal layer of the seed coat. It has been known for a long time that large numbers of genes determine the development of cotton fiber, and more recently it has been determined that these genes are distributed across At and Dt subgenomes of tetraploid AD cottons. In the present study, the organization and evolution of the fiber development genes were investigated through the construction of an integrated genetic and physical map of fiber development genes whose functions have been verified and confirmed. A total of 535 cotton fiber development genes, including 103 fiber transcription factors, 259 fiber development genes, and 173 SSR-contained fiber ESTs, were analyzed at the subgenome level. A total of 499 fiber related contigs were selected and assembled. Together these contigs covered about 151 Mb in physical length, or about 6.7% of the tetraploid cotton genome. Among the 499 contigs, 397 were anchored onto individual chromosomes. Results from our studies on the distribution patterns of the fiber development genes and transcription factors between the At and Dt subgenomes showed that more transcription factors were from Dt subgenome than At, whereas more fiber development genes were from At subgenome than Dt. Combining our mapping results with previous reports that more fiber QTLs were mapped in Dt subgenome than At subgenome, the results suggested a new functional hypothesis for tetraploid cotton. After the merging of the two diploid Gossypium genomes, the At subgenome has provided most of the genes for fiber development, because it continues to function similar to its fiber producing diploid A genome ancestor. On the other hand, the Dt subgenome, with its non-fiber producing D genome ancestor, provides more transcription factors that regulate the expression of the fiber genes in the At subgenome. This hypothesis would explain previously published mapping results. At the same time, this integrated map of fiber development genes would provide a framework to clone individual full-length fiber genes, to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of the fiber differentiation, elongation, and maturation, and to systematically study the functional network of these genes that interact during the process of fiber development in the tetraploid cottons."
https://openalex.org/W2170145404,"Local adaptation to different environments can promote mating isolation--either as an incidental by-product of trait divergence, or as a result of selection to avoid maladaptive mating. Numerous recent empirical examples point to the common influence of divergent natural selection on speciation based largely on evidence of strong pre-mating isolation between populations from different habitat types. Accumulating evidence for natural selection's influence on speciation is therefore no longer a challenge. The difficulty, rather, is in determining the mechanisms involved in the progress of adaptive divergence to speciation once barriers to gene flow are already present. Here, we present results of both laboratory and field experiments with Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from different environments, who do not show complete reproductive isolation despite adaptive divergence. We investigate patterns of mating isolation between populations that do and do not exchange migrants and show evidence for both by-product and reinforcement mechanisms depending on female ecology. Specifically, low-predation females discriminate against all high-predation males thus implying a by-product mechanism, whereas high-predation females only discriminate against low-predation males from further upstream in the same river, implying selection to avoid maladaptive mating. Our study thus confirms that mechanisms of adaptive speciation are not necessarily mutually exclusive and uncovers the complex ecology-geography interactions that underlie the evolution of mating isolation in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1971807361,"Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) has been implicated in regulating chromosomal alignment and mitotic progression but the physiological substrates mediating these GSK3-dependent effects have not been identified. Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 4 (CRMP4) is a cytosolic phosphoprotein known to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and is a known physiological substrate of GSK3. In this study, we investigate the role of CRMP4 during mitosis.Here we demonstrate that during mitosis CRMP4 phosphorylation is regulated in a GSK3-dependent manner. We show that CRMP4 localizes to spindle microtubules during mitosis and loss of CRMP4 disrupts chromosomal alignment and mitotic progression. The effect of CRMP4 on chromosomal alignment is dependent on phosphorylation by GSK3 identifying CRMP4 as a critical GSK3 substrate during mitotic progression. We also provide mechanistic data demonstrating that CRMP4 regulates spindle microtubules consistent with its known role in the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton.Our findings identify CRMP4 as a key physiological substrate of GSK3 in regulating chromosomal alignment and mitotic progression through its effect on spindle microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2075169862,"Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is a primary food-borne bacterial pathogen capable of causing life-threatening human infections which poses a serious challenge to public health worldwide. Intimin, the bacterial outer-membrane protein, plays a key role in the initiating process of EHEC infection. This activity is dependent upon translocation of the intimin receptor (Tir), the intimin binding partner of the bacteria-encoded host cell surface protein. Intimin has attracted considerable attention due to its potential function as an antibacterial drug target. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Tir-binding domain of intimin (Int188) from E. coli O157:H7 at 2.8 Å resolution, together with a mutant (IntN916Y) at 2.6 Å. We also built the structural model of EHEC intimin-Tir complex and analyzed the key binding residues. It suggested that the binding pattern of intimin and Tir between EHEC and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) adopt a similar mode and they can complement with each other. Detailed structural comparison indicates that there are four major points of structural variations between EHEC and EPEC intimins: one in Domain I (Ig-like domain), the other three located in Domain II (C-type lectin-like domain). These variations result in different binding affinities. These findings provide structural insight into the binding pattern of intimin to Tir and the molecular mechanism of EHEC O157: H7."
https://openalex.org/W2094666098,"Background Apart from the platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1, CD31), endoglin (CD105) and a positive factor VIII-related antigen staining, human primary and immortalized macro- and microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) differ in their cell surface expression of activating and inhibitory ligands for natural killer (NK) cells. Here we comparatively study the effects of irradiation on the phenotype of ECs and their interaction with resting and activated NK cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Primary macrovascular human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) only express UL16 binding protein 2 (ULBP2) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related protein MIC-A (MIC-A) as activating signals for NK cells, whereas the corresponding immortalized EA.hy926 EC cell line additionally present ULBP3, membrane heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (CD54) and HLA-E. Apart from MIC-B, the immortalized human microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC, resembles the phenotype of EA.hy926. Surprisingly, primary HUVECs are more sensitive to Hsp70 peptide (TKD) plus IL-2 (TKD/IL-2)-activated NK cells than their immortalized EC counterpatrs. This finding is most likely due to the absence of the inhibitory ligand HLA-E, since the activating ligands are shared among the ECs. The co-culture of HUVECs with activated NK cells induces ICAM-1 (CD54) and HLA-E expression on the former which drops to the initial low levels (below 5%) when NK cells are removed. Sublethal irradiation of HUVECs induces similar but less pronounced effects on HUVECs. Along with these findings, irradiation also induces HLA-E expression on macrovascular ECs and this correlates with an increased resistance to killing by activated NK cells. Irradiation had no effect on HLA-E expression on microvascular ECs and the sensitivity of these cells to NK cells remained unaffected. Conclusion/Significance These data emphasize that an irradiation-induced, transient up-regulation of HLA-E on macrovascular ECs might confer protection against NK cell-mediated vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2026554242,"Incidental entanglement in fishing gear is arguably the most serious threat to many populations of small cetaceans, judging by the alarming number of captured animals. However, other aspects of this threat, such as the potential capture of mother-offspring pairs or reproductive pairs, could be equally or even more significant but have rarely been evaluated. Using a combination of demographic and genetic data we provide evidence that i) Franciscana dolphin pairs that are potentially reproductive and mother-offspring pairs form temporal bonds, and ii) are entangled simultaneously. Our results highlight potential demographic and genetic impacts of by-catch to cetacean populations: the joint entanglement of mother-offspring or reproductive pairs, compared to random individuals, might exacerbate the demographic consequences of by-catch, and the loss of groups of relatives means that significant components of genetic diversity could be lost together. Given the social nature of many odontocetes (toothed cetaceans), we suggest that these potential impacts could be rather general to the group and therefore by-catch could be more detrimental than previously considered."
https://openalex.org/W2003438798,"Hedgehog (Hh) signalling plays an important role in various developmental processes by activating the Cubitus interruptus (Ci)/Glioblastoma (Gli) family of transcription factors. In the process of proper pattern formation, Ci activity is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including processing, trafficking, and degradation. However, it remains elusive how Ci distinctly recognizes the strong and moderate Hh signals. Roadkill (Rdx) induces Ci degradation in the anterior region of the Drosophila wing disc. Here, we report that Rdx inhibited Ci activity by two different mechanisms. In the region abutting the anterior/posterior boundary, which receives strong Hh signal, Rdx inhibited the nuclear import of Ci by releasing importin α3 from Ci. In this region, Rdx negatively regulated the expression of transcription factor Knot/Collier. In farther anterior regions receiving moderate levels of Hh signal, Rdx induced Ci degradation, as reported previously. Thus, two different mechanisms by which Rdx negatively regulates Ci may play an important role in the fine-tuning of Hh responses."

The MPZ gene is regulated, in part, by the transcription factors SOX10 and EGR2. Mutations in MPZ, SOX10, and EGR2 have been implicated in demyelinating peripheral neuropathies, suggesting that components of this transcriptional network are candidates for harboring disease-causing mutations (or otherwise functional variants) that affect MPZ expression.We utilized a combination of multi-species sequence comparisons, transcription factor-binding site predictions, targeted human DNA re-sequencing, and in vitro and in vivo enhancer assays to study human non-coding MPZ variants.Our efforts revealed a variant within the first intron of MPZ that resides within a previously described SOX10 binding site is associated with decreased enhancer activity, and alters binding of nuclear proteins. Additionally, the genomic segment harboring this variant directs tissue-relevant reporter gene expression in zebrafish.This is the first reported MPZ variant within a cis-acting transcriptional regulatory element. While we were unable to implicate this variant in disease onset, our data suggests that similar non-coding sequences should be screened for mutations in patients with neurological disease. Furthermore, our multi-faceted approach for examining the functional significance of non-coding variants can be readily generalized to study other loci important for myelin structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1990162430,"Background In recent years, there is aroused interest in expressing complex systems as networks of interacting nodes. Using descriptors from graph theory, it has been possible to classify many diverse systems derived from social and physical sciences alike. In particular, folded proteins as examples of self-assembled complex molecules have also been investigated intensely using these tools. However, we need to develop additional measures to classify different systems, in order to dissect the underlying hierarchy. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study, a general analytical relation for the dependence of nearest neighbor degree correlations on degree is derived. Dependence of local clustering on degree is shown to be the sole determining factor of assortative versus disassortative mixing in networks. The characteristics of networks constructed from spatial atomic/molecular systems exemplified by self-organized residue networks built from folded protein structures and block copolymers, atomic clusters and well-compressed polymeric melts are studied. Distributions of statistical properties of the networks are presented. For these densely-packed systems, assortative mixing in the network construction is found to apply, and conditions are derived for a simple linear dependence. Conclusions Our analyses (i) reveal patterns that are common to close-packed clusters of atoms/molecules, (ii) identify the type of surface effects prominent in different close-packed systems, and (iii) associate fingerprints that may be used to classify networks with varying types of correlations."
https://openalex.org/W2078863038,"Background A functional link has been established between the severe neurodegenerative disorder Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy and the enhanced propensity of the plasma protein transthyretin (TTR) to form aggregates in patients with single point mutations in the TTR gene. Previous work has led to the establishment of an experimental model based on transgenic expression of normal or mutant forms of human TTR in Drosophila flies. Remarkably, the severity of the phenotype was greater in flies that expressed a single copy than with two copies of the mutated gene. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we analyze the distribution of normal and mutant TTR in transgenic flies, and the ultrastructure of TTR-positive tissues to clarify if aggregates and/or amyloid filaments are formed. We report the formation of intracellular aggregates of 20 nm spherules and amyloid filaments in thoracic adipose tissue and in brain glia, two tissues that do not express the transgene. The formation of aggregates of nanospherules increased with age and was more considerable in flies with two copies of mutated TTR. Treatment of human neuronal cells with protein extracts prepared from TTR flies of different age showed that the extracts from older flies were less toxic than those from younger flies. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that the uptake of TTR from the circulation and its subsequent segregation into cytoplasmic quasi-crystalline arrays of nanospherules is part of a mechanism that neutralizes the toxic effect of TTR."
https://openalex.org/W2161063308,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful strategy for studying the phenotypic consequences of reduced gene expression levels in model systems. To develop a method for the rapid characterization of the developmental consequences of gene dysregulation, we tested the use of RNAi for “transient transgenic” knockdown of mRNA in mouse embryos. These methods included lentiviral infection as well as transposition using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) and PiggyBac (PB) transposable element systems. This approach can be useful for phenotypic validation of putative mutant loci, as we demonstrate by confirming that knockdown of Prdm16 phenocopies the ENU-induced cleft palate (CP) mutant, csp1. This strategy is attractive as an alternative to gene targeting in embryonic stem cells, as it is simple and yields phenotypic information in a matter of weeks. Of the three methodologies tested, the PB transposon system produced high numbers of transgenic embryos with the expected phenotype, demonstrating its utility as a screening method."
https://openalex.org/W2059496990,"Greater than 75% of all hematologic malignancies derive from germinal center (GC) or post-GC B cells, suggesting that the GC reaction predisposes B cells to tumorigenesis. Because GC B cells acquire expression of the highly mutagenic enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), GC B cells may require additional DNA repair capacity. The goal of this study was to investigate whether normal human B cells acquire enhanced expression of DNA repair factors upon AID induction. We first demonstrated that several DNA mismatch repair, homologous recombination, base excision repair, and ATR signaling genes were overexpressed in GC B cells relative to naïve and memory B cells, reflecting activation of a process we have termed somatic hyperrepair (SHR). Using an in vitro system, we next characterized activation signals required to induce AID expression and SHR. Although AID expression was induced by a variety of polyclonal activators, SHR induction strictly required signals provided by contact with activated CD4+ T cells, and B cells activated in this manner displayed reduced levels of DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We further show the induction of SHR is independent of AID expression, as GC B cells from AID -/- mice retained heightened expression of SHR proteins. In consideration of the critical role that CD4+ T cells play in inducing the SHR process, our data suggest a novel role for CD4+ T cells in the tumor suppression of GC/post-GC B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2045198447,"The Coastal Giant Salamander (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) is classified as threatened at the northern periphery of its range in British Columbia (BC), Canada, primarily due to forestry practices and habitat fragmentation. Characterising dispersal behaviour and population connectivity is therefore a priority for this region, while genetic differentiation in core versus peripheral locations remains unstudied in this wide-ranging species. We present seven new polymorphic microsatellite markers for use in population genetic analyses of D. tenebrosus. We examine locus characteristics and genetic variation in 12 streams at the species' northern range limit in BC, and within two regions representing sub-peripheral (North Cascades) and core localities (South Cascades) in Washington State, United States. In BC, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2–5 and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.044–0.825. Genetic differentiation was highest between BC and the South Cascades, and intermediate between BC and the North Cascades. Across loci, mean allelic richness was similar across regions, while private allelic richness was highest in the core locality (corrected for sample size). These new microsatellite loci will be a valuable addition to existing markers for detailed landscape and population genetic analyses of D. tenebrosus across its range."
https://openalex.org/W2027905390,"A number of studies have previously demonstrated that ""goodness of fit"" is insufficient in reliably classifying the credibility of a biological model. Robustness and/or sensitivity analysis is commonly employed as a secondary method for evaluating the suitability of a particular model. The results of such analyses invariably depend on the particular parameter set tested, yet many parameter values for biological models are uncertain.Here, we propose a novel robustness analysis that aims to determine the ""common robustness"" of the model with multiple, biologically plausible parameter sets, rather than the local robustness for a particular parameter set. Our method is applied to two published models of the Arabidopsis circadian clock (the one-loop [1] and two-loop [2] models).

However, both the factors leading to adoption and living as an adoptee may bias the studies with regard to the relative influence of genes and environment compared to the general population. The aim was to investigate whether the cohort of domestic adoptees used for these studies in Denmark is similar to the general population with respect to all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality rates.13,111 adoptees born in Denmark in 1917, or later, and adopted in 1924 to 1947 were compared to all Danes from the same birth cohorts using standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The 12,729 adoptees alive in 1970 were similarly compared to all Danes using SMR as well as cause-specific SMR.The excess in all-cause mortality before age 65 years in adoptees was estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI 1.26-1.35). Significant excess mortality before age 65 years was also observed for infections, vascular deaths, cancer, alcohol-related deaths and suicide. Analyses including deaths after age 65 generally showed slightly less excess in mortality, but the excess was significant for all-cause mortality, cancer, alcohol-related deaths and suicides.Adoptees have an increased all-cause mortality compared to the general population. All major specific causes of death contributed, and the highest excess is seen for alcohol-related deaths."

We have previously shown that depletion of NK cells in rats leads to increased bacterial burden upon L. monocytogenes infection, and that a subset of NK cells encompassing the majority of Ly49 receptors (Ly49s3+ NK cells) contributed to this effect. In this study, we have further investigated how the Ly49s3+ NK cell subset is affected by L. monocytogenes infection. We observed an increased percentage of Ly49s3+ NK cells in the spleen and a reduction in the bone marrow within the first 48 hrs of L. monocytogenes infection. Concomitantly, we observed increased expression levels of the inflammatory chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 by Ly49s3+ bone marrow NK cells, as compared to Ly49s3− NK cells, suggesting involvement of Ly49s3+ NK cells in the early phase of infection. However, NK cell production of IFN-γ was independent of Ly49 receptor expression. Furthermore, we observed increased expression levels of MHC class I molecules on both macrophages and NK cells during the first 48 hrs of infection, paralleled by a reduction in the surface expression of Ly49s3 on NK cells. In conclusion, L. monocytogenes infection modulates the tissue distribution of Ly49s3+ NK cells, and induces increased MHC class I expression and hence reduced surface expression of Ly49 receptors on NK cells. These changes indicate that L. monocytogenes infection may have multiple effects on NK cells in vivo, and suggests the involvement of Ly49-expressing NK cells in the immune responses towards L. monocytogenes."
