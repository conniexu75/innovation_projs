https://openalex.org/W2144038313,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory RNAs found in multicellular eukaryotes, including humans, where they are implicated in cancer. The let-7 miRNA times seam cell terminal differentiation in C. elegans. Here we show that the let-7 family negatively regulates let-60/RAS. Loss of let-60/RAS suppresses let-7, and the let-60/RAS 3'UTR contains multiple let-7 complementary sites (LCSs), restricting reporter gene expression in a let-7-dependent manner. mir-84, a let-7 family member, is largely absent in vulval precursor cell P6.p at the time that let-60/RAS specifies the 1 degrees vulval fate in that cell, and mir-84 overexpression suppresses the multivulva phenotype of activating let-60/RAS mutations. The 3'UTRs of the human RAS genes contain multiple LCSs, allowing let-7 to regulate RAS expression. let-7 expression is lower in lung tumors than in normal lung tissue, while RAS protein is significantly higher in lung tumors, providing a possible mechanism for let-7 in cancer."

We used these measurements to construct tomographic images of the principal geological units of California, with low-speed anomalies corresponding to the main sedimentary basins and high-speed anomalies corresponding to the igneous cores of the major mountain ranges. This method can improve the resolution and fidelity of crustal images obtained from surface-wave analyses."

https://openalex.org/W2114111268,"TNFalpha is a pleiotropic cytokine that induces either cell proliferation or cell death. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation increases susceptibility to TNFalpha-induced death, concurrent with sustained JNK activation, an important contributor to the death response. Sustained JNK activation in NF-kappaB-deficient cells was suggested to depend on reactive oxygen species (ROS), but how ROS affect JNK activation was unclear. We now show that TNFalpha-induced ROS, whose accumulation is suppressed by mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, cause oxidation and inhibition of JNK-inactivating phosphatases by converting their catalytic cysteine to sulfenic acid. This results in sustained JNK activation, which is required for cytochrome c release and caspase 3 cleavage, as well as necrotic cell death. Treatment of cells or experimental animals with an antioxidant prevents H(2)O(2) accumulation, JNK phosphatase oxidation, sustained JNK activity, and both forms of cell death. Antioxidant treatment also prevents TNFalpha-mediated fulminant liver failure without affecting liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2098534820,"It is important for animals to estimate the value of rewards as accurately as possible. Because the number of potential reward values is very large, it is necessary that the brain's limited resources be allocated so as to discriminate better among more likely reward outcomes at the expense of less likely outcomes. We found that midbrain dopamine neurons rapidly adapted to the information provided by reward-predicting stimuli. Responses shifted relative to the expected reward value, and the gain adjusted to the variance of reward value. In this way, dopamine neurons maintained their reward sensitivity over a large range of reward values."
https://openalex.org/W2134613265,"Cerebral deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides is an invariant pathological hallmark in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and transgenic mice coexpressing familial AD-linked APP and PS1 variants. We now report that exposure of transgenic mice to an ""enriched environment"" results in pronounced reductions in cerebral Abeta levels and amyloid deposits, compared to animals raised under ""standard housing"" conditions. The enzymatic activity of an Abeta-degrading endopeptidase, neprilysin, is elevated in the brains of ""enriched"" mice and inversely correlated with amyloid burden. Moreover, DNA microarray analysis revealed selective upregulation in levels of transcripts encoded by genes associated with learning and memory, vasculogenesis, neurogenesis, cell survival pathways, Abeta sequestration, and prostaglandin synthesis. These studies provide evidence that environmental enrichment leads to reductions in steady-state levels of cerebral Abeta peptides and amyloid deposition and selective upregulation in levels of specific transcripts in brains of transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2074915514,"AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of unstable mRNAs dictate their degradation. An RNAi-based screen performed in Drosophila S2 cells has revealed that Dicer1, Argonaute1 (Ago1) and Ago2, components involved in microRNA (miRNA) processing and function, are required for the rapid decay of mRNA containing AREs of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The requirement for Dicer in the instability of ARE-containing mRNA (ARE-RNA) was confirmed in HeLa cells. We further observed that miR16, a human miRNA containing an UAAAUAUU sequence that is complementary to the ARE sequence, is required for ARE-RNA turnover. The role of miR16 in ARE-RNA decay is sequence-specific and requires the ARE binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP). TTP does not directly bind to miR16 but interacts through association with Ago/eiF2C family members to complex with miR16 and assists in the targeting of ARE. miRNA targeting of ARE, therefore, appears to be an essential step in ARE-mediated mRNA degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1993525477,"Physical, genetic, and chemical-genetic interactions centered on the conserved chaperone Hsp90 were mapped at high resolution in yeast using systematic proteomic and genomic methods. Physical interactions were identified using genome-wide two hybrid screens combined with large-scale affinity purification of Hsp90-containing protein complexes. Genetic interactions were uncovered using synthetic genetic array technology and by a microarray-based chemical-genetic screen of a set of about 4700 viable yeast gene deletion mutants for hypersensitivity to the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. An extended network, consisting of 198 putative physical interactions and 451 putative genetic and chemical-genetic interactions, was found to connect Hsp90 to cofactors and substrates involved in a wide range of cellular functions. Two novel Hsp90 cofactors, Tah1 (YCR060W) and Pih1 (YHR034C), were also identified. These cofactors interact physically and functionally with the conserved AAA(+)-type DNA helicases Rvb1/Rvb2, which are key components of several chromatin remodeling factors, thereby linking Hsp90 to epigenetic gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2119992455,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from 686 wild and domestic pig specimens place the origin of wild boar in island Southeast Asia (ISEA), where they dispersed across Eurasia. Previous morphological and genetic evidence suggested pig domestication took place in a limited number of locations (principally the Near East and Far East). In contrast, new genetic data reveal multiple centers of domestication across Eurasia and that European, rather than Near Eastern, wild boar are the principal source of modern European domestic pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2148866736,"Signaling pathways transmit information through protein interaction networks that are dynamically regulated by complex extracellular cues. We developed LUMIER (for luminescence-based mammalian interactome mapping), an automated high-throughput technology, to map protein-protein interaction networks systematically in mammalian cells and applied it to the transforming growth factorâÎ² (TGFÎ²) pathway. Analysis using self-organizing maps and k -means clustering identified links of the TGFÎ² pathway to the p21-activated kinase (PAK) network, to the polarity complex, and to Occludin, a structural component of tight junctions. We show that Occludin regulates TGFÎ² type I receptor localization for efficient TGFÎ²-dependent dissolution of tight junctions during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions."
https://openalex.org/W1988869609,"Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) internalize antigens and present antigen-derived peptides to T cells. Although APCs have been thought to exhibit a well-developed capacity for lysosomal proteolysis, here we found that they can exhibit two distinct strategies upon antigen encounter. Whereas macrophages contained high levels of lysosomal proteases and rapidly degraded internalized proteins, dendritic cells (DCs) and B lymphocytes were protease-poor, resulting in a limited capacity for lysosomal degradation. Consistent with these findings, DCs in vivo degraded internalized antigens slowly and thus retained antigen in lymphoid organs for extended periods. Limited lysosomal proteolysis also favored antigen presentation. These results help explain why DCs are able to efficiently accumulate, process, and disseminate antigens and microbes systemically for purposes of tolerance and immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2151476452,"All eukaryotes have three nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, namely, Pol I, II, and III. Interestingly, plants have catalytic subunits for a fourth nuclear polymerase, Pol IV. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Pol IV does not functionally overlap with Pol I, II, or III and is nonessential for viability. However, disruption of the Pol IV catalytic subunit genes NRPD1 or NRPD2 inhibits heterochromatin association into chromocenters, coincident with losses in cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S gene clusters and AtSN1 retroelements. Loss of CG, CNG, and CNN methylation in Pol IV mutants implicates a partnership between Pol IV and the methyltransferase responsible for RNA-directed de novo methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, 5S gene and AtSN1 siRNAs are essentially eliminated in Pol IV mutants. The data suggest that Pol IV helps produce siRNAs that target de novo cytosine methylation events required for facultative heterochromatin formation and higher-order heterochromatin associations."
https://openalex.org/W2147926680,"Appropriate cell number and organ size in a multicellular organism are determined by coordinated cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Disruption of these processes can cause cancer. Recent studies have identified the Large tumor suppressor (Lats)/Warts (Wts) protein kinase as a key component of a pathway that controls the coordination between cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here we describe growth inhibitory functions for a Mob superfamily protein, termed Mats (Mob as tumor suppressor), in Drosophila. Loss of Mats function results in increased cell proliferation, defective apoptosis, and induction of tissue overgrowth. We show that mats and wts function in a common pathway. Mats physically associates with Wts to stimulate the catalytic activity of the Wts kinase. A human Mats ortholog (Mats1) can rescue the lethality associated with loss of Mats function in Drosophila. As Mats1 is mutated in human tumors, Mats-mediated growth inhibition and tumor suppression is likely conserved in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2131601308,"Coordinating growth and communication between adjacent cells is a critical yet poorly understood aspect of tissue development and organ morphogenesis. We report a Rho GTPase signaling network underlying the jigsaw puzzle appearance of Arabidopsis leaf pavement cells, in which localized outgrowth in one cell is coordinated with localized inhibition of outgrowth of the adjacent cell to form interdigitating lobes and indentations. Locally activated ROP2, a Rho-related GTPase from plants, activates RIC4 to promote the assembly of cortical actin microfilaments required for localized outgrowth. Meanwhile, ROP2 inactivates another target RIC1, whose activity promotes well-ordered cortical microtubules. RIC1-dependent microtubule organization not only locally inhibits outgrowth but in turn suppresses ROP2 activation in the indentation zones. Thus, outgrowth-promoting ROP2 and outgrowth-inhibiting RIC1 pathways antagonize each other. We propose that the counteractivity of these two pathways demarcates outgrowing and indenting cortical domains, coordinating a process that gives rise to interdigitations between adjacent pavement cells."
https://openalex.org/W2138498649,"We have shown previously that sulforaphane (SFN), a constituent of many edible cruciferous vegetables including broccoli, suppresses growth of prostate cancer cells in culture as well as in vivo by causing apoptosis, but the sequence of events leading to cell death is poorly defined. Using PC-3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cells as a model, we now demonstrate, for the first time, that the initial signal for SFN-induced apoptosis is derived from reactive oxygen species (ROS). Exposure of PC-3 cells to growth-suppressive concentrations of SFN resulted in ROS generation, which was accompanied by disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytosolic release of cytochrome c, and apoptosis. All these effects were significantly blocked on pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine and overexpression of catalase. The SFN-induced ROS generation was significantly attenuated on pretreatment with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I inhibitors, including diphenyleneiodonium chloride and rotenone. SFN treatment also caused a rapid and significant depletion of GSH levels. Collectively, these observations indicate that SFN-induced ROS generation is probably mediated by a nonmitochondrial mechanism involving GSH depletion as well as a mitochondrial component. Ectopic expression of Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-2, in PC-3 cells offered significant protection against the cell death caused by SFN. In addition, SFN treatment resulted in an increase in the level of Fas, activation of caspase-8, and cleavage of Bid. Furthermore, SV40-immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Bid knock-out mice displayed significant resistance toward SFN-induced apoptosis compared with wild-type MEFs. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that SFN-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is initiated by ROS generation and that both intrinsic and extrinsic caspase cascades contribute to the cell death caused by this highly promising cancer chemopreventive agent.

Our own work revealed that the SFN-mediated G2-M phase cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells was associated with activation of checkpoint kinase 2, which promoted Ser216 phosphorylation of Cdc25C leading to its translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol (21Singh S.V.

Thus, significant progress has been made toward our understanding of the mechanism of cell cycle arrest by SFN (15Gamet-Payrastre L. Li P. Lumeau S. Cassar G. Dupont M.A. Chevolleau S. Gasc N.

On the other hand, the signaling pathway by which SFN initiates the cell death process is poorly defined. An understanding of the mechanism of SFN-induced apoptosis is critical for its clinical development because this knowledge could lead to identification of mechanism-based biomarkers potentially useful in future clinical trials. Previous studies have documented down-regulation of Bcl-2 in SFN-treated cells (16Fimognari C. Nüsse M. Cesari R. Iori R. Cantelli-Forti G. Hrelia P. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18Wang L. Liu D. Ahmed T. Chung F.L. Conaway C. Chiao J.W. Int. J.

Singh S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), yet studies are lacking that could directly test the role of this anti-apoptotic protein in cell death caused by SFN. Similarly, activation of caspases on treatment with SFN has been reported (20Singh A.V. Xiao D. Lew K.L. Dhir R. Singh S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of caspase activation remains elusive. Using PC-3 and DU145 human prostate cancer cells as a model, we demonstrate the following: (a) cell death caused by SFN is initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS); (b) the SFN-induced apoptosis is significantly attenuated by ectopic expression of Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2; and (c) both intrinsic and extrinsic caspase cascades contribute to the cell death caused by SFN. Reagents—SFN (purity >99%) was purchased from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN). Reagents for cell culture including F-12K Nutrient Mixture, DMEM, penicillin, streptomycin antibiotic mixture, and serum were purchased from Invitrogen. The kits for determination of catalase (catalog number 707002) and superoxide dismutase (catalog number 706002) activities and glutathione (GSH) levels (catalog number 703002) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Propidium iodide, NAC, RNaseA, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and rotenone were from Sigma; hydroethidine (HE), 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); and diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) was from Calbiochem. The combined SOD/catalase mimetic EUK-134 was a generous gift from Eukarion, Inc. (Bedford, MA). The antibodies against Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD; catalog number 574597), Mn-SOD (catalog number 574596) and catalase (catalog number 219010) were from Calbiochem; antibodies against cytochrome c (catalog number 556432), caspase-8 (catalog number 551242), caspase-9 (catalog number 552036), and Bcl-xL (catalog number 556361) were from Pharmingen (Palo Alto, CA); antibodies against Bid (catalog number sc-6538), Bok (catalog number sc-11424), Bim EL (catalog number sc-11425), and FADD (catalog number sc-5559) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Bcl-2 antibody (catalog number M0887) was from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA); anti-Fas antibody (catalog number AAP-221) was from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada); anti-cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) antibody (Cox IV; catalog numberA21348) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); antibody against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; catalog number SA-250) was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); and anti-actin antibody was from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Monolayer cultures of PC-3 cells were maintained in F-12K Nutrient Mixture (Kaighn's modification) supplemented with 7% nonheat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. PC-3 cells stably transfected with Bcl-2 (PC-3/Bcl-2) and vector-transfected control cells (PC-3/neo) were generously provided by Dr. Natasha Kyprianou (University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) and cultured similarly except in the presence of 500 μg of G418/ml (Invitrogen). The DU145 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wild-type and Bid knock-out (Bid–/–) mice and immortalized by transfection with a plasmid containing SV40 genomic DNA were generously provided by Dr. Stanley J. Korsmeyer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) (23Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar). The MEFs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 0.1 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. Each cell line was maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The effect of SFN on cell survival was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay as described by us previously (20Singh A.V. Xiao D. Lew K.L. Dhir R. Singh S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 24Xiao D. Choi S. Johnson D.E. Vogel V.G. Johnson C.S. Trump D.L. Lee Y.J. Singh S.V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5594-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Measurement of ROS—Intracellular ROS generation was measured by flow cytometry following staining with HE and H2DCFDA, which have been shown to be somewhat specific for detection of O2−˙ and H2O2, respectively (25Rothe G. Valet G.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 26Narayanan P.K. Goodwin E.H. Lehnert B.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3963-3971PubMed Google Scholar). The HE is oxidized to ethidium bromide, whereas H2DCFDA is cleaved by nonspecific cellular esterases and oxidized in the presence of H2O2 and peroxidases to yield fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes, allowed to attach overnight, and exposed to different concentrations of SFN for specified time intervals. Stock solution of SFN was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and an equal volume of Me2SO was added to the controls. The cells were counterstained with 2 μm HE and 5 μm H2DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected, and the fluorescence was analyzed using a Coulter Epics XL Flow Cytometer. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with NAC, DPI, or rotenone prior to SFN exposure and analysis of ROS generation. Immunoblotting—The cells were treated with SFN as described above, and both floating and attached cells were collected and lysed as described by us previously (20Singh A.V. Xiao D. Lew K.L. Dhir R. Singh S.V. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 21Singh S.V. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Singh A.V. Lew K.L. Srivastava S.K. Kamath R. Brown K.D. Zhang L. Baskaran R.

Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions from control and SFN-treated cells were prepared using a kit from BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA (catalog number K256-100). The lysate proteins were resolved by 6–12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with a solution containing Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5–10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and then exposed to the desired primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following treatment with the appropriate secondary antibody, the bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence method. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody to correct for differences in protein loading. The change in protein level was determined by densitometric scanning of the immunoreactive bands followed by correction for actin loading control. The immunoblotting for each protein was performed at least twice using independently prepared lysates, and the results were similar. SOD and Catalase Activity Determination—PC-3 cells (5 × 105) were plated in T25 flasks, allowed to attach overnight, and exposed to Me2SO (control) or SFN (20 or 40 μm) for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were collected, washed with PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 6 min. The cell pellet was suspended in ice-cold 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7) containing 1 mm EDTA, sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was used for determination of catalase or SOD activity using kits from Cayman Chemical according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glutathione Assay—The effect of SFN treatment on the intracellular level of GSH was determined by using a kit from Cayman Chemical. Briefly, PC-3 cells (1 × 106) were plated in T25 flasks, and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were exposed to Me2SO (control) or 40 μm SFN for the specified time period at 37 °C. The cells were collected by scraping, washed with PBS, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and counted. An equal number of cells from each treatment group was used for the determination of GSH according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using fluorescent lipophilic cationic dye TMRM, which accumulates within mitochondria in a potential-dependent manner. Briefly, cells (5 × 105) were plated in 60-mm culture dishes, allowed to attach overnight, exposed to desired concentrations of SFN for specified time period, and collected by trypsinization. The cells were then resuspended in growth medium and stained with 0.2 μm TMRM for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and the fluorescence was measured using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 25 μm), an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, was used as a positive control. Electron Microscopy—Transmission electron microscopy to determine the effect of SFN treatment on mitochondrial morphology was performed essentially as described previously (27Watkins S.C. Cullen M.J. J. Neurol. Sci. 1987; 82: 181-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC-3 cells (2 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were then treated with either Me2SO (control) or 40 μm SFN for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were fixed in ice-cold 2.5% electron microscopy grade glutaraldehyde (in 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.3)). The specimens were rinsed with PBS, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 0.1% potassium ferricyanide, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol (30–90%,) and embedded in Epon (dodecenyl succinic anhydride, nadic methyl anhydride, scipoxy 812 resin, and dimethylaminomethyl; Energy Beam Sciences). Semi-thin (300 nm) sections were cut using a Reichart Ultracut, stained with 0.5% toluidine blue, and examined under a light microscope. Ultrathin sections (65 nm) were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and examined on a JEOL 1210 transmission electron microscope at ×50,000 magnification. Apoptosis Assays—Apoptosis induction by SFN was assessed as follows: (a) by fluorescence microscopic analysis of cells with condensed and fragmented DNA following staining with DAPI; (b) quantitation of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation; and (c) flow cytometric analysis of cells with sub-G0-G1 DNA content following staining with propidium iodide. For DAPI assay, cells (2 × 104) were plated on coverslips, allowed to attach overnight, and exposed to Me2SO or SFN. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 4 min, washed again, and stained by incubation with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 30 min. The cells with condensed and fragmented DNA (apoptotic cells) were scored using a Leica DC300F fluorescence microscope at ×40 magnification. Cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation was determined using a kit from Roche Applied Science according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The sub-G0-G1 fraction was quantified by flow cytometry as described previously (21Singh S.V. Herman-Antosiewicz A. Singh A.V. Lew K.L. Srivastava S.K. Kamath R. Brown K.D. Zhang L. Baskaran R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25813-25822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Catalase Overexpression—Adenoviral constructs for enhanced green fluorescence protein (Ad-EGFP) or catalase (Ad-catalase) have been described previously (28Song J.J. Rhee J.G. Suntharalingam M. Walsh S.A. Spitz D.R. Lee Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46566-46575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The DU145 cells (2 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates, allowed to attach, infected with Ad-EGFP (5 multiplicity of infections) or Ad-catalase (20 multiplicity of infections), and treated with Me2SO or 40 μm SFN for the specified time points. The cells were then processed for analysis of ROS generation, immunoblotting, or apoptosis as described above. Transfection of PC-3 Cells with Bcl-xL—PC-3 cells were transfected with pSFFV-Bcl-xL and pSFFV-neo plasmids (a generous gift from Dr. Stanley J. Korsmeyer) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were grown in media containing 800 μg of G418/ml for 3 weeks. Several G418-resistant clones were expanded and screened for the Bcl-xL protein levels by immunoblotting. The clone with the highest expression (clone 18) was selected for functional studies and maintained in the presence of 500 μg of G418/ml. Determination of Caspase Activity—Caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities were determined by using a kit from Clontech and R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively, according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were plated and allowed to attach overnight. The medium was replaced with fresh completed medium containing 40 μm SFN. After incubation for the specified time point at 37 °C, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and lysed using 50 μl of manufacturer supplied lysis buffer. The reaction mixture contained 50 μl of cell lysate, 50 μl of reaction buffer, 5 μl of caspase-8- or caspase-9-specific peptide substrate conjugated to p-nitroanilide. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Absorbance at 405 nm, due to release of p-nitroanilide from the peptide substrate, was measured using a Labsystem Multiskan Plus plate reader. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with specified concentration of NAC or EUK-134 prior to addition of SFN and determination of caspase activity. Immunohistochemistry for Cytochrome c Localization—The MEFs derived from wild-type and Bid–/– mice were cultured on coverslips and treated with 30 μm SFN or Me2SO (control) for 8 h. The MEFs were then washed with PBS and stained for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 nm of the mitochondria-specific dye MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; catalog number M7513). After washing with PBS, MEFs were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After washing with PBS and BSA buffer (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.15% glycine), the MEFs were incubated with normal goat serum (1:20 dilution with BSA buffer, Sigma; ca"
https://openalex.org/W1965525371,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, reduced levels of the replicative α DNA polymerase result in greatly elevated frequencies of chromosome translocations and chromosome loss. We selected translocations in a small region of chromosome III and found that they involve homologous recombination events between yeast retrotransposons (Ty elements) on chromosome III and retrotransposons located on other chromosomes. One of the two preferred sites of these translocations on chromosome III involve two Ty elements arrayed head-to-head; disruption of this site substantially reduces the rate of translocations. We demonstrate that this pair of Ty elements constitutes a preferred site for double-strand DNA breaks when DNA replication is compromised, analogous to the fragile sites observed in mammalian chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2084460699,"Gag proteins direct the process of retroviral particle assembly and form the major protein constituents of the viral core. The matrix region of the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein plays a critical role in the transport of Gag to the plasma membrane assembly site. Recent evidence indicates that Gag trafficking to late endosomal compartments, including multivesicular bodies, occurs prior to viral particle budding from the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that the matrix region of HIV-1 Gag interacts directly with the delta subunit of the AP-3 complex, and that this interaction plays an important functional role in particle assembly. Disruption of this interaction eliminated Gag trafficking to multivesicular bodies and diminished HIV particle formation. These studies illuminate an early step in retroviral particle assembly and provide evidence that the trafficking of Gag to late endosomes is part of a productive particle assembly pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1991570972,"Wear limits the life-span of many mechanical devices with moving parts. To reduce wear, lubricants are frequently enriched with additives, such as zinc phosphates, that form protective films on rubbing surfaces. Using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of films derived from commercial additives, we unraveled the molecular origin of how antiwear films can form, function, and dissipate energy. These effects originate from pressure-induced changes in the coordination number of atoms acting as cross-linking agents to form chemically connected networks. The proposed mechanism explains a diverse body of experiments and promises to prove useful in the rational design of antiwear additives that operate on a wider range of surface materials, with reduced environmental side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2091364176,"Insulin receptor substrates-1 and 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2) are pivotal in relaying insulin signaling in insulin-responsive tissues such as muscle. However, the precise contribution of IRS-1 vis-à-vis IRS-2 in insulin-mediated metabolic and mitogenic responses has not been compared directly in differentiated muscle cells. This study aimed to determine the relative contribution of IRS-1 versus IRS-2 in these responses, using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated specific gene silencing. In L6 myotubes, transfection of siRNA targeted specifically against IRS-1 (siIRS-1) or IRS-2 (siIRS-2) reduced the cognate protein expression by 70–75%. Insulin-induced ERK phosphorylation was much more sensitive to IRS-2 than IRS-1 ablation, whereas p38MAPK phosphorylation was reduced by 43 or 62% in myotubes treated with siIRS-1 or siIRS-2, respectively. Insulin-induced Akt1 and Akt2 phosphorylation was reduced in myotubes treated with siIRS-1, but only Akt2 phosphorylation was reduced in myotubes treated with siIRS-2. In contrast, siIRS-1 treatment caused a marked reduction in insulin-induced actin remodeling, glucose uptake, and GLUT4 translocation, and siIRS-2 was without effect on these responses. Notably, combined siIRS-1 and siIRS-2, although reducing each IRS by around 75%, caused no further drop in glucose uptake than that achieved with siIRS-1 alone, but abolished p38MAPK phosphorylation. We conclude that insulin-stimulated Akt1 phosphorylation, actin remodeling, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake are regulated mainly by IRS-1, whereas IRS-2 contributes selectively to ERK signaling, and Akt2 and p38MAPK lie downstream of both IRS in muscle cells.

Defining the exact roles of IRS isoforms in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is not without controversy.

Interestingly, when stimulated with insulin ex vivo, isolated soleus muscles from the IRS-2-null and wild type mice had similar glucose uptake response, albeit with a lower basal glucose transport rate, suggesting that IRS-2 may not be required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle (27Higaki Y.

Of note, the total GLUT4 expression was decreased in the IRS-2-null mice, yet the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake response was not diminished. A later in vivo study using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, however, showed that although IRS-1 is the major regulator of glucose transport in muscle, IRS-2 also participates in glucose metabolism in muscle, fat, and liver (28Previs S.F.

The objective of this study was to determine the relative contribution of IRS-1 versus IRS-2 in these responses, using siRNA-mediated specific gene silencing. The transient nature of siRNA-mediated protein reduction minimizes the possibility of compensatory up-regulation of other proteins that may mask the biological consequences of eliminating IRS-1/2. In addition, we made use of the L6-GLUT4myc rat skeletal muscle cell line that stably expresses a myc-tagged GLUT4, where the expression of the GLUT4myc is constant and resistant to manipulations that may affect expression of other proteins (34Huang C. Somwar R. Patel N. Niu W. Torok D. Klip A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This allows us to determine the importance of IRS-1/2 in the regulation of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation without the confounding factor of altered GLUT4 expression (34Huang C. Somwar R.

Materials—Phospho-specific antibodies to p38MAPK (dual phosphorylated Thr180 and Tyr182), Akt (Thr308 and Ser473), and ERK were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, and anti-Rat-Akt2 (immunoaffinity-purified sheep IgG) antibodies (for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence experiments) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Dr. Morris White generously provided rabbit anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 antibodies used for immunoprecipitation. Polyclonal anti-myc (A14) and anti-Akt1 (D17-goat IgG) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). SiRNAs targeted against IRS-1 (siIRS-1), IRS-2 (siIRS-2), and nonrelevant control (siNR) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The sequence of the IRS-1 siRNA used was AAC AAG ACA GCU GGU ACC AGG, and the nonrelevant control X was AUU CUA UCA CUA GCG UGA CUU. The nonrelevant control siRNA sequence was screened against the expressed sequence tag gene bank data base and had no homology to the vertebrate genome. IRS-2 Smartpool® siRNA was designed by and purchased from Dharmacon. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Human insulin (Humulin R) was purchased from Eli Lilly Canada, Inc. (Toronto, ON). Cytochalasin B, mercuric chloride, d-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, all protease inhibitors, and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD reagent) were from Sigma. 2-Deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

GLUT4myc myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes in α-MEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% antibiotics/antimycotics over 7 days. Myotube cultures contained less than 20% mononucleated cells. Cultures were deprived of serum for 5 h prior to stimulation with insulin. Transfection of siRNA—L6 myotubes were transfected with siIRS-1 or siNR using Oligofectamine Reagent from Invitrogen as per the manufacturer's instruction, with minor modifications. The differentiation medium was changed to antibiotic-free growth medium on day 3 of myotube differentiation, and on day 4, 400 nm siRNA was transfected using Oligofectamine in serum-free α-MEM. 4 h after transfection, α-MEM containing 6% FBS was added to each well to a final concentration of 2% FBS (v/v). The siRNA duplex was never removed from the medium when using the Oligofectamine transfection protocol. In some experiments, siRNA to IRS-1 was also introduced to cells using the calcium phosphate protocol required for effective IRS-2 gene silencing as described below, and equivalent IRS-1 knock-downs were achieved with either Oligofectamine or calcium phosphate-based transfection reagent, as detailed under “Results.” L6 myoblasts were transfected with siIRS-2 using a calcium phosphate-based transfection reagent (CellPhect transfection kit, Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells were seeded at 30% confluence in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS without antibiotics/antimycotics. On day 2, myoblasts were transfected with 50 nm siRNA, and the medium was changed 12–14 h later to α-MEM supplemented with 2% FBS with 1% antibiotics/antimycotics. Cells were transfected again on day 5 with 100 nm siRNA. SiRNA transfection had no deleterious effects on either cell viability or fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes. Double elimination of IRS-1 and IRS-2 was achieved using the calcium phosphate transfection protocol described above. Fluorescence Microscopy—L6-GLUT4myc myotubes grown on 25-mm-diameter glass coverslips were deprived of serum for 5 h and treated with 0–100 nm insulin for 10 min at 37 °C. Myotubes were fixed with paraformaldehyde immediately at 4 °C after insulin stimulation and permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 3 min to preserve actin morphology. Actin filaments were labeled with rhodamine-coupled phalloidin, and immunostaining of IRS-1 or IRS-2 in fixed and permeabilized myotubes was carried out as described previously (39Patel N. Rudich A. Khayat Z.A. Garg R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4611-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Primary antibody (IRS-1 and IRS-2 purchased from Upstate Biotechnology) was used at 1:500 dilution. Cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Acquisition parameters were adjusted to exclude saturation of the pixels. For quantification, such parameters were kept constant among the various conditions compared. Determination of 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake—2-Deoxyglucose uptake measurements were carried out as described previously (36Ueyama A. Yaworsky K.L. Wang Q. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 5 min in HEPES-buffered saline containing 10 μm 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (0.5 μCi/ml) in the absence of insulin. Glucose transport was stopped with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl containing 1 mm HgCl2. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B and subtracted from all experimental values. Immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 and IRS-2—L6 myotubes were stimulated with insulin for 5 min (for IRS-1 studies) or 3 min (for IRS-2 studies), times at which phosphorylation of each isoform peaks (13Ogihara T. Shin B.C. Anai M. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Funaki M. Fukushima Y. Ishihara H. Takata K. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol.

Briefly, 500 μg or 1 mg of protein of whole cell lysates in Triton X-100 were incubated with IRS-1- or IRS-2-specific antibodies at 4 °C overnight under constant rotation, and the antibody-antigen complex was pulled down by protein A/G-Sepharose beads. The pelleted protein was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 or IRS-2 was detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Immunoprecipitation of Akt1 and Akt2—L6 myotubes were stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min. We have determined previously that 10 min of stimulation yields maximal phosphorylation of Akt in these cells (44Niu W. Huang C. Nawaz Z. Levy M. Somwar R. Li D. Bilan P.J. Klip A. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation of Akt1 and Akt2 was performed from 200 μg of cell lysates in Triton X-100 containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (44Niu W. Huang C. Nawaz Z. Levy M. Somwar R. Li D. Bilan P.J. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17953-17962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The antibody-antigen complex was pulled down by protein A/G-Sepharose beads. The pelleted proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and serine and threonine phosphorylation of Akt1 or Akt2 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Akt-Ser473 or -Thr308 antibody. Reverse Transcription-PCR of Insulin Receptor Isoforms—Isolation of total RNA and reverse transcription-PCR of insulin receptor from L6 myotubes were performed as described previously (41JeBailey L. Rudich A. Huang X. Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Kapus A. Klip A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The primers used to amplify insulin receptor were: CAT TCA GGA AGA CCT TCG AGG and TCT GGG GAG TCC TGA TTG CAT. Measurement of GLUT4myc Translocation in L6 Myotubes—Cell surface myc-tagged GLUT4 was quantified by an antibody-coupled colorimetric assay as validated previously (35Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, after a 20-min incubation with insulin at indicated concentrations, confluent myotubes were exposed to anti-myc antibody (1:100) for 60 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:750) for 45 min, all at 4 °C. Cells were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 ml of OPD reagent was added for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 0.25 ml of 3 n HCl. The supernatant was collected, and absorbance was measured at 492 nm. Nonspecific IgG binding, as measured by a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and omitting the primary antibody, was subtracted from all experimental values. Detection of Cellular Protein Expression and Protein Phosphorylation—Whole cell lysates were made from myotubes after incubation with insulin (0–100 nm) for 10 min (as described previously (42Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)). We have determined previously that 10 min of stimulation yields maximal phosphorylation of Akt and p38MAPK and is also the time shown previously to yield robust ERK phosphorylation in these cells (43Pirola L. Bonnafous S. Johnston A.M. Chaussade C. Portis F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15641-15651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 40 μg of lysates was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters, which were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C under constant agitation (dilutions: polyclonal anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2, 1:1,000; anti-Akt, anti-ERK, and anti-p38MAPK, 1:500–1:1,000; anti-phospho-Akt-Ser473 or -Thr308, antiphospho-ERK, and anti-phospho-p38MAPK, 1:500), followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:15,000 goat anti-rabbit antibody, 1:7,500 sheep anti-mouse antibody). Protein was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method and scanned within the linear range using ImageJ software. Insulin-stimulated Tyrosine Phosphorylation of IRS-2 Is More Insulin-sensitive Than That of IRS-1—We first compared the insulin sensitivity of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with that of IRS-2. L6-GLUT4myc myotubes were incubated with increasing concentrations of insulin (0.5–100 nm) for 3–5 min, and the results were expressed as a percentage of the response observed at 100 nm insulin. As shown in Fig. 1, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2 is more sensitive at low concentrations of insulin than is IRS-1, with an EC50 of 0.5 nm for IRS-2 versus 5–8 nm for IRS-1. A similar difference of insulin sensitivity of IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in myoblasts (results not shown). Hence, any possible presence of myoblasts in the cultures would be unlikely to be responsible for the marked difference in insulin-sensitivity of IRS-1 and IRS-2. Akt Phosphorylation Is More Insulin-sensitive Than Phosphorylation of p38MAPK or ERK—Akt, p38MAPK, and ERK have been shown to regulate GLUT4 translocation, glucose uptake, and mitogenic responses, respectively. However, with the exception of Akt, i"
https://openalex.org/W1986965597,"Estrogen has been shown to affect vascular cell and arterial function in vitro and in vivo. Here we examined the ability of estradiol (E2) to cause rapid arterial dilation of elastic and muscular arteries in vivo and the mechanisms involved. E2 administration caused a rapid increase in the outer wall diameter of both types of arteries in ovariectomized female mice. This resulted from estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated stimulation of nitric oxide production, demonstrated by preinjecting the mice arteries with a soluble inhibitor of nitric oxide (monomethyl l-arginine) and by showing the absence of E2 action in eNOS-/- mice. Rapid activation of both ERK/MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity was found in the E2-exposed arteries, and inhibiting either kinase prevented the vasodilatory action of E2. Kinase activation and vasodilator responses to E2 were absent in either ERα or ERβ knock-out mice, implicating both receptor subtypes as mediating this E2 action. These results indicate that E2 modulation of arterial tonus through plasma membrane ER and rapid signaling could underlie many previously observed actions of estrogen reported to occur in women.

Estrogen has been suggested to modulate vascular physiology and function from a variety of studies in cellular, animal, and human models. Administration of sublingual estradiol to women significantly reduces exercise-induced myocardial ischemia (1Rosano G.M.C. Sarrel P.M. Poole-Wilson P.A. Collins P.

Relevant to this proposed model, E2 rescues rodents from ischemia-reperfusion injury of their small arteries in muscle, via signaling to NO (5Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K.

In contrast, conjugated estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone does not prevent the occurrence of primary or secondary arteriosclerotic heart disease (10Writing Group for the Women's Health Initiative J.

This indicates that estrogen may modulate discrete aspects of cardiovascular tone and function, unrelated to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. One potentially important action of estrogen is to induce arterial dilation. Vasodilation opposes excessive vasoconstriction that results in decreased blood flow and increased systemic vascular resistance. How might E2 rapidly induce dilation of the arterial wall? This is likely to occur through binding vascular cell receptors, because ERα and ERβ are present in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (12Colburn P. Buonassisi V.

Traditionally, it is felt that steroid sex hormones act in cells after binding their nuclear receptors (14Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The steroid-receptor complex then binds specific response elements in the 5′ promoter region of target genes. Gene transactivation may also result from more complex protein-protein interactions between the ER, transcription factors such as AP-1, co-activators such as SRC-1, and the basal transcriptional machinery proteins. Additionally, there is evidence for plasma membrane-localized ER that rapidly signal through G proteins to discrete cell biological functions (reviewed in Ref. 15Levin E.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In vitro, E2 rapidly stimulates the release of prolactin (16Pappas T.C. Gametchu B. Yannariello-Brown J. Collins T.J. Watson C.S. Endocrine. 1994; 2: 813-822Google Scholar), cAMP (17Aronica S.M. Kraus W.L. Katznellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8517-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), and triggers a calcium spike in seconds (18Tesarik J. Mendoza C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E2 activates signal cascades that culminate in the activation of ERK, a member of the MAP kinase family (19Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). E2 preserves neurons from in vitro insults that cause apoptosis or necrosis via signaling through ERK activation (20Singer C.A. Figueroa-Masot X.A. Batchelor R.H. Dorsa D.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, E2 rapidly activates NO synthase activity via ERK or PI3K and membrane ER in endothelial cells (EC) (21Chen Z. Yuhanna I.S. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Karas R.H. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 22Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The sex steroid prevents the vascular smooth muscle response in rodents to acute vascular injury (angioplasty), preventing the closure of the vessel lumen (23Pare G. Krust A. Karas R.H. Dupont S. Aronovitz M. Chambon P. Mendelsohn M.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We showed previously in vitro that E2 stimulates a p38 MAP kinase-MAPKAP-2 and heat shock protein 27 cascade, leading to EC survival and the formation of primitive capillary tubes (9Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38540-38546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the ability of intra-arterial E2 and its mechanism to effect rapid vascular dilation. We found that the sex steroid acts in both elastic and muscular arteries and causes vasodilation through rapid signal transduction to NO generation. These effects were mediated by both the ERα and ERβ receptors and were likely the result of membrane ER action. Animal Preparation—Homozygous inbred mice (C57BL/10 strain) with body weight of 22.8 ± 2.9 g (mean ± S.D.) and age 80.6 ± 9.7 days were used in this study. Thirty-eight mice underwent ovariectomy by the vendor, and the remaining 14 mice (6 females and 8 males) were intact for comparison. In additional studies, ovariectomized ERα genedeleted mice, ovariectomized ERβ KO mice, and ovariectomized eNOS KO mice were used (n = 4–6 mice/group). Also, 8 wild type mice (same age and strain) were used for comparison to the KO mice. The mice were preanesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (56.2 mg/kg) and midazolam (3.75 mg/kg) to achieve requisite immobilization and then were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg). Carotid blood pressure was measured by inserting a catheter into the common carotid artery, and femoral artery pressure was measured through insertion of a catheter into the femoral artery connected to a pressure transducer. 200 units/ml heparin was administered to prevent blood clots via a jugular vein catheter. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with national and local ethical guidelines, including the Institute of Laboratory Animal Research Guide, Public Health Service policy, Animal Welfare Act, and University of California, Irvine, policies regarding the use of animals in research. Vasodilatory Effects of E2—In the first experiment, the cannulated femoral artery was loosely ligated in the proximal (cephalad) position, and the artery was then filled with Krebs-Ringer lactate (KRL) solution. Blood pressure measurements were continuously recorded over a 10-min period. On this stable background, the ligature was released. The artery was re-ligated, and the vessel was filled with E2 at 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 nm in KRL solution, and the pressure was varied between 60 and 150 mm Hg, in increments of 30 mm Hg. The same study was later repeated in the carotid artery (order reversed in alternating mice). To determine whether the effect of E2 was mediated through ER action, 10-6 m ICI182780, a potent and specific ER antagonist, was dissolved in KRL and used to fill the ligated carotid and femoral arteries for 10 min, and the distension protocol and the relevant parameters were recorded. At that time, the volume was withdrawn, and the artery was re-ligated. The segment was then filled with 10 nm E2 + ICI182780 in KRL, and the parameters were recorded for 20 additional min. Pressure diameter relations and the response to E2 in the ovariectomized and intact mice were recorded. The external geometry of the artery at a given pressurized state was photographed to obtain the loaded outer diameter and the in vivo axial length (using the Aver TV 4.0 program). The in vivo outer diameter was quantified from the images, using a morphometric analysis system (SigmaScan version 5.0). Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance, p < 0.05, as significant for comparisons of control versus E2. The Role of NO—In the next set of experiments, we examined if the rapid vasodilation induced by E2/ER was because of the release of an endothelial-derived relaxing factor substance, most likely NO. The arteries were first filled for 10 min with KRL and then1 μm monomethyl l-arginine (l-NAME), a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor in KRL, then filled with 10 nm E2 + l-NAME in KRL for 20 min. To implicate further NO, the effect of E2 alone was assessed in ovariectomized eNOS-/- mice (The Jackson Laboratories). To determine the signaling required for E2/ER to release NO in vivo, the arteries were filled with PD98059 (1 μm), a specific MEK inhibitor that was previously shown to block E2-induced ERK activation in vitro. This was compared with the ligated artery filled with 10 nm E2 + PD98059. To determine a contribution from PI3K activation, the arteries were filled with a PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (100 μm), for 10 min of recording, prior to exposing the artery to 10 nm E2 + wortmannin. ER KO Studies—We then determined which ER mediates the ability of E2 to induce vasodilation. Ovariectomized ERα KO mice were created by Lubahn et al. (24Lubahn D.B. Moyer J.S. Golding T.S. Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11162-11166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar), and ERβ KO mice were produced by the Wyeth Research Institute (25Shughrue P.J. Askew G.R. Dellovade T.L. Merchenthaler I. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The femoral and carotid arteries were utilized as described above, and the data shown are at 120 mm Hg. In Vivo Kinase Activity—The carotid or femoral artery was filled with 10 nm E2, or KRL alone as control, for the 10 min of the experiment. The isolated artery segment was rapidly excised, with the distal and proximal segments suture ligated, and the mouse was rapidly euthanized. The artery segments were dropped into liquid nitrogen, pulverized, and solubilized in kinase binding buffer, and ERK or AKT protein was immunoprecipitated. Kinase activity was determined in vitro as described previously (26Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44385-44398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Myelin basic protein was used as substrate for ERK activity, and an antibody to phosphorylated AKT (Ser-473) reflected PI3K activity, as determined by Western blot. ERK or AKT total protein was shown to normalize activity results. The activity was derived from 3 to 5 pooled arteries from separate mice E2 Rapidly Dilates Elastic and Muscular Arteries—Female ovariectomized mice were anesthetized, and their carotid (elastic) and femoral (muscular) arteries were sequentially cannulated, allowing for sensitive measurements of arterial wall diameter, reflecting constriction or dilation. Each isolated artery was filled with Krebs-Ringer lactate (KRL) solution, and the arterial wall outer diameter was measured optically at various imposed static pressures (60–150 mm Hg), each over 20 min. These measurements were compared with arteries filled with KRL containing various concentrations of E2. The sex steroid produced a significant increase in arterial wall diameter in both arteries within 2 min, compared with KRL alone, and was seen at all pressures (Fig. 1A). This occurred at concentrations as low as 1 nm E2 (data not shown). To determine whether this was mediated through ER action, the arteries were first filled for 10 min with KRL and 1 μm ICI182780, a potent and specific ER antagonist. ICI182780 specifically blocked vasodilation induced by 10 nm E2 but only in the femoral artery (Fig. 1B). Most interestingly, ICI182780 by itself acted as an agonist in the carotid artery, inducing dilation comparable with E2 through a similar mechanism (Fig. 1A and see below). Intact female or male mice did not respond to E2, probably because of the effects of endogenous E2 (data not shown). NO Mediates the Vasodilator Effect of E2—A possible mediator of the vasorelaxing action of E2 is NO. We initially implicated this vasodilator, in that E2-induced arterial dilation in either artery was substantially prevented by brief pretreatment with the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, monomethyl l-arginine (l-NAME) (Fig. 2B). Most interestingly, the novel agonist effect of ICI182780 in the carotid artery was also prevented by l-NAME (Fig. 2A). To implicate further NO, we determined the effect of E2 in ovariectomized eNOS-/- mice. The rapid arterial dilation induced by E2 in ovariectomized wild type mice was not seen in ovariectomized eNOS-deleted mice (Fig. 2C). Here the results at physiological pressure (120 mm Hg) are shown and do not vary significantly over a range of 60–150 mm Hg. Most interestingly, the basal diameter of the artery was decreased in the eNOS KO mice, compared with wild type mice. This indicates an important contribution of NO to basal arterial tone (Fig. 2C and data not shown). These results indicate that acute arterial wall vasodilation occurs in response to E2, mediated through a rapid cross-talk from ER to eNOS, with subsequent NO production and action. E2 Stimulates Rapid Kinase-induced Arterial Dilation—Our results suggested a possible mechanism whereby nongenomic, rapid signaling from membrane ER up-regulates NO synthase enzymatic activity. Subsequent NO production then mediates the vasodilation action of the sex steroid, as shown above. In cultured cells, E2 has been reported to signal rapidly through ERK/MAP kinase and PI3K to induce NO synthase activity and NO generation (21Chen Z. Yuhanna I.S. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Karas R.H. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 22Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This is likely to occur through membrane ER, because ER targeted to the plasma membrane of cells supports kinase activation by E2. In contrast, ER targeted to the cell nucleus does not support rapid activation of ERK (27Razandi M. Oh P. Pedram A. Schnitzer J. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We then determined the role of rapid signaling pathways mediating this E2 action in vivo. We first showed that brief pretreatment of the arteries with soluble inhibitors of ERK (PD98059) or PI3K (wortmannin) each prevented E2-induced arterial dilation. This occurred in both arteries over the entire range of pressures (Fig. 3, A and B). Most interestingly, inhibition of either kinase also prevented the vasodilator effect of ICI182780 in the carotid artery (Fig. 3C). To support further the roles of these signal molecules in E2 action, we determined whether E2 activated these kinases in vivo. We measured arterial wall ERK and PI3K activity after exposing the lumen of the whole arterial segment in the anesthetized mouse to 10 min of 10 nm E2. E2 induced significant increases in ERK activity, and AKT phosphorylation at serine 473 (the latter reflecting PI3K activity) (Fig. 4A). Similarly, ICI182780 stimulated ERK and PI3K activities in the carotid artery (Fig. 4B) but not in the femoral artery (data not shown). Thus, we propose that rapid stimulation of these kinases by E2 induces the up-regulation of eNOS activity. This leads to the increased production of NO and subsequent vascular wall relaxation. A similar mechanism underlies the agonist effects of ICI182780 in the carotid artery. ERα and ERβ Mediate the Vasodilator Effect of E2—Which ER mediates the effects of E2? This is an important issue because there is evidence that ERα or ERβ underlies the various effects of E2 in the vasculature (3Zhu Y. Bian Z. Lu P. Karas R.H. Bao L. Cox D. Hodgin J. Shaul P.W. Thoren P. Smithies O. Gustafsson J.A. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 23Pare G. Krust A. Karas R.H. Dupont S. Aronovitz M. Chambon P. Mendelsohn M.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To determine this, we carried out studies in ovariectomized female ERα and ERβ KO mice. The KO mice were created as described previously (24Lubahn D.B. Moyer J.S. Golding T.S. Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11162-11166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 25Shughrue P.J. Askew G.R. Dellovade T.L. Merchenthaler I. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). E2 had no significant effect in either the carotid or femoral arterial beds of either the ERα or ERβ KO mice. In contrast, E2 caused dilation of the arteries of wild type mice (Fig. 5A). ICI182780 also caused dilation in the carotid artery of wild type mice, not seen in either KO mouse (Fig. 5B). Failure to dilate in these mice correlated with the inability of E2 or ICI182780 to stimulate ERK or PI3K activity in the carotid arteries from ERα or ERβ KO mice (Fig. 5C). Thus, it is E2 signaling to kinase activation via either receptor that mediates the acute dilation effects of the sex steroid in arteries. This is consistent with in vitro studies that implicate actions of membrane ERα or ERβ to up-regulate eNOS activity (28Chambliss K.L. Shaul P.W. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 665-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Our results define a novel mechanism by which estrogen modulates in vivo vascular tone. This suggests that E2 might mitigate endogenous mechanisms that increase vascular wall tone and could be important in the absence of estrogen input as occurs after the menopause. In women with coronary artery disease, E2 administration attenuates the paradoxical acetylcholine-induced coronary constriction (29Collins P. Rosano G.M. Sarrel P.M. Ulrich L. Adamopoulos S. Beale C.M. McNeill J.G. Poole-Wilson P.A. Circulation. 1995; 92: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Administration of premarin plus medroxyprogesterone to post-menopausal women for 3 months results in a significant increase in forearm blood flow, reflecting vasodilation (30Sanada M. Higashi Y. Nakagawa K. Tsuda M. Kodama I. Kimura M. Chayama K. Ohama K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In healthy young women, flow-mediated and NO-mediated arterial compliance of the forearm significantly changes during the menstrual cycle, correlating to estrogen blood concentration (31Williams M.R. Westerman R.A. Kingwell B.A. Paige J. Blombery P.A. Sudhir K. Komesaroff P.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5389-5395Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Additional chronic studies in humans support a mechanistically undefined relationship between estrogen and vasodilation (32McCrohon J.A. Walters W.A. Robinson J.T. McCredie R.J. Turner L. Adams M.R. Handelsman D.J. Celermajer D.S. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Herrington D.M. Braden G.A. Williams J.K. Morgan T.M. Am. J. Cardiol. 1994; 73: 951-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). How does E2 induce an increase in arterial wall diameter? Here we show that eNOS and nitric oxide mechanistically underlie this action of the sex steroid. The NO inhibitor, l-NAME, prevents the effects of E2, implying that eNOS activation and NO production from EC are important. More definitively, we showed that E2 does not produce the demonstrated vascular effects in the eNOS -/- mouse. eNOS is responsible for the majority of NO production from the EC. In vivo studies have shown that basal eNOS production is compromised in ERα-deleted mice (34Rubanyi G.M. Freay A.D. Kauser K. Sukovich D. Burton G. Lubahn D.B. Couse J.F. Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). E2 can also stimulate inducible nitricoxide synthase and NO production from vascular smooth muscle cells or arteries that have been denuded of endothelium (3Zhu Y. Bian Z. Lu P. Karas R.H. Bao L. Cox D. Hodgin J. Shaul P.W. Thoren P. Smithies O. Gustafsson J.A. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This may contribute to the observation that middle-aged male and female ERβ knock-out mice develop moderately severe hypertension (3Zhu Y. Bian Z. Lu P. Karas R.H. Bao L. Cox D. Hodgin J. Shaul P.W. Thoren P. Smithies O. Gustafsson J.A. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be that in the shorter term, eNOS stimulation from EC predominates, whereas longer term modulation may reflect NO production from both vascular cells through different NOS and ER isoforms. The ability of E2 to stimulate NO-mediated vasodilation appears to be linked to the stimulation of ERK and PI3K. We found that E2 activated both these kinases in the in vivo arterial segment filled with E2. This action of E2 was blocked by an ER antagonist and by specific soluble inhibitors of MEK (the kinase immediately upstream to ERK) and PI3K. This further correlated with the ability of PD98059 and wortmannin to inhibit the vasodilation induced by E2 in vivo. E2 can modulate EC paracellular permeability through eNOS- and inducible nitric-oxide synthase-related actions in vitro (35Cho M.M. Ziats N.P. Pal D. Utian W.H. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 276: C337-C349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed recently that E2 can activate more than 250 genes in a PI3K-dependent fashion, after exposure of EC to this sex steroid for only 40 min (36Pedram A. Razandi M. Aitkenhead M. Hughes C.C.W. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50768-50775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This includes genes such as Egr-1 that are induced by acute vascular injury and are proposed to mitigate vascular damage in vivo (37Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) Thus, the ability of E2 to activate rapid in vivo signaling through kinase cascades is meaningful to preserve beneficial vascular function. This reflects both rapid nongenomic and genomic actions in the vasculature. E2 rapidly signals to these kinase cascades, and this most likely originates from the small population of ER at the plasma membrane (15Levin E.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 27Razandi M. Oh P. Pedram A. Schnitzer J. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The membrane receptor is likely to be the nuclear receptor, translocated to the membrane (38Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, we recently reported that EC prepared from ERα/ERβ double knock-out mice fail to show detectable ER at the membrane or in the nucleus (39Razandi M. Pedram A. Merchenthaler I. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This suggests that the two receptor pools (membrane and nucleus) are products of the same ER genes coding for the α and β isoforms, respectively. The membrane population is responsible for rapid signal transduction through multiple pathways including those identified here. This idea is further supported in that targeted expression of ERα in the nucleus of ER-negative cells fails to support E2-induced rapid signaling, whereas expression at the membrane supports these functions (27Razandi M. Oh P. Pedram A. Schnitzer J. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It is ER at the membrane, for instance, that physically associates with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K in cells (5Simoncini T. Hafezi-Moghadam A. Brazil D.P. Ley K. Chin W.W. Liao J.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar) and activates NO (28Chambliss K.L. Shaul P.W. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 665-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In cells, the integrated functions of membrane and nuclear ER result in the overall ability of E2 to modulate biology. As a novel action, we report that ICI182780 rapidly stimulates vasodilation via ERK and PI3K signaling, and eNOS activation, similarly to E2. This only occurs in the carotid artery and not the femoral artery. In the latter, ICI182780 antagonized the effects of E2. The mechanism by which ICI182780 antagonizes the established rapid signaling from membrane ER (40Razandi M. Alton G. Pedram A. Ghonshani S. Webb D. Levin E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) has not been determined. This may be related to ICI182780 promoting a rapid internalization of membrane ER to endosomes (41Benten W.P. Stephan C. Lieberherr M. Wunderlich F. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or hastening receptor degradation through undetermined mechanisms. We speculate that in the carotid artery, ICI182780 does not enact the antagonistic mechanism found in the femoral artery. Furthermore, the conformation of the membrane ER in the carotid artery may allow ICI182780 to engage the receptor as an agonist. Further studies will be needed to dissect the differential mechanisms, using both in vitro and in vivo models. We also found that both ERα and ERβ mediate the actions of E2 shown here (Fig. 6). This was based on the lack of E2-induced dilation in the arteries of ERα or ERβ KO mice. Previous studies have indicated that both receptors are present on EC (28Chambliss K.L. Shaul P.W. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 665-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 42Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 938-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We recently showed that at the membrane of endothelial cells, ERα and ERβ exist both as homodimers and as heterodimers (39Razandi M. Pedram A. Merchenthaler I. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Karas and co-workers (23Pare G. Krust A. Karas R.H. Dupont S. Aronovitz M. Chambon P. Mendelsohn M.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) show that it is ERα that prevents the smooth muscle/medial arterial response to balloon angioplasty in rodents (23Pare G. Krust A. Karas R.H. Dupont S. Aronovitz M. Chambon P. Mendelsohn M.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In a more chronic model, ERβ plays an important role in the prevention of hypertension (3Zhu Y. Bian Z. Lu P. Karas R.H. Bao L. Cox D. Hodgin J. Shaul P.W. Thoren P. Smithies O. Gustafsson J.A. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Thus, both ER isoforms are relevant to the modulation of vascular function and, as shown here, in vivo vasodilation. ERα receptors are present in ERβ KO mice blood vessels, and the reverse is also true. We therefore propose that it is the disruption of the functional heterodimer by either receptor deletion that results in the loss of E2 action. Overall, rapid signaling as a mechanism of estrogen action at the membrane may contribute to the beneficial effects of arterial relaxation, potentially preventing the pathological effects of excessive vasoconstriction (43Konidala S. Gutterman D.D. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 2004; 46: 349-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We thank Wyeth Research and Heather Harris for supplying the ER knock-out mice."

https://openalex.org/W2154933226,"The aqueous decay and concomitant release of nitric oxide (·NO) by nitrolinoleic acid (10-nitro-9,12-octadecadienoic acid and 12-nitro-9,12-octadecadienoic acid; LNO2) are reported. Mass spectrometric analysis of reaction products supports a modified Nef reaction as the mechanism accounting for the generation of ·NO by the aqueous reactions of fatty acid nitroalkene derivatives. Nitrolinoleic acid is stabilized by an aprotic milieu, with LNO2 decay and ·NO release strongly inhibited by phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposome membranes and detergents when present at levels above their critical micellar concentrations. The release of ·NO from LNO2 was induced by UV photolysis and triiodide-based ozone chemiluminescence reactions currently used to quantify putative protein nitrosothiol and N-nitrosamine derivatives. This reactivity of LNO2 complicates the qualitative and quantitative analysis of biological oxides of nitrogen when applying UV photolysis and triiodide-based analytical systems to biological preparations typically abundant in nitrated fatty acids. The results reveal that nitroalkene derivatives of linoleic acid are pluripotent signaling mediators that act not only via receptor-dependent mechanisms, but also by transducing the signaling actions of ·NO via pathways subject to regulation by the relative distribution of LNO2 to hydrophobic versus aqueous microenvironments. The aqueous decay and concomitant release of nitric oxide (·NO) by nitrolinoleic acid (10-nitro-9,12-octadecadienoic acid and 12-nitro-9,12-octadecadienoic acid; LNO2) are reported. Mass spectrometric analysis of reaction products supports a modified Nef reaction as the mechanism accounting for the generation of ·NO by the aqueous reactions of fatty acid nitroalkene derivatives. Nitrolinoleic acid is stabilized by an aprotic milieu, with LNO2 decay and ·NO release strongly inhibited by phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposome membranes and detergents when present at levels above their critical micellar concentrations.

Schopfer F.J. Sweeney S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Nitrolinoleic acid is a product of nitric oxide (·NO)-dependent linoleic acid nitration reactions that predominantly occur at the C-10 and C-12 alkene carbons. The positional isomer distribution of the LNO2 alkenyl nitro group indicates that in vivo fatty acid nitration is a consequence of nucleophilic (nitronium group (NO2+) and/or radical (nitrogen dioxide (·NO2)) addition reactions with olefinic carbons.Recent observations reveal that LNO2 is a pluripotent signaling mediator that acts via both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent pathways. Nitrated fatty acids are specific and high affinity endogenous ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (2Schopfer F.J. Lin Y. Baker P.R. Cui T. Garcia-Barrio M. Zhang J. Chen K.

LNO2 also activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling pathways in neutrophils and platelets, serving to down-regulate the activation of these inflammatory cells (3Coles B. Bloodsworth A. Eiserich J.P. Coffey M.J. McLoughlin R.M. Giddings J.C. Lewis M.J. Haslam R.J. Freeman B.A. O'Donnell V.B. J. Biol.

Res. 2002; 91: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Finally, LNO2 induces vessel relaxation in an endothelium-independent manner (5Lim D.G. Sweeney S. Bloodsworth A. White C.R. Chumley P.H. Krishna N.R. Schopfer F. O'Donnell V.B. Eiserich J.P. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15941-15946Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This LNO2-mediated relaxation of phenylephrine-preconstricted aortic rings is 1) a consequence of LNO2-induced stimulation of smooth muscle cell and aortic segment cGMP content, 2) inhibitable by the ·NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin, and 3) 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ)-inhibitable (e.g. guanylate cyclase-dependent). Although these vessel responses to LNO2 suggest ·NO as the mediator of guanylate cyclase activation, the identity of the proximal LNO2-derived, cGMP-dependent signaling molecule was not directly identified (5Lim D.G. Sweeney S. Bloodsworth A. White C.R. Chumley P.H. Krishna N.R. Schopfer F. O'Donnell V.B. Eiserich J.P. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15941-15946Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Nitric oxide, synthesized by three different nitric-oxide synthase isoforms, was first shown to mediate endothelium-dependent relaxation via reaction with the heme iron of guanylate cyclase and subsequent activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinases (6Ignarro L.J. Byrns R.E. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Circ. Res. 1987; 61: 866-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Subsequent to this discovery, there has been a growing appreciation that the cell signaling actions of ·NO are also transduced by secondary products derived from redox reactions of ·NO. These redox reactions yield a variety of oxides of nitrogen displaying both unique and overlapping reactivities that can regulate differentiated cell function via both cGMP- and non-cGMP-dependent mechanisms. These products include nitrite (NO2−), ·NO2, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), nitrosothiols (RSNO), and dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3). These reactive species serve to transduce the cell signaling actions of ·NO by inducing changes in target molecule structure and function via oxidation, nitration, or nitrosation reactions (7Hogg N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 585-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 8Schopfer F.J. Baker P.R. Freeman B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 646-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).The lipophilicity and intrinsic chemical reactivities of ·NO facilitate multiple interactions with lipids that impact both cellular redox and ·NO signaling reactions. For example, ·NO concentrates in membranes and lipoproteins, where it more readily reacts with oxygen to yield oxidizing, nitrosating, and nitrating species such as N2O3 and N2O4 (9Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3566-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 10Denicola A. Batthyany C. Lissi E. Freeman B.A. Rubbo H. Radi R. J. Biol.

In these lipophilic compartments, ·NO can react with lipid peroxyl radicals (LOO·) at diffusion-limited rates, readily out-competing tocopherols and ascorbate for the scavenging of intermediates that would otherwise propagate lipid oxidation. In this regard, ·NO displays an oxidant-protective, anti-inflammatory role (12O'Donnell V.B. Chumley P.H. Hogg N. Bloodsworth A. Darley-Usmar V.M.

Of relevance to inflammatory signaling, hemeand nonheme-containing peroxidases and oxygenases that catalyze physiological and pathological fatty acid oxygenation reactions also catalytically consume ·NO during enzyme turnover, e.g. lipoxygenases (14Coffey M.J.

The reaction of ·NO with these enzymatic catalysts and free radical intermediates of fatty acid oxygenation in turn inhibits rates of fatty acid oxygenation product formation. The convergence of ·NO and fatty acid oxygenation reactions can thus influence the steady-state concentration of both ·NO and eicosanoids in a concerted fashion.Redox reactions of ·NO frequently induce the chemical modification of target molecules, including the nitrosylation (addition of ·NO) of heme proteins (18Arnold W.P.

A. 1977; 74: 3203-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar), the nitrosation (addition of the nitroso group NO) of thiol substituents (7Hogg N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Freeman B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 646-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Herein, we report that LNO2, a product of ·NO-dependent unsaturated fatty acid nitration reactions that is abundant in red cells and plasma, decays in aqueous solvents to release ·NO. This generation of ·NO by LNO2 is inhibited by aprotic environments, a milieu that concomitantly stabilizes LNO2. Moreover, we show that UV photolysis and triiodide (I3−)-based chemiluminescence approaches, currently used to quantify ·NO derived from protein hemenitrosyl, RSNO, and N-nitrosamine (RNNO) derivatives, also facilitate ·NO release from LNO2. This complicates the interpretation of quantitative and qualitative results from the application of these analytical systems in biological preparations. Together, these results reveal that nitroalkene derivatives of fatty acids serve to transduce the signaling actions of ·NO via pathways subject to regulation by the relative distribution of LNO2 to hydrophobic versus aqueous microenvironments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Horse heart myoglobin, octyl β-glucopyranoside (OG), and octyl thio-β-glucopyranoside (OTG), 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO), diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), Na2HPO4, and sodium dithionite were from Sigma. LNO2 and [13C]LNO2 were synthesized and purified as described previously (1Baker P.R. Schopfer F.J. Sweeney S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Metmyoglobin was reduced using sodium dithionite, desalted by exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex PD-10 column, and further oxygenated by equilibration with 100% oxygen.Electron Paramagnetic Resonance—EPR measurements were performed at room temperature using a Bruker Elexsys E-500 spectrometer equipped with an ER049X microwave bridge and an AquaX liquid sample cell. The following instrument settings were used: modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 0.05 G; receiver gain, 60 dB; time constant, 1.28 ms; sweep time, 5.24 s; center field, 3510 G; sweep width, 100 G; power, 20 milliwatts; and scan parameter, 16 scans.Spectrophotometry—The UV spectrum of LNO2 and repetitive scans of LNO2 decay kinetics were collected using a Hitachi UV 2401 PC spectrophotometer. The apparent ·NO formation was calculated from the extent of oxymyoglobin oxidation in the visible wavelength range (spectrum) and at 580 nm (kinetic mode). Initial oxymyoglobin oxidation was calculated using UV Probe Version 1.10 (ϵ580 = 14.4 mm-1 cm-1). Decomposition of the NO2 group was followed at 268 nm, and the appearance of oxidized products was followed at 320 nm.Liposome Preparation—Reverse-phase evaporation liposomes were formed from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and stearylamine (4:2:1 mol ratio) following an established procedure (19Szoka Jr., F. Papahadjopoulos D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1980; 9: 467-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Briefly, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and stearylamine were dissolved in CHCl3 and sonicated with 10 mm potassium Pi buffer (2:1, v/v). The organic solvent was then removed by evaporation under reduced pressure at 45 °C. The liposomes were allowed to anneal for 12 h at room temperature and then centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in the experimental buffer.Chemiluminescence and UV Photolysis Analyses—For direct detection of ·NO release, LNO2 (75 μm) was incubated directly or with different additions (1.5% (w/v) sulfanilamide in 2 m HCl for 5 min at 25 °C with or without 50 mm HgCl2) under aerobic conditions in a capped vial for 3 min. The gas phase was then injected into a chemiluminescence detector (ANTEK Instruments, Houston, TX). Additionally, known concentrations of diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N,-diethylamino)-diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DEA NONOate) (in 10 mm NaOH) were added to a capped vial containing 0.5 m HCl. NOx concentration profiles of plasma samples were performed by ·NO chemiluminescence analysis. Measurement of putative ,NO2− RSNO, and other ·NO derivatives present in plasma was performed using an I3−-based reducing system as described previously (20Feelisch M. Rassaf T. Mnaimneh S. Singh N. Bryan N.S. Jourd'heuil D. Kelm M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 21Gladwin M.T. Wang X. Reiter C.D. Yang B.K. Vivas E.X. Bonaventura C. Schechter A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27818-27828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Rats were treated by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide; and 5 h later, blood was collected in EDTA anticoagulation tubes following cardiac puncture. Following removal of red cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, plasma samples were pretreated with sulfanilamide (1.5% (w/v) final concentration in 2 m HCl for 5 min at 25 °C) with or without 50 mm HgCl2 prior to injection into the chemiluminescence detector to measure NO2− and HgCl2-resistant NOx derivatives, respectively. For UV photolysis studies, a water-cooled reaction chamber was filled with 1 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm DTPA and continuously bubbled with argon. The chamber was illuminated using an ILC PS300-1A xenon arc source (ILC Technology, Sunnyvale, CA). Samples were injected into the reaction chamber through an air-tight septum, and released ·NO was passed to the reaction chamber of a Sievers NOA 280 NO analyzer and detected by chemiluminescence after reaction with ozone (O3).Mass Spectrometric Analysis—LNO2 was extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.L. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42153) Google Scholar). During extraction, [13C]LNO2 was added as an internal standard, and the LNO2 content of samples was quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (1Baker P.R. Schopfer F.J. Sweeney S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Qualitative and quantitative analysis of LNO2 by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was performed using a hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer (4000 Q TRAP, Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX) as described (1Baker P.R. Schopfer F.J. Sweeney S. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11577-11582Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For the detection and characterization of nitrohydroxylinoleic acid (L(OH)NO2), the hydration product of LNO2 generated by a Michael-like addition between H2O and the nitroalkene LNO2 (3 μm) was incubated at 25 °C for 60 min in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm DTPA and extracted following the method of Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.L. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42153) Google Scholar). L(OH)NO2 was detected using a multiple reaction monitoring scan mode by reporting molecules that undergo an m/z 342 to 295 mass transition. This method selects m/z 342 in the first quadrupole, consistent with the precursor ion, and, following collision-induced dissociation, yields in third quadrupole a species (m/z 295) consistent with loss of the nitro group ([M - HNO2]-). The presence of the nitrohydroxy adduct was confirmed by product ion analysis of m/z 342. The degradation of LNO2 to secondary products was followed in negative ion mode after chloroform extraction and direct injection into an ion trap mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (LCQ Deca, Thermo Electron Corp.).RESULTSCharacterization of ·NO Release from LNO2—cPTIO is a selective spin trap for ·NO (k = 104m-1 s-1) (23Akaike T. Yoshida M. Miyamoto Y. Sato K. Kohno M. Sasamoto K. Miyazaki K. Ueda S. Maeda H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), with the product of this reaction (cPTI) displaying a characteristic EPR spectrum. To determine whether ·NO is released from LNO2, it was incubated at 25 °C for different times in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm DTPA in the presence of cPTIO. This resulted in a time-dependent decrease in the characteristic five-peak cPTIO signal and the appearance of a new signal ascribed to cPTI (Fig. 1A). This release of ·NO by LNO2 was concentration-dependent and followed first-order decay kinetics for LNO2. Due to limitations of the ·NO/cPTIO reaction for quantitating yields of ·NO, we utilized oxymyoglobin to measure ·NO release rates (24Hogg N. Singh R.J. Joseph J. Neese F. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).LNO2 was incubated with oxymyoglobin in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm DTPA, and ·NO-dependent oxymyoglobin oxidation was followed spectrophotometrically. LNO2 oxidized oxymyoglobin in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, yielding metmyoglobin as indicated by the spectral changes depicted in Fig. 1B. The apparent rate constant for ·NO release by LNO2, calculated from the oxidation of oxymyoglobin to metmyoglobin, was k = 9.67 × 10-6 s-1 (Fig. 1C). To monitor the concomitant decomposition of the parent LNO2 molecule, its UV spectrum was first analyzed. LNO2 displayed a characteristic absorbance spectrum with a peak at 268 nm, ascribed to the π electrons of the NO2 group. During aqueous LNO2 decay, this maximum decreased, and a new maximum appeared at 320 nm, corresponding to a mixture of vicinal nitrohydroxy, oxygen, and conjugated diene-containing products not yet fully characterized by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1D). The decrease in absorbance at 268 nm paralleled ·NO release, as detected by both EPR and oxymyoglobin oxidation.Nitrite Formation during LNO2 Decomposition—During LNO2-dependent ·NO formation, measured via oxymyoglobin oxidation and mass spectrometric analysis of LNO2 parent molecule loss in aqueous buffers, the stable ·NO oxidation product NO2− accumulated with time (Fig. 2). The release of ·NO from LNO2 was maximal at pH 7.4 (Fig. 3), suggesting a role for protonation and deprotonation reactions in ·NO formation from LNO2.Fig. 2Nitrite formation during LNO2 decay. The time-dependent formation ofNO2−during decomposition of LNO2 (initial concentration of 200 μm) was measured in parallel with oxidation of oxymyoglobin (20 μm). Nitrite formation was measured in the absence of oxymyoglobin. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3pH dependence of ·NO formation from LNO2.

LNO2 was incubated in capped vials in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm DTPA in air, and the gas phase was directly injected into the detector. The ·NO-dependent chemiluminescence yield was a function of diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DEA NONOate) and LNO2 concentrations, studied separately (Fig. 4A). Chemiluminescence was also time-dependent, increasing with time of LNO2 decay prior to gas sampling from vials (data not shown).Fig. 4Chemiluminescence detection of ·NO release by LNO2. A, LNO2 (5 and 10 mm) was incubated in a capped vial under aerobic conditions for 3 min, and the gas phase was injected into an O3 chemiluminescence detector. Additionally, known nanomolar concentrations of diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DEA NONOate) in 10 mm NaOH were added to a capped vial containing 0.5 m HCl, and the gas phase was injected into the chemiluminescence detector. B,50mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm DTPA was illuminated with a xenon arc lamp. ·NO formation was examined by O3-based chemiluminescence after injection of MeOH (20 μl), LNO2 (4 nmol in 20 μl of MeOH, two additions made before and after sodium nitrite addition), and sodium nitrite (4 nmol in 20 μl of phosphate buffer). C, blood was obtained by cardiac puncture of lipopolysaccharide-treated rats; red cells were removed by centrifugation; and plasma samples were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The following conditions were studied in C: I3− alone (peak 1); I3− plus sulfanilamide (SA) (peak 2); and I3− plus sulfanilamide and HgCl2 (peak 3), with 75 μm of LNO2 treated with I3− plus sulfanilamide and HgCl2 as for the corresponding plasma sample (LNO2 inset). Derived·NO was measured by ·NO chemiluminescence analysis. Traces are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)UV photolysis has been used to quantitate RSNO derivatives of proteins and other NO-containing biomolecules (25McMahon T.J.

When LNO2 (4 nmol) was subjected to UV photolysis in concert with ·NO chemiluminescence detection, UV light exposure stimulated ·NO release from LNO2 (Fig. 4B). The ·NO chemiluminescence response to NO2− (4 nmol) added to samples being subjected to UV photolysis and repetitive LNO2 addition was also examined to address the possibility that LNO2-derived NO2− formed during decay reactions might have accounted for some fraction of net chemiluminescence yield; it did not.Appreciating that nitroalkene derivatives of red cell membrane and plasma fatty acids are present in human blood, we examined whether LNO2-derived ·NO has the potential to interfere with the chemiluminescence detection of ,NO2− RSNO, RNNO, or NO-heme compounds in plasma when also analyzed via an I3−-based reaction system (21Gladwin M.T.

Plasma from lipopolysaccharide-treated rats was used to exemplify this reaction system because lipopolysaccharide treatment of rodents induces a robust elevation in plasma biomolecule ·NO adduct levels (27Crawford J.H.

First, plasma was directly injected into the detector chamber, and I3− reagent was added, yielding a signal indicative of net plasma NO2−, RSNO, RNNO, and NO-heme compounds (Fig. 4C, peak 1). Then, plasma treated with acidic sulfanilamide (which removes NO2−) was injected, giving a peak of lower intensity after I3− reagent addition, indicative of RSNO and putative RNNO derivatives (20Feelisch M.

Using this strategy and combination of reagents, LNO2 pretreated with acidic sulfanilamide and HgCl2 also generated ·NO chemiluminescence for extended periods of time following I3− addition (Fig. 4C, LNO2 inset).Hydrophobic Stabilization of LNO2—The observation that LNO2 is stable in organic solvents such as n-octanol, undergoing decay only after solvation in aqueous solutions, led us to analyze the rates of ·NO formation from LNO2 in the presence of non-ionic detergents. The formation of ·NO was followed by EPR (measuring cPTI formation) in the presence of different concentrations of OG and OTG. The rate of ·NO release was constant and not influenced by these detergents until the critical micellar concentration (CMC) for each was achieved, after which ·NO formation was inhibited as the volume of the hydrophobic environment increased (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained when measuring ·NO formation via conversion of oxymyoglobin to metmyoglobin. The apparent ·NO release rates remained constant until the OG concentration reached ∼2.8 mg/ml (CMC = 2.77 mg/ml) (11Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). For OTG, inhibition of LNO2-dependent ·NO release occurred at ∼7 mg/ml (CMC = 7.8 mg/ml) (11Liu X. Miller M.J.

To further confirm that LNO2 was protected in lipophilic environments, LNO2 decomposition was followed by UV absorbance at 268 and 320 nm (Fig. 5, C and D).

https://openalex.org/W2108363571,"Treatment with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a polyphenolic compound of green tea, results in activation of p53 and induction of apoptosis in prostate cancer LnCaP cells. However, no direct evidence has delineated the role of p53 and p53-dependent pathways in EGCG-mediated apoptosis. To understand the mechanism of negative growth regulation of prostate cancer cells by EGCG we undertook a genetic approach and generated an isogenic pair of prostate carcinoma cells PC3 (p53-/-) by stably introducing a cDNA encoding wild-type p53. Treatment of the resultant cells, PC3-p53, with EGCG led to, as reported earlier in LnCaP cells, an increase in p53 protein, which exacerbated both G1 arrest and apoptosis. This response was accompanied by an increase in the levels of p21 and Bax. The cells lacking p53 continued to cycle and did not undergo apoptosis upon treatment with similar concentrations of EGCG, thus establishing the action of EGCG in a p53-dependent manner. This observation was revalidated in another prostate cancer LNCaP cells harboring wild-type p53. Inactivation of p53 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) rendered these cells resistant to EGCG-mediated apoptosis. Because p53 activation led to increase in p21 and Bax, we investigated whether these two proteins are important in this process. Ablation of p21 protein by siRNA prevented G1 arrest and apoptosis in PC3-p53 cells. The p53-dependent increase in Bax expression altered the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and paralleled the activation of caspase 9 and 3 and cleavage of PARP. Transfection of cells with Bax siRNA abolished these effects and inhibited apoptosis but did not affect the accumulation of the cells in G1. In summary, using isogenic cell lines and siRNA, we have clearly demonstrated that EGCG activates growth arrest and apoptosis primarily via p53-dependent pathway that involves the function of both p21 and Bax such that down-regulation of either molecule confers a growth advantage to the cells."

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) govern gene expression patterns by being recruited to target genes through association with specific transcription factors. One of the HATs, p300, serves as a coactivator of cardiac-specific transcription factors such as GATA-4. The HAT activity of p300 is required for acetylation and DNA binding of GATA-4 and its full transcriptional activity as well as for promotion of a transcriptionally active chromatin configuration. However, the roles of HATs and HDACs in post-translational modification of GATA-4 during the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes remain unknown. In an ES cell model of developing embryoid bodies, an acetylated form of GATA-4 and its DNA binding increased concomitantly with the expression of p300 during the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes. Treatment of ES cells with trichostatin A (TSA), a specific HDAC inhibitor, induced acetylation of histone-3/4 near GATA sites within the atrial natriuretic factor promoter. In addition, TSA augmented the increase in an acetylated form of GATA-4 and its DNA binding during the ES cell differentiation. Finally, TSA facilitated the expression of green fluorescence protein under the control of the cardiac-specific Nkx-2.5 promoter and of endogenous cardiac β-myosin heavy chain during the differentiation. These findings demonstrate that acetylation of GATA-4 as well as of histones is involved in the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes.

These findings demonstrate that acetylation of GATA-4 as well as of histones is involved in the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes. During embryogenesis, cell type-specific gene expression plays a pivotal role in the determination of cell fate determination, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In contrast to other cell types, cardiac muscle cells are highly organized and their developmental processes require a number of cell type-specific transcription factors (1Sachnidis A. Fleischmann B.K. Kolossov E. Wartenberg M. Sauer H. Hescheler J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 278-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Among these, a zinc finger protein, GATA-4, is expressed at the earliest stage during heart development. In addition, embryonic stem (ES) 1The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EB, embryoid body; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; MHC, myosin heavy chain; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; WT, wild type. cell lines overexpressing GATA-4 show enhancement of cardiac myocyte differentiation, whereas GATA-4-deficient ES cell lines are impaired in differentiation. These findings suggest that GATA-4 is one of the DNA binding transcription factors regulating cardiac muscle cell differentiation (2Grepin C. Nemer G. Nemer M. Development. 1997; 124: 2387-2395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate gene expression patterns by affecting chromatin structure. These regulators are recruited to target genes in association with specific DNA binding transcription factors. HATs facilitate chromatin opening by acetylating the N-terminal tails of nucleosomal histones, which are rich in lysine residues, thus promoting active transcription (3Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, HDACs deacetylate lysine residues and induce compaction of chromatin, making the access of transcription factors to nearby promoters more difficult and thereby resulting in gene silencing (4Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A transcriptional coactivator, p300, serves as one of the intrinsic HATs and plays central roles in a wide range of cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (3Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Shikama N. Lyon J. Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In addition, p300 is able to acetylate several DNA binding transcription factors and enhance their DNA binding activities (3Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, p300 acetylates p53, increases its DNA binding activity, and activates the transcription of p53-inducible genes, contributing to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (6Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 7Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, p300 acetylates GATA-4, enhances its DNA binding, and plays an important role in the transactivation of hypertrophy-responsive genes (8Yanazme T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T. Wada H. Matsumori A. Kawase Y. Hirai M. Kita T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3593-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the roles of HATs and HDACs in post-translational modification of GATA-4 during the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes remain unknown. Specifically, we would like to know whether the acetylation of GATA-4 occurs in ES cells during their differentiation into cardiac myocytes and, if so, whether pharmacological augmentation of the acetylation could facilitate the differentiation. The present study was performed to address these questions. Cell Line and Cell Culture of Embryonic Stem Cells—The 129/Ola-derived ES cell lines we used in the present study were ht7 and its derivative (Nkx2.5-GFP ES cells) in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is knocked into the Nkx2.5 locus (9Hidaka K. Lee J.K. Kim H.S. Ihm C.H. Iio A. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Kodama I. Morisaki T. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained and differentiated as previously described (9Hidaka K. Lee J.K. Kim H.S. Ihm C.H. Iio A. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Kodama I. Morisaki T. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were grown on gelatinized dishes without feeder cells by using culture medium containing Glasgow-modified Eagle's medium, 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon International), 100 mg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen), 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 × non-essential amino acids, 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mmol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol. Differentiation of ES cells was induced through formation of embryoid bodies (EBs). After incubation in hanging drops for 2 days, 60 EBs were transferred into 10-cm bacterial Petri dishes together with 10 ml of differentiation medium and cultured as floating EBs until dissociation for the experiments. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Analysis of the Acetylation State of GATA-4 —Nuclear protein extracts from ES cells were prepared as previously described (8Yanazme T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T. Wada H. Matsumori A. Kawase Y. Hirai M. Kita T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3593-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting for p300, GATA-4, and β-actin were performed as previously described (8Yanazme T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T. Wada H. Matsumori A. Kawase Y. Hirai M. Kita T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3593-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of the lysates containing 100 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated by incubating with goat anti-GATA-4 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal goat IgG in low stringency buffer for 16 h at 4 °C and then incubating with protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed four times in the same buffer and subjected to Western blotting by using rabbit polyclonal antibody against acetylated lysine (Cell Signaling) or rabbit anti-GATA-4 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The detection of acetylated GATA-4 was also analyzed by pulse labeling as previously described (8Yanazme T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T. Wada H. Matsumori A. Kawase Y. Hirai M. Kita T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3593-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, EBs were resuspended in 2.5 ml of medium containing 0.05 mCi of [1-14C]acetic acid sodium salt/ml (200 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) and incubated for 3 h. Ethanol, the solvent of [1-14C]acetic acid sodium salt, was removed by evaporation to minimize the cytotoxic effect of the ethanol in the culture medium. Nuclear extracts from these cells were immunoprecipitated using goat anti-GATA-4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal goat IgG in low stringency buffer for 16 h at 4 °C and incubated with protein G beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed four times in the same buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis buffer, heated to 95 °C for 2 min, electrophoresed in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, fixed, and autoradiographed using a bioimaging analyzer (BAS 2000; FUJIX). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—EMSAs were carried out as previously described (8Yanazme T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T. Wada H. Matsumori A. Kawase Y. Hirai M. Kita T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3593-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The sequence of the sense strands of the double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a GATA-4 site in the endothelin-1 promoter were as follows: Wt-GATA, 5′-CCTCTAGAGCCGGGTCTTATCTCCGGCTGCACGTTGC-3′, and Mut-GATA, 5′-CCTCTAGAGCCGGGTCTGCACTCCGGCTGCACGTTGC-3′ (mutated sequence is underlined). We also used a double-stranded oligonucleotide that contained the Sp-1 binding site as a control probe (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Acid Extraction of Proteins from ES Cells and Detection of Histone Acetylation—Histones were isolated by acid extraction using a commercial kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer with 0.2 mol/liter hydrochloric acid, and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 11000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant fraction was dialyzed against 0.1 mol/liter acetic acid twice and against H2O three times. After dialysis, the protein concentrations of extracts were measured, and equal aliquots of extracts were subjected to 18% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting for acetylated histone-3/4 and for total histone-3/4 was performed using goat anti-acetylated histone-3/4 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-histone-3/4 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay and Real-time PCR Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as previously described (10Ferreira R. Naguibneva I. Mathieu M. Ait-Si-Ali S. Robin P. Pritchard L.L. Harel-Bellan A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. In brief, after fixation of the genomic DNA and nuclear proteins with formalin, extracts were sonicated, subsequently immunoprecipitated with goat polyclonal anti-acetylated histone-4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-GATA-4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or control goat IgG, and immunocomplexes were captured by adding protein G beads. After the precipitates were washed four times in the low stringency buffer, DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, and precipitated with ethanol. To detect the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) promoter, which contains two GATA-4 sites (-281/-273 and -123/-118), collected DNA was subjected to real-time quantitative PCR analysis using a thermal cycler (ABI Prism®7900HT sequence detection system) with the detection probe and specific primers for the ANF promoter (-292/-93). Sequences of the primers were as follows: FAM-AATGTGACTCTTGCAGCTGAGGGTCTGG-TAMRA (detection probe; Applied Biosystems), 5′-GAGCGCCCAGGAAGATAACC-3′(sense for the ANF promoter), and 5′-GCCAGGAGAAGATGCCCTTT-3′(antisense for the ANF promoter). Immunocytochemistry and Western Blotting for Cardiac Myosin Heavy Chain—After EBs were incubated with trypsin-EDTA, the cells were dissociated, resuspended in the medium, and grown in flask-style chambers with human fibronectin-coated slides (BD Biosciences). After a 24-h incubation, cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry for β-myosin heavy chain (MHC) as previously described (11Yanazume T. Hasegawa K. Wada H. Morimoto T. Abe M. Kawamura T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8618-8625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, after fixation the cells were incubated with anti-cardiac β-MHC monoclonal antibody (Novocastra Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:50, followed by incubation with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a dilution of 1:200. 30 μg of whole cell lysates extracted from EBs were subjected to Western blotting using anti-cardiac MHC monoclonal antibody that reacts with both α- and β-cardiac MHC. The levels of signals were quantified by densitometry using NIH image1.61. Flow Cytometry—For the quantitative analysis of the number of GFP-positive cells in Nkx2.5-GFP ES cells, EBs were dissociated into single cells and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) as previously described (9Hidaka K. Lee J.K. Kim H.S. Ihm C.H. Iio A. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Kodama I. Morisaki T. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Gene Expression Analysis by Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from EBs by using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen) to eliminate genomic DNA contamination, and cDNA was synthesized by using SuperScriptTMII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For real-time PCR, the reaction was performed with a SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), and the products were analyzed with a thermal cycler (ABI Prism®7900HT sequence detection system). Levels of GAPDH transcript were used to normalize cDNA levels. Gene-specific primers were used as previously described (9Hidaka K. Lee J.K. Kim H.S. Ihm C.H. Iio A. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Kodama I. Morisaki T. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests or analysis of variance with Scheffe's test where appropriate, with a probability value <0.05 taken to indicate significance. Expression of p300 and the Acetylated Form of GATA-4 Concomitantly Increases during the Differentiation of ES Cells into Cardiac Myocytes—We examined the time dependence of the expression of p300 and GATA-4 proteins during the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes. The day on which EBs were transferred into Petri dishes was set as day 0. The expression level of GATA-4 was almost constant on days 3, 5, and 7, though the level slightly increased from day 3 to day 5 (Fig. 1A, middle panel). In contrast, p300 expression progressively increased from day 3 to day 7 (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The expression level of β-actin was almost constant. As p300 is able to acetylate GATA-4, we examined whether the acetylated form of GATA-4 also increased in a time-dependent manner during the ES cell differentiation. Protein extracts from EBs at days 3, 5, and 7 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-GATA-4 antibody, followed by Western blotting using anti-acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, upper panel, the acetylated form of GATA-4 progressively increased from day 3 to day 7, consistent with the expression pattern of p300. The anti-acetylated lysine antibody was stripped, and then the membrane was reprobed with the anti-GATA-4 antibody. GATA-4 was similarly immunoprecipitated with anti-GATA-4 antibody in these three groups (Fig. 1B, lower panel). No protein was immunoprecipitated with control IgG (lane four). GATA-4/DNA Binding Increases Concomitantly with GATA-4 Acetylation during ES Cell Differentiation—Next, to examine the changes in the DNA binding activity of GATA-4 during ES cell differentiation, EMSAs were performed. The same extracts from EBs used to detect acetylation were probed with a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a GATA site. As shown in Fig. 1C, competition EMSAs demonstrated that the retarded band represented specific binding, as evidenced by the fact that it was competed out by an excess of unlabeled GATA oligonucleotide (lane 2) but not by the same amount of an oligonucleotide containing a GATA site with a mutation (lane 3). Furthermore, the retarded band was super-shifted by anti-GATA-4 antibody (lane 5) but not by control goat IgG (lane 4). These data confirm that the retarded band represents an interaction of the probe with GATA-4. The amount of GATA-4/DNA binding (Fig. 1D) was markedly increased from day 3 to day 7, whereas Sp-1/DNA binding (Fig. 1E) was not altered. This was consistent with the increase in the amounts of p300 and acetylated GATA-4. An HDAC Inhibitor, TSA, Induces Acetylation of Histone Tails and Increases the Accessibility of GATA-4 to the ANF Promoter—To examine the effect of TSA, a specific HDAC inhibitor, on the differentiation of ES cells, we first determined whether TSA treatment induces the acetylation of histone tails in these cells. Seven days after the transfer of EBs onto Petri dishes, ES cells were stimulated with TSA for 24 h. Protein extracts from these cells were then subjected to immunoblotting for the acetylated states of histone-3 and histone-4. As shown in Fig. 2A, TSA treatment of ES cells enhanced the acetylation of both histone-3 and histone-4. GATA-4 binds two GATA elements (-281/-273 and -123/118) within the ANF promoter and activates this promoter in a sequence-specific manner (12Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34096-34102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As GATA-4 is a substrate of an intrinsic HAT, p300, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we examined whether histones near GATA-4 sites within the ANF promoter are acetylated as a result of TSA treatment and, if so, whether the treatment increases the accessibility of GATA-4 to the ANF promoter. Before immunoprecipitation, input genomic DNA was measured using GAPDH primers (Applied Biosystems) by comparison with the standard curve shown in supplemental Fig. S1A, left panels. Extracts from non-treated and TSA-treated ES cells containing the same amounts of GAPDH were immunoprecipitated with anti-acetylated histone-4 antibody, anti-GATA-4 antibody, or with control goat IgG as a negative control. DNA was then purified from these precipitates and subjected to real-time PCR to quantify the amount of GATA-4 site-containing DNA sequences in the ANF promoter. We quantified the amounts of DNA by comparison with the standard curve shown in supplemental Fig. S1A, right panels. As shown in Fig. 2B, in extracts precipitated with anti-acetylated histone-4 antibody and those precipitated with anti-GATA-4 antibody, the amount of the ANF promoter containing two GATA-4 sites was much higher in TSA-treated ES cells than in non-treated ES cells. However, this promoter was not detectable in the extracts precipitated with IgG. These findings demonstrate that treatment of ES cells with TSA induces acetylation of histones near GATA-4 sites within the ANF promoter and increases the accessibility of GATA-4 to these sites. TSA Induces Acetylation of GATA-4 and Enhances GATA-4/DNA Binding in ES Cells—We next examined whether TSA also induces acetylation of the DNA binding transcription factor GATA-4 in ES cells. On day 7, ES cells were stimulated with TSA for 24 h, pulse-labeled with [14C]acetic acid sodium salt, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antiserum against GATA-4 or with control goat IgG as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 3A, upper panel, incorporation of sodium [14C]acetate into GATA-4 protein was increased by TSA treatment. TSA-induced acetylation of GATA-4 was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-GATA-4 antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-acetylated-lysine antibody (Fig. 3A, middle panel). After the anti-acetylated lysine antibody was stripped, the membrane was reprobed with the anti-GATA-4 antibody. GATA-4 was similarly immunoprecipitated with anti-GATA-4 antibody in non-treated and TSA-treated cell extracts (Fig. 3A, lower panels). No protein was immunoprecipitated with control IgG (lane 3). These results indicate that TSA augments the acetylation of GATA-4 in ES cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression of p300 was also increased by TSA stimulation, whereas the levels of GATA-4 and β-actin expression were almost constant. In addition, we performed EMSAs using protein extracts from ES cells to determine whether TSA treatment increased the DNA binding of GATA-4. We confirmed by competition and supershift assays that the retarded band indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3C represents specific binding of the probe with GATA-4, similar with the findings shown in Fig. 1C. The GATA-4/DNA binding was increased by TSA treatment in ES cells (Fig. 3C), whereas Sp-1/DNA binding was not altered by TSA treatment (Fig. 3D). TSA Promotes the Differentiation of ES Cells into Cardiac Myocytes—Finally, to determine whether TSA promotes the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes, we utilized an ES cell line (Nkx2.5-GFP ES cells) that expresses GFP under the transcriptional control of the cardiac-specific Nkx2.5 promoter. The cardiac specificity of GFP-positive cells in this cell line was shown in a previous study (9Hidaka K. Lee J.K. Kim H.S. Ihm C.H. Iio A. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Kodama I. Morisaki T. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In agreement with a previous study, we confirmed by cell sorting and immunocytochemistry for β-MHC that more than 90% of GFP-positive cells were positive for β-MHC and that none of the GFP-negative cells was β-MHC-positive (data are not shown). EBs derived from Nkx2.5-GFP ES cells (day 7) were stimulated with TSA (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, TSA-stimulated EBs showed distinct fluorescence, whereas non-stimulated EBs showed only vague fluorescence. Then we dissociated EBs, cultured the cells on the fibronectin-coated slides for 24 h, and stained them with an antibody against cardiac β-MHC. As shown in Fig. 4B, cells with brown signals indicating the presence of β-MHC were observed predominantly in TSA-stimulated ES cells. For quantification, the cells dissociated from EBs were also subjected to flow cytometric analysis. In Fig. 4C, the X- and Y-axes in the dot blot represent GFP and propidium iodide (PI) signals, respectively. The percentage of GFP-positive ES cells was significantly (p <0.05) increased by TSA treatment. TSA did not affect the number of propidium iodide-positive cells, excluding the possibility of its nonspecific toxic effects on ES cells. To confirm that TSA directs differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes, we performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis using specific primers for the detection of mRNAs encoding Nkx2.5 and ANF. After total RNA was extracted from EBs (days 7–8) incubated with or without TSA for 24 h, cDNA was synthesized and subjected to real-time PCR. The amounts of cDNA for the Nkx2.5, ANF, and GAPDH genes were measured by comparison with the respective standard curves (supplemental Fig. S1B). Consistent with the data of flow cytometry, the mRNA levels of Nkx2.5 and ANF were increased by TSA treatment, as shown in Fig. 5A. Furthermore, whole cell lysates extracted from EBs treated with or without TSA for 48 h (days 7–9) were subjected to Western blotting for cardiac MHC. TSA increased protein expression of cardiac MHC (Fig. 5B). These findings suggest that TSA treatment promotes the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes. Differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes requires activation of a cardiac-specific gene program. HATs and HDACs are profoundly involved in gene expression by modulating acetylation of specific transcription factors as well as of histones. The present study was performed to examine the roles of nuclear acetylation during the ES cell differentiation into cardiac myocytes. Several lines of evidence suggest that p300 is critical for the development of the embryonic heart. Expression of p300 is relatively abundant in the heart, begins to be detected as early as embryo day 7.5, and increases during the subsequent developmental stages (13Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 14Partanen A. Motoyama J. Hui C.C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 487-494PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous p300 knock-out mice die between 9 and 11.5 days of gestation, exhibiting defects in proper heart development (13Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D. Ch'ng L.E. Newsome D. Bronson R.T. Li E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). p300 acts as a transcriptional coactivator of GATA-4, one of the earliest markers of cardiac myocyte differentiation, and is required for cardiac-specific gene expression (12Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kaburagi S. Wada H. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34096-34102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37178-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, p300 is able to acetylate GATA-4 and enhance its DNA binding activity (8Yanazme T. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kawamura T. Wada H. Matsumori A. Kawase Y. Hirai M. Kita T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3593-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Homozygous mice in which HAT mutant p300 is knocked in exhibit developmental defects similar to those in p300 knock-out mice (16Shikama N. Lutz W. Kretzschmar R. Sauter N. Roth J-F. Marino S. Wittwer J. Scheidweiler A. Eckner R. EMBO. J. 2003; 22: 5175-5185Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that the HAT activity of p300 is required for proper heart development. The present study demonstrated that the acetylated form of GATA-4 and GATA-4/DNA binding increases in concert with the expression level of p300 during the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes. These findings suggest that p300 is involved in increasing the acetylation and DNA binding of GATA-4 during myocardial cell differentiation, while the precise roles of p300 HAT activity should be clarified by further studies. Acetylation of nuclear proteins is also regulated by HDACs, whose functions are opposed by HATs (4Johnson C.A. Turner B.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7706) Google Scholar). HDACs repress gene expression not only by affecting chromatin structure but also by directly acting on transcriptional activators, co-repressors, and DNA binding factors. HDACs directly interact with DNA binding transcription factors such as p53, MyoD, and myocyte enhancing factor 2, deacetylate these factors, and repress their transcriptional activity (18Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 19Mal A. Sturniolo M. Schiltz R.L. Ghosh M.K. Harter M.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1739-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). HDACs also perturb the interaction between HATs (p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein) and their target transcription factors. Furthermore, HDACs are able to recruit other transcriptional co-repressors to the target genes (17Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7706) Google Scholar, 21Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports, the present study demonstrated that inhibition of HDACs by TSA induced acetylation of histone tails in ES cells (22Lagace D.C. Nachtigal M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18851-18860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Marin-Husstege M. Muggironi M. Liu A. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10333-10345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These tails included GATA-4 site-containing DNA sequences within the ANF promoter. In addition, TSA enhanced the acetylation of GATA-4 during the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes. These findings suggest that post-translational GATA-4 modification as well as epigenetic modification are involved in the increase in GATA-4/DNA binding. The results also suggest the hypothesis that TSA treatment releases HDACs from GATA-4 and promotes interaction between p300 and GATA-4. However, TSA also increased the amount of p300 protein in ES cells. Further studies are needed to clarify the precise mechanisms by which TSA induces acetylation and DNA binding of GATA-4. The present study demonstrated that TSA promotes the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes. In contrast, it has been reported that TSA inhibits the differentiation of adipocytes (22Lagace D.C. Nachtigal M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18851-18860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or oligodendrocytes (23Marin-Husstege M. Muggironi M. Liu A. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10333-10345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the skeletal muscle cell lineage, TSA either augments or inhibits the differentiation depending on the developmental stage (24Iezzi S. Cossu G. Nervi C. Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7757-7762Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that TSA has differential effects in distinct cell types or developmental stages. In addition, individual HDACs play differential roles in cardiac myocytes. For example, one of the class II HDACs, HDAC9, represses the pro-hypertrophic gene program, whereas class I HDAC seems to suppress anti-hypertrophic gene expression (25Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 26Kook H. Lepore J.J. Gitler A.D. Lu M.M. Wing-Man Yung W. Mackay J. Zhou R. Ferrari V. Gruber P. Epstein J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 27Hamamori Y. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 824-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies are needed on the role of each HDAC in different stages of ES cell differentiation into cardiac myocytes. We have shown here that acetylation of GATA-4 as well as of histones occurs during the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes and that further augmentation of the acetylation by TSA promotes the differentiation. It is unclear at present whether acetylation of GATA-4 in whole EBs represents acetylation of GATA-4 in cardiac myocytes or their precursors. In mouse embryogenesis, however, GATA-4 is expressed in cardiac tissue during formation and bending of the heart tube at day 8 postcoitum (28Heikinheimo M. Scandrett J.M. Wilson D.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In contrast, GATA-4 is expressed later in the gut epithelium and in primitive gonads (at around day 11.5 postcoitum) (29Laverriere A.C. MacNeill C. Mueller C. Poelmann R.E. Burch J.B. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23177-23184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Viger R.S. Mertineit C. Trasler J.M. Nemer M. Development. 1998; 125: 2665-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that GATA-4 expression is restricted to cardiac tissue during early stages of heart development. Therefore, acetylation of GATA-4 detected in the entire EBs might represent acetylation of cardiac GATA-4, which possibly contributes to the differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myocytes. These findings emphasize the important roles of nuclear acetylation in myocardial cell differentiation. Our findings might be applicable to the differentiation of endogenous stem cells into cardiac myocytes in vivo. At present, the differentiation efficiency is too low to be used for myocardial regeneration therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Therefore, it would be interesting to test the usefulness of TSA for this therapy in vivo. We thank N. Sowa and S. Nagata for excellent technical assistance.

Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, are other hypoglycemic agents that effectively improve peripheral insulin resistance through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). In the present study, we found that glimepiride specifically induced the transcriptional activity of PPARγ in luciferase reporter assays. Glimepiride enhanced the recruitment of coactivator DRIP205 and dissociation of corepressors such as nuclear receptor corepressor and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors. In addition, glimepride directly bound to PPARγ in a manner competitive to rosiglitazone, which is a proven ligand for PPARγ. Furthermore, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, glimepiride stimulated the transcriptional activity of the gene promoter containing PPAR-responsive element and altered mRNA levels of PPARγ target genes including aP2, leptin, and adiponectin. Finally, glimepiride induced adipose differentiation in 3T3-F442A cells, which was known to differentiate into adipocytes in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Most effects observed with glimepiride were also seen with glibenclamide. These data strongly suggest that glimepiride and glibenclamide, both of which belong to SU agents, should have PPARγ agonist activity, whose potencies were 16–25% of the maximum level achieved by pioglitazone. Our observation that glimepiride and glibenclamide could act not only on SU receptor but also on PPARγ may give an important clue to the development of novel antidiabetic drugs, which can enhance both insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and peripheral insulin sensitivity.

IntroductionHyperglycemia seen in type 2 diabetes is caused by defects in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues such as liver, muscle, and fat. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) 1The abbreviations used are: TZD, thiazolidinedione; AF-2, activation function-2; DRIP205, vitamin D receptor-interacting protein 205; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK 293, human embryonic kidney 293; N-CoR, nuclear receptor corepressor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; mPPAR, mouse PPAR; PPRE, PPAR-responsive element; SU, sulfonylurea; SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors. are a new class of hypoglycemic agents that improve peripheral insulin resistance (1Olefsky J.M.

TZDs bind and activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a key transcription factor involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, and adipose differentiation (2Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B.

Invest. 1998; 101: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). PPARγ is highly expressed in adipose tissues and most pharmacological actions of TZDs are thought to be through the PPARγ activation in adipose cells (6Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 7Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Trends Pharmacol.

In addition to TZDs, structurally diverse synthetic compounds including N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-l-leucine (12Rocchi S. Picard F. Vamecq J. Gelman L. Potier N. Zeyer D. Dubuquoy L.

Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3406-3410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) also possess the activities as PPARγ ligands. Furthermore, one of the angiotensin II receptor antagonists, telmisartan, has been recently demonstrated to act as a partial agonist for PPARγ (14Benson S.C. Pershadsingh H.A. Ho C.I. Chittiboyina A. Desai P. Pravenec M. Qi N. Wang J. Avery M.A. Kurtz T.W. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Thus, one of the unique characteristics of PPARγ is that a wide range of lipophilic molecules can interact with it. Agonistic ligands activate PPARγ through direct interactions with the ligand-binding domain in its C-terminal region. The rather spacious ligand-binding pocket of PPARγ is thought to potentially accommodate multiple lipophilic ligands (15Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar).Sulfonylurea (SU) agents have played a pivotal role in the drug therapy of type 2 diabetes patients as effective oral hypoglycemic agents for several decades. They stimulate insulin secretion primarily by binding to the SU receptor on the plasma membrane of pancreatic β-cells (16Gribble F.M. Ashcroft F.M. Metabolism. 2000; 49: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition to such actions on the pancreas, several reports have pointed out that some SU agents, such as glimepiride and glibenclamide, have direct effects to potentiate or mimic the insulin action in adipocytes (17Jacobs D.B. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Muller G. Satoh Y. Geisen K. Diabetes Res. Clin.

However, the molecular mechanisms of such extrapancreatic effects of SU agents have not been unraveled.The present study was designed to determine the direct effects of SU agents on PPARγ transcriptional activity in adipocytes. We found that SU agents, such as glimepiride and glibenclamide, possessed agonistic activities for PPARγ and affected adipose gene expression. Our results are potentially useful for the design and development of effective novel antidiabetic drugs that enhance both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[3H]Rosiglitazone (specific activity 50 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO).

At 20 h after a drug treatment, luciferase reporter assays were performed using a luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase values were normalized by an internal β-galactosidase control and expressed as relative luciferase activity.Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted with Sepasol-RNA I Super (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Thermoscript RT (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer. Real time quantitative PCR amplification was performed on the LightCycler thermal cycler (Roche Applied Science) using LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science).

The ligand-binding domain of PPARγ was fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4. Because the reporter used is activated only by the exogenous GAL4-chimera receptors, the effects of endogenous receptors are eliminated. Interestingly, we found that glimepiride and glibenclamide induced GAL4-PPARγ transcriptional activities; however, such increases were not seen with other SU agents, including tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, and gliclazide, at a dose of 10 μm (Fig. 1A).Next, we examined the concentration-dependent activation of GAL4-PPARγ by SU agents in HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment with glimepiride or glibenclamide resulted in concentration-dependent activation of GAL4-PPARγ. Glimepiride and glibenclamide activated GAL4-PPARγ up to 16 and 25% of the maximum level achieved by pioglitazone, respectively. Tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, and gliclazide also caused activation of GAL4-PPARγ at relatively higher doses than glimepiride and glibenclamide (Fig. 1B).To examine the PPAR subtype selectivity of glimepiride, we performed reporter assays using the GAL4-PPARs in HEK 293 cells. Wy 14643, GW 501516, and pioglitazone, known as a specific ligand for each PPAR subtype (30Hsu M.H. Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 5306-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar), activated GAL4-PPARα, GAL4-PPARδ, and GAL4-PPARγ, respectively (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, glimepiride activated GAL4-PPARγ, but not GAL4-PPARα and PPARδ (Fig. 1C). Glimepiride had no effects on the transcriptional activities of other GAL4-chimeric nuclear receptors, such as RXRα, LXRα, LXRβ, and FXR (data not shown).To clarify whether glimepiride and glibenclamide directly bind to PPARγ, we performed competitive binding assays using GST-full-length PPARγ and [3H]rosiglitazone. The displacement of [3H]rosiglitazone by pioglitazone was seen, and the IC50 value was 3.0 μm (Fig. 1D). The displacements by glimepiride and glibenclamide were also concentration-dependent, and IC50 values were 27 and 7.6 μm, respectively (Fig. 1D). These data strongly suggest that both glimepiride and glibenclamide activate PPARγ through the direct association and that they could be considered as partial agonists for PPARγ.Glimepiride Increases the Interaction of PPARγ with Cofactors—Upon ligand binding, nuclear receptors undergo conformational changes that result in AF-2 domain-dependent dissociation of corepressors and recruitment of coactivators (32Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effect of glimepiride on a PPARγ AF-2 deletion mutant by cotransfecting full-length PPARγ or mutant PPARγ (ΔAF-2) and PPREx3-tk-LUC receptor. Glimepiride as well as pioglitazone activated full-length PPARγ. However, glimepiride-dependent activation of PPARγ was completely abolished by truncation of the AF-2 domain (Fig. 2A). To confirm the expression of mutant PPARγ (ΔAF-2), we performed the Western blot analysis. Full-length PPARγ was detected in the expected size, with both anti-PPARγ antibodies recognizing the N terminus (H-100) and C terminus (E-8) of PPARγ. On the other hand, the ΔAF-2 PPARγ was detected only with the H-100 antibody, not with the E-8 antibody (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Glimepiride affects the interaction of PPARγ with cofactors.A, AF-2-dependent activation of PPARγ by glimepiride. HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with CMX vector, CMX-mPPARγ, or CMX-ΔmPPARγ and PPREx3-tk-LUC and treated with vehicle control (cont), 1 μm pioglitazone (pio), or 10 μm glimepiride (gmp). Luciferase values were normalized by β-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative luciferase activity. Values are mean ± S.E. (n = 3). Cell lysates from HEK 293 cells transfected with pCMX-mPPARγ or pCMX-ΔmPPARγ were immunoblotted with anti-PPARγ antibody recognizing the N terminus (H-100) or C terminus (E-8) of PPARγ. CMX vector was used as a control. B and C, effects of glimepiride on interaction between PPARγ and cofactors in cell-based assays. Mammalian two-hybrid analyses were performed by using GAL4-DRIP205 or GAL4-N-CoR in combination with VP16 or VP16-mPPARγ and MH100(UAS)x4-tk-LUC in HEK 293 cells. The cells were then treated with vehicle control, 1 μm pioglitazone, or 10 μm glimepiride. Luciferase values were normalized by β-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative luciferase activity. Values are mean ± S.E. (n = 3). D, effect of glimepiride on interaction between PPARγ and DRIP205 in a cell-free system. GST pull-down assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the presence of pioglitazone or glimepiride, in vitro translated 35S-mouse PPARγ was detected as a result of interaction with GST-DRIP205. Representative data from three experiments are presented. E, effect of glimepiride on interaction between PPARγ and N-CoR in a cell-free system. In the presence of rosiglitazone (rosi) or glimepiride, in vitro translated [35S]N-CoR was detected as a result of interaction with GST-PPARγ. Representative data from three experiments are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we examined the effect of glimepiride on the interaction of PPARγ and the coactivator DRIP205, also known as PPAR-binding protein (33Zhu Y.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8008-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), or corepressor N-CoR by mammalian two-hybrid assays in HEK 293 cells. The assays were performed using full-length PPARγ fused to the transactivation domain of herpesvirus VP16 protein and the nuclear receptor-interacting domain of DRIP205 or N-CoR fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 for detection of ligand-dependent cofactor recruitment or detachment (35Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). Both pioglitazone and glimepiride markedly increased the transcriptional activity by cotransfection of VP16-PPARγ, GAL4-DRIP205, and GAL4-responsive LUC reporter (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that glimepiride induces the association of PPARγ with DRIP205. On the other hand, cotransfection of VP16-PPARγ with GAL4-N-CoR resulted in activation of the reporter without ligands. The reporter activity was markedly inhibited in the presence of pioglitazone or glimepiride (Fig. 2C). Similar inhibitory effects by pioglitazone and glimepiride were also seen upon interaction of PPARγ with SMRT, another corepressor (data not shown). These results suggest that glimepiride induces the dissociation of PPARγ from N-CoR or SMRT.We also verified the direct effect of glimepiride on interaction of full-length PPARγ with DRIP205 using GST pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 2D, 35S-labeled PPARγ slightly bound to GST-DRIP205 (lane 7), and this binding was augmented by pioglitazone (lane 8). Similarly, glimepiride induced the association of labeled PPARγ with GST-DRIP205 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D, lanes 9–11). The binding between GST alone and labeled PPARγ was not observed in the absence or presence of ligands (Fig. 2D, lanes 2–6). These data suggest that direct binding of glimepiride to PPARγ induces the association of PPARγ with DRIP205. Furthermore, we examined the direct effect of glimepiride on the interaction of full-length PPARγ with N-CoR. GST-PPARγ strongly bound to 35S-labeled N-CoR in the absence of ligands (Fig. 2E, lane 7). Both glimepiride and rosiglitazone induced the dissociation of GST-PPARγ from labeled N-CoR (Fig. 2E, lanes 8–11). The binding between GST alone and labeled N-CoR was not observed in the absence or presence of ligands (Fig. 2E, lanes 2–6). These data suggest that direct binding of glimepiride to PPARγ induces the dissociation of PPARγ from N-CoR.Glimepiride and Glibenclamide Induce PPAR-dependent Transcriptional Activities in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—To investigate the effects of glimepiride and glibenclamide on PPAR-dependent transactivation in adipocytes, we performed luciferase reporter assays using the PPREx3-tk-LUC in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Glimepiride significantly induced the activity of the PPRE reporter in adipocytes in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3A). Glibenclamide also activated the PPRE reporter in adipocytes as effectively as glimepiride (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that both glimepiride and glibenclamide should activate endogenous PPARγ in adipocytes. Next, we examined the effect of glimepiride on the transcriptional activity of the adiponectin gene in 3T3-L1 adipocyte"
https://openalex.org/W1965410991,"A single base (U1939) within E. coli 23S ribosomal RNA is methylated by its dedicated enzyme, RumA. The structure of RumA/RNA/S-adenosylhomocysteine uncovers the mechanism for achieving unique selectivity. The single-stranded substrate is “refolded” on the enzyme into a compact conformation with six key intra-RNA interactions. The RNA substrate contributes directly to catalysis. In addition to the target base, a second base is “flipped out” from the core loop to stack against the adenine of the cofactor S-adenosylhomocysteine. Nucleotides in permuted sequence order are stacked into the site vacated by the everted target U1939 and compensate for the energetic penalty of base eversion. The 3′ hairpin segment of the RNA binds distal to the active site and provides binding energy that contributes to enhanced catalytic efficiency. Active collaboration of RNA in catalysis leads us to conclude that RumA and its substrate RNA may reflect features from the earliest RNA-protein era."

The specifics of the role of Surf1p have remained unresolved. Numerous mutations in human Surf1p lead to severe mitochondrial disease. A homolog of human Surf1p is encoded by the genome of the α-proteobacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which synthesizes a mitochondrial-like aa3-type cytochrome-c oxidase. The gene for Surf1p was deleted from the genome of R. sphaeroides. The resulting aa3-type oxidase was purified and analyzed by biochemical methods plus optical and EPR spectroscopy. The oxidase that assembled in the absence of Surf1p was composed of three subpopulations with structurally distinct heme a3-Cu active sites. 50% of the oxidase lacked heme a3, 10–15% contained heme a3 but lacked CuBB, and 35–40% had a normal heme a3 -CuB active site with normal activity. CuA assembly was unaffected. All of the oxidase contained low-spin heme a, but the environment of the heme a center was slightly altered in the 50% of the enzyme that lacked heme a3. Introduction of a normal copy of the gene for Surf1p on an exogenous plasmid resulted in a single population of normally assembled, highly active enzyme. The data indicate that Surf1p plays a role in facilitating the insertion of heme a3 into the active site of cytochrome-c oxidase.

Cytochrome-c oxidase (CcO) 1The abbreviations used are: CcO, cytochrome-c oxidase; Strep/Spec, streptomycin and spectinomycin. functions as the terminal member of the respiratory electron transfer chain in mitochondria. Electrons from soluble cytochrome c are first transferred to a dimeric copper center in subunit II, CuA, then on to six-coordinate heme a in subunit I, and finally to the buried heme a3-CuB site, also located in subunit I, where O2 is reduced to water (1Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Some of the energy of electron transfer is used to pump protons through the protein, across its host membrane. Rhodobacter sphaeroides, a member of the α-subgroup of the proteobacteria that gave rise to mitochondria, synthesizes an aa3-type oxidase with high genetic and structural similarity to the subunits of the catalytic core (I, II, and III) of mammalian CcO (2Shapleigh J.P.

R. sphaeroides has proven to be highly useful for producing engineered forms of its mitochondrial-like oxidase, thus providing experimental models for elucidating structure/function relationships for the catalytic core of CcO. Numerous proteins that are not members of the final complex are specifically required for the assembly of CcO in eukaryotic cells (5Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The genome of R. sphaeroides encodes homologs of five of these assembly proteins, which are also present in yeast and human cells. The presence of these proteins in R. sphaeroides and related bacteria suggests that they play a fundamental role in the assembly of the catalytic core. Including this report, the evidence for a role in CcO assembly for at least four of these five bacterial proteins is compelling. Cox10p and Cox15p of R. sphaeroides form a membrane complex that coverts heme B to heme A (7Brown B.M. Wang Z. Brown K.R. Cricco J.A. Hegg E.L.

Here, we report the analysis of CcO synthesized in the absence of Surf1p of R. sphaeroides, the fifth of the conserved CcO assembly proteins present in this bacterium. It is well established that Surf1p is essential for the assembly of normal amounts of mitochondrial CcO (11Williams S.L. Valnot I. Rustin P. Taanman J.W. J. Biol.

Houstkova H. Hansikova H. Zeman J. Houstek J. Physiol. Res. 2004; 53: S213-S223PubMed Google Scholar). At least 40 different mutations in Surf1p of humans lead to CcO deficiency, resulting in severe mitochondrial disease (14Pecina P. Houstkova H. Hansikova H. Zeman J. Houstek J. Physiol. Res. 2004; 53: S213-S223PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, human Surf1p has been linked with a greater number of defects leading to human disease than any of the other CcO assembly proteins (14Pecina P. Houstkova H. Hansikova H. Zeman J. Houstek J. Physiol. Res. 2004; 53: S213-S223PubMed Google Scholar). Surf1p is anchored in the inner mitochondrial membrane (or the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane) by two predicted transmembrane helices, one each at the N and C termini of the protein (15Mashkevich G.

The predicted sizes of human (GenBank™ accession number NP_003163) and R. sphaeroides Surf1p (AY918925) are similar (300 versus 262 residues). Using EMBOSS-Align (European Bioinformatics Institute), the DNA-predicted amino acid sequence of R. sphaeroides Surf1p is 31% identical and 45% similar to human Surf1p. Essentially all of this homology is found in the extramembrane domains of the two proteins; the sequences of the transmembrane helices are not conserved. Surf1p of R. sphaeroides is no less similar to human Surf1p than is Shy1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the yeast homolog of Surf1p (15Mashkevich G. Repetto B. Glerum D.M. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

The gel-purified fragment was restricted with EcoRI and ligated into the EcoRI site of pUC18 to create pDS301.

The Strep/Spec-resistant exconjugate colonies were replica-plated onto media containing 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline to identify cells in which double crossover events had eliminated the plasmid from the genome leaving behind the modified surf1. Tetracycline-sensitive (double crossover) exconjugates were analyzed by PCR using primers just outside of the Surf1EcoRIforward and Surf1EcoRIreverse primers for the presence of an ∼3.6-kbp fragment containing modified surf1 plus the Strep/Spec resistance gene. Three such isolates were identified, and one was carried forward for use as the surf1 deletion strain, DS003. The 1.8-kbp EcoRI fragment containing surf1 from pDS301 was cloned into the broad host range vector pBBR1MCS-2 (22Kovach M.E. Elzer P.H. Hill D.S. Robertson G.T. Farris M.A. Roop II, R.M.

An extinction coefficient of 40 mm–1 cm–1 (27Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was used for the wild-type oxidase and the oxidase isolated from DS020 (see below). The contribution to α-band absorbance by heme a3 is ∼20% (27Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Once it became apparent that the oxidase that assembles in the absence of Surf1p lacked 50% of its heme a3 (see below), an extinction coefficient of 36 mm–1 cm–1 was then used for this oxidase form in order to more closely estimate the concentration of the protein. The binding of CO and CN– were performed as described (25Bratton M.R. Pressler M.A. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16236-16245Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were obtained as noted in the legend to Fig. 2. Biochemical and Spectroscopic Characteristics of the aa3-type Cytochrome-c Oxidase That Assembles in the Absence of Surf1p—In the R. sphaeroides genome, surf1 is located immediately adjacent to the gene for subunit III of the aa3-type oxidase, as the first gene in what appears to be a four-gene operon. Three downstream genes encode a putative threonine synthase, a peptidase of the M16 family, and a putative alanine acetyltransferase. In the surf1 deletion strain, DS003, a 0.4-kbp fragment encoding residues Trp-64 through Pro-195 of Surf1p (i.e. most of the conserved extramembrane domain) was deleted and replaced by a gene encoding resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin. DS003 grew as well as wild-type strain 2.4.1 under aerobic conditions, indicating that the presence of the antibiotic resistance gene at this position was not cytotoxic. The growth rate of DS003 was the same whether or not the minimal growth media was supplemented with l-threonine. Thus, the expression of the downstream threonine synthase was sufficient for cell needs despite possible polar effects from the insertion of the antibiotic resistance gene. A strain (DS009) for over-expression of the aa3-type CcO in the absence of Surf1p was created by introducing the expression plasmid pRKpAH1H32 (9Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which contains the genes for subunits I, II, and III as well as those for the assembly proteins Cox10p and Cox11p, into DS003. DS009 also grew at a normal rate. This indicates that expressing the aa3-type oxidase in the absence of Surf1p is not harmful to the cell but, other than that, it yields no information about the assembly of the oxidase. Even the complete absence of the aa3-type oxidase from R. sphaeroides does not affect the aerobic growth rate, because a cbb3-type CcO is also synthesized to high levels during aerobic growth (28García-Horsman J.A. Berry E. Shapleigh J.P. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The aa3-type oxidase was isolated from purified DS009 membranes via its histidine tag on the C terminus of subunit I (23Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Mitchell D.M. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and termed ΔSurf1p CcO. Extensive use of this tag to isolate the wild-type oxidase and many mutant oxidase forms has shown that the tag itself does not alter the structural or functional properties of the oxidase. The cytochrome c-driven O2 reduction activity of purified ΔSurf1p CcO (Vmax = 706 ± 29 s–1) was ∼35% that of the wild-type enzyme (Vmax = 2074 ± 45 s–1). This indicated an overall decrease in activity or the presence of at least two oxidase forms, one active and one inactive. Densitometry of protein gels (not shown) showed that the subunit composition of the CcO complex that assembled in the absence of Surf1p was entirely normal. Inspection of the absolute spectrum of dithionite-reduced ΔSurf1p CcO showed a significant decrease in the ratio of the amplitudes of the Soret peak at ∼444 nm and the α peak at ∼605 nm (Fig. 1A; Table I). Because the α peak absorbance is primarily due to heme a (80%) and the Soret absorbance is more equally contributed by both hemes a and a3 (27Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), this decrease in the Soret/α amplitude ratio suggested a loss of heme a3. The Soret/α value of ΔSurf1p CcO is approximately half way between that of the wild-type oxidase and the theoretical value for an oxidase lacking all heme a3, calculated from the extinction values of Vanneste (27Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Table ISpectroscopic characterization of CcO forms that assemble with and without Surf1pCcO formSoret/α from reduced spectrumHeme A content (heme A per monomer)Heme a3 contentNormal heme a3-CuB contentWild-type (normal aa3)5.3-5.5 (n = 5)2.04 ± 0.02 (n = 3)100% (81.6 ± 3.7; n = 3)100% (18.4 ± 1.3; n = 3)ΔSurf1p aa3 (from DS009)4.5-4.8 (n = 10)1.46 ± 0.06 (n = 3)51% (41.2 ± 5.0; n = 3)37% (6.8 ± 0.3; n = 4)DS020 (Surf1p complementation)5.4-5.5 (n = 3)1.95 ± 0.13 (n = 3)100% (81.7 ± 0.4; n = 3)99% (18.3 ± 1.9; n = 3) Open table in a new tab The heme A content of ΔSurf1p CcO was measured to be 75% that of the wild-type oxidase by pyridine hemochrome analysis (Table I). Because the content of six-coordinate heme a appears normal based on the amplitude of the α peak and the Soret/α value, this indicated the loss of 50% of the heme a3 of ΔSurf1p CcO. Measurements of the extent of carbon monoxide (CO) binding to ΔSurf1p CcO confirmed this loss of heme a3. The CO difference spectrum (a2+ a 2+–CO minus a32+ a3 2+) is solely due to five-coordinate heme a3, because six-coordinate heme a does not bind CO (30Rich P.R. Moody A.J. Graber P. Milazzo G. Bioenergetics. Birkhauser Verlag Basel, Basel, Switzerland1997: 418-456Crossref Google Scholar) and its absorbance contribution is subtracted. From the amplitude of the trough at 472–447 nm in the CO difference spectrum, it was determined that ΔSurf1p CcO bound ∼50% less CO than the same amount of wild-type CcO, consistent with a heme a3 content of 50% less than normal. The CO difference spectrum of wild-type CcO contains a peak at 430 nm due to the absorbance of the low-spin heme a3–CO adduct (Fig. 1B) (30Rich P.R. Moody A.J. Graber P. Milazzo G. Bioenergetics. Birkhauser Verlag Basel, Basel, Switzerland1997: 418-456Crossref Google Scholar). This peak is also present in the CO difference spectrum of ΔSurf1p CcO, but an absorbance shoulder ∼419 nm is also present. This indicates the presence of a small amount of heme a3 in ΔSurf1p CcO that resists reduction by sodium dithionite and does not bind CO (27Vanneste W.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A sensitive optical assay for the presence of a normally assembled heme a3-CuB active site is the ability of CN– to bind to the reduced enzyme (25Bratton M.R. Pressler M.A. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16236-16245Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Rich P.R. Moody A.J. Graber P. Milazzo G. Bioenergetics. Birkhauser Verlag Basel, Basel, Switzerland1997: 418-456Crossref Google Scholar, 31Mitchell R. Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7576-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cyanide moves to the active site as neutral HCN, where it dissociates to allow CN– to bind to heme a3. In the reduced active site, the presence of CuB is required to bind the resulting H+, presumably on a hydroxyl anion bound to the copper (31Mitchell R. Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7576-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Mitchell R. Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The CN– difference spectrum (a2+ a32+–CN– minus a2+ a32+) of the reduced, normal oxidase shows a characteristic peak at 590 nm (resulting from the low-spin heme a3–CN– adduct) and a trough at 613 nm (Fig. 1C) (30Rich P.R. Moody A.J. Graber P. Milazzo G. Bioenergetics. Birkhauser Verlag Basel, Basel, Switzerland1997: 418-456Crossref Google Scholar, 31Mitchell R. Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7576-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The 590–613 nm absorption of ΔSurf1p CcO was measured to be 37% that of wild-type CcO (Table I), indicating that slightly more than one-third of the ΔSurf1p CcO contained a normal active site. This agreed well with the amount of normal oxidase (35%) indicated by activity measurements of ΔSurf1p CcO. As a negative control, the oxidase isolated from our bacterial strain lacking the copper chaperone Cox11p, an enzyme that contains heme a3 but lacks CuB (9Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), failed to bind any CN– in its reduced form (data not shown). Complementation of the Deletion—The Surf1p expression vector pDS306, which is compatible with the pRK415-based CcO expression plasmid pRKpAH1H32, was introduced into DS009 to create strain DS020. The aa3-type oxidase isolated from DS020 had wild-type activity (Vmax = 2195 ± 133 s–1), a normal heme A content, and a structurally normal active site based on CN– and CO binding (Table I). Thus, a single plasmid-borne copy of surf1 complements the deletion of the genomic copy of the gene. In a separate control experiment, the pRKpAH1H32 plasmid expressing ΔSurf1p CcO was extracted from DS009 and conjugated into YZ200, a strain of R. sphaeroides lacking the genomic copies of the genes for subunits II and III, as well as the assembly proteins Cox10p and Cox11p (23Zhen Y. Qian J. Follmann K. Hayward T. Nilsson T. Dahn M. Hilmi Y. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The CcO isolated from this strain (DS021) via the histidine tag present on the subunit I expressed from the plasmid was completely normal with high activity (data not shown). This demonstrated that the defective CcO isolated from DS009 could not have resulted from spontaneous alteration of any of the five genes present in pRKpAH1H32. Together, these results confirmed that the absence of Surf1p, and not another gene product, was responsible for the defective assembly of the heme a3-CuB active site of the aa3-type CcO. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectroscopy provides direct information about the environment and quantity of CuA and heme a in CcO (26Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Stevens T.H. Martin C.T. Wang H. Brudvig G.W. Scholes C.P. Chan S.I. J. Biol.

Acta. 1976; 422: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The structure and the quantity of the CuA center in subunit II of ΔSurf1p CcO appeared completely normal (Fig. 2). The gz component of the heme a signal of wild-type CcO appears as a sharp peak at g = 2.81 (Fig. 2) (26Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This signal was also present in ΔSurf1p CcO, but its amplitude was ∼50% that of the gz signal for heme a of wild-type CcO. An additional, broadened signal was observed immediately downfield of the gz signal in the spectrum of ΔSurf1p CcO. In a separate experiment, the g ≃ 3 region of wild-type and ΔSurf1p CcO was more highly resolved (Fig. 2, inset). Both spectra show a broad peak centered at g = 2.89 in addition to the g = 2.81 signal. However, although the g = 2.89 signal is a minor component in the spectrum of wild-type CcO, integration showed that the broad g = 2.89 signal and the more narrow g = 2.81 signals each contributed ∼50% of the total gz signal of heme a of ΔSurf1p CcO. In the normal heme a3-CuB center of oxidized CcO, the unpaired electrons of heme a3 and CuB are spin-coupled such that both centers are EPR-silent (35Tweedle M.F. Wilson L.J. Garcia-Iniguez L. Babcock G.T. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8065-8071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of CuB, however, high-spin heme a3 yields a signal at g ≃ 6 (9Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36Hunter D.J. Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Ingledew W.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An elevated g ∼ 6 signal in the spectrum of ΔSurf1p CcO (Fig. 2) indicates the presence of some high-spin heme a3. Using our previously published spectra of the ΔCuB oxidase as a standard for 100% high-spin heme a3 (9Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the slightly elevated g ≃ 6 signal in the spectrum of ΔSurf1p CcO indicates the presence of ∼15% high-spin heme a3. This strongly suggests that about 15% of ΔSurf1p CcO contains heme a3 but lacks CuB. The relationship of this finding to the spectroscopic results in Table I is discussed immediately below. The CcO population that assembles in the absence of Surf1p contains three distinct configurations of the heme a3-CuB active site. First, ∼50% of ΔSurf1p CcO lacks heme a3, as evidenced by the Soret/α value, measurements of heme A content and the amount of CO binding. Second, 35–40% of the CcO population is active and contains a normal heme a3-CuB active site, as shown by activity measurements and the extent of CN– binding to the reduced enzyme. Third, optical and EPR spectroscopy reveal a smaller population, corresponding to the remaining 10–15%, in which the active site contains heme a3 in the normal high-spin configuration but lacks CuB. The evidence for this is as follows. Carbon monoxide binding, which requires reduced heme a3 but not CuB (31Mitchell R. Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7576-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), shows the presence of 50% heme a3 in ΔSurf1p CcO. However, CN– binding to the reduced enzyme, which requires both heme a3 and CuB (31Mitchell R. Moody A.J. Rich P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7576-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Mitchell R. Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), is only 35–40% that of normal CcO. Together this indicates that 10–15% of the ΔSurf1p CcO contains heme a3, but not CuB. This conclusion can be derived independently from the EPR spectra. The presence of ∼15% high-spin heme in ΔSurf1p CcO (Fig. 2) is best explained by the presence of a subpopulation that contains high-spin heme a3 but lacks CuB (9Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In addition, preliminary metal analysis data are consistent with the absence of CuB in the 50% of ΔSurf1p CcO that lacks heme a3. It should be noted, however, that metal content measurements are complicated by the fact that a 50–60% loss of CuB in the presence of a normal CuA center leads to only a 17–20% loss of the total amount of copper in each CcO monomer. Assembly in the absence of Surf1p does not affect metallation of the heme a and CuA sites. Retention of the α band ∼605 nm in the optical spectrum of reduced ΔSurf1p CcO, along with the fact that all of the loss of heme A is accounted for by the loss of heme a3, indicates that each ΔSurf1p CcO monomer contains a heme a center. Two configurations of heme a were revealed in the EPR spectrum of ΔSurf1p CcO, however. Each accounted for half of the total amount of heme a. Structural disruption of the heme a3-CuB active site has previously been shown to lead to broadened gz signals in the g ≃ 3 region (9Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 37Mitchell D.M. Aasa R. Δdelroth P. Brzezinski P. Gennis R.B. Malmström B.G.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12989-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both hemes a and a3 are bound to transmembrane helix 10 in subunit I (4Svensson-Ek M. Abramson J. Larsson G. Törnroth S. Brzezinski P. Iwata S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 39Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Calhoun M.W. Thomas J.W. Hill J. Lemieux L. Ma J.

Biomembr. 1993; 25: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and EPR spectroscopy is highly sensitive to structural changes in the environment of heme a, such as alterations in hydrogen bonds to the axial histidine ligands (26Hosler J.P. Fetter J. Tecklenburg M.M. Espe M. Lerma C. Ferguson-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24264-24272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we assign the g = 2.81 signal to the 50% of ΔSurf1p CcO that contains heme a3 and the broad g = 2.89 signal to the 50% of ΔSurf1p CcO that lacks heme a3. The EPR spectra also show that ΔSurf1p CcO contains a normal amount of properly assembled CuA in subunit II. This is the first demonstration that Surf1p plays a role in the assembly of the metal centers of CcO. The assembly role of Surf1p is clearly limited to the heme a3-CuB active site. Formally, Surf1p could be involved in heme a3 insertion, or it could be involved in the insertion of CuB if the assembly of CuB is a prerequisite for the assembly of heme a3. However, we have previously demonstrated that heme a3 insertion does not require the prior assembly of CuB (9Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, the sum of our previous and present results argues for a role for Surf1p in the assembly of the heme a3 center. The putative absence of CuB when heme a3 is also absent suggests that stable binding of this copper requires the presence of the active site heme. As yet, it cannot be discerned whether Surf1p plays a direct (e.g. as a heme chaperone) or an indirect role in the insertion of heme a3. Surf1p may interact with the proposed Cox10p-Cox15p complex that synthesizes and possibly inserts heme A (7Brown B.M. Wang Z. Brown K.R. Cricco J.A. Hegg E.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13541-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Surf1p could interact with subunits I or II to facilitate the assembly of the heme a3-CuB center. In this light, an apparent association of Surf1p and subunit II has been reported for cultured human cells (12Nijtmans L.G. Artal Sanz M. Bucko M. Farhoud M.H. Feenstra M. Hakkaart G.A. Zeviani M. Grivell L.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The finding that some normally assembled CcO accumulates in the absence of Surf1p in R. sphaeroides is consistent with reports of the assembly of mitochondrial CcO in the absence of Surf1p. A constitutive knock-out of both surf1 alleles in mice is highly detrimental but not 100% lethal, indicating the production of some active CcO (40Agostino A. Invernizzi F. Tiveron C. Fagiolari G. Prelle A. Lamantea E. Giavazzi A. Battaglia G. Tatangelo L. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mutations that lead to the absence of Surf1p in humans, causing Leigh syndrome, severely decrease the amount of CcO, but some CcO is correctly assembled and active (14Pecina P. Houstkova H. Hansikova H. Zeman J. Houstek J. Physiol. Res. 2004; 53: S213-S223PubMed Google Scholar). Work with the R. sphaeroides system has previously demonstrated that assembly of the heme a3-CuB active site requires the association of subunit II with subunit I (38Bratton M.R. Hiser L. Antholine W.E. Hoganson C. Hosler J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12989-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The various proposals for Surf1p function in mitochondria center on the maturation of subunit I and the subsequent association of subunit I with subunit II (11Williams S.L. Valnot I. Rustin P.

Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3472-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our finding that Surf1p is involved in the assembly of heme a3 suggests that the assembly of the heme a3-CuB active site is the maturation step that makes it possible for subunits I and II to associate in mitochondria. The association of these subunits in R. sphaeroides does not absolutely require the assembly of the heme a3-CuB active site, as evidenced by this and two previous studies (9Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 41Hiser L. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45403-45407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the level of expression of the R. sphaeroides oxidase is lower in the absence of full assembly of the heme a3-CuB active site, suggesting that subunit association is less stable. The prerequisites for subunit association are likely to be more stringent in mitochondria than in R. sphaeroides because the core subunits do not associate independently but as members of subassemblies that include nuclear encoded accessory subunits (11Williams S.L.

The mutation and reduction of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been suggested as factors in the pathogenesis of diabetes. To elucidate the association of cellular mtDNA content and insulin resistance, we produced L6 GLUT4myc myocytes depleted of mtDNA by long term treatment with ethidium bromide. L6 GLUT4myc cells cultured with 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide (termed depleted cells) revealed a marked decrease in cellular mtDNA and ATP content, concomitant with a lack of mRNAs encoded by mtDNA. Interestingly, the mtDNA-depleted cells showed a drastic decrease in basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, indicating that L6 GLUT4myc cells develop impaired glucose utilization and insulin resistance. The repletion of mtDNA normalized basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The mRNA level and expression of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 associated with insulin signaling were decreased by 76 and 90% in the depleted cells, respectively. The plasma membrane (PM) GLUT4 in the basal state was decreased, and the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the PM was drastically reduced by mtDNA depletion. Moreover, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt2/protein kinase B were drastically reduced in the depleted cells. Those changes returned to control levels after mtDNA repletion. Taken together, our data suggest that PM GLUT4 content and insulin signal pathway intermediates are modulated by the alteration of cellular mtDNA content, and the reductions in the expression of IRS-1 and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt2/protein kinase B are associated with insulin resistance in the mtDNA-depleted L6 GLUT4myc myocytes.

Glucose uptake in mammalian cells is mediated by a family of intrinsic membrane proteins known as facilitative glucose transporters, GLUTs (1Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 2Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). GLUT4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter, is selectively expressed in muscle and adipose cells (3Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). GLUT4 in these cells constantly recycles between the plasma membrane and intracellular storage pools (4Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Malide D. Dwyer N.K. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Cushman S.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1083-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). About 90% of GLUT4 is sequestered intracellularly in the absence of insulin or other stimuli such as exercise (6Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Suzuki K. Kono T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in these cells primarily by inducing net translocation of GLUT4 from the intracellular storage sites to the plasma membrane (8Lee W. Ryu J. Souto R.P. Pilch P.F.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9358-9366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The reduction in cellular GLUT4 expression, GLUT4 translocation, and/or impaired insulin signaling would result in insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, the primary characteristics and hallmarks of NIDDM (10Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 175-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that NIDDM is a polygenic disorder composed of subtypes whereby genetic susceptibility is strongly associated with environmental factors (11Froguel P. Velho G. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes 22 tRNAs, 13 subunits of the electron transport system, and its own 16 and 26 S ribosomal RNAs, has been considered one of the genetic factors for the development of diabetes (12Gerbitz K.D. Gempel K. Brdiczka D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 113-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P.

Although mtDNA within the cells is heteroplasmic, it has been reported that ∼0.5–1.5% of diabetics over the age of 40 exhibit mtDNA abnormalities such as duplications (14Ballinger S.W. Shoffner J.M. Gebhart S. Koontz D.A. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 458-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), point mutations (15Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Mori Y. Tobe K. Sakuta R. Suzuki Y. Tanabe Y. Sakura H. Awata T. Goto Y. Hayakawa T. Matsuoka K. Kawamori R. Kamada T. Horai S. Nonaka I. Hagura R. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. N. Engl. J.

Genet. 1992; 1: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cellular oxidative capacity, which is mostly dependent on mitochondrial function, is directly correlated with insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscles (17Kelley D.E. Goodpaster B.H. Diabetes Care. 2001; 24: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 18Simoneau J.A. Colberg S.R. Thaete F.L. Kelley D.E.

Physiol. 1997; 83: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and reduced mitochondrial oxidation and phosphorylation determined by NMR are associated with insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of elderly people (20Petersen K.F. Befroy D. Dufour S. Dziura J. Ariyan C. Rothman D.L. DiPietro L. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Science. 2003; 300: 1140-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that impaired mitochondrial function results in insulin resistance. Moreover, the quantitative analysis of mtDNA revealed a decrease in mtDNA content in diabetic animals and humans (21Serradas P. Giroix M.H. Saulnier C. Gangnerau M.N. Borg L.A. Welsh M. Portha B. Welsh N. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5623-5631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Antonetti D.A. Reynet C. Kahn C.R. J. Clin.

Pract. 1998; 42: 161-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similarly cellular content of mtDNA in the pancreatic islets of Goto-Kakizaki rat was markedly decreased without major deletion or restriction fragment polymorphism in mtDNA (21Serradas P. Giroix M.H. Saulnier C. Gangnerau M.N. Borg L.A. Welsh M. Portha B. Welsh N. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5623-5631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blot analyses from type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients also revealed that the cellular mtDNA copy number in skeletal muscles was ∼50% of normal (22Antonetti D.A. Reynet C. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Lee et al. (23Lee H.K. Song J.H. Shin C.S. Park D.J. Park K.S. Lee K.U. Koh C.S. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1998; 42: 161-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) also reported that the quantitative decrease of mtDNA in lymphocytes preceded the type 2 diabetic development, suggesting that the decreased content of mtDNA might be a causal factor in type 2 diabetes. However, there is as yet no convincing evidence that the reduction of cellular mtDNA content in peripheral tissues such as muscle cells is responsible for the disturbances in the glucose uptake and insulin resistance. It has been reported that long term treatment of cells with low doses (0.1–2 μg/ml) of ethidium bromide (EtBr), an inhibitor of DNA/RNA synthesis, specifically suppresses the replication and transcription of extrachromosomal genetic components such as mtDNA without affecting nuclear DNA replication and transcription (24Zylber E. Vesco C. Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 44: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 25Desjardins P. Frost E. Morais R. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, mtDNA-depleted cells have been important tools in the investigation of the cellular components regulated by mtDNA (27King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence obtained from mtDNA-depleted cells have revealed that mitochondrial stress resulting from the reduction of mtDNA causes substantial activation and inactivation of nuclear DNA-encoded gene expression (28Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 29Amuthan G. Biswas G.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the mtDNA depletion is a contributing factor in the expression of molecules responsible for the insulin signaling and GLUT4 translocation. In the present study, we report that the depletion of mtDNA in L6 GLUT4myc myocytes is directly correlated with drastic reduction in basal glucose utilization and resistance to insulin stimulation as shown by glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. The expression level of IRS-1 was also reduced in the depleted cells with drastic reduction in the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the PM, and the insulin-stimulated phosphorylations of IRS-1 and protein kinase B (Akt2/PKB) were decreased in the depleted cells. These findings strongly suggest that the GLUT4 contents in the PM and insulin signal pathway intermediates are modulated by the alteration of cellular mtDNA content and that the reductions in the expression of IRS-1 and the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt2/PKB are associated with insulin resistance in the mtDNA-depleted L6 GLUT4myc myocytes. Materials—Anti-GLUT4 antibody (clone 1F8) and anti-GLUT1 antibody were purchased from Biogenesis Ltd. (Sandown, NH). IRAP antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Kozma (Metabolex Inc., Hayward, CA). Antibody against IRS-1, IRS-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt2/PKB, and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Horseradish peroxidase-labeled protein A and anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Anti-β-actin antibody, insulin (porcine crystalline), and O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody 9E10 for c-myc was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Oligonucleotide primers were from Bionics (Seoul, Korea). All other chemicals were standard commercial products of reagent grade quality except for individually stated reagents. Cell Culture—The parent cell line used in this study was L6 GLUT4myc, an L6 cell line (provided by Dr. Amira Klip (the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada)) expressing GLUT4-myc, constructed by inserting a human c-myc epitope (14 amino acids) into the first ectodomain of rat GLUT4 (32Kanai F. Nishioka Y. Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Todaka M. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14523-14526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The L6 GLUT4myc cell line with partially depleted mtDNA was isolated by treating L6 GLUT4myc myocytes with EtBr (0.2 μg/ml) and uridine (50 μg/ml) for 3 weeks in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The control parental L6 GLUT4myc myocytes were maintained for the same time period in normal culture condition. Since the depletion of mtDNA in myoblast treated with EtBr severely impairs the formation of myotube (33Herzberg N.H. Zwart R. Wolterman R.A. Ruiter J.P. Wanders R.J. Bolhuis P.A. van den Bogert C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which makes L6 GLUT4myc myocyte differentiation less quantitative and less reproducible, and since L6 GLUT4myc myocytes without differentiation possess GLUT4 recycling compartments, insulin-sensitive glucose uptake and the insulin signaling intermediates similar to primary muscle cells (34Wang Q.

Khayat Z.A. Huang C. Patel N. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we used L6 GLUT4myc myocytes to study how insulin stimulates glucose utilization. Myocytes were deprived of serum for 5 h prior to all experimental manipulations. Staining of Functional Mitochondria—L6 GLUT4myc myocytes were incubated with the mitochondria-specific cationic fluorescent dye, Mitotracker Green (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), for 15 min at 37 °C and washed three times with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell preparations were visualized and photographed in a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). The fluorescent intensity reflects the integrity of mitochondrial function (40Chen L.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 29: 103-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cellular ATP Levels—The cellular ATP was measured by using a somatic cell ATP assay kit (Sigma) as previously described (28Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Briefly, the harvested L6 GLUT4myc cells were lysed with “ATP-releasing reagent,” and the lysates were assayed with injector-equipped luminometer detection (Lumat LB 9501, Berthold, Germany) for luciferase activity as described in the manufacturer's procedure. Genomic DNA Extraction and PCR—Total cellular DNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions by using DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The amplification of mtDNA was performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2400 PCR thermocycler using the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min (initial denaturation), 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s (25 cycles), 72 °C for 10 min (final extension).

Open table in a new tab RNA Preparation—Total RNA was extracted using a standard Trizol RNA isolation protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 ml of Trizol reagent was mixed with cell pellet (5 × 105 cells) by repeated pipetting. DNA and protein were excluded by chloroform phase separation. RNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and then resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The quantity and quality of the isolated RNA were determined by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. RT-PCR Analysis—RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (41Han J.C. Park S.Y. Hah B.G. Choi G.H. Kim Y.K. Kwon T.H. Kim E.K. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. Lee W. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were established in our laboratory to allow comparisons between the expression of transcripts, which relate insulin signaling and glucose uptake. Under these conditions, the efficiency of the RT-PCR for each gene did not plateau, and the number of cycles used in these experiments was kept to a minimum. The relative expression levels of mRNA were determined by using 1.0 μg of total RNA as template and the optimal cycles of PCR with the optimal thermal conditions (Table I). As a control, we analyzed the transcription levels of β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using specific rat primers, the same amount of total RNA, and 25 PCR cycles. These were optimal conditions for the analysis of mRNA expression, and the analysis was limited to the products generated in the exponential phase of the amplification. After RT-PCR, the content of each independent reaction tube was subjected to electrophoresis on 2–3% agarose gels containing EtBr. Images from electrophoresed gels were captured by a camera in a computer-assisted imaging system (AlphaImager 1220; Alphainotech Co., San Leandro, CA). Quantitative Gene Expression Analysis—In order to confirm gene expression levels, quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out in Rotor Gene 2000 (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) using SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). All of the gene-specific primer sets used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table I. After amplification, the authenticity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Images from electrophoresed gels were captured by a camera in a computer-assisted imaging system (AlphaImager 1220). The qRT-PCR results were analyzed using Rotor-Gene analysis software version 6.0 (Corbett Research). The comparative cycle threshold (CT) method was used to analyze the data by generating relative values of the amount of target cDNA. Relative quantitation for any given gene, expressed as percentage variation over control, was calculated after determination of the difference between CT of the given gene A and that of the calibrator gene B (β-actin) in the depleted or reverted myocytes (ΔCT1 = CT1A – CTB) and control myocytes (ΔCT0 = CT0A – CTB) using the 2–ΔΔCT(1–0) formula. CT values are means of triplicate measurements. Experiments were repeated 3–5 times. Determination of 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG) and 3-O-Methylglucose (3OMG) Uptake—Cells were starved of serum for 4 h and washed twice with Hepes-buffered saline solution (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na-Hepes, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4). 2DG and 3OMG uptakes were measured as described previously (42Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 20 min in the presence or absence of insulin (100 nm) and then 2DG uptake (10 μm [14C]2DG, 1 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was measured for 3 min. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B and was subtracted from all values. 3OMG uptake was measured in a similar fashion with the following differences: 50 μm [14C]3OMG (4 μCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to Hepes-buffered saline solution, and uptake was allowed to occur for 15 s, a period over which 3OMG uptake is known to be linear. Subcellular Fractionation—Membrane preparations were performed as described previously for wild type L6 cells (34Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of membrane proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose paper filters. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Membranes solubilized in Laemmli solution were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8 or 10% resolving gels as described (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with primary antibodies in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% nonfat milk. After overnight incubation, membranes were washed with TTBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled protein A (for the detection of polyclonal antibodies) or horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (for the detection of monoclonal antibodies). Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoblot intensities were quantitated by densitometry using an analytical scanning system (AlphaImager 1220). Measurement of GLUT4myc Translocation—The movement of myc-tagged GLUT4 to the cell surface was measured by an antibody-coupled colorimetric assay (34Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A.

Quiescent L6 GLUT4myc cells treated as indicated were washed once with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3 min at room temperature, and the fixative was immediately neutralized by incubation with 1% glycine in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibody (anti-c-myc, 9E10) was then added into the cultures at a dilution of 1:100 and maintained for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were extensively washed with PBS before introducing peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1000). After 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were extensively washed, and 1 ml of O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent (0.4 mg/ml O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and 0.4 mg/ml urea hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 m phosphate/citrate) was added to each well for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.25 ml of 3 n HCl. The supernatant was collected and the optical absorbance was measured at 492 nm. For phosphoprotein analysis, total cell lysates were prepared as described previously with modifications (44Huang C. Somwar R. Patel N. Niu W. Torok D. Klip A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Following appropriate incubation in the presence or absence of insulin (100 nm), cells were lysed on ice with 150 μm 2× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 7.5% β-mercaptoethanol, phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na2VO4 and 100 nm okadaic acid), and protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm E-64, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm leupeptin), passed five times through a 24-gauge syringe, and heated for 15 min at 65 °C. Total protein (50 μg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the respective phosphospecific antibody. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Where applicable, the significance of difference was analyzed using Student's t test for unpaired data. Long term treatment with low doses of EtBr is known to selectively inhibit mtDNA replication and transcription without detectable changes in nuclear DNA (24Zylber E. Vesco C. Penman S. J. Mol.

In a recent study, mtDNA of the C2C12 muscle cell line was partially depleted by long term exposure to EtBr, and the reversal of mtDNA depletion was successfully achieved by removal of EtBr (28Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The ability to partially deplete and replete the cellular mtDNA levels in cell lines by EtBr treatment would allow one to study cellular processes affected by changes in mtDNA content. To develop partially mtDNA-depleted muscle cell lines, we exposed L6 GLUT4myc myocytes to EtBr (0.2 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with pyruvate and uridine, previously shown to be essential for the growth of mtDNA-depleted cells (27King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The mtDNA content from L6 GLUT4myc myocytes cultured with or without EtBr was monitored routinely by amplifying genomic DNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1, A and B, shows that cytochrome oxidase subunits I (COX I) and II (COX II), which are encoded only in mtDNA, were hardly amplified from the genomic DNA of the cells treated with EtBr for 3 weeks.

Human AIFL has 598 amino acids, with a characteristic Rieske domain and a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain (Pyr_redox). AIFL shares 35% homology with AIF, mainly in the Pyr_redox domain. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed the expression of AIFL mRNA in all tissues tested, i.e. brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, ovary, pancreas, placenta, small intestine, and testis. We developed antibodies against human AIFL using fusion proteins as antigens. The antibodies specifically recognized the antigen and heterologously expressed AIFL proteins. The expression of AIFL proteins in human tissues was also ubiquitous, demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in tissue array slides. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence staining studies revealed that AIFL is predominantly localized to the mitochondria. Similar to AIF, overexpression of AIFL induced apoptosis, as shown by increased cytoplasmic nucleosomes and subdiploid cell populations in AIFL-transfected cells. The segment 1–190 containing the Rieske domain induced apoptosis, whereas the segment containing the Pyr_redox domain did not contribute to the pro-apoptotic function. The mitochondrial membrane potential of cells transfected with AIFL was significantly more depolarized than that of the control. AIFL transfection-induced cytochrome c release and cleavage of caspase 3. Furthermore, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk inhibited AIFL induced apoptosis.

The extrinsic pathway is initiated upon death receptor activation (4Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway is mainly through mitochondria (5Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar, 6Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), has also been reported to induce apoptosis when heterologously expressed. By blasting the human genome with AIF, we find a third gene that shares sequence homology to AIF, which we call AIF-like gene (AIFL). Because both AIF and AMID/PRG3 are involved in apoptosis, we hypothesized that AIFL may also play a role in apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to clone the human AIFL gene and characterize its expression and function. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry revealed the ubiquitous expression of AIFL in human tissues. Heterologous expression of AIFL protein in HEK 293 cells induced apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was more depolarized in AIFL-transfected cells than the control. Taken together, we cloned the AIFL gene with pro-apoptotic activities when heterologously expressed. Bioinformatics—Gene blasting was performed using the BLAST server (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) (36Zhang J. Madden T.L. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Domain structure was analyzed by the SMART program (smart.embl-heidelberg.de) (37Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Primers were designed by the Vector NTI software (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RT-PCR Cloning of Human AIFL—We designed PCR primers (see Supplemental Materials Table I) to amplify the hypothetical gene FLJ30473. Using RT-PCR, we amplified the full-length sequence of human AIFL from pooled human small intestine and colon cDNAs (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl using the high-fidelity TaqDNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Thirty-five PCR cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 3 min) were performed after an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min followed with a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. Sequencing of the PCR product revealed a cDNA sequence identical to the hypothetical gene FLJ30473. RT-PCR Analysis of the Tissue Distribution of AIFL Gene Expression—RT-PCR was performed using human cDNAs from Clontech. The PCR were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl using the high-fidelity TaqDNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). Thirty-five PCR cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s) were performed after denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min followed with a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. PCR primers are listed in supplemental materials Table I. All RT-PCR products were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained by ethidium bromide, and visualized by ultraviolet illumination. The band was cut and purified using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified PCR products were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1-V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The inserted PCR products were sequenced using the T7 primer. Plasmid Constructs—The AIFL full-length cDNA contains a BamHI site at 1789–1794 bp (just before the stop codon). To facilitate cloning of AIFL into different vectors, the 1791 base (T) was substituted with A to eliminate the BamHI site without changing the amino acid sequence of the protein (supplemental materials Table I). For expression of AIFL in mammalian cells, AIFL was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 after PCR amplification of the full-length cDNA by primers with the EcoRI site on the 5′ end and the SalI site on the 3′ end (the SalI site is compatible with the XhoI site of the pcDNA3 vector) because AIFL has an intrinsic XhoI site. For expression of AIFL-YFP fluorescent protein, AIFL was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of a pcDNA3-YFP vector. All truncation mutants of AIFL were constructed similarly. To make MBP fusion proteins, the cDNA sequences of AIFL-(1–82) and –(191–598) were PCR amplified and inserted into the BamHI and SalI sites of the pMAL6H vector. All plasmids were sequenced by the Indiana University School of Medicine or University of Southern California Comprehensive Cancer Center DNA sequencing facilities. All primers used in plasmid construction are listed in supplemental materials Table I. Generation and Purification of the Anti-AIFL Antibody—The fusion proteins MBP-AIFL-(1–82) and MBP-AIFL-(191–598) were induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 4 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Bacteria were suspended, sonicated on ice, and centrifuged. Both fusion proteins were soluble and purified by affinity chromatography using amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The purity of proteins was examined by Coomassie staining. Briefly, the SDS-PAGE gel was soaked in Coomassie solution (40% methanol, 7% acetic acid, 0.25% Coomassie Blue) and destained in the destaining solution (40% methanol, 7% acetic acid). The purified proteins MBP-AIFL-(1–82) and MBP-AIFL-(191–598) were injected into New Zealand White rabbits (Covance, Philadelphia, PA) and the resultant antisera were named anti-AIFL-(82) and anti-AIFL-(191–598), respectively. The antisera were further purified by affinity chromatography. Briefly, purified MBP, MBP-AIFL-(1–82) and MBP-AIFL-(191–598) were covalently coupled to CNBr Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The sera were first purified by protein A and G (Sigma) and then by the MBP-CNBr beads to absorb anti-MBP IgGs. MBP-AIFL-(1–82) and MBP-AIFL-(191–598) CNBr beads were then used to purify the remaining IgGs. Finally, purified antibodies were eluted with 0.2 m glycine (pH 2.8) and neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The concentration of anti-AIFL-(1–82), AIFL-(191–598), and preimmune sera was 1:1000 in Western blotting. Transfection—HEK 293 cells, DU145, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfection was performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 1 day before transfection, HEK 293 cells were subcultured in antibiotic-free medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 were mixed for 30 min before transfection. After transfection for 1 h in OPTI-MEM I medium (Invitrogen), fresh antibiotic-free medium with 10% fetal calf serum was added. Subcellular and Submitochondrial Fractionation—Plasma membrane (PM) proteins were extracted using the biotinylation approach (41Planes C. Blot-Chabaud M. Matthay M.A. Couette S. Uchida T. Clerici C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47318-47324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After washing the cells 5 times with buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose and Protease Inhibitors; Sigma), the cells were biotinylated using sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at room temperature for 30 min. Excessive biotin was quenched and washed off by buffer A plus 100 mm glycine. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet cell debris. 100 μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce) were added to the supernatant and rotated for 2 h at room temperature to pull down biotinylated protein. The biotinylated proteins were plasma membrane proteins. Other subcellular fractionations were carried out similarly as described in Nijhawan et al. (42Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and Zhu et al. (43Zhu H. Larade K. Jackson T.A. Xie J. Ladoux A. Acker H. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Fandrey J.

Cultured cells were collected and suspended in PBS. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A on ice for 20 min. Then the cells were passed through a 23-gauge needle 25 times. The resulting broken cells were centrifuged in three sequential steps: 1,000, 10,000, and then 100,000 × g. The 10,000 × g pellet was the mitochondrial fraction and the 100,000 × g supernatant was the cytosol. The 100,000 × g pellet was the microsomal membrane fraction, which includes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. The 100,000 × g supernatant was the cytosolic fraction. Nuclear proteins were extracted from the 1,000 × g pellet using the nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Antibodies for organelle markers were tubulin (1:2000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DHSB), Iowa City, IA), calreticulin (1:2000, Sigma), porin (1:2000, Molecular Probes), sodium potassium ATPase (1:1000, DHSB, Iowa City, IA), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (1:2000, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Submitochondrial fractions were extracted according to the methods of Milon et al. (44Milon L. Meyer P. Chiadmi M. Munier A. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Lascu I. Capeau J. Janin J. Lacombe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14264-14272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), Valgardsdottir et al. (45Valgardsdottir R. Ottersen O.P. Prydz H. Exp.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29400-29406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, an equal volume of fresh 1.2% digitonin solution was mixed with the above mitochondria fraction. The suspension was diluted 1:4 by buffer A and centrifuged at 9,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant contained outer membrane and intermembrane space fractions and was further centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant pellet was the outer membrane and the supernatant was the intermembrane space fraction. The pellet after 9,500 × g for 15 min, containing the mitoplasts, was washed once with buffer A. The mitoplast pellet was resuspended in fractionation buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. The sample was sonicated and centrifuged at 500 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 20 min at 165,000 × g. The resultant pellet was the inner membrane fraction and the supernatant was the matrix fraction. The antibodies for compartment markers are porin (1:2000, Molecular Probes), cytochrome c (1:2000, Calbiochem), cytochrome c oxidase IV subunit IV (COX IV) (1:2000, Molecular Probes), and heat shock protein 60 (1:2000, StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, BC, Canada). Western Blotting—After transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and sonicated briefly in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (47Sun X.C. Bonanno J.A. Jelamskii S. Xie Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1648-C1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of protein from transfected cells was loaded in each lane. The samples were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, incubated with primary antibodies (AIFL-(1–82) and AIFL-(191–598) or pre-immune serum, 1:1000) containing 5% dry milk for an additional hour, washed with PBST, and then incubated with a secondary antibody at 1/10,000 dilution in PBST containing 5% dry milk. The secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (Sigma) and the blots were detected with an enhanced West-Pico chemiluminescence kit (ECL) as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). The rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (48Zheng J. Rudra-Ganguly N. Miller G.J. Moffatt K.A. Cote R.J. Roy-Burman P. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2009-2018PubMed Google Scholar). The Histostain-Plus Kits and MaxArray™ Human Normal Tissue Microarray Slides (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used for the tissue array study. The tissue array contains 30 different human samples. Sections of 4 μm thick, paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The slides were then treated in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min and blocked with serum blocking solution for 10 min to reduce nonspecific background. The affinity-purified anti-AIFL-(191–598) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:50) was applied to the slides and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The slides were then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (kit supply) at room temperature for 10 min followed by streptavidin peroxidase conjugate for 10 min. Aminoethyl carbazole was added as a peroxidase substrate and incubated for 15 min. Cell nuclei were counterstained by hematoxylin to give a blue background contrast to red color of the positive reaction. The sections were cover-slipped and viewed under light microscope. Immunofluorescence Staining—Two days after transfection with pcDNA3-AIFL, HeLa cells on coverslips were washed with PBS three times and stained by Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 10 min. After fixation by 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, the coverslips were blocked by"
https://openalex.org/W2049558528,"Cataract is the most common cause of blindness but is at least curable by surgery. Unfortunately, many patients gradually develop the complication of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) or secondary cataract. This arises from stimulated cell growth within the lens capsule and can greatly impair vision. It is not fully understood why residual lens epithelial cell growth occurs after surgery. We propose and show that cataract surgery might remove an important inhibitory factor for lens cell growth, namely electric fields. The lens generates a unique pattern of electric currents constantly flowing out from the equator and entering the anterior and posterior poles. We show here that cutting and removing part of the anterior capsule as in cataract surgery significantly decreases the equatorial outward electric currents. Application of electric fields in culture inhibits proliferation of human lens epithelial cells. This inhibitory effect is likely to be mediated through a cell cycle control mechanism that decreases entry of cells into S phase from G1 phase by decreasing the G1-specific cell cycle protein cyclin E and increasing the cyclin-Cdk complex inhibitor p27kip1. Capsulorrhexis in vivo, which reduced endogenous lens electric fields, significantly increased LEC growth. This, together with our previous findings that electric fields have significant effects on the direction of lens cell migration, points to a controlling mechanism for the aberrant cell growth in posterior capsule opacification. A novel approach to control growth of lens epithelial cells using electric fields combined with other controlling mechanisms may be more effective in the prevention and treatment of this common complication of cataract surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2042129286,"Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) is a ribosome-inactivating protein isolated from the pokeweed plant (Phytolacca americana) that inhibits the proliferation of several plant and animal viruses. We have shown previously that PAP and nontoxic mutants of PAP can directly depurinate brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA in vitro, resulting in reduced viral protein translation. Here we expand on these initial studies and, using a barley protoplast system, demonstrate that recombinant PAP and nontoxic mutants isolated from E. coli are able to reduce the accumulation of BMV RNAs in vivo. Pretreatment of only BMV RNA3 with PAP prior to transfection of barley protoplasts reduced the accumulation of all BMV RNAs, with a more severe effect on subgenomic RNA4 levels. Using in vitro RNA synthesis assays, we show that a depurinated template causes the BMV replicase to stall at the template nucleotide adjacent to the missing base. These results provide new insight into the antiviral mechanism of PAP, namely that PAP depurination of BMV RNA impedes both RNA replication and subgenomic RNA transcription. These novel activities are distinct from the PAP-induced reduction of viral RNA translation and represent new targets for the inhibition of viral infection.

Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) 1The abbreviations used are: PAP, pokeweed antiviral protein; BMV, brome mosaic virus; PEG, polyethylene glycol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is a 29-kDa ribosome-inactivating protein of the pokeweed plant Phytolacca americana. Since its initial description as an antiviral agent against tobacco mosaic virus (1Duggar B.M. Armstrong J.K. Ann. Mo. Bot. Gard. 1925; 12: 359-366Crossref Google Scholar), PAP has been demonstrated to reduce the propagation of several plant and animal viruses, including potato virus X, HIV, and influenza (2Tumer N.E. Hwang D.J. Bonness M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Zarling J.M. Moran P.A. Haffar O. Sias J. Richman D.D. Spina C.A. Myers D.E.

Virol. 1974; 22: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It therefore holds promise as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. Years after its initial discovery, the enzymatic activity of PAP was characterized as an N-glycosylase (5Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Lambert J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Like all ribosome-inactivating proteins, PAP efficiently removes a conserved adenine from the sarcin/ricin loop within domain VI of the large ribosomal RNA (6Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8128-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Stirpe F. Bailey S. Miller S.P. Bodley J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 405-412Crossref Google Scholar). This depurination slows the elongation step of protein synthesis and is considered to be the reason for cytotoxicity of the protein (reviewed in Refs. 8Wang M. Hudak K.A. Genet. Eng. (N. Y.). 2003; 25: 143-161PubMed Google Scholar and 9Tumer N.E. Hudak K. Di R. Coetzer C. Wang P. Zoubenko O. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 240: 139-158PubMed Google Scholar). The accompanying decline in cellular protein translation may cause local cell death and limit virus propagation (10Ready M.P. Brown D.T. Robertus J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 84: 5053-5056Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This model is supported by observations showing a positive correlation between ribosome depurination and inhibition of virus infection (11Taylor S. Massiah A. Lomonossoff G. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Hartley M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The accompanying decline in cellular protein translation, as a result of depurination, is often cited as the cause of antiviral activity. For example, reduction of poliovirus infection of HeLa cells incubated with PAP was attributed to inhibition of translation in virus-infected cells (12Ussery M.A. Irvin J.D. Hardesty B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 284: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of tobacco mosaic virus multiplication in tobacco protoplasts correlated well with PAP-mediated inhibition of translation (13Watanabe K. Kawasaki T. Sako N. Funatsu G. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). More recent results have revealed that many ribosome-inactivating proteins are capable of depurinating RNA substrates apart from the rRNA (14Bolognesi A. Polito L. Lubelli C. Barbieri L. Parente A. Stirpe F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13709-13716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Nicolas E. Beggs J.M. Haltiwanger B.M. Taraschi T.F. J. Biol.

Rajamohan et al. (17Rajamohan F. Venkatachalam T.K. Irvin J.D. Uckun F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) showed that PAP removes both adenines and guanines from HIV-1 when incubated in vitro with the genomic viral RNA. In addition, Hudak et al. (18Hudak K.A. Wang P. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have shown that PAP and nontoxic PAP mutants depurinate brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNAs in vitro and that this depurination inhibits their translation in a cell-free system. Therefore, the direct depurination of viral RNAs by PAP may contribute to its antiviral activity. BMV is a model positive-strand RNA virus with a genome composed of three positive sense RNAs designated RNA1, RNA2, and RNA3. Each RNA is 5′-capped and contains a conserved 200-nucleotide tRNA-like structure at the 3′-end (reviewed in Refs. 19Ahlquist P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar and 20Kao C.C. Sivakumaran K. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2000; 1: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RNA1 is monocistronic and encodes a 1a protein containing an N-terminal domain with similarity to m7G methyltransferases involved in viral RNA capping and a C-terminal domain with similarity to RNA helicases (21Kong F. Sivakumaran K. Kao C.C. Virology. 1999; 259: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Ahola T. den Boon J.A. Ahlquist P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8803-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). RNA2 is also monocistronic and encodes a 2a protein that has all of the motifs expected of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (23Argos P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9909-9916Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). RNA3 is dicistronic and encodes a movement protein and a coat protein that is translated from a subgenomic RNA4 (24Miller W.A. Dreher T.W. Hall T.C. Nature. 1985; 313: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Allison R. Thompson C. Ahlquist P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1820-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26Schmitz I. Rao A.L.N. Virology. 1996; 226: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the RNAs therefore involves replication of negative and positive strand RNAs and transcription of subgenomic RNA. In this report, we expand on our initial in vitro studies to show evidence that PAP and nontoxic PAP mutants inhibit the replication and transcription of BMV RNAs in barley protoplasts. The inhibition caused by PAP is not due to ribosome depurination or decline of cellular translation. Rather, PAP and nontoxic mutants reduced the accumulation of BMV RNAs in protoplasts, by inhibiting both viral RNA replication and transcription. Furthermore, depurinated RNAs were shown to prevent efficient elongative RNA synthesis by the BMV replicase in vitro. Cloning and Expression of PAPs in E. coli—The mature form of wild-type PAP was amplified from pNT188, a yeast vector expressing the complete unprocessed form of PAP. The 5′ primer (CATGGATCCGTGAATACAATC) was designed to begin at Val23, and the 3′ primer (CCAAGCTTGTTAAGTTGTCTGACAGCTCCC) was designed to stop at Thr284, thereby amplifying the mature, processed form of the protein present in eukaryotes. The mutants of PAP, namely PAPx, PAPn, and PAPc, were amplified with the same primers, and all PCR products were cloned into the expression vector pET30a (Novagen) at NdeI and HindIII sites. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and transformed into BL21 cells. The overexpressed wild-type and mutant forms of PAP were purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Fractions containing PAP were pooled and concentrated by filtration centrifugation with a 10-kDa cut-off filter (Amicon). Purified proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. RNase Activity Assay—To determine whether ribonucleases co-purified with preparations of PAP and PAP mutants from E. coli, an endoribonuclease assay was adapted from Bhardwaj et al. (27Bhardwaj K. Guarino L. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12218-12224Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A chemically synthesized RNA template (Dharmacon, Inc.) of 10 nucleotides was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [α-32P]ATP. Approximately 100 ng of RNA substrate was incubated with 50 ng of PAP or PAP mutants in 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C for 30 min. RNA incubated without protein was used as a negative control, and the endoribonuclease of the SARS coronavirus, Nsp15 (50 ng), was used as a positive control (27Bhardwaj K. Guarino L. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12218-12224Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The positive control endoribonuclease was incubated in the same buffer as the PAPs except that 4 mm MgCl2 was replaced with 5 mm MnCl2. Following incubation, samples were separated by a 7.5 m urea, 18% acrylamide gel. The gel was wrapped in plastic and quantification of radiolabeled bands was performed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of Ribosomes and Primer Extension of rRNA—Ribosomes were isolated from barley leaves according to the method described by Tumer et al. (2Tumer N.E. Hwang D.J. Bonness M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3866-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). PAP and PAP mutants purified from E. coli (50 ng) were incubated with barley ribosomes (50 μg) in RIP buffer to a final volume of 100 μl for 30 min at 30 °C. rRNA was extracted, and depurination was assessed by primer extension as previously described (18Hudak K.A. Wang P. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using 500 ng of barley rRNA. A second primer, which anneals close to the 5′-end of the 28 S rRNA, was included in each sample for primer extension and served as an internal control for RNA loading (28Parikh B.A. Coetzer C. Tumer N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41428-41437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Treatment of BMV RNAs with PAP and PAP Mutants—BMV RNAs (1 μg) isolated from viral particles were incubated with purified wild-type PAP (5, 10, 50, or 100 ng) in RIP buffer (60 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2) to a final volume of 100 μl for 30 min at 30 °C. Following incubation, PAP was removed from the RNAs by phenol/chloroform extraction, and the treated RNAs were precipitated in ethanol. The RNAs were resuspended in diethyl-pyrocarbonate-treated water and used to transfect isolated protoplasts of barley. BMV RNAs (1 μg) were also treated with PAP mutants (50 ng) as described for incubation with wild-type PAP. An in vitro generated transcript of BMV RNA3 (1 μg) was incubated with wild-type PAP (50 ng) as described for total BMV RNAs. Generation of Protoplasts and Inoculation with BMV RNAs—Protoplasts were generated by enzyme digestion of 7-day-old leaves of barley, and inoculation of protoplasts with BMV RNAs was done using PEG 1500 essentially according to the method of Kroner et al. (29Kroner P. Richards D. Traynor P. Ahlquist P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5302-5309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PAP-treated BMV RNA samples (1 μg prepared as described above) were added to 4 × 105 protoplasts in 0.55 m mannitol and 8% PEG 1500. Protoplasts were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then washed in 0.55 m mannitol and resuspended in 1 ml of incubation medium (10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KNO3, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm KH2PO4, 1 μm KI, 0.1 μm CuSO4, 10% mannitol, 2% sucrose, 0.01% gentamycin sulfate). Protoplasts were incubated for 18 h at 27 °C and constant low light (165 μmol/m2/s). As a negative control, 0.5 μg of BMV RNAs were inoculated without the addition of PEG, and the positive control was 0.5 μg of BMV RNAs inoculated in the presence of PEG but without prior treatment with PAP. Incubation of Inoculated Protoplasts with PAP and PAP Mutants— Aliquots of 4 × 105 protoplasts were inoculated with 0.5 μg of BMV RNAs and incubated as described above in 1 ml of incubation medium for 30 min prior to the addition of PAP or mutant PAPs (1.0 μg). Protoplasts were incubated for an additional 18 h at 27 °C and constant low light (165 μmol/m2/s). To compare the effect of delayed PAP addition to protoplasts on the synthesis of positive versus negative strand BMV RNAs, aliquots of 4 × 105 protoplasts were transfected with 0.5 μg of BMV RNAs and incubated, as described, for 30 min or 3 h prior to the addition of 1.0 μg of PAP and subsequent incubation for a total of 18 h. To test whether PAP caused a decline in the stability of BMV RNAs in protoplasts, a pool of 2.4 × 106 protoplasts was transfected with 6.0 μg of in vitro transcript of BMV RNA1 and incubated in 6 ml of incubation medium for 30 min prior to the addition of 6.0 μg of PAP. Aliquots (1 ml) were removed at the indicated time points and analyzed for the presence of BMV RNA1 by Northern blot. Inoculated protoplasts without the addition of PAP were used as a negative control. Isolation of Protoplast RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Following incubation of protoplasts, total RNA was isolated from these cells. Protoplasts were pelleted at 300 × g for 3 min and resuspended in guanidinium buffer (4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm MES, pH 7.0, 20 mm EDTA), and phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Cells were vortexed and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The aqueous layer was re-extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and total RNA was precipitated by the addition of 0.2 volumes of 1 m acetic acid and 0.7 volumes of 100% ethanol. The precipitated RNA was pelleted by centrifugation and washed with 3 m NaOAc, washed again with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in diethyl-pyrocarbonate-treated water. Equal amounts of total RNA per sample were separated in a 4.5% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel, transferred to nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with radiolabeled negative strand partial transcripts of BMV or 25 S rRNA. The probe for positive-strand BMV RNA was transcribed from pB3HE1 containing an ∼200-nucleotide fragment of the tRNA-like structure from the 3′-end of BMV RNA3 that is conserved in sequence in all BMV positive strand RNAs. The probe for negative strand BMV RNA was transcribed from the same plasmid but in the reverse direction. The 28 S rRNA probe was transcribed from pKH002, containing an ∼80-nucleotide fragment of the conserved sarcin/ricin loop region of the yeast 25 S rRNA. Hybridization of probes to total RNA was visualized by exposure of the blot to x-ray film. In Vivo [35S]Methionine Incorporation—Protein synthesis in protoplasts was assayed by the incorporation of radiolabeled methionine into protein. Protoplasts (2 × 105 cells/ml) transfected with BMV RNAs recovered for 30 min in incubation medium and then were incubated in 1 ml of incubation medium containing 1.0 μg of PAP or PAP mutants for 1 h at 25 °C. Protoplasts were then pulsed with 10 μCi of [35S]Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 100-μl aliquots were removed at the times indicated. Protoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g, and 100 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added to each aliquot. The preparation was incubated at 70 °C for 20 min followed by 10 min on ice. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was filtered through 25-mm glass microfiber filters (Whatman GFC), washed with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and then ice-cold 95% ethanol. Filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. BMV Replicase Assays—RNA templates used in replicase assays were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Boulder, CO). BMV replicase was isolated from infected barley leaves as described by Sun et al. (30Sun J. Adkins S. Faurote G. Kao C.C. Virology. 1996; 226: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Replicase assays were performed essentially according to Adkins et al. (31Adkins S. Stawicki S. Faurote G. Siegel R. Kao C.C. RNA. 1998; 4: 455-470PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, template RNA (0.5 pmol) and 7 μl of replicase were combined in reaction buffer (20 mm sodium glutamate, pH 8.2, 12 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 500 μm GTP, 200 μm ATP, 200 μm UTP, 242 nm [α-32P]CTP (400 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 0.5% Triton X-100) in a 40-μl final volume. Following incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, the reaction products were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated in 6 volumes of 100% ethanol, 10 μg of glycogen, and a final concentration of 0.4 m ammonium acetate. Samples were resuspended in formamide loading buffer and separated on 12% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels. The amount of label incorporated into newly synthesized RNA was determined with a PhosphorImager and quantified using Amersham Biosciences software. To measure the rate of RNA synthesis over time, the same replicase reaction mixture was assembled as described above, and aliquots of 20 μl were removed at the indicated times. Reaction products were precipitated and analyzed as above. The percentages of synthesis were normalized for CMP incorporation relative to the control template analyzed in the same set of reactions. Synthesis of Mature PAP and PAP Mutants in E. coli—In pokeweed, PAP is first synthesized as a 313-amino acid-long precursor that is processed to produce the mature (262-amino acid) form of the protein, which has 22 and 29 amino acids cleaved from the N and C termini, respectively. Analysis of the in vitro activity of wild-type PAP has been facilitated by E. coli-expressed forms of the protein (32Rajamohan F. Engstrom C.R. Denton T.J. Engen L.A. Kourinov I. Uckun F.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Honjo E. Watanabe K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, mutant forms of mature PAP derived from E. coli have not yet been prepared or analyzed. Expression of enzymatically active PAP and its respective mutants in E. coli required the synthesis of their fully processed forms, which would accurately mimic their synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The wild-type constructs and mutants with amino acid substitutions were designed to begin at Val23 and end with Thr284 to produce mature proteins of 262 amino acids. To facilitate purification, these proteins also included an N-terminal His6 tag. Three mutant forms of PAP were expressed in addition to wild-type PAP. PAPx is an active site mutant with a point mutation E176V that inactivates the glycosylase activity of this protein (34Hur Y. Hwang D.J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PAPn and PAPc contain a point mutation G75D and a termination codon in place of Trp259, respectively, and are nontoxic to yeast growth (34Hur Y. Hwang D.J. Zoubenko O. Coetzer C. Uckun F.M. Tumer N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The purified proteins migrated according to their expected masses, with PAPc moving slightly faster due to the absence of 26 C-terminal residues. Importantly, the purified enzymes lacked detectable contaminating proteins (Fig. 1A) and, at the concentrations of PAP used in protoplast assays, had minimal ribonuclease activities (Fig. 1B). PAPx, which showed the highest level of contamination (7% degradation of template), did not affect the accumulation of BMV RNAs in protoplasts (Figs. 2 and 3). Although PAPn was not included in this analysis, it was expected to contain a similar level of contaminating nucleases, since all proteins were isolated in the same manner.Fig. 2Inhibition of BMV RNA accumulation in barley protoplasts by prior incubation with PAP and PAP mutants. A, BMV RNAs (1.0 μg) were incubated with PAP (5, 10, 50, or 100 ng), and following incubation, PAP was removed by phenol/chloroform extraction. The treated BMV RNAs were inoculated into protoplasts and allowed to replicate for 18 h. Total protoplast RNA was analyzed by Northern blot and probed for positive strand BMV RNAs. A protoplast sample without PEG (–PEG) and a sample without BMV RNAs (–BMV) were used as negative controls for inoculation. BMV RNAs incubated in buffer alone (0 PAP) prior to inoculation into protoplasts were used as a positive control for replication. Std, 300 ng of BMV RNAs loaded directly onto the gel. B, the same samples probed for 28 S rRNA as a loading control for total RNA. C, BMV RNAs (1.0 μg) were incubated with PAP, PAPx, PAPn, or PAPc (50 ng), and following incubation, PAPs were removed by phenol/chloroform extraction. The treated BMV RNAs were inoculated into protoplasts and allowed to replicate for 18 h. Total protoplast RNA was analyzed by Northern blot and probed for positive strand BMV RNAs. BMV RNAs incubated in buffer alone (–PAP) prior to inoculation into protoplasts were used as a positive control for replication. Std, 300 ng of BMV RNAs loaded directly onto the gel.

Total protoplast RNA was analyzed by Northern blot and probed for positive strand BMV RNAs. Protoplasts incubated without PAP (–PAP) were used as a positive control for BMV replication.

Protoplasts were incubated for a total of 18 h. Total protoplast RNA was analyzed by Northern blot and probed for positive and negative strand BMV RNAs. Protoplasts incubated without PAP (–PAP) were used as a positive control for BMV replication.

Hudak K.A. Tumer N.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 36Hudak K.A. Hammell A.B. Yasenchak J. Tumer N.E. Dinman J.D. Virology. 2001; 279: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether mature PAP and PAP mutants expressed in E. coli were able to depurinate ribosomes, the proteins were incubated with ribosomes isolated from barley leaves, and primer extension analysis was performed on the rRNA to detect the missing purine residue. Barley is a host for BMV, the focus of this study. As shown in Fig. 1C, only minimal levels of depurination of the sarcin/ricin loop were evident in barley ribosomes not treated with PAP. This background depurination may be due to the endogenous ribosome-inactivating protein present in barley (37Chaudhry B. Muller U.F. Cameron Mills V. Gough S. Simpson D. Skriver K. Mundy J. Plant J. 1994; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, incubation of ribosomes with PAP purified from pokeweed increased rRNA depurination 12-fold over background levels. Efficient levels of depurination were also observed for ribosomes incubated with mature PAP isolated from E. coli. In contrast, the nontoxic mutants PAPx, PAPn, and PAPc did not depurinate barley ribosomes above background levels. These data illustrate that the mature forms of PAP expressed in E. coli exhibit similar depurination properties as the corresponding proteins expressed in transgenic tobacco and yeast. Inhibition of BMV RNA Accumulation in Barley Protoplasts by Pretreatment with PAP—We have demonstrated previously that wild-type PAP depurinates BMV RNAs in vitro and inhibits the translation of these PAP-treated RNAs in a cell-free system (18Hudak K.A. Wang P. Tumer N.E. RNA. 2000; 6: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine whether PAP treatment could affect BMV RNAs in vivo, the RNAs were incubated with wild-type PAP, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation to remove PAP. Treated RNAs were then inoculated into barley protoplasts, and the amount of replication product that accumulated was monitored by Northern blot analysis (mutant BMV RNAs incapable of replication are not detected by this assay). Fig. 2A illustrates a decline in the level of BMV RNAs that correlated with treatment of increasing concentrations of PAP. These results indicate that prior incubation of BMV RNAs with PAP inhibits the accumulation of these RNAs in barley protoplasts. This analysis was repeated with 50 ng of nontoxic mutants of PAP, an amount that caused severe inhibition of accumulation with wild-type PAP (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2C shows that both PAPn and PAPc were able to efficiently inhibit accumulation of BMV, despite being inactive for rRNA depurination. The active site mutant PAPx did not inhibit BMV RNA accumulation, since the amount of viral RNA was indistinguishable from samples without PAP treatment. These results indicate that rRNA depurination and inhibition of BMV RNA accumulation both require PAP with a functional active site; however, each has different requirements as revealed by mutants PAPn and PAPc. Samples were also probed for 28 S rRNA as an indicator of total RNA loading (Fig. 2, B and D). Analysis of PAP Activity in Barley Protoplasts—To determine whether PAP could affect BMV RNA accumulation in vivo, without prior treatment of the viral RNAs, PAP or PAP mutants were added to the protoplast incubation medium 30 min after RNA transfection. PAP is known to be able to traverse protoplast membranes; thus, access of PAP to the cytosol was anticipated (13Watanabe K. Kawasaki T. Sako N. Funatsu G. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of total protoplast RNA after an 18-h incubation shows a decline in the amount of BMV RNAs for those treated with PAP, PAPn, or PAPc (Fig. 3A). The pattern of BMV RNA accumulation was similar to that seen when the RNAs were incubated with PAP or PAP mutants prior to the transfection of BMV RNAs. Thus, in vitro and in vivo treatments with PAP have comparable effects on BMV accumulation levels in barley protoplasts. Samples were also probed for 28 S rRNA as a loading control for total RNA (Fig. 3B). Next, we examined whether PAP could selectively affect the replication of positive strand BMV RNAs after the initiation of negative strand RNA replication. Three hours after transfection, BMV translation and negative strand RNA replication are known to be well under way, but positive strand RNA synthesis is not detectable (38Hema M. Kao C.C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2148316181,"Urocortin (Ucn) is an endogenous cardioprotective agent that protects against the damaging effects of ischemia and reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo. We have found that the mechanism of action of Ucn involves both acute activation of specific target molecules, and using Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) gene chip technology, altered gene expression of different end effector molecules. Here, from our gene chip data, we show that after a 24 h exposure to Ucn, there was a specific increase in mRNA and protein levels of the protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon) isozyme in primary rat cardiomyocytes compared with untreated cells and in the Langendorff perfused ex vivo heart. Furthermore, a short 10 min exposure of these cells to Ucn caused a specific translocation/activation of PKCepsilon in vitro and in the Langendorff perfused ex vivo heart. The importance of the PKCepsilon isozyme in cardioprotection and its relationship to cardioprotection produced by Ucn was assessed using PKCepsilon-specific inhibitor peptides. The inhibitor peptide, when introduced into cardiomyocytes, caused an increase in apoptotic cell death compared with control peptide after ischemia and reperfusion. When the inhibitor peptide was present with Ucn, the cardioprotective effect of Ucn was lost. This loss of cardioprotection by Ucn was also seen in whole hearts from PKCepsilon knockout mice. These findings indicate that the cardioprotective effect of Ucn is dependent upon PKCepsilon."

The mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown, although it has been proposed that heteromeric macromolecular complexes containing presenilins mediate γ-secretase cleavage of the amyloid β-precursor protein. Using a random mutagenesis screen of presenilin-1 (PS1) for PS1 endoproteolysis-impairing mutations, we identified five unique mutants, including R278I-PS1 and L435H-PS1, that exclusively generated a high level of Aβ43, but did not support physiological PS1 endoproteolysis or Aβ40 generation. These mutants did not measurably alter the molecular size or subcellular localization of PS1 complexes. Pharmacological studies indicated that the up-regulation of activity for Aβ43 generation by these mutations was not further enhanced by the difluoroketone inhibitor DFK167 and was refractory to inhibition by sulindac sulfide. These results suggest that PS1 mutations can lead to a wide spectrum of changes in the activity and specificity of γ-secretase and that the effects of PS1 mutations and γ-secretase inhibitors on the specificity are mediated through a common mechanism.

The consequential proteolytic release of the intracellular domains of these substrates has been revealed to be involved in signaling from the membrane to the nucleus (3Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B.

In the case of APP, γ-secretase mediates γ- and ϵ-cleavage to generate a heterogeneous series of N- and C-terminal products named the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD), respectively. Aβ peptides have C termini that end at residue 38, 40, 42, or 43, whereas AICD fragments begin at residues 48–52 of the Aβ domain (4Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

The process regulating these heterogeneous intramembranous cleavages is poorly understood, but is a central issue in Alzheimer disease research for three reasons. First, the longer Aβ species ending at residue 42 or 43 (Aβ42/43) are thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, although they are minor products of normal γ-secretase activity (6Selkoe D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Second, clinical mutations in the presenilins (PSs), which are responsible for the majority of familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) pedigrees, cause increased ratios of Aβ42/43 isoforms to total Aβ (7Wolfe M.S. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5413-5416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Third, medication that modulates Aβ42/43 production by altering γ-secretase activity could provide an effective therapy for Alzheimer disease. PS1 and PS2 are multipass TM proteins and undergo endoproteolysis within their large cytoplasmic loop domains by an unknown protease named presenilinase (8Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K.

Furthermore, it has been presumed that FAD-associated mutations of the PSs significantly alter γ-secretase activity and enhance production of Aβ42/43 through a gain-of-function effect.

Thus, the clinical mutations were ascertained by linkage to FAD, whereas the site-directed mutations in conserved residues were created to test specific hypotheses. We therefore undertook a screen of randomly mutagenized PS1 to identify single residue missense mutations that affect the physiological endoproteolysis of PS1 and/or selectively change Aβ isoform production. We report here the discovery and characterization of novel PS1 mutants that exclusively generate longer Aβ species, but do not support the activities for Aβ40 generation or PS1 endoproteolysis.

Generation and Screening of a Randomly Mutagenized PS1 cDNA Library—Random mutagenesis of PS1 cDNA was performed by errorprone PCR with the forward primer 5′-TTTTGAATTCTCCTTAGACAGCTTGGCCTGGAG-3′ (corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region of human PS1 cDNA and containing an EcoRI restriction site) and the reverse primer 5′-TTTTCTCGAGACCTTTGTCCTCCCCAGATTTGG-3′ (corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region and containing an XhoI site). PCR conditions were determined for low frequency mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). By sequencing 10 PCR products, we confirmed that the number of nucleotide substitutions per PS1 cDNA ranged from zero to seven. Mutagenized PS1 cDNA fragments obtained from four different PCRs were cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pCMV-script (Stratagene). Site-directed mutagenesis for subsequent confirmatory experiments was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate synthesized oligonucleotide primers. For screening for endoproteolysis-impaired mutants, PS-null MEFs were transfected with each mutagenized PS1 cDNA. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and homogenized in a Teflon/glass homogenizer. Crude membrane fractions were isolated from the post-nuclear supernatants by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min and then subjected to Western analysis with anti-PS1 antibody. Retrovirus-mediated Gene Expression—The retroviral infection of PS-null MEFs was carried out as described (21Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, PLATE-E packaging cells were transfected with a retroviral vector (pMXs) carrying the cDNA encoding PS1 or human APP using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Culture media collected 2 days after transfection were used for viral stocks. For infection, MEFs were incubated with viral stock containing 10 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) for 6 h. One day after infection, the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% streptomycin/penicillin, and the MEFs were cultured for another 48 h for the preparation of conditioned medium to be used in Aβ measurements. The infection efficiency was >95% in this study, estimated by a control experiment using pMXs-GFP, carrying cDNA for jellyfish green fluorescent protein. Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Cells or membrane fractions were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Western blotting was performed as described previously (10Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S.

Nature. 2000; 407: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% CHAPSO. After preclearing with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden), cell lysates were incubated with antibody for 2 h, followed by overnight incubation with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1% CHAPSO buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Glycerol Velocity Gradient Centrifugation—Glycerol velocity gradient centrifugation was carried out as described previously (22Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E.

HEK293 cells transfected with PS1 cDNA were disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica AG, Littau-Lucerne, Switzerland), and nuclei and large cell debris were sedimented by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min. The post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman ultracentrifuge to prepare crude membrane fractions. After solubilization in lysis buffer containing 1% CHAPSO, membrane fractions were applied to the top of 15–30% (w/v) linear glycerol gradients. The gradients were centrifuged at 36,000 × g for 18 h and split into 12 fractions from the bottom. The fractionated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Ferritin (440 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) were used as molecular mass markers. Evaluation of PS-dependent Cleavages of APP and Notch—For analysis of AICD generation, crude membrane fractions were obtained from HEK293 cells expressing various PS1 mutants and solubilized in lysis buffer containing 0.5% CHAPSO and 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma). The lysates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and analyzed by Western blotting. For assessment of Notch intracellular domain generation, HEK293 cells expressing the PS1 mutant were transiently transfected with NotchΔE tagged with Myc epitopes (23Schroeter E.H. Kisskinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). After starvation in Met-free medium, cells were metabolically labeled for 20 min with 500 μCi/ml [35S]Met (ICN Biomedicals) and then incubated for 1 h in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Secreted Aβ levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) specific for Aβ40 or Aβ42/43 as described (24Komano H. Shiraishi H. Kawamura Y. Sai X. Suzuki R. Serneels L.

Immunoprecipitation/Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry analysis of Aβ peptides was performed as described previously (4Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Secreted Aβ peptides in conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody 4G8 (Senetek, Napa, CA) using protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Aβ peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each mass spectrum was averaged from 1000 measurements and calibrated with bovine insulin as an internal calibrant. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubating cells with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. For double staining, fixed cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mixture of primary antibodies, followed by reaction for 2 h with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The slides were analyzed with an LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Subcellular Fractionation with Discontinuous Sucrose Gradients— Subcellular fractionation was performed according to a previously described method (22Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M. St George-Hyslop P.H. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16470-16475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transfected with PS1 cDNA were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. The post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and loaded on the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (1 ml/2.0 m, 3.4 ml/1.3 m, 3.4 ml/1.0 m, and 2.7 ml/0.6 m) made up in the same buffer. The gradient was centrifuged for 2 h at 280,000 × g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge, and 24 fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube with a peristaltic pump. Fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Identification of Novel Endoproteolysis-impaired PS1 Mutants by Random Mutagenesis Screening—We generated and screened a randomly mutagenized PS1 cDNA library to identify mutants that were defective in PS1 endoproteolysis. We isolated 370 clones that were then transiently transfected into PS-null MEFs. Upon Western analysis, 33 of the PS1 mutants displayed impaired PS1 endoproteolysis. DNA sequencing revealed that seven of these mutants had nonsense mutations. The remaining 26 mutants harbored missense mutations that were located throughout the molecule (data not shown). Six of these 26 mutants contained single amino acid substitutions: S141R, T245I, R278I, P433L, A434T, and L435H (Fig. 1, A and B). Ser141 and Thr245 are located within the second and sixth TM domains, respectively, and are not conserved in homologs of Caenorhabditis elegans. Arp278 is a conserved residue at the N terminus of the cytoplasmic loop between the sixth and seventh TM domains, and Pro433, Ala434, and Leu435 are located in the highly conserved PAL motif in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (17Tomita T. Watabiki T. Takikawa R. Morohashi Y. Takasugi N. Kopan R. De Strooper B. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33273-33281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mutant PS1 Proteins Form Stable High Molecular Mass Complexes—To assess the functional properties of these PS1 mutants, each was stably transfected into HEK293 cells that also expressed a construct equivalent to the C-terminal β-secretase-processed APP fragment C99, which is the immediate substrate for γ-secretase and yields Aβ. Because functional endoproteolytic derivatives of wild-type (WT) PS1 assemble into a stable high molecular mass complex (22Yu G. Chen F. Levesque G. Nishimura M. Zhang D.M. Levesque L. Rogaeva E. Xu D. Liang Y. Duthie M. St George-Hyslop P.H. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16470-16475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), we initially investigated 1) the incorporation of each mutant into macromolecular complexes, 2) the ability of each mutant to replace endogenous PS1, and 3) the metabolic half-life of each mutant protein. Glycerol velocity gradient analyses revealed that the uncleaved mutant holoproteins were assembled into high molecular mass complexes that were of similar size as the endogenous complexes (∼200–400 kDa), although the complexes containing the S141R and T245I mutants were also distributed broadly in the lower molecular mass ranges (Fig. 1C). The mutant holoproteins also displaced the proteolytic fragments of endogenous presenilins (Fig. 1C). Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that, similar to WT-PS1, all six PS1 mutants bound to the other γ-secretase components (nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2) (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1D, the half-lives of the mutant holoproteins in the presence of cycloheximide were comparable with those of WT proteolytic fragments (t1/2 > 24 h) and were much longer than the half-life of the WT holoprotein (t1/2 < 1 h). The S141R-PS1 and T245I-PS1 holoproteins were less well stabilized (t1/2 = ∼8 and ∼4 h, respectively). Taken together, all six mutations specifically prevented PS1 endoproteolysis, but did not significantly impede the assembly and stabilization of mutant PS1 complexes. Proteolytic Activities of PS1 Mutants—To investigate the ability of these mutants to support γ- and ϵ-cleavage of APP, we measured the production of AICD and Aβ from HEK293 cell lines expressing mutant PS1 and APP fragment C99. In comparison with cells expressing WT-PS1, the generation of AICD was clearly suppressed in all six mutant cell lines (Fig. 2A). Similarly, S3 cleavage of Notch, which corresponds to ϵ-cleavage of APP, was clearly attenuated (Fig. 2B). An ELISA specific for Aβ40 or Aβ42/43 revealed that the level of Aβ40 secreted from mutant PS1-expressing cells was either comparable with or lower than the level of Aβ40 secreted from WT-PS1 cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the level of secreted Aβ42/43 was significantly elevated in five of the six mutant cell lines. Finally, P433L-PS1 cells secreted less Aβ40 and Aβ42/43 than WT-PS1 cells. These mutants exhibited dominant phenotypes for the secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42/43 presumably through the replacement of endogenous PSs. To assess the γ-secretase activity of these mutants in the absence of endogenous PSs, we transfected each of these PS1 mutants together with human APP into PS-null MEFs using retroviral vectors and then measured Aβ levels in the conditioned media from these cells (Fig. 3A). Transfection of WT-PS1 successfully restored Aβ secretion, whereas compared with transfection with WT-PS1, transfection of FAD-causing mutants (I143F-PS1 and L392V-PS1) led to Aβ secretion with an increased ratio of Aβ42/43 to total Aβ. The P433L mutant did not restore Aβ secretion, supporting the idea that P433L is a loss-of-function mutation (17Tomita T. Watabiki T. Takikawa R. Morohashi Y. Takasugi N. Kopan R. De Strooper B. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33273-33281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Wang J. Brunkan A.L. Hecimovic S. Walker E. Goate A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 15: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, the five other mutants secreted significant amounts of Aβ42/43 while secreting only minimum or background levels of Aβ40. Because the R278I and L435H mutants generated particularly high levels of Aβ42/43, we focused on these mutants in the following experiments. To reveal the profile of Aβ species secreted by MEFs expressing R278I-PS1 or L435H-PS1, we performed immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry as described previously (4Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The spectrum of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry indicated that the Aβ species secreted by these MEFs always ended at Thr43 (i.e. Aβ-(11–43) and Aβ-(1–43)) (Fig. 3B). These mutants are quite unique in exclusively generating Aβ43 and are therefore designated PS1LA for PS1 yielding longer Aβ peptides. The R278I and L435H mutations are located in the NTF and CTF of PS1, respectively (Fig. 1B). To determine whether these mutations might have cooperative or additive effects, we generated a PS1 cDNA harboring both mutations in cis. When expressed in PS-null MEFs, this double mutant formed a holoprotein that was incorporated into stable high molecular mass complexes, but rescued neither Aβ40 nor Aβ42/43 secretion (data not shown). This suggests that the double PS1LA mutation causes a loss of γ-secretase activity and that PS1LA is an incomplete loss-of-function mutation. PS1 endoproteolysis is thought to occur during PS1 complex maturation and prior to the activation of γ-secretase (13Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the inefficient endoproteolysis of the mutant holoproteins had affected the cleavage specificity of γ-secretase, we simulated endoproteolysis of the mutant proteins by co-infecting PS-null MEFs with two cDNAs: one encoding the PS1 NTF (residues 1–291) and the other encoding the PS1 CTF (residues 292–467). In both cases, the R278I and L435H mutations were contained in the appropriate hemiconstructs. The amounts of total Aβ (data not shown) and the ratios of Aβ42/43 to total Aβ produced in these experiments were comparable with those produced in PS-null MEFs infected with the corresponding full-length cDNA (Fig. 3C). In addition, coexpression of the PS1 NTF and CTF harboring R278I and L435H mutations, respectively, did not restore Aβ secretion (data not shown). These results confirm that γ-secretase activity was modified by the specific amino acid substitution rather than due to the lack of endoproteolysis of the mutant holoprotein. The R278I Mutation Does Not Alter the Subcellular Localization of the PS1 Protein—Previous studies have suggested that Aβ40 and Aβ42/43 arise from γ-secretase cleavage at distinct subcellular locations (26Hartmann T. Bieger S.C. Bruhl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 27Cook D.G.

However, three observations argue that simple mistrafficking of the PS1LA mutants is not the reason for Aβ42/43 production. First, there were no significant differences in the subcellular distribution of the WT-PS1 CTF and the R278I-PS1 holoprotein in immunocytochemical experiments or upon subcellular fractionation with sucrose gradients (Fig. 4, A and B). Both PS1 species appeared to be similarly transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Second, the pattern of nicastrin glycosylation in R278I-PS1-expressing cells was indistinguishabl"

In contrast to the dimeric standard Ni-Fe hydrogenases, the RH forms a double dimer [HoxBC]2 (Fig. 1A) that is connected to a tetramer of the HoxJ protein (14Buhrke T. Lenz O. Porthun A. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The N-terminal input module of HoxJ containing a PAS domain is required for the formation of the RH-HoxJ complex, whereas the C-terminal domain of HoxJ has histidine protein kinase activity (14Buhrke T.

In contrast to standard hydrogenases, which can exist in up to nine different redox states (1Cammack R. Robson R. Frey M. Hydrogen as a Fuel: Learning from Nature.

Although information has become available about the sequence of events that occur at the Ni-Fe active site upon interaction of the RH with H2 (10Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Bleijlevens B. De Lacey A.L.

Information on these points is expected to contribute to the understanding of the H2-sensing mechanism of the RH-HoxJ complex (14Buhrke T. Lenz O. Porthun A. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In standard Ni-Fe hydrogenases of the D. gigas type, the small subunit contains three Fe-S clusters, two [4Fe-4S] and one [3Fe-4S] (16Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 556-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar), which are bound via conserved cysteines and one histidine residue found in all Ni-Fe hydrogenase sequences. During hydrogen turnover these clusters become reduced as detected by EPR spectroscopy (1Cammack R. Robson R. Frey M. Hydrogen as a Fuel: Learning from Nature. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1997Google Scholar, 17Armstrong F.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The RH small subunit HoxB also contains these conserved cysteines. Therefore, it was postulated that it might also harbor three Fe-S clusters (6Kleihues L. Lenz O. Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). EPR investigation of the RH, however, did not show reduced Fe-S clusters when the Ni-C EPR signal was formed under H2 (3Pierik A.J. Schmelz M. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Bleijlevens B. De Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Albracht S.P. Friedrich B. J. Biol.

Soc. 2003; 125: 13075-13083Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a non-Fe-S cofactor may be involved in electron transfer instead (10Bernhard M. Buhrke T.

In this work the double dimeric wild-type RH (RHWT, Fig. 1A) and a derivative denoted as RHstop (Fig. 1B), which forms a monodimer due to mutational truncation of the C terminus of HoxB (14Buhrke T. Lenz O. Porthun A. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), were compared. It has been suggested that the RHstop may lack the putative non-Fe-S cofactor (14Buhrke T. Lenz O. Porthun A. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In both preparations, for the first time reduction of Fe-S clusters in the presence of H2 was clearly detected in UV-visible spectra and by XAS at the iron K-edge. Support for reduction of a non-Fe-S cofactor was not obtained. Seemingly, the Fe-S clusters of the RH differ from those of standard hydrogenases. Bacteria Growth and Enzyme Purification—Strains with the initials HF were derived from R. eutropha H16 (DSM428, ATCC 17699). Large scale cultivation of R. eutropha strains, cell harvesting, cell disruption, and preparation of soluble protein extracts were published before (10Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Bleijlevens B.

Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1677-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RHWT (Fig. 1A) was purified from the RH-overproducing strain R. eutropha HF371(pGE378) as described in Bernhard et al. (10Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Bleijlevens B. De Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Albracht S.P. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15592-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Starting with 50 g of cells (wet weight) yielded 3.7 mg of RH with a specific activity of 1.6 units/mg of protein. The RHstop protein (Fig. 1B) was purified from R. eutropha HF574(pGE567) as a Strep-tag II fusion protein. 2T. Buhrke, O. Lenz, and B. Friedrich, manuscript in preparation. Starting with 18 g of cells yielded 1.5 mg of RHstop with a specific activity of 1.6 units/mg of protein. The homogeneity of the respective protein preparations was investigated by SDS-PAGE analysis and subsequent Coomassie staining. The amount of impurities was quantified by using the Gelscan Professional V5.1 software (BioSciTec, Frankfurt, Germany). After background subtraction, the sum of the percent differential integrated density of the HoxC- and HoxB-specific bands was correlated to the sum of the percent differential integrated density from the contaminating proteins. Assays of Hydrogenase Activity—H2-oxidizing activity was quantified by an amperometric H2 uptake assay as in Pierik et al. (3Pierik A.J. Schmelz M. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using a H2 electrode with methylene blue as an electron acceptor. One unit of H2 methylene blue oxidoreductase activity was the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the consumption of 1 μmol of H2/min. Protein concentrations were determined according to the protocol of Bradford (18Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). Analysis of Metal Contents—Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and total reflection x-ray fluorescence analysis (TRXFA) (19Klockenkämper R. Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Analysis. John Wiley & Sons, London, UK1996Google Scholar) were used for quantification of nickel and iron. For AAS, three aliquots of each RH preparation were solubilized overnight in concentrated HNO3 (65%, Suprapur, Merck), then diluted with ultrapure water (Millipore) to 1–5% HNO3 and further diluted for measurements using the transversely heated graphite furnace technique with longitudinal Zeeman-effect background correction on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Aanalyst 800 spectrometer equipped with an autosampler and WinLab32 software in the laboratory of Dr. Klaus Irrgang (TU-Berlin). TRXFA for simultaneous nickel and iron quantification was performed on a Picotax spectrometer at Röntec (Berlin, Germany) using 1 μl of concentrated and dried protein solutions. Nickel and iron contents were determined against commercial nickel and iron standards (Fluka) in AAS and relative to a gallium standard in TRXFA. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)—FTIR measurements were carried out with a Bruker IFS66V/S spectrometer equipped with a photovoltaic MCT detector using a resolution of 2 cm-1. The sample compartment was purged with nitrogen. Samples were held in a temperature-controlled (23 °C) gas-tight liquid cell (volume ∼7 μl) with CaF2 windows. FTIR spectra were baseline-corrected using the software available with the spectrometer. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR measurements were performed in the laboratory of Prof. Robert Bittl (FU-Berlin) on an X-band Bruker Elexsys E580 spectrometer equipped with a SHQE resonator and a helium cryostat (Oxford) (microwave frequency of 9.6 GHz). For additional conditions see the figure legends. From each enzyme spectrum in Fig. 2 the background from sample holder and cavity was subtracted. EPR signals in enzyme samples were quantified by comparison with the integrated intensities of signals from CuSO4 solutions used as spin standards (20Albracht S.P.J. van der Linden E. Faber B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1557: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). UV-Visible Spectroscopy—Purified samples of wild-type RH and RHstop were diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to a protein concentration of 0.64 mg/ml. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Cary 1E spectrophotometer (Varian) with a spectral resolution of 0.3 nm. To reduce the RH samples, protein solutions were flushed with hydrogen gas for 1 min. Subsequently, the sample was centrifuged (1 min, 12,000 × g) to remove small amounts of precipitated protein. The clear supernatant was immediately re-transferred to the cuvette, and the UV-visible spectrum of the reduced sample was recorded. XAS—X-ray absorption spectra at the iron K-edge were collected at beamline D2 of the EMBL at HASYLAB (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). XAS samples contained 10–20 μl of RH solution (protein concentration 0.4–1 mm). Fluorescence-detected XAS spectra were measured with a 13-element solid-state germanium detector (Canberra) at 20 K as described elsewhere (11Haumann M. Porthun A. Buhrke T. Liebisch P. Meyer-Klaucke W. Friedrich B. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11004-11015Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An absolute energy calibration (accuracy, ±0.1 eV) was performed by monitoring the Bragg reflections of a crystal positioned at the end of the beamline (21Pettifer R.F. Hermes C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1985; 18: 404-412Crossref Google Scholar). 3 scans of ∼60-min duration were taken on the same spot (4.5 × 1 mm) of the sample. Comparison of the first and third scan revealed that radiation damage to the samples was absent because the iron K-edge energy remained unchanged. Six scans, obtained on two separate spots of the samples, were averaged for each EXAFS spectrum. Spectra were normalized, and EXAFS oscillations were extracted as in Dau et al. (22Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The energy scale of iron EXAFS spectra was converted to a k-scale using an E0 of 7112 eV; E0 refined to 7120 eV during the EXAFS simulations. Unfiltered k3-weighted spectra were used for least-squares curve-fitting (22Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and for calculation of Fourier transforms representing k-values ranging from 1.85 to 13 Å-1. The data were multiplied by a fractional cosine window (10% at low and high k-side). For EXAFS simulation, complex backscattering amplitudes were calculated using FEFF 7 (23Zabinsky S.I. Rehr J.J. Aukudinov A. Albers R.C. Eller M.J. Phys. Rev. B. Condens. Matter. 1995; 52: 2995-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar); the amplitude reduction factor S02 was 0.9. For XAS sample preparation, RH solutions were degassed 3 times under vacuum and subsequently flushed for 10 min with H2 gas. H2-reduced samples were filled under argon or H2 atmosphere into Kapton-covered acrylic glass sample holders using syringes previously filled with Ar or H2. The same samples were used for EPR (before and after XAS) and XAS measurements. Comparison of the Ni-Fe Active Site in RHWT and RHstop—To test whether truncation of the C-terminal 55 amino acids of HoxB affected the Ni-Fe site, preparations of RHWT and RHstop were examined by FTIR and EPR measurements. The FTIR spectrum of oxidized RHstop was identical to that of RHWT (Fig. 2A) in showing an intense peak at 1942 cm-1 originating from the Fe-CO and two peaks at 2072 cm-1 and 2081 cm-1 from the two Fe-CN stretching vibrations as previously reported (3Pierik A.J. Schmelz M. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Bleijlevens B. De Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Albracht S.P. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15592-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Upon reduction of the samples by H2, the ν(CO) vibration in both spectra shifted to higher frequencies by 18.5 cm-1 (not shown), whereas the ν(CN) vibrations remained unaffected as previously observed for RHWT (10Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Bleijlevens B. De Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Albracht S.P. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15592-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The redox properties of the Ni-Fe active site of RHstop also turned out to be similar to those of RHWT as detected by EPR (Fig. 2B). Flushing of the RH with H2 generates the Ni-C state (Ni(III)-H-) of the Ni-Fe active site with the hydride in a bridging position between nickel and iron (15Brecht M. Van Gastel M. Buhrke T. Friedrich B. Lubitz W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13075-13083Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The Ni-C EPR signals (Fig. 2B) were similar in RHWT and RHstop. Signal quantification revealed that greater than 90% of the nickel was converted to Ni(III) in both preparations after incubation with H2 for 10 min, implying similarly effective heterolytic hydrogen cleavage. However, EPR signals from singly reduced Fe-S clusters were completely absent in the Ni-C state. Reduced Fe-S clusters were also not detected when temperatures between 6 and 50 K and microwave power variations between 0.01 and 10 milliwatt were applied (data not shown). In summary, RHWT and RHstop appeared to be similar with respect to the coordination of the iron of the Ni-Fe site both in the oxidized state and in the Ni-C state, which was nearly quantitatively formed in both cases in the presence of hydrogen. Moreover, both preparations showed identical hydrogenase activities (see “Materials and Methods”). The catalytic properties of RHstop were, thus, not affected by the truncation of the C terminus of HoxB. Determination of Metal Contents—Analysis of the nickel contents by AAS in combination with protein determination yielded on the average about 0.6 mol of nickel in the RHWT and close to 1 mol of nickel in the RHstop (Table I). The relatively low nickel content in RHWT can be explained with impurities in the preparations. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that preparations of RHWT contained sizable amounts of copurified proteins, whereas preparations of RHstop were homogenous (Fig. 3). The amount of impurities in the RHWT sample was quantified by calculating the intensities of HoxC- and HoxB-specific protein bands and the sum of the band intensities derived from the contaminating proteins. According to this analysis the RHWT sample contained about 16% of impurities, whereas the RHstop sample was pure. Therefore, assuming that each HoxBC unit of RHWT also contained one nickel similar to RHstop, it was estimated from the Fe/Ni ratios (Table I), determined by two independent techniques (AAS and TRXFA), that each HoxBC unit of RHWT contained about 8–9 iron atoms, in accordance with previous estimates (10Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Bleijlevens B. De Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Albracht S.P. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15592-15597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The iron content of RHstop was about 4–6 and, thus, distinctly lower than that of RHWT.Table IMetal contents of RH preparations Ni,Fe/(HoxBC) values represent the average over values from AAS and protein determinations from five independent preparations of both RHWT and RHstop. Mean iron/nickel ratios were derived from the AAS values and from concentrations determined by TRXFA on two preparations of both RHWT and RHstop. The respective error ranges represent S.D.Nickel/[HoxBC]Iron/[HoxBC]Iron/Nickel (AAS, TRXFA)RHWT0.56 ± 0.094.53 ± 0.958.09 ± 1.04, 8.83 ± 1.16RHstop1.03 ± 0.214.83 ± 2.174.69 ± 2.38, 6.12 ± 0.24 Open table in a new tab Based on sequence homologies (see “Discussion”) one would expect HoxB to contain three [4Fe-4S] clusters (6Kleihues L. Lenz O. Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Taking also the iron atom of the Ni-Fe site into account, one HoxBC monodimer might contain 13 Fe/Ni. Thus, the experimentally determined iron content of RHWT was significantly lower than expected. Furthermore, HoxBWT seemed to contain more iron than HoxBstop. The double dimeric RHWT may, thus, comprise iron species that are absent in monodimeric RHstop. Detection of Fe-S Cluster Reduction by UV-Visible Spectroscopy—The optical absorption spectra of the oxidized RHWT and RHstop showed, in addition to a peak at 280 nm due to the absorption of the aromatic amino acid residues of the protein, a broad shoulder around 410 nm, presumably due to the presence of Fe-S clusters (Fig. 4, solid lines). That both preparations were fully oxidized was apparent from the absence of any Ni-C EPR signal (data not shown). The extinction coefficients were calculated at 390 and at 420 nm and compared with data from the literature (Table II). The ϵ(420 nm) value determined for RHstop is in good agreement with the value that would be expected in the presence of two cysteinyl-coordinated [2Fe-2S] clusters (49Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994Google Scholar). The ϵ(420 nm) of RHWT, on the other hand, is significantly higher, confirming the data from the metal analysis which indicate that RHWT contain additional iron species (see “Determination of Metal Contents”). The ϵ(390 nm) values estimated for RHWT as well as for RHstop were significantly larger than the value of ϵ(390 nm) that was expected if only one [4Fe-4S] cluster was present (Table II).Table IIExtinction coefficients of preparations of RHWT and RHstop at 390 and at 420 nm as obtained from the UV-visible spectra (Fig. 4)ϵ(390 nm)ϵ(420 nm)m-1cm-1m-1cm-1RHWToxaThe values for RHWT were corrected by a factor of 1.188 due to the fact that preparations of RHWT contained 16% impurities31,50028,300RHstopox23,90021,800[4Fe-4S]15,200bThese values were taken from Lippard et al.

University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab When the RH was reduced by flushing of samples with H2, increased absorption was observed in the whole spectral range (not shown); the curvature of the background (proportional to λ-4) suggested its origin from a scattering contribution. Because this background could be removed by centrifugation of H2-flushed samples, apparently a small portion of the RH protein precipitated, thereby light-scattering aggregates were formed. Aggregation was also observed after flushing with argon, which indicated that it was not specifically caused by H2. Reduction of RHWT by flushing with H2 and subsequent removal of aggregates by centrifugation yielded a spectrum with clearly decreased absorption between 350 and 600 nm compared with the oxidized state (Fig. 4A, dotted line); the absorption at ∼280 nm was almost unchanged. Reduction of RHstop with H2 yielded similar results (Fig. 4B, dotted line). The difference spectra (reduced – oxidized RH, insets in Fig. 4, A and B) showed two main minima (bleachings) around 410 and 550 nm, respectively. Whereas bleaching solely around 410 nm has been observed upon reduction o"

Once activated by the invasion of a pathogen, such as viruses and bacteria, IRFs regulate the expression of various genes encoding immunomodulatory cytokines and chemokines and limit the spread of infection. Among these factors, interferons (IFNs) play important roles in host defense, cell growth regulation, and immune activation (1Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol.

IRF-3 consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that specifically binds to an ISRE motif, and a C-terminal IRF association domain (IAD) that mediates protein-protein interactions. IRF-3 uses the IAD for both intramolecular autoinhibition interactions and intermolecular dimerizations (6Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 12Vilcek J. Sen. G. Virology. 1996; : 375-399Google Scholar). Furthermore, IRF-3 possesses a transactivation domain (amino acids 134-394) and two autoinhibition domains found within the proline-rich sequence (amino acids 134-197) and at the C-terminal end (amino acids 407-414). The two autoinhibition domains are thought to interact with each other to generate a closed conformation that masks the C-terminal IAD, the DNA-binding domain, and the nuclear localization signal of IRF-3, which prevents homodimerization and DNA binding in uninfected cells. The C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF-3 might open the conformation, leading to dimer formation and exposure of the nuclear localization signal and the DNA-binding domain (6Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Takahasi K. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Mori M. Suhara W. Okabe Y. Fukuhara Y. Terasawa H. Akira S. Fujita T.

Biol. 2003; 10: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, the molecular events associated with such a drastic conformational change remain unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate the interaction of IRF-3 with cyclophilin B (CypB), an immunophilin with cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase and chaperone-like activities (15Price E.R. Jin M. Lim D. Pati S. Walsh C.T. McKeon F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The knockdown of CypB by RNA interference prevented the NDV-induced IRF-3 phosphorylation, dimerization, association with CBP, binding to the ISRE, and induction of IFN-β. Bacterial Two-hybrid Screening—A BacterioMatch™ two-hybrid SystemXR Plasmid cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to screen IRF-3 interacting proteins according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the construction of the bait plasmid, the GST fusion expression plasmid pGEX-IRF-3 was digested at the NcoI site, which overlapped with the initiation codon of IRF-3, filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and then digested by XhoI. The plasmid pBT was digested by BamHI, filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and then digested by XhoI. The NcoI/Klenow-XhoI fragment containing the IRF-3 coding region was ligated with the pBT fragment. The junction of the cloning site of the resultant plasmid pBT-IRF-3 was verified by sequencing. Competent cells of the BacterioMatch two-hybrid system Escherichia coli reporter strain were transformed with pBT-IRF-3, together with the pTRG-cDNA library (Human HeLa cell plasmid cDNA library, number 982208, Stratagene). As every transformation produced 4.0-5.0 × 105 clones, we finally screened 4.30 × 106 colonies after 10 transformations. The cDNA-containing plasmids were recovered from the antibiotic-resistant and lacZ-positive clones, and the sequences of the cDNA inserts were verified, using the pTRG forward primer (5′-CAGCCTGAAGTGAAAGAA-3′) and the pTRG reverse primer (5′-ATTCGTCGCCCGCCATAA-3′), by a PRISM 310 or 3100 autosequencer. For the construction of the N-terminal Myc-tag fusion protein expression vector, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the Myc-tag sequence, followed by HindIII, NcoI, BamHI, NotI, and EcoRI sites as multicloning sites, was ligated into pcDNA3 digested with HindIII and EcoRI to yield the plasmid pcDNA/Myc. The cDNAs of the candidate positive clones were amplified by PCR with the pTRG forward and reverse primers, digested with BamHI, NotI, or EcoRI for the 5′-junction and XhoI for the 3′-junction, and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3/Myc. GST Pull-down Assay—The Myc-tagged protein encoded by the cloned cDNA was synthesized by the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega) with unlabeled methionine. To construct the plasmids pGEX-hIRF-3ΔN1-3, pGEX-hIRF-3 was digested with ScaI, MscI, or BglII, blunt-ended with the Klenow enzyme, and then digested with SacII. The 938-bp ScaI-SacII fragment, the 608-bp MscI-SacII fragment, and the 350-bp BglII-SacII fragment were excised and subcloned into the blunt-ended NcoI site and the SacII site of the pGEX-hIRF-3 plasmid, respectively. To construct pGEX-hIRF-3ΔC1, the 5925-bp BglII-NotI fragment of pGEX-hIRF-3 was blunt-ended with the Klenow enzyme, and then self-ligated. To construct pGEX-hIRF-3ΔC2 and -ΔC3, the 724-bp NcoI-MscI fragment and the 394-bp NcoI-ScaI fragment were excised from pGEX-hIRF-3 and then subcloned into the blunt-ended NotI site and the NcoI site of the pGEX-hIRF-3 plasmid, respectively. To create a PPIase-defective mutant of CypB, both the arginine at the 96th position and the phenylalanine at the 101st position of CypB were substituted by alanine, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To construct the Myc-cyclophilin A (CypA) expression plasmid, the CypA cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using Pfu Ultra™ DNA polymerase and the gene-specific primers (forward 5′-CGGAATTCGGCACGAGGCCATGGTCAACCCCACCGTGTTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCGCTCGAGTCAAACTTATTCGAGTTGTCCACAG-3′) with an amplification cycle of 95 °C/30 s, 62 °C/30 s and 72 °C/60 s for 25 cycles. The amplified cDNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3-Myc-CypB. E. coli strain TG1 was transformed with each plasmid construct, and was grown in LB medium to an A600 > 0.4. After 3 h of culture in the presence of 2 mm IPTG, for the induction of fusion protein synthesis, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in one-twelfth volume of PBS(-) containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated. The amount of protein used was adjusted on the basis of an SDS-PAGE analysis. The cleared lysates were mixed with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and subsequently were washed 3 times with DBT-0.1 (dilution buffer with Triton X) (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl). The affinity beads were incubated with 150 μl of precleared in vitro translated protein for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads 3 times with DBT-0.4 (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 400 mm KCl), the proteins retained on the beads were extracted in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were separated on 4-20% SDS gradient gels (Daiichi Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). Proteins were detected by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoprecipitation—To detect the association of endogenous IRF-3 and CypB, we performed the immunoprecipitation experiment using the human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080. The aliquot of cells was pelleted by centrifugation and infected with NDV for 10 min at 37 °C, and then a whole cell extract was prepared. An aliquot of each extract was incubated with 5 μg of goat IgG or goat polyclonal anti-IRF-3 antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. After this incubation, the protein G beads were added to the mixture and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The following procedures were the same as those used for the GST pull-down described above. Proteins were detected by Western blotting with a goat polyclonal anti-IRF-3 antibody (C-20) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclophilin B antibody (Affinity BioReagents. Inc.). RNA Interference—Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. The sense and antisense strands of the siRNAs for CypB (5′-GGUGGAGAGCACCAAGACATT-3′, 5′-UGUCUUGGUGCUCUCCACCTT-3′) and for the control (5′-ACAGAACCACGAGAGGUGGTT-3′, 5′-CCACCUCUCGUGGUUCUGUTT-3′) were annealed according to the provider's instructions, respectively (JBioS, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). In brief, 1.0 × 105 cells/well were seeded in a 6-well tissue culture plate. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced by culture medium without antibiotics. To allow the siRNA-liposome complexes to form, 5 μl of siRNAs (20 μm) and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent were combined in 500 μl of Opti-MEM medium and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. This mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. The cells were then washed twice with dilution medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine serum albumin) and infected with NDV by the addition of 100 μl of allantoic fluid from NDV-infected chicken eggs (1000 hemagglutinin units/ml) for 1.5 h. After washing twice with complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin), the cells were further incubated in complete medium for 10.5 h before harvesting for extract preparation. Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts—The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline(-) and then scraped and suspended in 400 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed by vortexing briefly, and the lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min. The whole cell extracts were recovered after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Western Blotting—The procedures were the same as those used in the GST pull-down experiment described above. The antibodies used were the goat polyclonal anti-IRF-3 antibody (C-20), the mouse monoclonal anti-IRF-3 Ser(P)-396 antibody (HIS5133, a gift provided by Drs. J. Hiscott and M. Servant, McGill University), the rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclophilin B antibody, and the mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Chemicon). Native PAGE Assay—The native PAGE assay was performed by using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (Daiichi Chemicals). The gel was prerun in a running buffer containing 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine, with and without 1% deoxycholate in the cathode and anode chambers, respectively, for 30 min at 40 mA. Aliquots of whole cell extracts were diluted in native sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 15% glycerol, and 1% deoxycholate), applied to the gel, and electrophoresed for 60 min at 25 mA. Immunoblotting was performed as described above. Proteins were detected by Western blotting with a goat polyclonal anti-IRF-3 antibody (C-20) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-IRF-3 Ser(P)386 antibody (IBL). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To examine the binding of IRF-3 to the IFN-β promotor, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using whole cell extracts from siRNA-transfected and NDV-infected or -uninfected HT1080 cells. The extracts were incubated in a reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)). After a 30-min incubation on ice, ∼10,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the ISRE sequence of the ISG15 gene (5′-GGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAA-3′) were added to the reactions, which were then incubated for an additional 30 min at 25 °C. The reactions were further incubated with an anti-IRF-3 antibody (C-20) or an anti-CBP antibody (A-22X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 25 °C. The binding reactions were mixed with 1 μl of loading buffer (0.1% bromphenol blue in the same buffer used for the binding reactions) and then were electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5 × TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) at 200 V for 2 h. The gel was dried and analyzed by an image analyzer, BAS5000 (Fuji, Tokyo). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—HT1080 cells were mock- or NDV-infected for 12 h and then treated with formaldehyde to cross-link the proteins bound to DNA. The cross-linked proteins were purified and immunoprecipitated with the anti-IRF-3 antibody (C-20). After reversal of the cross-linking, the DNA was amplified using primers for the ISG15 promoter (5′-TTTTCCCTGTCTTTCGGTCATTCG-3′, 5′-TATTATAAGCCTGAGGCACACACG-3′) with an amplification cycle of 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/2 min for 30 cycles. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for IFN-β—The amounts of human IFN-β in the culture medium supernatants before and after NDV infection were quantified with a human interferon-β enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Differences among groups were examined for statistical significance using one-factor analysis of variance (Bonferroni/Dunn). A p value < 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. Isolation of Putative IRF-3-binding Proteins by the Bacterial Two-hybrid Screening—To isolate the protein(s) that associate with IRF-3, we performed a screening by a bacterial two-hybrid system (16Dove S. Joung J. Hochschild A. Nature. 1997; 386: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Hu J.C. Kornacker M.G. Hochschild A. Methods. 2000; 20: 80-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The bait was fused to the full-length bacteriophage λ repressor protein (λcI), whereas the corresponding target protein was fused to the N-terminal domain of the α-subunit of RNA polymerase. When the bait and target interact, they recruit and stabilize the binding of RNA polymerase at the promoter and activate the transcription of reporter genes, the carbenicillin-resistance and the β-galactosidase genes. In addition, this system offers the ability to detect an interaction between a pair of protein domains with an equilibrium dissociation constant in the high nanomolar range. In the present study, we used IRF-3 as the bait and a human HeLa cell cDNA library as the target. We obtained 272 antibiotic-resistant and lacZ-positive clones from 4.30 × 106 screened clones. To identify the protein encoded by the candidate positive clones, the nucleotide sequence of each clone was determined. Among the clones obtained, only 25 clones encoded in-frame fusion proteins to the λcI repressor. These clones were used in a search for homology in the NCBI data base. The cDNA fragments of the positive clones were subcloned into an expression vector to produce N-terminally Myc-tagged fusion proteins. However, we obtained in vitro coupled transcription/translation products from only 13 of 25 clones. For these 13 clones, we performed a GST pull-down assay to confirm their binding activities to IRF-3. Only clone A25 (cyclophilin B) showed specific binding to IRF-3 (data not shown). Therefore, we concentrated our efforts on the interaction between IRF-3 and CypB. Mapping the IRF-3 and Cyclophilin B Interaction Domains—To confirm the specificity of the interaction between IRF-3 and CypB, we examined which region of IRF-3 is important for binding to CypB. A GST pull-down assay was performed with a series of IRF-3 deletion mutants fused to GST and in vitro translated full-length CypB (Fig. 1A). As mentioned above, CypB bound to GST-IRF-3 but not to GST alone (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 2). The deletion of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain somehow enhanced the binding of CypB (Fig. 1B, lane 4), whereas further removal of the nuclear export signal and the proline-rich region reduced the affinity to CypB (lane 5). Unexpectedly, the deletion of the IAD restored the interaction potential of IRF-3 to CypB (Fig. 1B, lane 6). When we removed the C-terminal 296 residues from IRF-3, the interaction with CypB was not detected (Fig. 1B, lane 9). It is noteworthy that the mutants ΔN3 and ΔC1 do not share any regions of IRF-3 but still exhibited the CypB binding, suggesting that IRF-3 has multiple sites for CypB binding. Furthermore, the IAD seems to have an inhibitory effect on the binding, as the binding of ΔN2 is weaker than that of ΔN3, the construct lacking two thirds of the IAD from ΔN2. We did not perform a GST pull-down analysis with GST-CypB to detect the binding with IRF-3, because the GST-CypB expression plasmid failed to produce a detection level of the protein in E. coli. Next, we examined the regions of CypB required for the interaction with IRF-3. Because CypB is a rather small protein (208 amino acids), even a small deletion drastically destabilized the mutant forms of the protein (data not shown). Thus, we tested whether the PPIase activity of CypB, a well known biological activity of the protein, was required for the binding to IRF-3. For this purpose, arginine 96 and phenylalanine 101 in the PPIase domain of CypB were substituted with alanines by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1D, the PPIase mutant did not bind to IRF-3 (lane 9). In addition, we found that cyclophilin A (CypA), the most abundant cyclophilin in vivo, could not bind to IRF-3 (lane 3). Then, we examined the interaction between IRF-3 and CypB in vivo. The association of endogenous IRF-3 and CypB was detected when an anti-IRF-3 antibody was used for the precipitation of an extract prepared 10 min after NDV infection (Fig. 1E, lane 4) but not 30 min after the infection (data not shown). On the other hand, the available anti-CypB antibodies could not precipitate the endogenous IRF-3 with CypB, even 10 min after the infection. We also tried to characterize the binding domains of IRF-3 with CypB by using mutant IRF-3 expression plasmids. Unfortunately, the IRF-3 expression was inhibited when the CypB plasmid was introduced simultaneously. This is consistent with previous reports that CypB may participate in inducing the degradation of exogenously introduced DNA (18Nagata T. Kishi H. Liu Q.L. Yoshino T. Matsuda T. Jin Z.X. Murayama K.

Cyclophilin B Is Required for Virus-induced Phosphorylation of IRF-3—To examine the physiological roles of CypB in the IRF-3 function, we performed RNA interference experiments to knock down CypB in vivo and then examined the biochemical activities of IRF-3 after NDV infection. As shown in Fig. 2, the expression of CypB was almost completely suppressed by the specific siRNA interference (lanes 3 and 6, third panel). NDV infection in the mock- or control siRNA-transfected cells resulted in a mobility shift of IRF-3, which reflected the C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF-3 (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5, first panel) (9Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 20Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). However, IRF-3 showed an intermediate mobility in CypB siRNA-transfected/NDV-infected cells (Fig. 2, lane 6, first panel). When the same blot was reprobed with an antibody that specifically recognized a phosphorylated form of IRF-3 (21Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we found that the amounts of phosphorylated IRF-3 (phosphorylated Ser-396) were reduced in the CypB siRNA-transfected cells, as compared with the mock- or control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2, compare lanes 6 with lanes 4 and 5, second panel). These results strongly suggest that the knock-down of CypB resulted in the defect in IRF-3 phosphorylation by virus infection. The Cyclophilin B Knockdown Inhibited Virus-induced IRF-3 Dimerization—It is known that the phosphorylation of IRF-3 is prerequisite for the dimerization of IRF-3 (7Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). We thus examined the virus-induced dimerization of IRF-3 in siRNA-transfected cells. To do this, we used the native PAGE assay that sensitively detects the difference between the monomer and dimer forms of IRF-3 (22Iwamura T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi K. Suhara W. Mori W. Shiota K. Okabe Y. Namiki H. Fujita T. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). IRF-3 existed as a monomer in the mock-, control siRNA-, and CypB siRNA-transfected cells in the absence of NDV infection (Fig. 3, lanes 1-3). Upon viral infection, the monomer signals were reduced, but newly formed dimer signals were detected in the mock- and control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). However, significant amounts of the IRF-3 monomer still remained in the CypB siRNA-transfected/NDV-infected cells (Fig. 3, lane 6). These results clearly indicated that the specific knockdown of CypB by RNA interference inhibited the IRF-3 dimer formation induced by viral infection. The importance of CypB was again demonstrated in the phosphorylation of Ser-386, which is the critical residue in IRF-3 activation (23Mori M. Yoneyama M. Ito T. Takahashi K. Inagaki F. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9698-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). CypB siRNA-transfected/NDV-infected cells failed to phosphorylate Ser-386 (Fig. 3, panel 2, lane 6). The Cyclophilin B Knockdown Inhibited IRF-3 Binding to the ISRE and Association with CBP—Phosphorylated IRF-3 undergoes homodimerization (6Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The holocomplex has the ability to specifically recognize the target DNA sequence, called the ISRE (5Lin R. Genin P. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6342-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 8Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Kitabayashi I. Fujita T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of CypB on IRF-3 in terms of the DNA binding to the ISRE and the association with the CBP/p300 coactivator, using electromobility shift assay. In the absence of NDV infection, no DNA-protein complex was observed in the mock-, control siRNA-, and CypB siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1, 6, and 11). NDV infection induced the formation of a DNA-protein complex bound to the ISRE of the ISG15 gene in the mock- and control siRNA-transfected cell extracts (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 7). The addition of specific antibodies against IRF-3 to the binding reactions reduced the amount of the complex band and the induction of supershifted bands, indicating that the complex contained IRF-3 (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 8). The addition of specific antibodies against CBP to the binding reactions reduced the amount of the complex but did not induce the formation of supershifted bands, indicating that complex formation was partly blocked by the antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 9). This is consistent with the previous result that CBP/p300 is involved in the holocomplex of IRF-3 (6Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 7Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). However, the knockdown of CypB severely impaired the DNA binding activity of IRF-3 (Fig. 4, lane 12). Thus, the inhibition of CypB also resulted in reduced holocomplex formation, which is required for the target gene activation by IRF-3. A chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed the in vivo binding of IRF-3 to the ISG15 promoter in NDV-infected cells (Fig. 4B, lane 8) but not in uninfected cells (Fig. 4B, lane 2). When NDV-infected cells were pretreated with CypB siRNA, the binding was significantly reduced, and no band was detected after 30 PCR cycles (Fig. 4B, lane 12), although a band was visible after 40 cycles (data not shown). The control siRNA could not reduce the binding (Fig. 4B, lane 10). The Cyclophilin B Knockdown Reduced IFN-β Production by Newcastle Disease Virus Infection—Finally, we examined the effect of CypB on the regulation of IFN-β production. The amount of IFN-β in the culture medium was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, before and after NDV infection. The virus infection induced a more than 25-fold activation of IFN-β in the mock- and the control siRNA-transfected cells. The CypB-siRNA treatment caused a severe defect in the viral-dependent activation of IFN-β. (Fig. 5). These results indicate that CypB is required for the efficient activation of IFN-β production upon viral infection. We have described a novel interaction between IRF-3 and CypB. The present in vitro analysis suggests that autoinhibition domain of IRF-3 and the catalytic domain bearing the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of CypB are required for the interaction. CypB, a member of the cyclophilins, possesses a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity (15Price E.R. Jin M. Lim D. Pati S. Walsh C.T. McKeon F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Via their PPIase activity, cyclophilins facilitate protein folding and have been shown to contribute to the maturation and trafficking of several proteins (24Kay J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cyclophilins regulate signal transduction cascades, as revealed by their modulation of transforming growth factor-β signaling and the transactivation of c-myb and IRF-4 (25Lopez-Ilasaca M. Schiene C. Kullertz G. Tradler T. Fischer G. Wetzker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9430-9434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Leverson J.D. Ness S.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Among the cyclophilins, CypB is distinguished from the others by the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum-directed signal sequence (15Price E.R. Jin M. Lim D. Pati S. Walsh C.T. McKeon F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, CypB is found not only in the endoplasmic reticulum but also in the extracellular space and the nucleus (15Price E.R. Jin M. Lim D. Pati S. Walsh C.T. McKeon F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3931-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CypB has been reported to interact with prolactin. The proximal action of prolactin is mediated by its cell surface receptor. PRL activity, however, is also associated with the internalization and translocation of this hormone into the nucleus. To retrotransport it to the nucleus, and to potentiate prolactin-induced proliferation, the interaction with CypB with its PPIase activity is essential (27Rycyzyn M.A. Reilly S.C. O'Malley K. Clevenger C.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Rycyzyn M.A. Clevenger C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6790-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Similar to the interaction with prolactin, the PPIase domain of CypB is required for IRF-3 binding in a GST pull-down assay. We also found that retaining either one of the autoinhibition domains of IRF-3 is required for the binding. Previously, Mamane et al. (29Mamane Y. Sharma S. Petropoulos L. Lin R. Hiscott J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 129-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported the interaction between IRF-4, a member of the IRFs, and FKBP52, another member of the immunophilins. They demonstrated that IRF-4 would not co-immunoprecipitate with FKBP52 unless the C-terminal autoinhibition domain of IRF-4 was removed. This observation raises the possibility that the interactions of immunophilins with IRF family proteins are sensitive to the conformations or the ternary structures of IRFs. As demonstrated by our RNA interference analysis, the specific knockdown of CypB in vivo resulted in the inhibition of virus-induced IRF-3 activation. This was confirmed at multiple steps, including phosphorylation, dimerization, DNA binding, coactivator binding, and IFN-β-induction. If the phosphorylation of IRF-3 is a prerequisite for the following events after the virus-induced activation of IRF-3, then it is likely that CypB is involved in the phosphorylation reaction of IRF-3. The early involvement of CypB is supported by the notion that the in vivo association of CypB with IRF-3 was only detected 10 min after the infection but not after 30 min. At present, it has been reported that the C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF-3 is mediated by IκB kinase-ϵ and TANK-binding kinase 1 (10Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E.

Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis of IRF-3 revealed key residues for virus-induced activation. Substitutions of the serine residues at 385 or 386 to alanine, glutamic acid, or aspartic acid made the molecule unresponsive to stimuli (7Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K.

Substitutions of other serine/threonine residues, present at positions 396, 398, 402, 404, and 405, to aspartic acid made IRF-3 constitutively active (20Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Recently, Servant et al. (21Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. tenOever B.R. Duguay D. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9441-9447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) identified Ser-396 and Ser-398 as the minimal phosphorylation sites critical for activation, based on their observation that S396D and S396D/S398D are constitutively active. More recently, Mori et al. (23Mori M. Yoneyama M. Ito T. Takahashi K. Inagaki F. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9698-9702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) identified Ser-386 as the target of IRF-3, using an antibody that specifically detects the phosphorylation of Ser-386. As protein kinases are often associated with, in addition to their regulators, molecular chaperones that sometimes need to exert their specificity for the substrates, it is interesting to speculate that CypB associates with the IRF-3 kinases, IκB kinase-ϵ and TANK-binding kinase 1, in a similar manner. Although it will be important in the future to determine whether it is the CypB binding, catalytic activity, or both that is responsible for its effect on IRF-3, our results indicate that CypB plays a significant role in modulating IFN-β gene expression via its interaction with IRF-3.

https://openalex.org/W2058261041,"The expression of certain endothelial cell adhesion molecules (ECAMs) is increased in the vasculature of the inflamed bowel (e.g., colitis), thereby providing an opportunity for targeted drug delivery. We recently demonstrated that biodegradable particles conjugated with ligands to ECAMs exhibit significant selective adhesion to ECAM expressing endothelium. In the present study, we used a murine model of colitis to determine whether poly(lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) particles conjugated with a VCAM-1 ligand (alpha-V) exhibit enhanced adhesion to colitic vasculature. In post-capillary venules of the colon, significantly more alpha-V particles accumulate in colitic mice relative to (i) control mice (i.e., selectivity) and (ii) particles bearing a control ligand (i.e., ligand efficiency). The selectivity and ligand efficiency of alpha-V particles were a function of the total number of particles infused. The highest selectivity observed within our test regime was 3, while ligand efficiency increased linearly with the number of particles injected to a value of 24. This work represents a significant step towards achieving a targeted drug delivery scheme for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and indicates that the efficiency of targeting is dependent on the dose regime."

In contrast, in Escherichia coli, a variety of exoribonucleases carry out final 3′ maturation. Yet, E. coli retains an RNase Z homologue, ElaC, whose function is under active study. We have overexpressed and purified to homogeneity His-tagged ElaC and show here that it is, in fact, the previously described enzyme, RNase BN. Thus, purified ElaC displays structural and catalytic properties identical to those ascribed to RNase BN. In addition, an elaC mutant strain behaves identically to a known RNase BN– strain, CAN. Finally, we show that wild type elaC can complement the mutation in strain CAN and that the elaC gene in strain CAN carries a nonsense mutation that results in loss of RNase BN activity. These data correct a previous misassignment for the gene encoding RNase BN.

In all organisms examined, tRNA genes are transcribed as precursor forms that contain extra 5′ and 3′ sequences that must be removed to generate mature, functional species (1Deutscher M.P. Soll D. Rajbhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 51-65Google Scholar). The 5′ processing event carried out by the endoribonuclease RNase P is quite similar among different organisms (2Deutscher M.P. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 45-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, 3′-end maturation varies considerably and may utilize an exonucleolytic or an endonucleolytic mechanism depending largely on whether or not the universal 3′-terminal CCA sequence is encoded (1Deutscher M.P.

In Escherichia coli, an organism in which all tRNA genes have the CCA encoded (5Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), 3′ maturation generally begins with an endonucleolytic cleavage by RNase E downstream of the mature 3′ terminus (7Li Z. Deutscher M.P. RNA (N. Y.). 2002; 8: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), followed by exonucleolytic trimming to expose the CCA sequence (1Deutscher M.P. Soll D.

Any one of five exoribonucleases, RNase II, RNase D, RNase BN, RNase T, or RNase PH, can carry out the trimming reaction (8Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although RNases T and PH are most effective (8Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, in which the CCA sequence is not encoded, and in Bacillus subtilis, for those tRNA genes that do not encode the CCA sequence, 3′ maturation is carried out by an endoribonuclease, termed RNase Z or 3′-tRNase (6Schiffer S. Rosch S. Marchfelder A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2769-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Nashimoto M.

Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Genes encoding RNase Z homologues are found in eukaryotes, archaea, and about half of the sequenced eubacterial genomes (11de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the RNase Z homologue is encoded by the elaC gene located at 51.3 min on the E. coli chromosome (13Rudd K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by elaC was originally found to be a zinc phosphodiesterase (ZiPD) (14Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to have RNase activity on certain tRNA precursors (12Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Schilling O. Spath B. Kostelecky B. Marchfelder A. Meyer-Klaucke W.

Ruggeberg S. Vogel A. Rittner N. Weichert S. Schmidt S. Doig S. Franz T. Benes V. Andrews S.C. Baum M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the presence of CCA in all E. coli tRNA genes (5Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), has made it difficult to understand what might be the role of ElaC in this organism. Interestingly, the substrate specificity of RNase Z, i.e. removal of incorrect residues in the position of the CCA sequence, was reminiscent of a previously identified E. coli enzyme, termed RNase BN (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This RNase was shown to be essential for maturation of certain bacteriophage T4 tRNAs that do not encode the CCA sequence (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); thus, two E. coli mutant strains, BN (a B derivative) and CAN (a K-12 derivative) (19Maisurian A.N. Buyanovskaya E.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 120: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Maisurian A.N. Buianovskaia E.A. Genetika. 1975; 11: 114-118PubMed Google Scholar), deficient in this RNase, could not support the growth of a phage T4 mutant that required a suppressor function of phage T4 tRNASer, a tRNA for which the CCA is not encoded (18Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). RNase BN also can take over 3′ maturation of host tRNA precursors in a strain lacking the other tRNA maturation exoribonucleases, although it does so extremely poorly (3Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Earlier, our laboratory reported that RNase BN is encoded by an orf (yihY) at 87.8 min on the E. coli genetic map, subsequently named rbn (21Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the rbn coding regions of strains BN and CAN were identical to wild type (21Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, sequence analysis of rbn indicated that RNase BN was unlike other RNases, and in fact, was part of a hydrophobic protein family (22Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These considerations led us to re-examine the identity of the gene that encodes RNase BN. We show here, using biochemical and genetic approaches, that RNase BN is actually encoded by the elaC gene and, therefore, that RNase BN is the RNase Z homologue of E. coli. Materials—Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. The Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene. Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase was from Promega. The QIAEX II gel extraction kit was purchased from Qiagen Inc.

Bacterial and Bacteriophage Strains—Wild type E. coli K-12 strain CA265 and its RNase BN– derivative, strain CAN, have been described (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H.

Strain BL21I–II– (DE3)/pLys also was described previously (23Cheng Z.F. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21624-21629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Wild type bacteriophage T4, the amber-suppressor T4 phage, BU33, and phage Plvir were from our laboratory stock. An elaC deletion-insertion strain was constructed by replacing most of the elaC gene (all but four N-terminal amino acids of ElaC are removed) with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette using the method of Datsenko and Wanner (24Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11281) Google Scholar). The pKD3 chloramphenicol resistance cassette was amplified by PCR using the following reverse and forward primers, 5′-GGGTTGCGATAACAGGGCAAGTTTCGCCCTGTTTTTAATAATAAGCAGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTA-3′ and 5′ATACTAGCCGGAATATTTTTTGAAACTGTATGAACTCATGGAATTAATTTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′, respectively (residues homologous to elaC are underlined). The linear PCR product was first transformed into the electrocompetent strain BW25113/pKD46, and the elaC mutation was subsequently transferred into other strains by transduction with phage P1vir. Disruption of the elaC gene was verified by PCR using a variety of primers within and flanking the insertion cassette (data not shown). Plasmid Construction—DNA fragments containing the elaC gene were amplified from chromosomal DNA of strains CA265 and CAN by PCR using the oligonucleotides ElaC5ECO (5′-CGGAATTCCGCCACCAGTTCATCATTTTTCCAACCGAG-3′) and ElaC3SAL (5′-ACGCGTCGACAGCGCGGGTTGCGATAACAGGGCAAGTTTC-3′) as primers. PCR products were inserted into the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of plasmid pHC79 to yield plasmids pElaC(CA265) (for the CA265 elaC gene) and pElaC(CAN) (for the CAN elaC gene). Construction of the overexpression plasmid, pET-ElaC, for production of ElaC, was carried out as follows: the elaC DNA sequence was generated by PCR from genomic DNA of E. coli strain CA244 using the forward primer (P3) 5′-GAACCCATGGAATTAATTTTTTTAGGTACT-3′, which introduced an NcoI restriction site (bold) and the reverse primer (P2) 5′-TAATAACTCGAGTTAAACGTTAAACACGGT-3′, which introduced an XhoI restriction site (bold). The PCR product was then cloned into the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET15b expression plasmid (Novagen). Since NcoI cuts the elaC gene internally into two fragments, insertion of the DNA fragment was done in two steps. Construction of the overexpression plasmid pET-ElaC(His) for production of His-tagged ElaC was performed as follows: the elaC DNA sequence was generated by PCR from genomic DNA of E. coli strain CA244 using the forward primer (P1) 5′-GAACCATATGGAATTAATTTTTTTAGGTACT-3′, which introduces an NdeI restriction site (bold) and the reverse primer (P2). The PCR product was cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET15b. Expression and Purification of ElaC—Strain BL21I–II–(DE3)/pLys carrying the pET-ElaC(His) plasmid was grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin plus 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to maintain the pLys plasmid. At an A600 of 0.6, 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and growth was continued for another 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and washed with 0.9% NaCl. The cell pellet was frozen at –80 °C until use. All steps of the purification procedure were carried out at 4 °C. The frozen pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of buffer M (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Cells were ruptured by two passes through an Aminco French press at 12,000 p.s.i. The resulting crude extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fluid was loaded on a 5 ml His-Trap HP column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with nickel and equilibrated with buffer M. Proteins were eluted by a gradient from 0 to 600 mm imidazole, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ElaC-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Ultrafree Biomax-10K. Preparation of Extracts—Cultures (20 ml) of BL21I–II–(DE3)/pLys cells carrying either pET-ElaC or pET-ElaC(His) were grown at 37 °C in LB medium. At an A600 of 0.6, 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added. After 2 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.4 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Resuspended cells were broken by sonication using two 20-s pulses. Substrates—tRNA-C-[3H]A, tRNA-C-[32P]U, and tRNA-CC-[32P]A were synthesized using E. coli or rabbit liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferase as described (25Deutscher M.P. Ghosh R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein Determination—Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217389) Google Scholar) Enzyme Assays—Standard assays for RNase BN were carried out in 100 μl reaction mixtures containing: 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 0.2 mm CoCl2, 200 mm KCl, 10 or 20 μg of tRNA-C-[3H]A and the indicated amount of crude extract or purified protein. Gel Filtration—Extracts containing ElaC(His) were applied to an Ultragel AcA44 gel filtration column (1.0 × 56.5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Blue dextran 2000, bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsin (25 kDa), and vitamin B12 were used for calibration. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and 50 μl of each were assayed for RNase BN. Phage Assays—Bacteriophage T4 or T4 mutant strain BU33 (18Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 0.4 ml of E. coli at an A600 ∼1. The suspension was then overlaid onto LB plates with 3 ml of top agar. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C prior to counting plaques. Purification of ElaC—To examine its catalytic properties, we attempted to purify the ElaC protein both in its native and in a His-tagged form (see “Experimental Procedures”). RNases I and II were eliminated from the strain to reduce background RNase activity. Unexpectedly, we found that the active, native form of ElaC could not be overexpressed, whereas no such difficulty was found with the N-terminal His-tagged protein. Thus, as shown in Fig. 1A, induction of pET-ElaC essentially results in cessation of cell growth, whereas slower growth continues upon induction of pET-ElaC(His). Moreover, while the His-tagged form of ElaC protein could be readily overexpressed and led to increased RNase activity in extracts, results with the native form were quite variable (Fig. 1B). In some experiments, no overexpression was observed, whereas in others, such as shown in Fig. 1B, the protein was overexpressed, but it was inactive (data not shown). These data indicate that overexpression of ElaC is deleterious to E. coli. Second, it is likely that His-tagged ElaC is considerably less active than the native protein. However, direct confirmation of this conclusion must await purification of native ElaC. To confirm that the elevated RNase activity observed in extracts was due to the overexpressed His-tagged ElaC, the extract was fractioned on an Ultragel AcA44 gel filtration column. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assayed for RNase activity (data not shown). His-tagged ElaC protein peaked in fractions 22 to 24, and the peak of RNase activity was found in the same position, supporting the conclusion that His-tagged ElaC is an active RNase. His-tagged ElaC was purified to homogeneity using a His-Trap HP column. The purified protein had a specific activity with tRNA-CA as substrate of ∼2,000 nmol/h/mg of protein. This compares with a specific activity of 55 nmol/h/mg of protein in the crude extract. On SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C), the purified protein migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa. Taking into account the His-tag and additional amino acids introduced from the cloning, this value is in excellent agreement with the molecular mass calculated from the sequence of the elaC gene (32.9 kDa). Based on an apparent molecular mass of ∼75 kDa, determined by gel filtration for the active, His-tagged enzyme, these data confirm that ElaC is a homodimer (14Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and also show that it is similar in size to that reported earlier for RNase BN (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Catalytic Properties of ElaC—The reported preference of RNase Z for tRNA substrates lacking the CCA sequence appeared to be the same as that previously ascribed to E. coli RNase BN (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Consequently, for the assays of the RNase Z homologue, ElaC, we used RNase BN assay conditions and tRNA-CA, a known substrate of RNase BN (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further examination of the specificity of ElaC for various tRNA substrates revealed that it acted on tRNA-CU, tRNA-CA, and tRNA-CCA essentially as previously found for RNase BN (5Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Purified ElaC also was active against bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate and thymidine-5′-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, as reported (14Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RNase BN is unusual among E. coli RNases in that it is more active with Co2+ than with Mg2+ as the required divalent cation, and it is most active at pH values between 6 and 7 (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As these are essentially unique signatures for RNase BN activity, we examined purified ElaC to determine whether these conditions were also optimal for its RNase activity. The data in Table I show that homogeneous ElaC acts on tRNA-CA much more efficiently with Co2+ than with Mg2+ and that the enzyme is more active at pH 6.5 than pH 7.5. These data support the idea that ElaC might be RNase BN.Table IOptimal conditions for purified ElaC RNase activityCo2+Mg2+relative activitypH 6.5100aActivity at pH 6.5 with CoCl2 was set at 100.28pH 7.56117a Activity at pH 6.5 with CoCl2 was set at 100. Open table in a new tab As a further test of the relation between ElaC and RNase BN, we determined the product of ElaC action on tRNA-C-[3H]A. Earlier, it was shown that RNase BN releases UMP and AMP from tRNA-CU and tRNA-CA, respectively (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consequently, RNase BN was considered to be an exoribonuclease. ElaC also releases AMP from tRNA-CA (Table II). Thus, all of the acid-soluble product generated binds to Dowex-1, but after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, it no longer binds, confirming that the product is negatively charged AMP that is converted to neutral adenosine upon phosphatase treatment. Likewise, AMP is released from tRNA-CCA and UMP from tRNA-CU (data not shown). These data provide additional biochemical evidence that ElaC is related to RNase BN.Table IIAction of ElaC on tRNA-CANucleosideNucleotide%-Phosphatase199+Phosphatase937 Open table in a new tab Generation and Properties of an elaC Mutant—To further examine the relationship between ElaC and RNase BN, a deletion-insertion mutant of elaC was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Our ability to recover the mutant strain indicates that elaC is not essential for E. coli growth, confirming the conclusion of Schilling et al. (16Schilling O. Ruggeberg S. Vogel A. Rittner N. Weichert S. Schmidt S. Doig S. Franz T. Benes V. Andrews S.C. Baum M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Growth of the elaC mutant strain was indistinguishable from wild type on rich medium (LB) or minimal medium (M9/glucose) plates at 24, 37, and 42 °C. Thus, the absence of ElaC has no obvious effect on E. coli growth. In earlier studies, it was shown that strain CAN, lacking RNase BN, also grows as well as wild type (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Maisurian A.N. Buianovskaia E.A. Genetika. 1975; 11: 114-118PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zaniewski R. Petkaitis E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11651-11653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these data show that both ElaC– and RNase BN– mutant strains are unaffected in growth. The elaC mutation was also transferred to a strain lacking RNase I, II, and D activity. In this background, the elaC mutation reduced RNase activity against tRNA-C-[32P]U in extracts to ≤10% of that in a strain containing ElaC (data not shown). This finding indicates that elimination of ElaC dramatically reduces RNase BN activity, supporting the conclusion that ElaC is RNase BN. It was necessary to carry out this experiment in the RNase I–II–D– background to eliminate other RNases that also act on the RNase BN substrate (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Growth of T4 Phage in Wild Type and Mutant Strains— E. coli strains deficient in RNase BN are known to be unable to plate the mutant T4 phage strain BU33 (19Maisurian A.N. Buyanovskaya E.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 120: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) due to their inability to process the 3′-end of a phage-encoded suppressor tRNASer (18Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To obtain additional evidence for the identity of RNase BN and ElaC, wild type T4 and BU33 were plated on a wild type E. coli strain (CA265), on a known RNase BN– mutant strain (CAN) and on an ElaC mutant strain (BEZ33). The data in Table III show that wild type T4 is able to form plaques with equal efficiency on all three strains. In contrast, phage T4 BU33 could only form plaques on the wild type strain; the other strains could not support BU33 growth. These data indicate that ElaC– and RNase BN– mutant strains behave identically with respect to growth of T4 phage BU33 and consequently to the maturation of psu+1 tRNASer.Table IIIPlating of bacteriophage T4 on wild type and mutant E. coliE. coli strainRelevant phenotypeT4BU33plaquesCA265Wild type35108CANRNase BN-250BEZ33ElaC-300 Open table in a new tab The elaC genes from wild type CA265 and mutant CAN also were compared for their ability to complement the T4 phage BU33 growth defect in strain CAN. Each elaC gene was cloned into the low copy number plasmid pHC79 and transformed into strain CAN (Table IV). The elaC gene from strain CA265 can complement to allow phage BU33 growth, whereas that from strain CAN cannot. These data indicate that elaC genes from strains CA265 and CAN are different and that the wild type elaC gene can overcome the absence of RNase BN in strain CAN. These observations imply that the RNase BN defect in strain CAN is due to a mutation in its elaC gene.Table IVComplemantation of an RNase BN mutation by wild type and mutant elaCE. coli strainPlasmid presentT4BU33plaquesCANpHC79 vector4980CANpElaC (CA265)410234CANpElaC (CAN)4600 Open table in a new tab Sequences of the elaC Genes from Wild Type and RNase BN–Mutant Strains—To directly confirm the presence of a mutation in the elaC gene of strain CAN, the cloned gene was sequenced and compared with the cloned elaC gene from wild type strain CA265. This analysis revealed that nucleotide 259 in the elaC gene of strain CAN was changed from C to T, converting the CAA codon of Gln-87 to a UAA stop codon, and resulting in synthesis of a protein fragment lacking RNase BN activity. The information presented here clearly shows that the E. coli ElaC protein is, in fact, the previously described enzyme, RNase BN. Thus, purified ElaC displays biochemical properties identical to those previously described for RNase BN (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), including its homodimeric structure, its unusual optimal assay conditions, and its substrate specificity. Second, an elaC mutant strain behaves identically to the known RNase BN– strain, CAN (17Asha P.K. Blouin R.T. Zaniewski R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3301-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with respect to growth under a variety of conditions and to its inability to support plaque formation by mutant T4 phage BU33. This latter property is a direct biological assay for the presence of RNase BN activity (18Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Third, whereas a cloned elaC gene from a wild type strain can complement the RNase BN defect in strain CAN, that from an RNase BN– strain cannot. Finally, direct sequencing showed that the elaC gene in strain CAN contains a nonsense mutation that would result in an inactive fragment protein. Based on all of this information, it is apparent that the previous assignment (21Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the gene encoding RNase BN must have been incorrect. The new assignment of elaC as the relevant gene is much more consistent with that expected for the sequence of a ribonuclease. Moreover, the finding of a mutation in the elaC gene of strain CAN provides a clear explanation for the absence of RNase BN in this strain, in contrast to the earlier results in which no mutation was found (21Callahan C. Deutscher M.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7329-7332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also observed that overexpression of the gene previously designated as rbn does not increase RNase BN activity and that deletion of this gene still allows plating of T4 phage BU33 (data not shown). Consequently, we propose that the rbn designation be removed from the orf (yihY) at 87.8 min and that elaC be renamed rbn, especially since there is no particular significance to the elaC name (14Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One interesting question that remains is whether RNase BN is an exo or endoribonuclease or both. When examined, RNase Zs from other organisms are endoribonucleases, and even the E. coli homologue has been shown to cleave tRNA precursors in an endonucleolytic manner (12Minagawa A. Takaku H. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15688-15697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Schilling O. Spath B. Kostelecky B. Marchfelder A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Vogel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17857-17862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that RNase BN cuts a B. subtilis tRNAThr precursor (10Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to generate a tRNA-sized product (data not shown), implying that it is an endoribonuclease. However, it is also true that RNase BN cuts tRNA-CA, tRNA-CU and tRNA-CCA to release the 3′-terminal nucleotide. It is this activity that led to its original designation as an exoribonuclease. We suspect that with these latter substrates, containing very short single-stranded 3′-ends or an inhibitory CCA sequence, endoribonucleolytic cleavage is constrained to the terminal residue, which may be the only residue able to enter the cleavage channel (11de la Sierra-Gallay I.L. Pellegrini O. Condon C. Nature. 2005; 433: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The finding that it was not possible to overexpress normal ElaC, whereas no such difficulty was observed with the His-tagged version, emphasizes a serious issue to be considered when working with tagged proteins. In this particular instance, the presence of the His-tag apparently results in a major effect on RNase BN activity that eliminates the deleterious effect of overexpressing the native protein. This is not so surprising considering that the His-tag would lead to a new, highly positively charged region in a protein that must interact with a negatively charged RNA substrate. This may result in incorrect binding and a consequent reduction in RNase activity. Although the data presented here clarify the relation between RNase BN and ElaC, the question still remains as to its role in E. coli. The essentiality of RNase BN for maturation of the 3′-end of certain phage T4 tRNA precursors which do not encode the CCA sequence (18Seidman J.G. Schmidt F.J. Foss K. McClain W.H. Cell. 1975; 5: 389-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) fits exactly with the role of the homologous RNase Z in other organisms (4Morl M. Marchfelder A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Pellegrini O. Nezzar J. Marchfelder A. Putzer H. Condon C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4534-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the E. coli host has no apparent need for such an activity as the CCA sequence is encoded in all its tRNA genes (5Deutscher M.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 209-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RNase BN mutants show no growth phenotype (16Schilling O. Ruggeberg S. Vogel A. Rittner N. Weichert S. Schmidt S. Doig S. Franz T. Benes V. Andrews S.C. Baum M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Zaniewski R. Petkaitis E. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11651-11653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this RNase could not be required for maturation of any essential RNA. Thus, given the absence of an obvious function, we can expect continued examination into the possible role of this interesting RNase in E. coli.

The amino acid residues, in which the side-chain oxygen atoms contribute to Ca2+ binding in SERCA, which include Glu-309 in M4 (Glu-327 or Glu-344 in Na,K-ATPase or H,K-ATPase, respectively), Asn-768 (Asn-775 or Asn-793) and Glu-771 in M5 (Glu-779 or Glu-796), Asn-796 (Asp-804 or Glu-821), Thr-799 (Thr-807 or Thr-824) and Asp-800 in M6 (Asp-808 or Asp-825), and Glu-908 in M8 (Val-920 or Glu-940) are highly conserved among these P-type ATPases. These data and other findings suggest the presence of a cationoccluded structure in Na/K-, H/K- and SERCA-Ca/H-ATPase that is shared by all molecules in this class, although the structures required for cation selectivity could be different. Many mutational and chemical modification studies of Na,K-ATPase had been carried out and the findings indicate that the amino acid residues described above recognize Na+ and/or K+ and/or form binding pockets for these cations (10Andersen J.P.

Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) suggested that the two Na+ ions bind to positions that are equivalent to the Ca2+ binding sites in SERCA (46Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar); namely, the first Na+ binding site is situated between M5, M6, and M8, and the second is between M4 and M6, whereas the third site, which is unique to Na,K-ATPase, is situated between M5, M6, and M9. The similarity of M4, M5, and M6 among the three P-type ATPases is more than 50%, and the similarity between Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase is in excess of 70% (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the similarity of M8 and M9 between Na,K-ATPase and Ca-ATPase is rather low, 38%, and the sequence 919IV(V/I)VQW924 in M8 is highly conserved in mammalian Na,K-ATPase, indicating the possibility that these helices contribute to the third Na+ binding, which is only present in Na,K-ATPase. The specific requirement of a hydrophobic side chain in Val-920 of Na,K-ATPase is suggested because the corresponding residue in SERCA and H,K-ATPase is a negatively charged Glu. The Gln-923 in Na,K-ATPase is conserved in H,K-ATPase but not in SERCA (Asn-911). Q923A has been reported not to support cell growth (43Argüello J.M. Whitis J. Lingrel J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When the amino acid residue Asp-925 in M8 of the rat α2 isoform is mutated to Leu, a 2-fold decrease in the apparent affinity for both Na+ and K+ occurs, and for the case of mutation to Asn, a 4-fold decrease in Na+ affinity with a 2-fold increase in K+ affinity was reported (19Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The presence of Na+ and K+ (14Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Moorman J. Stein W.D. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6911-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) has been reported to protect the chemical modification of Glu-953 in M9, but E953Q and E954Q showed no or only a slight effect on the apparent affinity for Na+ and K+ (17Van Huysse J.W. Lingrel J.B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar, 18Van Huysse J.W. Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Van Huysse J.W. Kuntzweiler T.A. Lingrel J.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to obtain information concerning the third Na+ binding site, which may be present in M5, M8, and M9, by comparing the apparent K0.5 values for Na+ with those for K+ and with those for ATP in mutated enzymes. The Val-920 and Gln-923 in M8 appears to face toward Glu-954 in M9 or Thr-774 in M5, respectively. Mutants carrying a single amino acid substitution in these residues and Glu-953 were constructed. The Glu-953 has been replaced with Phe in Artemia and Drosophila and has been assumed to be a Rb+-protectable dicylohexylcarbodiimide binding site (14Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Moorman J. Stein W.D. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6911-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We were not able to obtain stable cell lines expressing the Gln-923 mutants. However, the amino acid substitution of Thr-774 to Ala, Val-920 to Glu (the same sequence for SERCA and H,K-ATPase at the corresponding position), Glu-953 to Ala, and Glu-954 to Ala were expressed in HeLa cells. The apparent K0.5 for Na+,K+, and ATP of expressed enzymes were estimated by a Na+-dependent phosphorylation reaction, the Na,K-ATPase activity, and K+-dependent pNPPase activity of the enzymes. The data were subjected to a nonlinear least square regression using the Hill equation. These results and others suggest that Gln-923 in M8 is crucial for the active transport of Na+ and/or K+ across membranes and that Thr-774 in M5, Val-920 in M8, and Glu-954 in M9 are related mainly to the active transport of Na+, namely, the recognition and/or the occlusion-deocclusion of Na+, and also to the high and low affinity ATP effects rather than to the transport process of K+. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Plasmids pGEM-NaK and pCDL-NaK containing the entire coding region of rat Na,K-ATPase α1 cDNA have been described previously (50Imagawa T. Shida M. Matsuzawa K. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the megaprimer PCR method (51Tao B.Y. Lee K.C.P. Griffn H.G. Griffin A.M. PCR Technology Current Innovations. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 69-83Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides. The amplified cDNA fragment, including the region encoding amino acid residues 674–936 (between KpnI and EcoRI sites) for the Thr774, Val920, and Gln923 mutants or 935–1016 (between EcoRI and SacI (vector) sites) for the Glu953 and Glu954 was subcloned back into the wild type rat Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit cDNA in the pGEM vector. The mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing (52Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar). The entire coding region of the mutated rat α1 cDNA was transferred to the expression vector pCDL as described previously (50Imagawa T. Shida M. Matsuzawa K. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) or the fusion protein expression vector pEGFP-C3 (Clontech. BD Biosciences). Transfection of HeLa Cells Expressing the Rat β Subunit with Rat Na,K-ATPase α1 Subunit—HeLa cells expressing the rat β subunit (53Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were cultured in a 35-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA containing a wild type or mutant Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit cDNA with the GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) and subjected to selection in 10 μm ouabain. Ouabain-resistant cells were then expanded into stable cell lines. Localization of EGFP Fusion Protein in HeLa Cells—The fusion protein expression vector pEGFP carrying the entire coding region of the wild type and mutated rat α1 cDNA was transfected to HeLa cells as described above. Within 24–36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a confocal microscope LSM510 (Zeiss). The EGFP fluorescent signals were visualized and recorded through an 40× water immersion objective. Preparation of SDS-purified Membrane Vesicles—Crude plasma membranes were prepared from HeLa cells (53Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Crude plasma membranes at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were incubated with 0.15 mg/ml SDS in a buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 5 min at room temperature. The sample was loaded onto stepwise sucrose density gradients consisting of 10 and 40% sucrose layers and centrifuged at 350,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor for 10 min at 4 °C. The fractions at the 10%:40% interface were collected and pooled. The pooled sample was diluted with 3 volumes of the sucrose buffer and centrifuged at 350,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in the sucrose buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, and the protein concentration was measured using bovine serum albumin as a standard as described in (54Bradford M. Anal. Bochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Sodium-dependent Phosphoenzyme (EP) Formation from ATP—SDS-treated membrane vesicles (4 μg) were incubated at 0 °C for 10 s in 40 μlof0–16mm NaCl, 0.43 mm MgCl2,25mm imidazole/HCl (pH 7.2), and 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 μl of an ice-cold solution of 10% trichloroacetic acid solution containing 10 mm inorganic phosphate. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed with an ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid solution by centrifugation. The resulting precipitates were washed with ice-cold water by centrifugation. The precipitates were dissolved in sample buffer containing a trace amount of a bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and subjected to SDS-PAGE at pH 6.0 (55Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After drying the gels, the amount of 32P incorporated into the Na,K-ATPase α subunit was quantitated by means of a BAS 2000 system (Fuji), and the amount present relative to the wild type was determined. Na,K-ATPase and Potassium-dependent pNPPase Activity—The ATPase activity of SDS-treated membrane vesicles from HeLa cells was measured in duplicate at 37 °C for 30 min in a reaction medium containing 0.5∼2 μg of enzyme protein, 0–160 mm NaCl, 4 mm ATP, 16 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 125 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) in the presence of 5 μm or 5 mm ouabain. The reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 12% SDS. Inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically by measurement of inorganic phosphate as ammonium molybdate complexes (56Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Rat Na,K-ATPase activity was determined as the difference between the activities in the presence of 5 μm and 5 mm ouabain. The relative turnover number was obtained by dividing rat Na,K-ATPase activity by the relative amount of EPmax, estimated as described above. The value of the wild type was taken as 240 s–1, which was estimated in a previous paper (57Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50283-50292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of ATP and K+ on Na,K-ATPase activity, 4 mm ATP and 16 mm K+ were replaced with 0–4 mm ATP and 0–16 mm K+, respectively. The effect of vanadate was measured after the addition of 0–25 μm sodium vanadate. The pNPPase activity of the SDS-treated membrane vesicles was measured in the presence of 0–16 mm KCl at 37 °C for 30 min in a solution containing 1∼2 μg of enzyme protein, 0.5–10 mm pNPP, 6 mm MgCl2, 125 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm imidazole/HCl (pH 7.2). The K-pNPPase activity was calculated as the difference between the activities with and without KCl. The K-pNPPase activity was also measured in the presence of 5 mm ouabain. Curve Fitting of the Data—The data were subjected to curve fitting to estimate each apparent K0.5 and n for a ligand (L) by a nonlinear least square regression using the Hill equation (GraphPad Prism; GraphPad Software Inc.), V = Vmax [L]nL/(K0.5LnL + [L]nL), in which Vmax, K0.5L, and nL are the maximum amounts of EP formed or the maximum Na/K- or K-pNPPase activity, the concentration of ligand required for the half-maximum formation of EP or the half-maximum velocity, and the Hill coefficient, respectively. The value shown in the figures represent each K0.5 and n estimated from three independent duplicated experiments (the means ± S.D., n = 6) with the correlation coefficient, r. Construction of the Mutants of Na,K-ATPase Carrying a Single Amino Acid Substitution Near the Cation Binding Site— Homology modeling of Na,K-ATPase based on the three-dimensional structure of Ca-ATPase (9Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) was carried out with the SWISS-MODEL software program (www.expasy.ch/spabv) (Fig. 2, A and B) using the alignment shown in Fig. 1A. The amino acid residues Thr-774 (M5), Val-920 and Gln-923 (M8), and Glu-953 and Glu-954 (M9) appear to be close together and also in close proximity to the two Na+ binding sites estimated from homology modeling. Na,K-ATPase transports three Na+ ions from the cytosol to the extracellular space, whereas the Ca-ATPase and H,K-ATPase transports two Ca2+ ions and H+ ions, respectively. Thus, some amino acid residues that are not conserved between Na,K-ATPase and Ca-ATPase or H,K-ATPase might be related to the third Na+ ion binding conformation. Val-920 is conserved in all Na,K-ATPase enzymes, except for the fungal Blastocladiella emersonii, but the corresponding amino acid in Ca-ATPase and H,K-ATPase is Glu. The Gln-923 is highly conserved in Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase, so this amino acid may be related in some manner to the transport of monovalent cations. To investigate this point, mutant proteins carrying a single amino acid substitution of these residues (T774A, V920E, Q923N/D/E/L, E953A/K, and E954A/K) were constructed. Each of the mutant Na,K-ATPase molecules was expressed in HeLa cells expressing a rat Na,K-ATPase β subunit as described in a previous paper (53Teramachi S. Imagawa T. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37394-37400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the case of Q923N/D/E/L, E953K, and E954K, stable cell lines surviving in the presence of 10 μm ouabain could not be obtained, but some cells transfected with E953K survived for 24–36 h after transfection in the presence of 10 μm ouabain. We constructed the expression vector encoding the EGFP fusion protein with the wild type enzyme and transfected it in HeLa cells. The resulting EGFP wild type fusion Na,K-ATPase had an ATPase activity similar to the wild type enzyme, suggesting that the fusion with EGFP had a negligible effect on ATPase activity (data not shown). The EGFP fusion protein with the Q923N/D/E/L, E953K, and E954K mutants were transiently expressed in HeLa cells. Green fluorescent signals were observed on the plasma membrane in HeLa cells expressing the wild type and Q923N/D/E/L, E953K, and E954K mutants. When the HeLa cells were transfected with the expression vector without Na,K-ATPase cDNA, the green fluorescence was uniformly observed in the cytosol. The fusion protein expression vector contains the neomycin-resistant gene, so HeLa cells transfected with the EGFP mutant fusion constructs were selected in the presence of G418. We obtained G418-resistant stable cell lines, but these cells did not express the green fluorescent fusion proteins. These results suggest that, although these mutant enzymes were normally expressed on the plasma membrane, the Na+/K+-ATPase activity and/or the transport activity of Na+/K+ across the membranes was too low to permit stable cell lines to survive in the presence of 10 μm ouabain. Effect of Each Mutation on the Apparent Affinity for Na+Registered by ATP-dependent EP Formation and by Na,K-ATPase Activity—To estimate the apparent K0.5 for Na+ in the absence of K+, the Na+-dependent EP (E2P) formation of a SDS-treated enzyme preparation under steady state conditions was measured in the presence of 0–16 mm NaCl, 0.43 mm Mg2+, and 2 μm [γ32-P]ATP (Fig. 3). The data were fitted to the Hill equation with the correlation coefficient 0.956–0.986, which gave values for the maximum amount of phosphoenzyme (EPmax), the Hill coefficient nNa,EP, the half-maximum concentration of Na+ (K0.5Na,EP), and the correlation coefficient (r). The K0.5Na,EP of the wild type was 0.59 ± 0.03 mm, with an n value of 1.8 ± 0.2. Mutation increased the values of K0.5Na,EP in T774A, V920E, and E954A to 2.4-, 3.4-, and 1.8-fold, respectively (Table I, a) without significant change in the K0.5Na,EP in E953A. These mutant enzymes showed about a 20∼30% reduction in n value, a slight reduction of positive cooperativity for Na+.

https://openalex.org/W2038968573,"The binding interaction between the Nck2 SH2 domain and the phosphorylated ephrinB initiates a critical pathway for the reverse signaling network mediated by Eph receptor-ephrinB. Previously, the NMR structure and Tyr phosphorylations of the human ephrinB cytoplasmic domain have been studied. To obtain a complete story, it would be of significant interest to determine the structure of the Nck2 SH2 domain that shows a low sequence identity to other SH2 domains with known structures. Here, we report the determination of the solution structure of the human Nck2 SH2 domain and investigate its interactions with three phosphorylated ephrinB fragments by NMR spectroscopy. The results indicate that: 1) although the human Nck2 SH2 domain adopts a core tertiary fold common to all SH2 domains, it owns some unique properties such as a shorter C-terminal helix and unusual electrostatic potential surface. However, the most striking finding is that the C-terminal tail of the human Nck2 SH2 domain adopts a short antiparallel β-sheet that, to the best of our knowledge, has never been identified in other SH2 domains. The truncation study suggests that one function of the C-terminal tail is to control the folding/solubility of the SH2 domain. 2) In addition to [Tyr(P)304]ephrinB2301–322 and [Tyr(P)316]ephrinB2301–322, here we identified [Tyr(P)330]ephrinB2324–333 also capable of binding to the SH2 domain. The detailed NMR study indicated that the binding mechanisms for the three ephrinB fragments might be different. The binding with [Tyr(P)304]-ephrinB2301–322 and [Tyr(P)316]ephrinB2301–322 might be mostly involved in the residues over the N-half of the SH2 domain and provoked a significant increase in the backbone and side chain dynamics of the SH2 domain on the microsecond-millisecond time scale. In contrast, binding with [Tyr(P)330]ephrinB2324–333 might have most residues over both halves engaged but induced less profound conformational dynamics on the μs-ms time scale.

Signaling transduction pathways usually start with the transmembrane receptor proteins, and subsequently the signal is further transmitted into intracellular space via protein-protein interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors and downstream intracellular binding partners. The transmembrane Eph receptors, the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases containing 14 members, plays an essential role in the development of multicellular organisms by functioning at the interface between pattern development and morphogenesis, such as axon guidance, cell migration, segmentation, and angiogenesis (1Holder N.

So far eight mammalian ephrins have been identified, which can be divided into two structural and functional families, ephrinA and ephrinB. EphrinB and their Eph receptors are all membrane-anchored proteins and are unique in their ability to transmit signals bidirectionally, thus mediating contact-dependent cell-cell interactions for guidance and assembly of cells (1Holder N.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar).The cytoplasmic tail of the ephrinB proteins plays an integral role in mediating reverse signaling by interacting with intracellular protein binding partners (13Lu Q. Sun E.E. Klein R.S. Flanagan J.G. Cell. 2001; 105: 69-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In particular, the interaction between the cytoplasmic region of ephrinB and the SH2 1The abbreviation used is: SH2, Src homology domain 2.1The abbreviation used is: SH2, Src homology domain 2. domain of the Nck2 or Grb4 adapter protein initiates downstream signaling pathways regulating cytoskeleton assembly and remodeling (7Himanen J.P.

Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Nck adapter family consists of two members, namely Nck1 and Nck2 (15Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Tu Y. Li F. Wu C. Mol. Biol.

The human Nck2 is a 380-residue protein only comprised of three N-terminal SH3 and one C-terminal SH2 modular domains, thus called adapter proteins (15Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Chen M. She H. Kim A. Woodley D.T. Li W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7867-7880Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Nck adapter proteins serve as a pivotal point to connect the cellular surface receptors down to the multiple intracellular signaling networks in a “Tyr(P) → SH2/SH3 → effector” manner (17Li W. Fan J. Woodley D.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6403-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Nck SH2 domain binds to the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane receptors, whereas its SH3 domains recruit proline-rich effecter proteins to tyrosine-phosphorylated kinase or their substrates. It has been proposed that Nck proteins are extensively involved in organization of actin cytoskeleton, cell movement, or axon guidance (16Tu Y. Li F. Wu C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3367-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Li W. Fan J. Woodley D.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6403-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recently, we have determined the NMR structure of the ephrinB cytoplasmic subdomain, and showed that in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation, the 22-residue motif identified for binding with the Nck2 SH2 domain adopted a well packed β-hairpin structure with high conformational stability (19Song J. Vranken W. Xu P. Gingras R. Noyce R.S. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10942-10949Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Particularly, it has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of any of the three tyrosine residues in the 22-residue motif dramatically abolished its well packed β-hairpin structure and peptides with either Tyr304 or Tyr316 phosphorylated were able to bind to the human Nck2 SH2 domain (20Song J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).However, structural information about the other half of the ephrinB-Nck2 interaction story, namely the structure of the Nck2 SH2 domain, is still lacking. In particular, sequence alignment indicated that less than 40% identity was found between the Nck SH2 domains with other groups of SH2 domains (15Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21Campbell S.J. Jackson R.M. Protein Eng. 2003; 16: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the C-terminal residues that were usually considered not to be the core part of the SH2 domains have even lower sequence homology with other SH2 domains with the three-dimensional structure determined. To this end, it would be of significant interest to determine the structure of the Nck2 SH2 domain to gain deeper insight into its binding interactions with phosphorylated ephrinBs. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the three-dimensional structure of the human Nck2 SH2 domain, as well as to investigate its binding interactions with three phosphorylated ephrinB peptides by use of NMR spectroscopy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression of the Full-length and Truncated Human Nck2 SH2 Domains—The DNA fragment encoding the full-length SH2 domain corresponding to residues 283 to 380 of the human Nck2 protein was subcloned into a modified pET32a (Novagen) vector with S-tag and thioredoxin genes removed with BamHI and XhoI restriction sites by using two primers (forward) 5′-GGGGGATCCAGAGAGTGGTACTACGGG-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GGGCTCGAGTCACTGCAGGGCCCTGACG-3′. The truncated human Nck2 SH2 domain with C-terminal residues 367 to 380 deleted was subcloned into the same vector using the same restriction sites as above by replacing the reverse primer with 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGGTGAAGATGGGCGCCTT-3′. The DNA sequences of the constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing. The recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 20 °C. The full-length SH2 domain was found to be soluble after overexpression but the truncated one was all found in the inclusion body. Therefore, the full-length SH2 domain protein was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) under native conditions, whereas the truncated one was purified under the denaturing condition. Both the dialysis and fast dilution methods were used to refold the truncated SH2 domain. The preparation of the isotope-labeled full-length proteins followed similar procedures except for growing the cells in M9 medium with addition of (15NH4)2SO4 for 15N labeling and (15NH4)2SO4,[13C]glucose for 15N/13C double labeling, respectively (22Li M. Shi J. Wei Z. Teng F.Y. Tang B.L. Song J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The purified protein was immediately dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) in the presence of 5 mm dithiothreitol, and then concentrated for NMR experiments. The presence of the His tag with a sequence of MHHHHHHSSGLVPRGS significantly enhanced the solubility of the fusion protein, thus was not removed.NMR Experiments and Structure Modeling—Heteronuclear NMR experiments were performed as described previously (22Li M. Shi J. Wei Z. Teng F.Y. Tang B.L. Song J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3512-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog.

The NMR spectra acquired for both backbone and side chain assignments included 15N-edited HSQC-TOCSY, HSQC-NOESY, as well as triple-resonance experiments HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, (H)C-C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY. NOE restraints were derived from 15N- and 13C-NOESY spectra acquired both on 500 and 800 MHz spectrometers. NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11375) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (25Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond restraints were derived from examination of the HSQC-based hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiment.A set of manually assigned unambiguous NOE restraints together with dihedral angle restraints predicted by the TALOS program (26Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) based on five chemical shift values (15N, Cα, Cβ, CO, and Hα) was used to calculate initial structures of the human Nck2 SH2 domain by the CYANA program (27Guntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). With the availability of the initial structure, more NOE cross-peaks in the two NOESY spectra were automatically assigned by the CYANA program followed by manual confirmation. After many rounds of refinement, a final set of unambiguous NOEs, dihedral angles, and hydrogen bond restraints were utilized for structure calculations with a simulated annealing protocol implemented by the CNS program (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The 10 lowest-energy structures accepted by CNS protocol were selected for detailed analysis by use of the graphic software MolMol (31Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6468) Google Scholar). The NMR structures of the human Nck2 SH2 domain were deposited in the Protein Data Bank, with the PDB ID of 1Z3K.Binding with Three Phosphorylated EphrinB Fragments—In addition to the two phosphorylated ephrinB2 fragments, [Tyr(P)304]-ephrinB2301–322 and [Tyr(P)316]ephrinB2301–322 identified previously (20Song J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), here we found that the 10-residue C-terminal tail with Tyr330 phosphorylated (designated as [Tyr(P)330]ephrinB2324–333) was also able to bind to the human Nck2 SH2 domain.For characterization of the binding interactions between the SH2 domain and Tyr-phosphorylated ephrinB2 fragments, one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled SH2 domain were acquired at a protein concentration of ∼100 μm in the absence or presence of three phosphorylated ephrinB2 fragments at a molar ratio of ∼1:1.5 (SH2/peptide). The perturbed residues were assigned by superimposing the two HSQC spectra in the absence and presence of the peptides.RESULTSProtein Cloning and Expression of the Full-length and Truncated SH2 Domains—Previously, we failed to obtain a sample with a concentration high enough for three-dimensional NMR experiments because of the limited solubility of the human Nck2 SH2 domain prepared by thrombin cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (20Song J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, we cloned and expressed the His-tagged version of the SH2 domain whose solubility was largely enhanced, thus allowing the generation of protein samples with a concentration of ∼500 μm suitable for acquiring all NMR experiments for structure determination. In contrast, the truncated SH2 domain with the C-terminal last 14 residues deleted (Fig. 1) was totally insoluble and all accumulated in the inclusion body under different expression conditions. Refolding attempts by either dialysis or fast dilution all failed. This result indicated that although the 14-residue tail of the human Nck2 SH2 domain was usually considered not to be part of the SH2 core domain (15Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it did play a critical role in controlling the folding or solubility of the Nck2 SH2 domain.NMR Assignments and Secondary Structures—The human Nck2 SH2 domain consisted of 98 residues. Except for four residues Arg1, Gly6, Gln64, and Glu86, backbone assignments were successfully achieved for all other non-proline residues as shown in Fig. 1. Side chain carbon assignments were also completed except for the four above residues based on analyzing CCCONH and HCCH-TOCSY spectra. In total, around 90% of side chain protons were assigned. In particular, all hydrophobic residues including five Ala, eight Val, eight Leu, and three Ile residues were unambiguously assigned.Fig. 2b presents the difference between the Cα and Cβ conformational shifts of the human Nck2 SH2 domain, which was accepted as a good indication of the secondary structure patterns (32Song J. Chen Z. Xu P. Gingras R. Ng A. Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Ni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41205-41212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fig. 2c shows the NOE patterns to further define the protein secondary structures (33Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Based on these data, it appears that the major part of the protein shared the conserved secondary structure patterns common to all SH2 domains. However, a close examination suggested that the C-terminal tail unique for the Nck SH2 domain might adopt a two-stranded β-sheet. To confirm this, we conducted a detailed analysis of the NOE constraints over this region and identified characteristic NOEs to define an antiparallel sheet consisting of two β-strands: one over residues Phe83-Thr84-Ser85 and another over residues Glu89-Lys90-Leu91 (Fig. 3). Another interesting observation is that the secondary helix appeared to be shorter than those usually found in other SH2 domains.Fig. 2NMR assignments and data defining the secondary structures of the human Nck2 SH2 domain. a, The 1H-15N heteronuclear HSQC spectrum of the SH2 domain at pH 6.8 and 20 °C, with the sequential assignments labeled. b, the difference between the Cα and Cβ conformational shifts used for reflecting the secondary structure preference. c, the summary of the observed NOE constraints to define the secondary structure patterns of the SH2 domain.

Table I summaries the constraints used and structural statistics for the 10 lowest energy NMR structures accepted by CNS protocol, with distance violations less than 0.2 Å and dihedral angle violations less than 5°. Fig. 4 shows the stereoview of the superimposition of the 10 selected structures in the line (Fig. 4a) and ribbon modes (Fig. 4b). Globally, the Nck2 SH2 domain adopts a conserved tertiary architecture common to all SH2 domains. More specifically, the Nck2 SH2 domain has a core β-sheet composed of three long β-strands over residues 26–30, 37–43, and 48–56 followed by a short antiparallel β-sheet over residues 59–62 and 65–68. This central β-sheet was sandwiched by two helices: the N-terminal one over residues 12–17 and the C-terminal one over residues 73–76. It is very striking to note that the C-terminal region does adopt a short antiparallel β-sheet consisting of two strands over residues 83–85 and 89–91, respectively. Usually this C-terminal region with a very low sequence homology among different SH2 domain groups was considered not to be the core part of the common SH2 fold (15Braverman L.E. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5542-5549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and was demonstrated to adopt very diverse secondary structures: some formed one short β-strand packed to the core β-sheet while the other had no regular secondary structures. The short antiparallel β-sheet observed for the Nck2 SH2 domain was unambiguously defined by the characteristic NOEs shown in Fig. 3, as well as many other long-range side chain NOEs between the residues on the two β-strands. In addition, this short β-sheet was found to pack to the core β-sheet as evident by many long-range NOEs. It seems that a hydrophobic cluster was formed between this short β-sheet and the core β-sheet by hydrophobic residues Leu93, Val94, and Ala96 on the short β-sheet side and several hydrophobic residues on the rest of the protein. For example, Leu93 had extensive NOEs with Phe26, Ile28, Val40, Leu42, Ile62, Phe73, Val74, and Ile82. Ala96 had NOEs with Leu27 plus the N-terminal aromatic residues Trp3 and Tyr4. Therefore structurally the C-terminal short β-sheet served to cap the hydrophobic surface of the core β-sheet and its absence would make the large hydrophobic core exposed, thus resulting in complete insolubility as observed for the truncated Nck2 SH2 domain with the C-terminal 14 residues deleted.Table INMR constraints and structural statistics for the 10 lowest-energy structures of the human Nck2 SH2 domainRestraints for structure calculationTotal NOE restraints1348Intraresidue663Sequential285Medium range121Long range279Hydrogen bond restraints36Dihedral angel constraints114Final energies (kcal mol–1)E (total)409.4 ± 25.8E (bond)16.4 ± 1.4E (angle)111.4 ± 7.7E (improper)18.1 ± 2.4E (van der Waals)152.3 ± 10.5E (NOE)103.8 ± 13.6Root mean square deviations from idealized geometryBond (Å)0.003 ± 0.0002Angle (degree)0.513 ± 0.0174Improper (degree)0.380 ± 0.0244NOE (Å)0.037 ± 0.0025Ramachandran statistics (%)Most favored67.2 ± 3.0%Additionally allowed24.0 ± 3.7%Generously allowed5.8 ± 2.7%Disallowed3.0 ± 1.2%Root mean square deviation from the lowest-energy structure (Å)All atoms (secondary structure region)1.56Heavy atoms (secondary structure region)1.37Backbone atoms (secondary structure region)0.72 Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Three-dimensional structure of the human Nck2 SH2 domain determined by NMR spectroscopy. a, stereoview of the superimposition of the 10 lowest-energy structures in the line mode; b, in the ribbon mode.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The properties of the electrostatic potential surface play a crucial role in controlling affinity and specificity of protein-protein interactions. We thus examined the electrostatic potential surfaces of many SH2 domains and it appears that the Nck2 SH2 domain had a potential surface very different from others (figures not shown). Fig. 5 presents the ribbon structure and potential surface of the human Nck2 SH2 domain together with those of two representative SH2 domains, namely Abl (34Overduin M. Rios C.B. Mayer B.J.

Cell. 1993; 72: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) SH2 domains, with the ligand binding surfaces all facing outside. It can be seen clearly that N-half positively charged pockets for binding to phosphotyrosine are well conserved in all three SH2 domains but it is much larger in the human Nck2 SH2 domain. It is especially interesting to note that the Nck2 SH2 domain also has a large positively charged surface over the C-terminal half of the ligand-binding interface that was proposed to be critical for modulating binding specificity (21Campbell S.J.

Vranken W. Xu P. Gingras R. Noyce R.S. Yu Z. Shen S.H. Ni F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10942-10949Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was previously reported that the binding region between the ephrinB cytoplasmic domain and the Nck2 SH2 domain was located over the β-hairpin 22-residue region containing the first three tyrosine residues (14Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In this regard, the 22-residue ephrinB peptides with either of three tyrosine residues phosphorylated were previously investigated and the results led to the identification of two peptides, [Tyr(P)304]ephrinB2301–322 and [Tyr(P)316]ephrinB2301–322, capable of binding to the human Nck2 SH2 domain prepared by the thrombin cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (20Song J.
