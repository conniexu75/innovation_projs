https://openalex.org/W2094548638,"IT was recently demonstrated that thiosulphate esters rapidly react with protein sulphydryl groups to give mixed disulphides1. As Eldjarn and Pihl2 have attributed the protective properties against radiation of certain sulphur compounds (for example, cysteamine, cystamine) to their ability to form mixed disulphides with active sulphydryl or disulphide groups in the cell, the possibility was considered that thiosulphate esters may be active protectors against ionizing radiation."

https://openalex.org/W1981349530,"MUCH experimental work has been done on the causes of legume bloat in cattle and the prevention of its occurrence in the field (for reviews see Johns1). Several substances have been isolated from the feed or the animals' saliva, and have been reported to be responsible for the foam in the rumen of a bloated cow; but it has not been shown that any of these substances occur in the foam found in the rumen, and no attempt has been made to isolate the surface-active compound responsible for the foam directly from the rumen contents of a cow grazing clover or lucerne."

Antibodies have been shown to be transferred to the calf, during the first 24 hr., in the colostrum, and this has been shown to be associated with a parallel rise in serum γ-globulin from around 2 per cent of the total serum proteins to 30 per cent, the level found in the adult cow2."
https://openalex.org/W2049749582,"RECENT studies in this Laboratory have indicated1,2 that a principal reaction in the radiolysis of aqueous solutions of protein under certain conditions involves cleavage of the peptide chain to form the carbonyl and amide functions as represented by the reaction: Evidence for this type of radiation-induced oxidation has been derived largely from studies of carbonyl production in oxygenated solutions of pepsin and gelatin. The carbonyl function is found to be associated with high molecular weight (non-dialysable) products which on conventional acid hydrolysis yield a series of α-keto acids. A correlation of these results in terms of a detailed mechanism for reaction (1) has been given elsewhere2."

https://openalex.org/W2048323004,"IT has been reported that morphine is a potent stimulus to the anterior pituitary–adrenal cortical system, as judged by indirect index such as depletion of adrenal ascorbic acid in rats1–3. However, little is known quantitatively of adrenal corticosteroid secretion in response to morphine. In the present investigation, experiments were carried out to evaluate directly the effect of morphine upon the secretion-rate of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids in dogs."

https://openalex.org/W2008864250,"THE electron microscope can be used to investigate the morphological features of a specimen right down to the molecular level, but there is as yet no way of identifying the chemical nature of the substances seen, except on the rare occasions when these happen to be crystalline. In a specimen of uniform thickness, a region of high electron opacity may, in general, be said to be one containing substances of a greater weight density than those of the surrounding less opaque region1, but this gives little help in deciding on their chemical composition. The lack of any direct way of knowing what substances one is looking at is perhaps the most serious shortcoming of electron microscopy."

https://openalex.org/W2010026269,"THE determination of cardiac output by the dye dilution techniques requires the taking of serial arterial blood samples at short regular intervals. Direct puncture of the brachial artery of cattle1 enables such samples to be collected. T.1824 (Evans blue) was injected into the jugular vein of the subjects at a dose of approximately 0.40 mgm./kgm. body-weight and arterial blood samples collected at 1-sec. intervals for a period of 30 sec. Adopting the procedure described by Hamilton et al. 2 the average concentration of the dye in the arterial blood samples was found, together with the time required for one circulation of the dye and the cardiac output calculated from the formula:"

https://openalex.org/W2008495363,"THE recent publication of a communication on the preparation of caeruloplasmin1, the main cuproprotein of plasma, prompts this brief account of a method of its preparation from the precipitate G2, the mixture of α- and β-globulins obtained in the plasma fractionation scheme of Kekwick and Mackay2. With G2 from batches of plasma of 40–150 l., the following stages were used: (1) Extraction of G2 by 0.07 M sodium chloride at pH7 and denaturation of extracted lipoprotein with ether below − 25° C. by the McFarlane technique3; (2) precipitation of caeruloplasmin from the ether-saturated extract at pH 4.8; (3) solution of the precipitate in ether-saturated 0.1 M sodium chloride, removal of impurities by precipitation at pH 5.35 and a second McFarlane treatment; (4) reprecipitation of caeruloplasmin at pH 4.8 as in (2) and solution in 0.1 M sodium chloride; (5) precipitation of impurities at pH 4.8 by diluting to 0.02 M sodium chloride and precipitation of caeruloplasmin by further dilution to 0.0045 M sodium chloride. The product was dissolved in 0.l M sodium chloride. E

This technique, or minor variations of it, has been used extensively to identify the number of nucleoli in primitive normal or pathological leucocytes. There is a perinucleolar concentration of nuclear protein, but the nucleoli themselves are free of deoxyribonucleic acid."
