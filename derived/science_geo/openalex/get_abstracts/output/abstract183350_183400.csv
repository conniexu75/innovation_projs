https://openalex.org/W1966700487,"We have observed coherent time evolution between two quantum states of a superconducting flux qubit comprising three Josephson junctions in a loop. The superposition of the two states carrying opposite macroscopic persistent currents is manipulated by resonant microwave pulses. Readout by means of switching-event measurement with an attached superconducting quantum interference device revealed quantum-state oscillations with high fidelity. Under strong microwave driving, it was possible to induce hundreds of coherent oscillations. Pulsed operations on this first sample yielded a relaxation time of 900 nanoseconds and a free-induction dephasing time of 20 nanoseconds. These results are promising for future solid-state quantum computing."

Such a transient species has now been obtained from a synthetic complex with a nonheme macrocyclic ligand and characterized spectroscopically. Its high-resolution crystal structure reveals an iron-oxygen bond length of 1.646(3) angstroms, demonstrating that a terminal iron(IV)=oxo unit can exist in a nonporphyrin ligand environment and lending credence to proposed mechanisms of nonheme iron catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2027209056,"Cell contact is required for efficient transmission of human T cell leukemia virus- type 1 (HTLV-I) between cells and between individuals, because naturally infected lymphocytes produce virtually no cell-free infectious HTLV-I particles. However, the mechanism of cell-to-cell spread of HTLV-I is not understood. We show here that cell contact rapidly induces polarization of the cytoskeleton of the infected cell to the cell-cell junction. HTLV-I core (Gag protein) complexes and the HTLV-I genome accumulate at the cell-cell junction and are then transferred to the uninfected cell. Other lymphotropic viruses, such as HIV-1, may similarly subvert normal T cell physiology to allow efficient propagation between cells."

Although computational and spectroscopic results have suggested side-on binding, only end-on binding of oxygen to iron has been observed in crystal structures. We have determined structures of naphthalene dioxygenase that show a molecular oxygen species bound to the mononuclear iron in a side-on fashion. In a complex with substrate and dioxygen, the dioxygen molecule is lined up for an attack on the double bond of the aromatic substrate. The structures reported here provide the basis for a reaction mechanism and for the high stereospecificity of the reaction catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase."

In solution, α-synuclein is natively unstructured but assumes an α-helical conformation upon binding to phospholipid membranes. We now show that this conformation of α-synuclein consists of two α-helical regions that are interrupted by a short break. The structural organization of the α-helices of α-synuclein was not anticipated by sequence analyses and may be important for its pathogenic role. α-Synuclein is a small cytosolic protein of presynaptic nerve terminals composed of seven 11-residue repeats and a hydrophilic tail. α-Synuclein misfolding and dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and neurodegenerative dementias, but its normal folding and function are unknown.

Two independent mutations in human α-synuclein cause familial Parkinson's disease, and wild type α-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies found in Parkinson's disease and in several forms of neurodegenerative dementia. However, independent of its role in neurodegenerative diseases, α-synuclein is an interesting protein in its own right. It is an abundant presynaptic protein that may regulate neurotransmitter release and may contribute to synaptic plasticity (4George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 759-764PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of all synucleins are similar, although only α-synuclein is implicated in disease. Synucleins are composed of six copies (β-synuclein) or seven copies (all other synucleins) of an unusual 11-residue imperfect repeat, followed by a variable short hydrophilic tail. Synucleins are soluble, natively unfolded proteins that avidly bind to negatively charged phospholipid membranes and become α-helical upon binding (10Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Although secondary structure predictions indicate that the synuclein repeats could form an amphipathic structure consistent with lipid binding, the α-helical conformation is puzzling because the synuclein repeats are punctuated by central glycine residues. Furthermore, in Lewy bodies α-synuclein is thought to be in a β-strand aggregate, but aggregation of α-synuclein into dimers and multimers is promoted by lipid environments that induce an α-helical conformation (11Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 12Lee H.J. Choi C. Lee S.J. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have examined the conformation of α-synuclein in lipidic environments to understand the relation of its sequence to its physicochemical properties and to map a potential pathway of misfolding in neurodegenerative disease. Recombinant α-synuclein was expressed in bacteria as GST-fusion proteins with a TEV protease recognition sequence preceding the N-terminal methionine and cleaved with TEV protease (Invitrogen), resulting in a single additional glycine residue at the N terminus. After TEV cleavage, α-synuclein was isolated as the only heat-stable component upon boiling for 15 min, purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences), and dialyzed against the appropriate experimental buffers. N15 and C13/N15double-labeled α-synuclein were prepared similarly from bacteria grown in minimal M9 media supplemented with N15NH4Cl and C13D-Glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Antibodies were raised in rabbits against a peptide corresponding to amino acid 2–24 of human α-synuclein (CDVFMKGLSKAKEGVVAAAEKTKQG) that was coupled via its N-terminal cysteine to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and against recombinant α-synuclein expressed in bacteria. α-Synuclein (13.8 μm) was incubated for the indicated times at room temperature in the presence of SUVs1 (280 molar excess; composition: 30% phosphatidylserine/70% phosphatidylcholine or 100% phosphatidylcholine) or SDS (1 mm) in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 0.2% (SUVs) or 2% (SDS) trypsin (Sigma). Digestion products were separated on 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels (14Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 66: 368-379Crossref Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting. NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on Varian INOVA500 or INOVA600 NMR spectrometers. All NMR experiments were performed with pulsed-field gradient enhanced pulse sequences (15Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 16Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) using H2O/D2O 95:5 as the solvent. Sample conditions for 1H-15N HSQC spectra are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Backbone assignments were obtained from three-dimensional1H-15N NOESY-HSQC, TOCSY-HSQC, HNCO, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments acquired on a 0.3 mmsample of α-synuclein dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, plus 50 mm SDS. The 3D1H-15N NOESY-HSQC data were also used to analyze secondary structure NOE patterns and search for long-range NOEs. SUVs of 100% brain phosphatidylcholine or 30% brain phosphatidylserine, 70% brain phosphatidylcholine (all from Avanti Polar Lipids) were made and quantified as described (17Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). SUVs were confirmed to be unilamellar by electron microscopy. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed using standard procedures. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C in a Jasco Model J-720 instrument upgraded to J-715U and equipped with a 6-position peltier cuvette holder. Recordings were made using Hellma Quartz cuvettes (path length 0.1 cm). Spectra were averaged from 10–50 scans of 0.2 nm steps at a rate of 50 nm/min. Edman degradation was carried out using standard procedures. Upon addition of SUVs containing 30% phosphatidylserine and 70% phosphatidylcholine, the CD spectrum of purified α-synuclein shifts from a characteristic random coil pattern with a 195 nm minimum to a typical α-helical pattern with 206 and 222 nm minima (Fig.1A) (10Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Thus phosphatidylserine-containing SUVs induce α-synuclein folding (“folding” as used here refers to the adoption of a secondary, but not necessarily tertiary structure). SUVs composed only of phosphatidylcholine caused little change (data not shown). To determine how many lipids are required for α-synuclein folding, we titrated α-synuclein with increasing amounts of SUVs with a precisely known phospholipid content that were confirmed by electron microscopy to be unilammellar. A progressive increase in α-synuclein folding was observed, with apparent saturation of folding at a molar lipid/protein ratio of ∼270–300:1 (Fig. 1B). Taking into account that SUVs are composed of phospholipid bilayers, this ratio indicates that binding of each synuclein molecule requires ∼140–150 phospholipid molecules. To examine the conformation of folded α-synuclein, it is necessary to achieve folding in solution. Therefore we used CD spectroscopy to examine a series of detergents for their ability to support α-synuclein folding. Most detergents tested (Nonidet P-40,n-octylglycoside, Thesit, Tween 20, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and taurocholic acid) did not induce folding (data not shown). Only lysosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidic acid (but not lysophosphatidylcholine), and SDS elicited the same CD change in α-synuclein as acidic SUVs (Fig.2A and data not shown). Because complexes of α-synuclein with SDS would be particularly useful in characterizing its structure, we tested whether small phospholipid vesicles and SDS induced similar folded states of α-synuclein. Titration of α-synuclein with increasing concentrations of SDS revealed that SDS promotes folding below its critical micellar concentration (7–10 mm), with complete folding at 1 mm SDS for 13.8 μm α-synuclein (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that ∼70 SDS molecules are required per α-synuclein molecule for complete folding, a number that approximates the aggregation number for SDS (i.e. the number of SDS molecules per micelle) (18Budavari S. The Merck Index: An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs and Biologicals. 12th Ed. Whitehouse Station, NJ1996: 8782Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that α-synuclein drives the formation of SDS micelles and folds, as in the case of SUVs, on the surface of the micelles. Limited tryptic digestion of α-synuclein revealed that in the presence of saturating concentrations of SUVs containing phosphatidylserine, α-synuclein was partly protected from proteolysis, whereas SUVs lacking phosphatidylserine had no effect (Fig. 3). Similarly, when we added 1 mm SDS, we also observed partial protection from proteolysis, although the precise pattern of protected fragments was different, presumably because SDS affected the digestion. Immunoblotting with site-specific antibodies showed that the protected fragments (∼6 kDa, ∼4 kDa) under both conditions were derived from the N-terminal region of α-synuclein (Fig. 3). We were unable to ascertain the mass of these fragments by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight experiments due to lipidic contaminants, but analysis by Edman degradation confirmed that the 4–6 kDa fragments correspond to the N terminus of α-synuclein. Judging from their size, we surmised that one of the cleavage sites is probably at lysines 43 or 45. In support of this conclusion, tryptic digestion of mutant α-synuclein that lacks these lysines did not produce 4–6 kDa protected fragments (data not shown). To compare unfolded and folded α-synuclein, we acquired 1H-15N HSQC spectra of α-synuclein alone, or of α-synuclein in the presence of either SUVs (30% brain phosphatidylserine/70% phosphatidylcholine) or SDS (Fig. 4). The1H-15N HSQC spectrum of α-synuclein alone exhibited a dense cluster of cross-peaks over a narrow range, confirming that the protein is unfolded as described previously (19Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The number of visible peaks (∼50) was less than expected (135), possibly because of aggregation or of fast chemical exchange between amide groups and the solvent. After addition of saturating concentrations of SUVs, many but not all of the α-synuclein cross-peaks disappeared. This loss of cross-peaks presumably occurred because the large size of the SUVs effectively broadened the resonances of the corresponding amide groups of α-synuclein beyond detection. The positions of α-synuclein cross-peaks that remained after binding to SUVs were unchanged from the spectrum of α-synuclein alone (Fig.4B), showing that these cross-peaks represent amino acids that do not bind lipids and continue to be unfolded and mobile in the presence of SUVs. Consistent with previous results (19Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), we observed 36 such amino acids that account for a quarter of the total sequence. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of α-synuclein obtained at saturating concentrations of SDS exhibited an increased dispersion compared with that of isolated α-synuclein (Fig.4C). This result is consistent with the formation of α-helical structure upon micelle binding revealed by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The number of visible cross-peaks also increased in SDS, most likely because SDS disrupts aggregation and/or because the formation of the α-helical conformation protected the amide groups from exchange with the solvent. Interestingly, the strongest cross-peaks observed in the presence of SDS were generally in the same positions as the cross-peaks that remained in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of α-synuclein bound to SUVs (Fig. 4D). Thus these cross-peaks correspond to unfolded residues that do not participate in binding to SDS micelles or to SUVs, supporting the notion that the binding modes and folding of α-synuclein in both environments are analogous. To study the structure of α-synuclein bound to SDS, we assigned its backbone signals using triple resonance and three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC experiments (Fig. 5). Although a complete analysis of short range NOEs that are diagnostic for different types of secondary structure was made difficult by the strong resonance overlap observed, numerous NOEs could be assigned unambiguously. These include multiple NOEs that are characteristic of α-helical structure, particularly dNN(i,i+1) and dαN(i,i+3) NOEs, and are illustrated in sample strips from a three-dimensional1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum in Fig.6. All dNN(i,i+1) and dαN(i,i+3) NOEs that could be assigned are summarized in Fig. 7 with black boxes and solid lines, respectively, whereas open boxes and dashed lines indicate dNN(i,i+1) and dαN(i,i+3) NOEs that could not be assessed because of resonance overlap. Note that dNN(i,i+1)/dαN(i,i+1) intensity ratios, rather than absolute dNN(i,i+1) intensities, are represented in Fig. 7 to account for differences in resonance line widths. Only a few dαN(i,i+2) and dαN(i,i+4) NOEs could be assigned unambiguously due to the resonance overlap and the limited sensitivity of the data obtained under the conditions of these experiments (data not shown).Figure 6Composite of (F1, F3) strips of a three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum of SDS-bound α-synuclein illustrating the NOEpatterns observed for residues 36–56.Solid linesconnect diagonal peaks with dNN(i,i+1) NOEs as well as intraresidue dαN(i,i) NOEs with dαN(i,i+3) connectivities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Secondary structure of α-synuclein bound to SDS micelles. The primary sequence of α-synuclein is shown on top, and amide protection data and diagnostic NOE patterns are summarizedbelow the sequence. Amide protection was assessed from the intensities of exchange cross-peaks with the solvent in three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC spectra. The intensities were classified in three categories (weak, intermediate, and strong). Amide groups were considered protected from exchange if no cross-peak or a weak cross-peak with the solvent was observed (closed circles), whereas an intermediate exchange cross-peak intensity indicated partial protection (open circles). Question marks indicate amide groups whose protection could not be assessed due to resonance overlap.Solid boxes indicate the observation of dNN(i,i+1) NOEs.

Interestingly, a noticeable break in the helical pattern was observed around residues 43 and 44, revealing an interruption of the helical structure in this region. This break in the helix was also apparent from analysis of the deviations of the observed Cα chemical shifts from random coil values (Fig.8A). Significant positive deviations, which are characteristic of helical structure, were found for most of the N-terminal 98 residues, but the Cα chemical shifts of residues 43 and 44 were close to random coil values. The abundance of glycines in synuclein made analysis of Hα chemical shift deviations from random coil values difficult because the presence of two Hα protons in each glycine introduces uncertainty in the corresponding deviations. However, these data also illustrated the break in the helix (Fig. 8B). This conclusion is based on the negative deviations characteristic of helical structure that are observed for most of the 100 N-terminal residues, whereas residues 43–45 exhibit slightly positive deviations. In the sequences spanning residues 30–42, 60–65, and 82–100, a few Hα deviations are close to zero, and the Cα deviations are relatively small compared with other parts of the molecule, suggesting that there is helix fraying in these residues. However, the Cα deviations are still around 2 ppm or larger, and these sequences exhibit abundant dNN(i,i+1) and dαN(i,i+3) NOE patterns. Thus, these sequences adopt predominantly α-helical conformations that may be partially destabilized by the presence of residues with low helical propensity such as glycines and threonines. The lack of sequential dNN(i,i+1) and short-range NOEs in the 40 C-terminal residues (Fig. 7) clearly shows that this region of the molecule is largely unstructured. This conclusion is further supported by the observation of sharper resonances in this region than in the rest of the molecule (illustrated by the1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks; Fig. 4D) and by the small Cα and Hα deviations from random coil chemical shifts (Fig. 8; note that some significant deviations from random coil values may be favored by the abundance of prolines in this region). Extensive analysis of NOESY data did not uncover long-range NOEs indicative of tertiary structure, suggesting that the two α-helices do not interact with each other and are formed only at the protein/micelle interface. This conclusion agrees with the moderate chemical shift dispersion observed in SDS-bound α-synuclein, which indicates the presence of a defined secondary structure but is lower than the dispersion usually observed in globular proteins. Deuterium exchange experiments monitored at pH 6.5 by1H-15N HSQC spectra further reinforced the conclusion that SDS-bound α-synuclein does not have a tertiary structure because all amide groups were largely exchanged with the solvent within the time scale of the first spectrum (30 min; data not shown). To assess the secondary structure of α-synuclein by an independent approach, we examined the accessibility of each amino acid of α-synuclein to solvent by measuring their exchange cross-peaks with water using three-dimensional 15N NOESY-HSQC and TOCSY-HSQC spectra (summarized in Fig. 7). The intensity of the exchange cross-peaks directly reflects the exposure of the respective amino acid to solvent. We observed strong exchange cross-peaks, which are indicative of a lack of amide protection for the unstructured C-terminal residues consistent with the non-structured nature of the corresponding sequence (see above). Furthermore, exchange cross-peaks were weak or absent for much of the residues in the helical regions as expected. In the region around residues 43–44, however, exchange cross-peaks with intermediate intensity were observed, which confirms the helical break in this region. Overall, the NMR data yield a picture whereby the 100 N-terminal residues of α-synuclein bound to SDS do not form a globular structure but adopt an α-helical conformation with a break in the middle. The discovery of two α-helices in the folded conformation of α-synuclein was unanticipated as secondary structure calculations performed for example with the Expasy program suite (us.expasy.org) predict a mixture of α-helices, random coils, and β-strand. However, the NMR results correlate with the partial proteolysis experiments described above, which uncovered N-terminal protected 4 and 6 kDa bands that correspond to the first α-helix (Fig. 3). The observation of this proteolysis pattern in α-synuclein bound to both SUVs and SDS argues that their conformations are analogous. At non-saturating concentrations of SUVs or SDS, CD spectra of α-synuclein exhibited intermediate molar ellipticities (Fig. 1). Under these conditions, either only a subset of α-synuclein molecules was fully folded or a defined region of all synuclein molecules, such as part of an α-helix, was folded before the other regions. The first model implies that binding of both helical regions is a cooperative all-or-none process, whereas the second model would involve intermediate states containing partial helices. To distinguish between these possibilities, we acquired an 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 0.1 mm synuclein at an intermediate SDS concentration (2.8 mm). If partially helical intermediates exist under these conditions, sharp cross-peaks in the positions corresponding to the unbound protein would be expected for the regions that remain unstructured. However, all of the cross-peaks corresponding to the two α-helices that could be identified were substantially broadened, and their positions were close to those observed for fully SDS-bound synuclein (data not shown). These results suggest that under these conditions, synuclein is in an equilibrium between free and fully bound states, although we cannot completely discard the possibility that the bound states are somewhat different from those existing at saturating SDS concentrations. We have shown that SUVs containing phosphatidylserine and SDS induce folding of α-synuclein in a concentration-dependent manner, with saturation at ∼140 phospholipid or 70 SDS molecules per α-synuclein molecule. In folded α-synuclein, the N-terminal 98 residues are structured, whereas the C-terminal 42 residues retain a random coil configuration. The structured part of α-synuclein forms two distinct α-helices that are interrupted by a two-residue break. Folding appears to be cooperative, without a stable intermediate at non-saturating concentrations of SDS or SUVs. In the folded state, no long-range interactions between α-synuclein residues were observed, suggesting that there is no tertiary structure and that all of the folded residues are directly or indirectly engaged in lipid binding. The presence of two α-helices in α-synuclein and the position of the break were unexpected. α-Synuclein is composed of seven imperfect repeats composed of 11 residues. These repeats are interrupted after the fourth repeat by a four-residue insertion. The break between the two α-helices occurs in the first half of the fourth repeat, whereas the four-residue inserted sequence is α-helical. Furthermore, the break between the two α-helices consists of only two instead of four residues (Fig. 9A). Thus the break is not caused by the four-residue insertion between repeats; rather, the four-residue insertion serves to maintain the helical structure. When the two α-helices of α-synuclein are analyzed on a helical net, an amphipathic distribution of residues emerges, which explains the avid binding to negatively charged phospholipids (Fig.9B). However, when the sequence of α-synuclein is modeled into a single α-helix without a break, the orientation of the hydrophobic surface shifts along the α-helix, suggesting that the break between the two helices may allow a more favorable binding of hydrophobic surfaces to the hydrophobic interior of the micelle/membrane. Binding is likely to be stabilized by ionic interactions between positive charged α-synuclein residues and negatively charged phospholipid headgroups because no α-helicity was observed with either membranes or detergents that do not contain negative surface charges. An alternative explanation for the break is that it may facilitate binding of α-synuclein to small vesicles with a high curvature such as synaptic vesicles. If uninterrupted, the α-helix of synuclein would measure 14 nm, which may be too long to coat a highly curved surface. Our results suggest that α-synuclein may function as a surface-active coat of phospholipid membranes in the presynaptic nerve terminal, possibly of synaptic vesicles (20Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S.

Indeed, tryptic digestion of α-synuclein in the presence of synaptic vesicles resulted in protection of N-terminal fragments similar to those seen with phosphatidylserine-containing SUVs (data not shown), indicating that α-synuclein binds to and folds on synaptic vesicles. Alignment of the four human synucleins shows that other synucleins probably adopt a similar secondary structure as α-synuclein (Fig. 9A). The sequences of the two α-helices and of the break are well conserved, whereas the non-folded C termini are not. However, α-synuclein is unique among synucleins because it has a longer second α-helix than β-synuclein, and a more hydrophobic surface than γ-synuclein or synoretin (Fig. 9A). These differences may explain the selective propensity of α-synuclein to aggregate in neurodegenerative diseases. Several recent studies (11Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

https://openalex.org/W2025919881,"Blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging uses alterations in brain hemodynamics to infer changes in neural activity. Are these hemodynamic changes regulated at a spatial scale capable of resolving functional columns within the cerebral cortex? To address this question, we made simultaneous measurements of tissue oxygenation and single-cell neural activity within the visual cortex. Results showed that increases in neuronal spike rate were accompanied by immediate decreases in tissue oxygenation. We used this decrease in tissue oxygenation to predict the orientation selectivity and ocular dominance of neighboring neurons. Our results establish a coupling between neural activity and oxidative metabolism and suggest that high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging may be used to localize neural activity at a columnar level."
https://openalex.org/W2081329333,"Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are a family of heterodimeric transcriptional regulators that play pivotal roles in the regulation of cellular utilization of oxygen and glucose and are essential transcriptional regulators of angiogenesis in solid tumor and ischemic disorders. The transactivation activity of HIF complexes requires the recruitment of p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) by HIF-1α and HIF-2α that undergo oxygen-dependent degradation. HIF activation in tumors is caused by several factors including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Here we investigated the molecular basis for HIF activation by MAPK. We show that MAPK is required for the transactivation activity of HIF-1α. Furthermore, inhibition of MAPK disrupts the HIF-p300 interaction and suppresses the transactivation activity of p300. Overexpression of MEK1, an upstream MAPK activator, stimulates the transactivation of both p300 and HIF-1α. Interestingly, the C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1α is not a direct substrate of MAPK, and HIF-1α phosphorylation is not required for HIF-CAD/p300 interaction. Taken together, our data suggest that MAPK signaling facilitates HIF activation through p300/CBP.

In addition to HIF-α stabilization, HIF-α activity is regulated by the functional stimulation of its transactivation domains, NAD and CAD, which are separated by a negative regulatory region (6Jiang B.H.

In addition to hypoxia, multiple oncogenic pathways including growth factor signaling or genetic loss of tumor suppressor genes, likeVHL and PTEN, up-regulate HIF activity (28Zundel W. Schindler C.

Particularly, ERK1/2 (also known as p44/p42), two kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, have been implicated in HIF activation (30Salceda S. Beck I. Srinivas V. Caro J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 556-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Conrad P.W. Freeman T.L. Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol.

ERK1/2 are activated by extracellular proliferative signaling triggered by membrane-tyrosine kinases and transduced through the Ras-Raf-MEK pathway by a cascade of phosphorylation events that can be repressed by specific kinase inhibitors (33Guan K.L. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 are serine/threonine kinases that regulate gene expression by phosphorylating nuclear substrates (33Guan K.L. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Enhanced MAPK signaling is a common event in tumors, and constitutively active MAPK signaling transforms mammalian cells (34Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Therefore, up-regulation of HIF activity by MAPK signaling may play an essential role in transformation as well as, in the process of tumor growth and metastasis that depends on angiogenesis and changes in glucose metabolism (35Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7153) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the molecular basis by which MAPK signaling influences HIF activity. Our data indicate that MAPK signaling may affect HIF activity by promoting the formation of the HIF-p300/CBP complex and by modulating the transactivation activity of p300/CBP. Plasmids expressing G4.H1α530–826, G4.H1α530–778, G4.H1α744–826, and G4.H1α786–826 were described previously (24Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 9: 2984-2992Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). pFR-Luc is a luciferase reporter vector in which the luciferase gene is under the control of a minimal E1B promoter and upstream four copies of GAL4 binding sites (Clontech). pCMV-β-p300, pRSV-β-CBP, pCMV-G4.p300, pCMV.β-gal, and pSV.β-gal were generous gifts from Dr. Antonio Giordano (Temple University). pRL-CMV was obtained fromPromega (Madison, WI). pGEX.H1α530–826, pGEX.H1α530–658, and pGEX.H1α744–826 were constructed by inserting corresponding PCR fragments into the EcoRI site of pGEX4T (Amersham Biosciences). pGEX.H1α757–826 was kindly provided by Dr. Gregg Semenza (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (25Mahon P.C.

PD98059 (PDx) was purchased from BioMol(Plymouth, PA). Dimethyoxalylglycine (DOG) was provided by Dr. Peter Ratcliffe (Oxford University) (12Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J.

Genistein, Dfx, and PDx were first dissolved in Me2SO and used at the final concentration as indicated in each experiment. The establishment of the B1 cell line was described previously (5Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained at a 37 °C humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. B1 cells and parental Hep3B cells were cultured in minimal essential medium, whereas HeLa cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). Transient transfection was performed with LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen) by following the low serum protocol provided by the manufacturer. The amount of DNA used in transfection is described in each experiment. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, pooled, and equally divided into 12-well plates for luciferase assays or into 60-mm dishes for Western blot analysis. When needed, 0.5 μg of plasmid expressing β-galactosidase were co-transfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. Cells were flushed with a gas mixture of 0.47% O2, 5% CO2, and balanced N2in a sealed chamber as previously described (5Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in some experiments, cells were incubated directly in a hypoxia work station (IN VIVO2) at the O2 tension specified in each experiment. All cell extracts were prepared and analyzed using the luciferase assay system purchased from Promega(Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's procedure. Luminescence was measured in a TD20/20 Luminometer (Promega), and the results were expressed as relative light units. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad method. β-Galactosidase assays were performed for normalization reasons with the β-galactosidase assay system fromPromega. Plasmids expressing the indicated GST fusion proteins were transformed into BL21-competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Promega) to 0.1 mm. The procedures used to perform purification andin vitro pull-down assays were in general the same as described previously (37Sang N. Giordano A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton 100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mix, pH 7.5). GST and fusion proteins were first incubated with 3% milk in lysis buffer, washed with lysis buffer, and then incubated with cell lysates for 1 h on a roller at 4 °C, followed by three washes with lysis buffer. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described by Pei with minor modifications (38Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31191-31198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST, GST fusion proteins, and commercially obtained myelin basic protein (Sigma) were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with activated recombinant MAPK (BioMol) in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) in MAPK buffer (25 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and by heating at 95 °C for 3 min. After separation through a 4–20% continuous gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R250 (Sigma), destained, and dried before autoradiography. Monoclonal antibody against HIF-1α (catalog no. 610959) and anti-p300 monoclonal antibody (NM11) were purchased from Pharmingen. Monoclonal anti-GAL4 DNA binding domain antibody was purchased from Clontech (catalog no. 5399-1). Purified polyclonal antibodies against tyrosine-phosphorylated and total MAPK and horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody were purchased from Promega. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG (Fc fragment) was purchased from Sigma. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously with minor modifications (37Sang N. Giordano A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39Sang N. Avantaggiati M.L. Giordano A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 1× lysis buffer supplemented with 75 μm PDx when needed. Cell lysates were first incubated with nonspecific normal mouse serum and killed protein A-positive Staphylococcus aureus cells (Roche Diagnostics). The precleared lysates were incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal antibody on ice for 30 min followed by rocking with immobilized protein A (Pierce) at 4 °C for 45 min. For Western blot analyses, samples were separated on a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), if not specified, followed by electrotransferring onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBST (24Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 9: 2984-2992Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), incubated with specific antibody, washed in TBST, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. The membranes were finally developed with the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Previously, we reported the establishment of the hepatoma-derived B1 cell line that carries a hypoxia-responsive luciferase reporter gene and showed that this cell line is responsive to hypoxia and hydroxylase inhibitors (hypoxia mimics) including transition metals, iron chelators, and oxoglutarate analogs (5Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). It has been observed that genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, decreased the protein levels of both HIF-1α and HIF-1β and inhibited the formation of DNA binding complex (40Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Previously, we also found that in B1 cells, genistein inhibited HIF-1 activity and gene expression in response to hypoxic stimulation (30Salceda S. Beck I. Srinivas V. Caro J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 556-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, PDx, a selective MEK inhibitor (41Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar), inhibited hypoxia-stimulated gene expression but had little effect on HIF-1α level and the formation of DNA binding complex (30Salceda S. Beck I. Srinivas V. Caro J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 556-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated further the role of MAPK signaling in basal and induced activity of HIF-1α in B1 cells. The MAPK signaling pathway, the targeting sites of two kinase inhibitors, genistein (GSN) and PDx, and the experimental system are schematically represented in Fig. 1,A and B. Treatment of the B1 cells with genistein revealed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both the basal and hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activity (Fig. 1, C andD). Similar inhibition was observed with the use of the hypoxic mimic Dfx (an iron chelator) and DOG (an oxoglutarate analog) (not shown). We further examined the effects of PDx both on a basal level and on a stimulated transactivation activity of HIF-1. Fig. 1,E and F, shows that PDx inhibited luciferase expression in B1 cells both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, further confirming that MAPK signaling enhances not only hypoxia-stimulated HIF-1 activity but its basal activity as well. In control experiments, PDx showed no effect on the luciferase activity from a pRL-CMV (not shown). These results indicate that MAPK signaling has a general role in promoting endogenous HIF activity, regardless of oxygen concentration. We next tested the hypothesis that MAPK signaling regulates HIF-1 activity through the transactivation domains of HIF-1α. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing G4.H1α530–826 in which the HIF-1α fragment was fused with the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4. A luciferase reporter driven by an E1B minimal promoter and four copies of GAL4 binding sites (pFR-luc) was co-transfected to monitor the transactivation activity. Fig. 2,A and B, shows the dose-dependent inhibitory effect of PDx on the transactivation activity of G4.H1α530–826, which contains both the NAD and the CAD, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The protein levels of G4.H1α530–826 were not significantly affected by PDx treatment (Fig. 2, Cand D). Taken together, these data clearly confirm that MAPK signaling up-regulates the transactivation activity of HIF-1α. Whereas previous reports observed that HIF-1α was directly phosphorylated by MAPK (32Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), the exact amino acid residues involved in HIF-1α phosphorylation have not been clearly identified. Furthermore, there have been inconsistencies between results of different groups on the role of MAPK-induced direct phosphorylation of HIF-α in its transactivation activity (31Conrad P.W. Freeman T.L. Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33709-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). To clarify further the role of MAPK in HIF activation, we first attempted to identify the functional domains that were sensitive to MAPK inhibitors. G4.HIF fusion constructs containing various segments of the carboxyl half of HIF-1α were co-transfected with the pFR-Luc reporter, and the transfected HeLa cells were treated with increasing doses of PDx. As shown in Fig. 3,A–F, all of the constructs tested, including G4.H1α530–778 (which represents the NAD), G4.H1α744–826 (which represents the hypoxia-responsive CAD), and G4.H1α786–826 (which represents the constitutive CAD), were inhibited by PDx both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. These data suggest at least two possibilities: 1) there is more than one phosphorylation site, each of the constructs tested containing at least one site for MAPK-mediated phosphorylation, or 2) MAPK signaling affects a protein factor(s) that is required for both NAD and CAD activity. To test the first hypothesis, we expressed HIF-1α as GST fusion proteins and used them in in vitro MAP kinase assays (Fig. 3G). Whereas GST alone was not phosphorylated by active MAPK, GST.H1α530–658 and GST.H1α530–826 were readily phosphorylated. However, neither GST.H1α757–826 nor GST.H1α744–826, which corresponds to the hypoxia-responsive CAD (6Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), was phosphorylated, demonstrating that whereas both hypoxia-responsive CAD and constitutive CAD are sensitive to PDx treatment, they do not contain MAPK phosphorylation sites. Since CAD is sensitive to PDx but lacks MAPK phosphorylation sites, we explored the possibility that a transcriptional coactivator might be involved in MAPK signaling to HIF. Because p300/CBP are the major coactivators involved in HIF activation, we next tested the effects of MAPK on p300 transactivation activity. A plasmid expressing G4.p300 (aa 1–2414) was co-transfected with the pFR-Luc reporter, and the transfected HeLa cells were treated with Me2SO, PDx, or genistein and cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Fig.4A indicates that whereas hypoxia and Me2SO had little effect on p300 transactivation activity, exposure to PDx or genistein significantly repressed this activity. The effect of PDx was dose-dependent (Fig.4B) and affected the transactivation domain of p300 (G4.p300TD; aa 1751–2414) (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, transfection with a plasmid expressing MEK1, the upstream activator of ERK1/2 (36Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), enhanced the transactivation activity of p300TD (Fig.4D). We next tested whether p300TD was a direct substrate of MAPK. We expressed and purified p300TD (aa 1572–2370) as a GST fusion protein and used it in in vitro MAPK assays. We observed that this region of p300 was readily phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro (Fig. 4E). Finally, when coexpressed with NAD (G4.H1α530–778), p300 (pCMV-β-p300) or CBP (pRSV-CBP) enhanced the transactivation activity of NAD, which was repressible by wild type E1A but not by an E1A mutant defective in targeting p300/CBP (not shown) (42Sang N. Caro J. Giordano A. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 407-413PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that p300 is also required for NAD activity. Therefore, the effect of PDx on both NAD and CAD activity is at least partly caused by the repression of p300/CBP. HIF-1α transactivation activity depends on the recruitment of p300. We next investigated whether MAPK signaling affected the physical interaction between p300 and HIF-1αCAD. We exposed HeLa cells to hypoxia in the presence or absence of PDx. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with PDx had no effect on p300 levels. We incubated the cell lysates with bacterially expressed GST.H1α530–826 protein in pull-down assays, and the copurified p300 was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-p300 monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 5B, whereas p300 in cell lysates from normal or Me2SO-treated cells readily bound to GST.H1α530–826, little p300 was copurified from PDx-treated lysates. Similar results were observed when GST.H1α757–826 was used (not shown). To further confirm that blocking MAPK signaling disrupts the HIF-1/p300 interaction in vivo, a plasmid expressing G4.H1α786–826 (constitutive CAD) was transfected into HeLa cells, and the transfected cells were treated with Me2SO or PDx and cultured under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Western blot analysis showed that G4.H1α786–826 was expressed in all transfected cells (Fig. 5C). Coupled immunoprecipitation and Western blot assays with either anti-p300 or anti-Gal4 antibodies confirmed that G4.H1α786–826 interacted with p300 regardless of oxygen concentration as previously demonstrated (24Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 9: 2984-2992Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This interaction, however, was significantly weakened by PDx treatment (Fig. 5C, bottom two panels). These results indicate that MAPK signaling facilitates the interaction between p300 and HIF-1αCADin vivo. Finally, we investigated whether MAPK signaling is involved in the oxygen sensing mechanism in HeLa cells. We first examined whether hypoxia or hydroxylase inhibitors might affect the levels of activated (phosphorylated) ERK. HeLa cells were cultured in normal medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and both the total and activated ERK levels were examined by specific polyclonal antibodies in immunoblot assays. As shown in Fig.6A, total and activated ERK1/2 levels were found at rather high levels under normal culturing conditions and were affected neither by hypoxia nor by the hypoxia mimics Dfx or DOG. The effect of further activation of MAPK on the responsiveness of HIF-1α to hypoxia and Dfx was analyzed by overexpressing MEK1, an upstream activator of ERK. Overexpression of MEK1 enhanced HIF-CAD activity under all conditions tested, whereas the addition of PDx blocked the MEK1 effect (Fig. 6B). Most importantly, variations in MAPK levels did not affect the responsiveness of HIF-1α activity to hypoxia or Dfx. The role of phosphorylation in HIF activation has become a contentious issue since it was first observed that genistein decreased the protein levels of both HIF-1α and HIF-1β and blocked the formation of DNA binding complex (40Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It was later shown that PDx, a MEK-specific inhibitor, suppressed hypoxia-stimulated HIF activity but had little effect on the formation of HIF DNA-binding complex (30Salceda S. Beck I. Srinivas V. Caro J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 556-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results suggested that MAPK signaling might play a role in the regulation of the transactivation activity of HIF-1 but had an insignificant effect on the protein levels of HIF-1β and hypoxia-stimulated accumulation of HIF-1α. This notion is supported by reports indicating that p44/p42 kinases (ERK1/2) directly phosphorylate HIF-1α and regulate its transcriptional activity with no effect on HIF-1α protein levels induced by hypoxia (32Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). This issue is complicated further by the later finding that both PTEN/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and MAPK pathways enhance HIF-α levels in tumor cells or cells stimulated by mitogenic signaling under normoxic conditions (43Stiehl D.P. Jelkmann W. Wenger R.H. Hellwig-Burgel T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 44Zhong H. Chiles K. Feldser D. Laughner E. Hanrahan C. Georgescu M-M. Simons J.W. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1541-1545PubMed Google Scholar) and by evidence indicating that such enhancement involves the control of HIF-1α translation (45Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). One recent report, however, demonstrates that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is neither required nor sufficient for stabilization of HIF-1α (46Arsham A.M. Plas D.R. Thompson C.B. Simon M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15162-15170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that the transactivation activity of HIF-1α is affected by MAPK signaling. Whereas at low dosages (50 μm or less), PDx was very effective in blocking the transactivation activity of HIF-1α, it showed little or no effect on the protein level. However, higher doses (100 μm or more) of PDx reduced hypoxia-accumulated HIF-1α levels (not shown). These data are consistent with the translational role of MAPK signaling and suggest that, in certain conditions, MAPK signaling may regulate HIF activity, in part, by affecting the protein levels of HIF-1α. Although it is now clear that MAPK signaling facilitates the transactivation activity of HIF-1α and it has been suggested that MAPK directly phosphorylates HIF-α (32Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence for correlation of the MAPK-mediated phosphorylation to the transactivation activity of HIF-1α. Moreover, it was reported that PDx inhibited HIF-2α (EPAS1) transactivation activity but did not inhibit its phosphorylation (31Conrad P.W. Freeman T.L. Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33709-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Whereas it was demonstrated recently that the C-terminal domain of HIF-α is phosphorylated at multiple sites and that mutation of a conserved threonine residue (Thr796 in HIF-1α/T844 in HIF-2α) inhibited the interactions between HIF-α and CBP/p300, such phosphorylation is not mediated by MAPK (47Gradin K. Takasaki C. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Sogawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23508-23514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We observed that whereas both responsive CAD and constitutive CAD of HIF-1α were repressed by PDx exposure, neither the aa 757–826 nor the aa 744–826 region was phosphorylated by MAPK, indicating that it is not through direct phosphorylation of HIF-1α that MAPK affects the transactivation activity of HIF-1αCAD. Instead, we observed that MAPK signaling affected the transactivation activity of p300, the co-activator required for HIF-αCAD, and that the interaction between p300 and HIF-1α was affected by MAPK signaling. Although the aa 530–743 region, encompassing NAD and part of the oxygen-dependent degradation domain, is phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro (Fig. 3G) (48Sodhi A. Montaner S. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), because HIF-1α530–826 and HIF-1α757–826 expressed in Escherichia coli, thus lacking posttranslational modifications, efficiently bind p300 in cell lysates, it appears that direct phosphorylation of HIF-1α is not necessary for the recruitment of p300. Moreover, whereas PDx does not affect p300 levels, HIF-1α fails to bind p300 in PDx-treated cell lysates, suggesting that phosphorylation of p300 or other cellular factor(s) by MAPK or its downstream kinases may regulate the interaction between p300 and HIF-CAD. Therefore, our data indicate that p300 and very likely CBP as well serve as integrators of MAPK signaling in HIF activation. MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of CBP was originally reported in the regulation of Elk-1 activity (49Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and later MAPK signaling through CBP was found to play a role in T-cell activation (50Avots A. Buttmann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Smola U. Bannister A.J. Rapp U.R. Kouzarides T. Serfling E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recently, phenylephrine-mediated stimulation of gene expression in cardiomyocytes has been found to involve MAPK signaling through p300 and CBP (51Gusterson R. Brar B. Faulkes D. Giordano A. Chrivia J. Latchman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2517-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of MEKK1 enhanced the transcriptional activity of p300 in a c-Jun N-terminal kinase-independent manner (52See R.H. Calvo D. Shi Y. Kawa H. Luke M.P.S. Yuan Z. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16310-16317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since MEKK1 is also able to activate MEK1, the MEK1-MAPK pathway may play a role in the stimulatory effect of MEKK1. How p300 and CBP integrate the MAPK signaling is currently unclear. Since p300 and CBP are co-factors for a large number of transcription factors involved in multiple cellular processes (53Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), signal-mediated redistribution of p300/CBP among different interacting partners may differentially regulate p300/CBP-dependent transcriptional factors (54Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and the functionality of p300TD, thus reprogramming gene expression in response to the signal. Therefore, one possibility is that p300 and CBP are direct substrates of MAPK or a downstream kinase. Supporting this hypothesis, it has been reported that the C-terminal transactivation domain of CBP was phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro (49Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and we now demonstrate that the C-terminal transactivation domain of p300 can be phosphorylated by MAPK in a similar manner (Fig. 4E). It is equally possible that MAPK signaling leads to phosphorylation of a pool of p300/CBP-interacting factors, as shown for several other transcriptional factors. In either case, the phosphorylation events may have differential impact on the affinity between p300 and various protein factors, thus leading to a signal-mediated redistribution of p300/CBP among interacting partners. Particularly, since MAPK signaling stimulates the transactivation activity of p300/CBP, phosphorylation events very likely enhance the interaction between p300/CBP and the basic transcriptional machinery. The biological relevance of MAPK signaling in HIF activation is only partly understood. Previously, ERK activation upon hypoxia was observed in HMEC cells (55Minet E. Arnould T. Michel G. Roland I. Mottet D. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In our system, however, MAPK inhibitors suppressed the transcriptional activity of HIF under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Therefore, the MAPK dependence is not specific for hypoxia or hypoxic mimic-stimulated HIF activity. In cells exposed to MAPK inhibitors or MEK1 overexpression, the hypoxic response remains. Furthermore, in the presence of serum, MAPK is constitutively active, and the levels of activated MAPK are not changed either by hypoxia or by hypoxia mimics in HeLa cells. Finally, we have also found that FIH is not a substrate for MAPK, ruling out the possibility that MAPK signals to HIF by modifying FIH hydroxylase activity (not shown). These results indicate that MAPK signaling is not part of the hypoxia sensing mechanism in HeLa cells. However, since MAPK signaling facilitates HIF activation, it may represent an independent pathway that links oncogenesis to HIF activation and angiogenesis and may synergize the effect of other HIF-activating pathways.

The checkpoint functions of ATR and ATM are mediated, in part, by a pair of checkpoint effector kinases termed Chk1 and Chk2. In mammalian cells, evidence has been presented that Chk1 is devoted to the ATR signaling pathway and is modified by ATR in response to replication inhibition and UV-induced damage, whereas Chk2 functions primarily through ATM in response to ionizing radiation (IR), suggesting that Chk2 and Chk1 might have evolved to channel the DNA damage signal from ATM and ATR, respectively. We demonstrate here that the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 pathways are not parallel branches of the DNA damage response pathway but instead show a high degree of cross-talk and connectivity. ATM does in fact signal to Chk1 in response to IR. Phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-317 in response to IR is ATM-dependent. We also show that functional NBS1 is required for phosphorylation of Chk1, indicating that NBS1 might facilitate the access of Chk1 to ATM at the sites of DNA damage. Abrogation of Chk1 expression by RNA interference resulted in defects in IR-induced S and G2/M phase checkpoints; however, the overexpression of phosphorylation site mutant (S317A, S345A or S317A/S345A double mutant) Chk1 failed to interfere with these checkpoints. Surprisingly, the kinase-dead Chk1 (D130A) also failed to abrogate the S and G2 checkpoint through any obvious dominant negative effect toward endogenous Chk1. Therefore, further studies will be required to assess the contribution made by phosphorylation events to Chk1 regulation.

Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). In mammals, the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)1 and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinases function as critical regulators of the cellular DNA damage response. ATM and ATR are Ser/Thr-Gln-directed protein kinases with overlapping substrate specificities that are activated in response to distinct as well as partially overlapping types of genotoxic stimuli (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, 3Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). Despite their structural similarity and overlapping substrate specificities, ATR and ATM are functionally non-redundant protein kinases. Cells from A-T patients orATM-nullizygous mice are exquisitely sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) and other agents that induce double strand breaks and are defective in activating IR-induced G1/S, S phase, and G2/M checkpoints (4Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyangage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A.

In contrast to ATM−/− mice, which are viable, ATR-deficient mice die early during embryogenesis, and the conditional knockout ofATR gene function in human cells leads to a loss of cellular viability (6de Klein A.

ATR is required for the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint as well as the DNA replication checkpoint, which suppresses mitosis in the presence of unreplicated DNA (9Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 2: 159-169Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). ATR mediates responses to a broad spectrum of genotoxic stimuli, including IR, DNA replication inhibitors (e.g. hydroxyurea or HU), UV light, and agents such as cis-platinum that induce DNA inter-strand crosslinks (9Cliby W.A.

A common denominator of these agents is the ability to induce transient or prolonged DNA replication fork stalling during S phase. This stalled replication fork may be a critical trigger for ATR signaling potential. The checkpoint functions of ATR and ATM are mediated, in part, by a pair of checkpoint effector kinases termed Chk1 and Chk2/Cds1 (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J.

Although structurally distinct, Chk1 and Chk2 are functionally related kinases that phosphorylate an overlapping pool of cellular substrates (11O'Neill T. Giarratani L. Chen P. Iyer L. Lee C.H.

In mammalian cells, evidence has been presented that Chk2 and Chk1 have apparently evolved to channel DNA damage signals from ATM and ATR, respectively. This is based on reports that Chk1 appears to be devoted to the ATR signaling pathway and is modified by ATR in response to replication inhibition and UV-induced damage, whereas Chk2 functions primarily through ATM in response to IR (12Zhao H.

We demonstrate that Chk1 is a downstream target of ATM and is phosphorylated on Ser-317 in response to IR. Reduction of Chk1 expression by RNA interference results in a defect in regulation of the S and G2 phase checkpoints; however cells overexpressing the phosphorylation site mutants Chk1 were not compromised in their ability to arrest in S and G2 following IR. Control, A-T, and NBS lymphoblastoid cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were exposed to genotoxic agents (gamma, UV radiation, or HU) and, unless otherwise stated, harvested at the indicated time points. Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in universal immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mmsodium fluoride, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.3% Nonidet-P40). Twenty-five micrograms of whole cell extract was loaded per lane on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose using carbonate buffer at 30 V for 3 h, and the membranes were probed with appropriate antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphopeptide antisera against ATM/ATR phosphorylation sites in Chk1 (Ser-317 and Ser-345) were raised by immunizing rabbits with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptides NVKYSS-PhosphoSer-QPEPRT (for Ser-317) and VQGISF-PhosphoSer-QPTCPD (for Ser-345). Bleeds were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the serum was collected on days corresponding to the peak antibody response and affinity purified against the same peptide. Anti-Chk1 monoclonal and anti-cyclin B antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-S15p53 was from New England Biolabs. ATM-complemented cells (15Ziv Y. Bar-Shira A. Pecker I. Russell P. Jorgensen T.J. Tsarfati I. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and NBS1-complemented (16Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K.K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) cells have been described previously. Kinase-dead Chk1 (D130A, D148E), phosphorylation site Chk1 mutants (S317A, S345A, S317A/S345A, S317D, S345D, S317D/S345D) were constructed using the Quick Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by using FLAG-tagged Chk1 in PCI-Neo vector (Promega) as a template. The details of the primers are available from the authors on request. RNA interference of Chk1 was performed using 5′-UCGUGAGCGUUUGUUGAAC-3′. siRNA specific to HSP70 served as a negative control (GCACAUCAGCCAGAACAAG). The oligos were purchased from Dharmacon Research, Boulder, CO. A siRNA duplex was annealed using the protocol supplied by the company, and transfection was carried out using the OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection. Cells were synchronized by double thymidine block (17Atherton-Fessler S. Liu F. Gabrielli B. Lee M.S. Peng C.-Y. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 989-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 mm thymidine was added for 16 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and released in fresh media containing 24 μm thymidine and 24 μm deoxycytidine for 10 h. Cells were reblocked in 2.5 mm thymidine for 16 h. At this point, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and placed into normal medium. This point was designated t 0, the point at which 80% of cells are in G1/S by propidium iodide-flow cytometry analysis, and cells were harvested at 4 h (mid S phase), 7 h (G2 phase), and 9.5 h (G2+ M phase). At each time point the cells were either left untreated or treated with 6 Gy of IR for 30 min. Total cell extracts were prepared as described above and blotted with the respective antibodies. Cells were mock transfected or transfected with various Chk1 constructs or Chk1 siRNAs. Forty-eight hours later, cells were mock irradiated or exposed to 3 Gy of IR. Cells were harvested 1 h after IR and fixed in 70% ethanol at −20 °C. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was suspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25 μg of phospho-histone H3 antibody and 1% bovine serum albumin followed by staining with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody as described previously (18Xu B. Kim S.T. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). After 1 h of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the cells were stained with phosphatidylinositol, and cellular fluorescence was measured by BD Biosciences FACScan. The data was analyzed using Cell Quest software. Suppression of DNA synthesis after DNA damage was assessed as described (19Falck J. Petrini J.H Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with 10 nCi of [14C]thymidine for 24 h. The isotope was then washed away during the transfection procedure, and the cells were transiently transfected with siRNA oligos Chk1 or co-transfected with pCMV CD-20 and various Chk1 constructs at the ratio of 1:10 and incubated without [14C]thymidine for 24 h. Cells were then irradiated with 10 Gy, and, 45 min post-irradiation, [3H]thymidine (2.5 μCi/ml) was added. Fifteen minutes after the addition of [3H]thymidine, cells were harvested and fixed in 70% methanol either directly or after isolation with anti-CD-20-coupled Dynabeads as described (19Falck J. Petrini J.H Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and radioactivity was measured in an liquid scintillation counter. The DNA synthesis was estimated by the ratios of 3H to14C and expressed as a percentage of control values. To delineate the relationship between ATM and Chk1, we studied Chk1 mobility shift in control and AT cells treated with IR. In control lymphoblastoid cells (C3ABR and C2ABR), a small fraction of the Chk1 protein from IR-treated cells showed a reproducible reduction in mobility compared with untreated cells, whereas most of the AT cell lines (L3, AT1ABR, AT3ABR) tested failed to show that shift in mobility (Fig 1A). Chk1 modification post UV irradiation was quite comparable in AT and control lymphoblastoid cell lines (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have shown that this modification of Chk1 after DNA damage is because of phosphorylation. Therefore, we examined the in vivophosphorylation status of Chk1 in AT and control cells with or without prior exposure to irradiation. AT and control cells were metabolically labeled with 32P for 2 h immediately after exposure to 6 Gy of irradiation. Chk1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates and fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled Chk1 was detected by autoradiography. Chk1 in non-irradiated control and A-T cells appears to be already phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation was greatly enhanced (3-fold) 2 h after IR in control cells. In contrast, there was a barely detectable increase in32P-labeled Chk1 from IR-treated AT cells (Fig.1B). Earlier studies have mapped two damage-induced sites (Ser-317 and Ser-345) of phosphorylation in Chk1, and ATR has been shown to phosphorylate Chk1 on Ser-345 and Ser-317 primarily in response to replication inhibition and UV (12Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 14Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. De Maya F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Therefore, to examine Chk1 phosphorylation we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic polypeptide consisting of phosphorylated Ser-317 or Ser-345. We were unable to detect Ser-345 phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to IR in lymphoblastoid or fibroblast cell lines from control individuals. However, significant phosphorylation of Ser-317 in Chk1 was observed in response to various damaging agents in control cells. A-T cells were defective in rapid phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-317 in response to IR (6 or 10 Gy), but at a high dose of IR (20 Gy) or after HU and UV, Chk1 phosphorylation in AT and control cells was quite comparable (Fig 1C, top panel). The extent of phosphorylation of Chk1 was quite comparable with the phosphorylation of p53, a widely accepted target of ATM (Fig1C, bottom panel). The time course analysis revealed that Chk1 phosphorylation was induced in control cells within 30 min post-IR (6 Gy), whereas in ATM-deficient cells it became evident by 2 h and was still markedly reduced compared with controls at 6 h after IR (Fig. 1D). Defective IR-induced Chk1 phosphorylation in A-T cells was corrected by the introduction of ATM cDNA; therefore, it is indeed ATM-dependent (Fig. 1E). Ser-317 phosphorylation of Chk1 was also defective (Fig. 1F) in lymphoblastoid cells derived from individuals either homozygous or heterozygous for ATM mutation (T7271G), which is known to confer a high risk of breast cancer (20Stankovic T. Kidd A.M. Sutcliffe A Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 334-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 21Chenevix-Trench G. Spurdle A.B. Gatei M. Kelly H. Marsh A. Chen X.

Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that this mutant form of ATM is quite stable but intrinsically defective as a kinase (21Chenevix-Trench G. Spurdle A.B. Gatei M. Kelly H. Marsh A. Chen X. Donn K. Cummings M. Nyholt D. Jenkins M.A. Scott C. Pupo G.M. Dork T. Bendix R. Kirk J. Tucker K. McCredie M.R. Hopper J.L. Sambrook J. Mann G.J. Khanna K.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The mutant allele has been shown to act as a dominant negative manner so that the wild-type ATM is unable to function in the presence of mutant protein. The defective Ser-317 phosphorylation in a heterozygous carrier of T7271G mutation is related to this dominant negative effect (Fig. 1F). Evidence from yeast and vertebrate systems has shown that the activation of Chk1 and Chk2 requires a large number of additional gene products that participate in the detection, initiation, and propagation of checkpoint signals (22O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Additionally, radiation-induced phosphorylation of certain ATM substrates such as SMC1 has been reported to be defective in NBS cells (23Kim S.T. Xu B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 24Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of others (p53, BRCA1, and Rad9) has been reported to occur normally in NBS cell lines (16Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K.K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 25St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the dependence of Chk1 phosphorylation on NBS1. Dramatically reduced phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to IR was also observed in cells deficient in NBS1 as compared with control cells (Fig.2A), but after HU and UV, Chk1 phosphorylation in NBS1-deficient cells and control cells was comparable (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of Chk1 was restored with the introduction of NBS1 cDNA in NBS-deficient fibroblasts (Fig 2C). NBS1 is a target of ATM, and ATM phosphorylates NBS1 on Ser-343. This phosphorylation is required for activation of the S phase checkpoint. We tested the possible requirement for the phosphorylated form of NBS1 in Chk1 phosphorylation by using the NBS cells that were complemented with wild-type NBS1 and the ATM phosphorylation site mutant (S343A) NBS1 (Fig. 2C,top panel). Interestingly, Chk1 expression was up-regulated (5-fold) by overexpression of S343A mutant NBS1 (Fig.2C, bottom panel); however, the dependence of Ser-317 phosphorylation on NBS1 phosphorylation was not clear (Fig. 2C, middle panel). Quantification of data indicated that phosphorylation, relative to the amount of Chk1 protein, was reduced in S343A-overexpressing cells. To test whether activation of Chk1 after IR required a functional ATM protein, we assayed Chk1 activation in ATM-null cells complemented with empty vector or vector encoding wild-type ATM. Treating ATM-null cells with radiation had no effect on Chk1 activity and, interestingly, cells expressing ATM had slightly higher basal levels of Chk1 activity compared with ATM-null cells. IR treatment in the presence of ATM had a small effect on the activation of Chk1 (Fig. 2D). Similarly, we studied Chk1 activation after IR in NBS1 defective cells with or without complementation with NBS1 and failed to observe the NBS1 dependence of Chk1 activation after IR; however, like the ATM reconstituted cells, NBS1 reconstituted cells showed higher basal activity compared with retroviral vector only (LXIN) transfected cells. To address the functional significance of the phosphorylation of Chk1, we mutated Ser-317 and Ser-345 singly or doubly to either alanine or aspartate. The rationale for generating these mutations was that the alanine mutants, which cannot be phosphorylated, might not be active if Chk1 phosphorylation is important for its activity, and the negatively charged carboxyl group of aspartate may potentially mimic phosphoserine and would therefore be expected to exhibit similar functions to phosphorylated Chk1. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type Chk1, phosphorylation site mutants, and kinase-dead Chk1 to initially determine whether intrinsic kinase activity of Chk1 was altered as a consequence of amino acid substitution. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were either left unirradiated or irradiated with 6 Gy of IR. Lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed for Chk1 protein and Chk1 kinase activity. As seen in Fig.3, each phosphorylation site mutant of Chk1 (both alanine and aspartate) had specific activity quite comparable with wild-type Chk1, whereas kinase dead-Chk1 (D130A) had negligible activity in this assay. Furthermore, the activity of the constructs examined above remained unchanged after treatment with IR (data not shown). These results indicate that the phosphorylation site mutants of Chk1 do not affect the intrinsic activity of Chk1 to a great extent. Earlier studies using small molecule inhibitors of Chk1 (SB-218078 and UCN-01) have demonstrated a role for Chk1 in the regulation of the G2/M checkpoint (26Graves P.R. Yu L. Schwarz J.K Gales J. Sausville E.A O'Connor P.M Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 27Jackson J.R. Gilmartin A. Imburgia C. Winkler J.D. Marshall L.A. Roshak A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 566-572PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to attribute their effects to Chk1 inhibition, as these inhibitors do inhibit other kinases as well. We therefore chose to address the requirement for Chk1 in G2 checkpoint signaling more specifically using an siRNA knockout of Chk1 expression. HeLa cells were incubated with Chk1-specific siRNA, and the Chk1 expression was significantly reduced in treated cells (Fig.4C). Both control and siRNA treated HeLa cells were examined for their ability to delay in G2 at 1 h after exposure to 6 Gy of IR by flow cytometric assessment of anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody to distinguish mitotic cells from G2 cells. Control cells treated with nonspecific siRNA showed a 43–48% decrease in the number of cells entering mitosis (Fig. 4, A and B). The Chk1 siRNA-treated samples showed no detectable reduction in mitotic index following 1 h post IR (Fig. 4, A andB). These results suggest that Chk1 is required for the delay in mitotic entry after IR. To determine whether phosphorylation events contributed to G2/M checkpoint regulation by Chk1, we tested whether an IR-induced G2 checkpoint could be abrogated by overexpression of alanine phosphorylation site mutants of Chk1. Wild-type Chk1 and phosphorylation site mutant transfected cells (Ser-317, Ser-345, and double mutations involving Ser-317 and Ser-345) showed between 80 and 70% reduction in the number of mitotic cells. Cells expressing the kinase inactive Chk1 (D130A and D148E) were also normal in the ability to delay in G2following IR. Under the same experimental conditions, expression of kinase-dead ATM showed only a 20% reduction in the suppression of mitotic entry after IR. Taken together, these results show that, although Chk1 is required for G2 arrest, the precise role, if any, of the phosphorylations at Ser-317 and Ser-345 in G2 arrest remains to be established. To test whether phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-317 occurred during normal cell cycle progression, we synchronized HeLa cells at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine block and followed their progression through the cell cycle after release into the fresh medium. Chk1 was phosphorylated on Ser-317 at the G1/S boundary and mid S phase of normal S phase progression; however, no phosphorylation was evident in cells in G2 or G2/M (Fig.5A). In contrast, damage-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-317 was observed at all cell cycle stages. Similar results were obtained with MCF-7 cells synchronized by serum starvation and released into the fresh medium (data not shown). To determine whether S phase phosphorylation of Chk1 is also required for an IR-induced S phase checkpoint, we used U20S cells, which have been shown previously to be proficient in both branches of the S phase checkpoint (ATM/NBS1 and ATM/Chk2/Cdc25A branch). Vector-transfected U2OS cells irradiated at 10 Gy showed ∼50% inhibition of their DNA synthesis within 1 h post IR, as monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Cells expressing kinase dead Chk1 (D130A) or phospho mutant Chk1 (S317A, S345A, and S317A/S345A) showed comparable levels of suppression of DNA synthesis after IR (Fig. 5B). Thus, these experiments did not show any obvious negative effect of these mutants on the checkpoint function in the presence of endogenous Chk1. On the other hand, down-modulation of endogenous Chk1 by siRNA treatment, followed by IR and monitoring of the S phase checkpoint, revealed a radiation-resistant DNA synthesis phenotype (Fig. 5B), a hallmark of checkpoint failure. Identical results showing the radio-resistant DNA synthesis phenotype were obtained when the activity of Chk1 was inhibited by the chemical inhibitor UCN01 (data not shown). Thus, analogous to the requirement of Chk1 for the activation of the G2/M checkpoint, Chk1 is also essential for the IR-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis. The protein kinase Chk1 is phosphorylated at Ser-317 and Ser-345 in response to DNA damage. There has been accumulating evidence that these phosphorylation events are regulated by ATR (12Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 13Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). ATR shares overlapping substrate specificities with ATM in vitro, butin vivo it is regulated in response to different damaging agents. Recent studies have indicated that, in mammalian cells, ATR and ATM might represent two parallel branches of the DNA damage response pathway and that Chk1 and Chk2 in mammals might have evolved to signal DNA damage from ATR and ATM, respectively (12Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 13Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The ATM/Chk2 pathway is activated, principally, by double-stranded DNA breaks, whereas the ATR/Chk1 pathway primarily responds to lesions caused by UV and DNA replication block. Here we provide evidence for cross-talk between the two pathways by demonstrating that ATM does target Chk1 in response to IR. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-317 in response to IR is severely compromised in ATM-deficient cells and that ectopic expression of ATM corrects this defect. However, Chk1 phosphorylation in response to HU and UV is ATM-independent, possibly catalyzed by ATR, as indicated by earlier studies that have shown that expression of a kinase-inactive form of ATR interfered with UV-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 (13Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 14Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. De Maya F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our results establish that the NBS1 gene product is required for optimal IR-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 on Ser-317 but is dispensable for its phosphorylation in response to HU and UV. The simplest interpretation of the data is that NBS1 assists ATM in targeting some of its substrates. This explanation is consistent with ATM and NBS1 dependence of SMC1 phosphorylation in response to IR (23Kim S.T. Xu B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 24Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Normal BRCA1, p53, and H2AX phosphorylation (16Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K.K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 28Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) in NBS1-deficient cells, previously reported by us and others, suggests that NBS1-independent mechanisms might promote the phosphorylation of these substrates by ATM. Notably, p53 and BRCA1 can both be efficiently phosphorylated by ATM in vitro, whereas Chk1 is a poor ATM substrate in vitro (data not shown). There has been controversy in the literature as to whether Chk1 activity is increased after DNA damage; however, after repeated attempts we have not been able to demonstrate any consistent increase in activity after IR. Furthermore, we do not see a defect in Chk1 kinase activation in ATM-deficient or NBS-deficient cells in response to IR. To understand whether phosphorylation of Chk1 is required for its checkpoint function, we overexpressed phosphorylation site mutants of Chk1 either singly (S317A and S345A) or in combination to study their effects on G2/M and S phase checkpoint. Both phosphorylation site mutants were active as a protein kinase with or without prior exposure to IR. Our results demonstrate that the phosphorylation site mutants do not interfere with the checkpoint control, yet the existence of some additional site(s) of phosphorylation in Chk1, potentially capable of mediating the checkpoint function, is not very likely given that these two sites of phosphorylation are the only two Chk1 sites conserved across other species, including fission yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus, and Drosophila (13Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Furthermore, similar to the phospho mutants, we were unable to demonstrate a dominant negative effect through overexpression of kinase-inactive Chk1 (D130A or D148E). These findings raise the possibility that Chk1 activation does not depend on its dimerization and that the interactions with its substrates are very dynamic, with a rapid turnover of interaction. Consequently, the kinase-inactive form of the protein may not be capable of sequestering targets into non-functional complexes. Thus, it might not be possible to demonstrate a dominant negative effect of Chk1 phospho mutants in overexpression studies. Therefore, the significance of the phosphorylation sites can only be addressed by comparing the abilities of wild-type and phospho mutant Chk1 to restore the checkpoint functions in Chk1-deficient cells. The major problem with these experiments is the lack of availability of Chk1-null cells, as Chk1 is an essential gene in mice (14Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G.

Nagahama H. Tsukiyama T. Ikeda K. Nakayama K. Nakanishi M. Nakayama K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1439-1447PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we have shown that the reduction of Chk1 expression in mammalian cells by siRNA does lead to a defect in S and G2/M checkpoint control, which is consistent with a recently published report (30Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 99: 14795-147800Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar). These Chk1-deficient cells might be suitable for complementation studies with wild-type or Chk1 mutant constructs. The challenge here will be to modify various Chk1 constructs to make them resistant to inhibition by siRNA, which will be the goal of future experiments. We thank Malcolm Taylor for supplying cell lines from the Scottish T7271G families, Yosef Shiloh for providing the A-T cell line (L3) and ATM complemented cells, Patrick Concannon for supplying the NBS1 complemented cells, and Merl Hoekstra for the wild-type Chk1 expression construct."

https://openalex.org/W2028823361,"Imprinted genes in mammals are often located in clusters whose imprinting is subject to long range regulation by cis-acting sequences known as imprinting centers (ICs). The mechanisms by which these ICs exert their effects is unknown. The Prader-Willi syndrome IC (PWS-IC) on human chromosome 15 and mouse chromosome 7 regulates imprinted gene expression bidirectionally within an ∼2-megabase region and shows CpG methylation and histone H3 Lys-9 methylation in somatic cells specific for the maternal chromosome. Here we show that histone H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC is reduced in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking the G9a histone H3 Lys-9/Lys-27 methyltransferase and that maintenance of CpG methylation of the PWS-IC in mouse ES cells requires the function of G9a. We show by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that expression of Snrpn, an imprinted gene regulated by the PWS-IC, is biallelic in G9a −/− ES cells, indicating loss of imprinting. By contrast, Dnmt1 −/− ES cells lack CpG methylation of the PWS-IC but have normal levels of H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC and show normal monoallelic Snrpnexpression. Our results demonstrate a role for histone methylation in the maintenance of parent-specific CpG methylation of imprinting regulatory regions and suggest a possible role of histone methylation in establishment of these CpG methylation patterns. Imprinted genes in mammals are often located in clusters whose imprinting is subject to long range regulation by cis-acting sequences known as imprinting centers (ICs). The mechanisms by which these ICs exert their effects is unknown. The Prader-Willi syndrome IC (PWS-IC) on human chromosome 15 and mouse chromosome 7 regulates imprinted gene expression bidirectionally within an ∼2-megabase region and shows CpG methylation and histone H3 Lys-9 methylation in somatic cells specific for the maternal chromosome. Here we show that histone H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC is reduced in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking the G9a histone H3 Lys-9/Lys-27 methyltransferase and that maintenance of CpG methylation of the PWS-IC in mouse ES cells requires the function of G9a. We show by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that expression of Snrpn, an imprinted gene regulated by the PWS-IC, is biallelic in G9a −/− ES cells, indicating loss of imprinting. By contrast, Dnmt1 −/− ES cells lack CpG methylation of the PWS-IC but have normal levels of H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC and show normal monoallelic Snrpnexpression. Our results demonstrate a role for histone methylation in the maintenance of parent-specific CpG methylation of imprinting regulatory regions and suggest a possible role of histone methylation in establishment of these CpG methylation patterns. imprinting center Prader-Willi syndrome Prader-Willi syndrome/Angelman syndrome Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome embryonic stem chromatin immunoprecipitation fluorescencein situ hybridization Although the number of mammalian genes identified as showing parent-of-origin-specific expression patterns is growing, the mechanisms leading to their imprinted expression patterns are still poorly understood (1Ferguson-Smith A.C. Surani M.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). For many imprinted genes, there is a correlation between parent-specific CpG methylation of 5′ regulatory regions and parent-specific expression. Targeted inactivation of theDnmt1 DNA methyltransferase gene leads to disruption of imprinted expression for many imprinted genes (2Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). Imprinted genes are often located in clusters containing both maternally expressed and paternally expressed genes whose imprinting is subject to long range regulation by cis-acting sequences known as imprinting centers (ICs)1 (3Nicholls R.D.

One of the best characterized imprinting centers is the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) IC, which is required for establishment and maintenance of the paternal pattern of gene expression and CpG methylation in the Prader-Willi syndrome/Angelman syndrome (PWS/AS) region of human chromosome 15 and mouse chromosome 7 (3Nicholls R.D.

The PWS-IC in human and mouse contains the promoter region of the imprinted Snrpngene, and in both species, somatic cells show CpG methylation specific for the maternal copy of the PWS-IC. In mouse, this CpG methylation of the maternal PWS-IC occurs during oogenesis, and this methylation has been hypothesized to be the gametic imprint for the PWS/AS region in mouse (8Shemer R. Birger Y. Riggs A. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the PWS-IC is completely unmethylated in human oocytes (9El-Maarri O. Buiting K. Peery E. Kroise P. Balaban B. Wagner K. Urman B. Heyd J. Lich C. Brannan C. Walter J. Horsthemke B. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); therefore, maternal-specific CpG methylation of this region must occur after fertilization, and some other epigenetic mark must constitute the gametic imprint. We have shown previously in human somatic cells that histone H3 is modified by Lys-9 methylation on the maternal copy of the PWS-IC and that H3 is Lys-4-methylated on the paternal copy of the PWS-IC (10Xin Z. Allis C.D. Wagstaff J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1389-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We have proposed histone H3 methylation on Lys-9 in the PWS-IC as a candidate gametic imprint for the human PWS/AS region, with CpG methylation of the IC and of other promoter regions occurring as a consequence of the primary histone-based imprint. Recent studies by Tamaru and Selker in Neurospora (11Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) and by Jackson et al. in Arabidopsis (12Jackson J.P. Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Nature. 2002; 416: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) have demonstrated dependence of cytosine methylation on histone H3 Lys-9 methyltransferases. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that CpG methylation of the mouse PWS-IC requires the histone H3 Lys-9/Lys-27 methyltransferase G9a. Undifferentiated G9a +/+, −/−, and −/− with G9a transgene ES cell lines (13Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), as well as a Dnmt1 −/− ES cell line (14Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4449) Google Scholar), were maintained in ES cell medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1000 units/ml ESGRO (Chemicon). Chromatin was prepared from ES cells as described (15Kuo M.-H. Allis C.D. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and was sonicated to an average size of ∼0.5 kb. Spleens from F1 mice (C57Bl/6J x CAST/Ei and CAST/Ei x C57Bl/6J) were dissociated in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were collected by centrifugation at 700 ×g for 10 min, resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and then sonicated to produce chromatin of an average size of ∼0.5 kb. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated as described (15Kuo M.-H. Allis C.D. Methods (Orlando). 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref Scopus (486) Google Scholar) with rabbit polyclonal antibody to dimethyl Lys-9 H3 or with rabbit polyclonal antibody to dimethyl Lys-4 H3. DNA recovered from the immunoprecipitated material was amplified by PCR with the following primers: PWS-IC (Snrpn 5′ region, Msnp1, 5′-ACACGCTCAAATTTCCGCAG-3′ and Msnp2, 5′-TAGTCTTGCCGCAATGGCTC-3′), andD13Mit55 (D13Mit-F, 5′-TCAATATTAACTGCTAGCATGGTT-3′, and D13Mit-R, 5′-GCTTTTCCTCCCCAAACATT-3′). Amounts of ChIP DNA per reaction were normalized to give equal amounts of product withD13Mit55 control primers, which amplify a locus near the centromere of mouse chromosome 13; PCR yield with D13Mit55primers on ChIP DNA is independent of G9a genotype for ChIP with antibodies to methyl Lys-9 H3 and methyl Lys-4 H3 (data not shown). Annealing temperature was 59 °C for Msnp1/Msnp2 and 55 °C for D13Mit-F/D13Mit-R. Products in Fig. 2, a andc, were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Quantitative analysis of ChIP DNA (see Fig. 2b) was carried out by PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP for 28 cycles, where product yield is a linear function of cycle number for both primer sets. PCR products were separated on 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography, and films were scanned with a Amersham Biosciences densitometer and analyzed with ImageQuant software. ChIP DNA PCR ratios for the twoG9a −/− ES cell lines were calculated as [(PWS-IC product from −/−)/(D13Mit55 product from −/−)]/[(PWS-IC product from +/+)/(D13Mit55 product from +/+)]. Bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA was carried out as described by Clark et al. (16Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified by nested PCR with the following primers: Snrpn 5′ region (SNB1, 5′-GTGATGTTTGTAATTATTTGGGAG-3′ + SNB2, 5′-TTCACTACTAAAATCCACAAACC-3′, and SNB3N, 5′-ATTATTTTAGATTGATAGTG-3′ + SNB4, 5′-AATCCACAAACCCAACTAAC-3′). PCR products were cloned into a PCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. RNA FISH was performed as described (17Heard E. Rougeulle C. Arnaud D. Avner P. Allis C.D. Spector D.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). CITB mouse BAC 289D17 (clone obtained from Research Genetics) was used to detect Snrpn RNA; λ clone 510 was used to detectXist RNA. To determine whether parent-specific H3 Lys-9 methylation at the PWS-IC is present in somatic cells of the mouse, we studied a single base pair variation between C57Bl/6J and Mus musculus castaneus (Cast-Ei) mice, located 104 bp 5′ to the major site ofSnrpn transcription initiation. Somatic tissues from F1 hybrids between C57Bl/6J and Cast-Ei were subjected to ChIP with antibody to methyl Lys-9 H3; sequencing of genomic DNA from reciprocal hybrids showed equal peaks corresponding to each of the parental alleles, but sequencing of PCR-amplified ChIP DNA showed only the maternal allele from each of the crosses (Fig.1). Therefore, the maternal-specific association of methyl Lys-9 H3 with the PWS-IC region is conserved between human and mouse. To determine which histone methyltransferase(s) is required for H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC region in mouse, we examined ES cells homozygous for a targeted deletion of the gene encoding the G9a histone H3 Lys-9/Lys-27 methyltransferase (18Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 27: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Loss of G9a function causes loss of H3 Lys-9 methylation primarily in euchromatic regions, rather than in regions of centromeric heterochromatin, and mice homozygous for the G9a deletion die in midgestation (13Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). ES cells homozygous for the G9a deletion are viable (13Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Nozaki M. Ueda J. Ohta T. Ohki M. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Niida H. Kato H. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), and two independent G9a −/− ES cell lines both showed reduction of H3 Lys-9 methylation at the PWS-IC to ∼30% of G9a +/+ levels (Fig. 2). Total H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC in G9a −/− ES cells with aG9a transgene was similar to that in G9a +/+ ES cells (Fig. 2). G9a inactivation did not have any significant effect on the level of H3 Lys-4 methylation in the PWS-IC (Fig. 2). DNA from G9a +/+, +/−, and −/− ES cells was analyzed by bisulfite genomic sequencing (16Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) to determine the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides in the PWS-IC region. Seven out of ten clones from +/+ cells showed evidence of methylation at all or almost all CpG sites (Fig. 3), and five out of nine clones from +/− cells showed methylation at all or almost all sites (data not shown); by contrast, 32 clones from 3 G9a −/− cell lines showed no evidence of methylation at any CpG site (Fig. 3).G9a −/− cells with a G9a transgene showed no evidence of methylation at any CpG site (data not shown). We examined the role of G9a in control of imprinted Snrpnexpression by RNA FISH analysis of ES cell lines. SimultaneousXist RNA FISH was performed as a control as this transcript can normally be detected in almost 100% of undifferentiated male ES cells. Greater than 80% of G9a +/+ or +/− ES cells showed either a single Snrpn signal or one strong and one very weakG9a signal per nucleus (Fig.4, a and b); by contrast, >80% of G9a −/− ES cells from two lines showed two strong Snrpn hybridization signals, indicating biallelic expression (Fig. 4, c and d). The observation of one strong and one very weak Snrpn RNA FISH signal inG9a wild-type nuclei suggests that Snrpnimprinting in ES cells is slightly leaky, unlike the situation in somatic tissues; results consistent with this observation have been reported by Szabo and Mann (19Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Development. 1994; 120: 1651-1660PubMed Google Scholar). G9a −/− ES cells with aG9a transgene also showed two Snrpn signals in >80% of cells, although the intensity of the two signals within each nucleus tended to be less equal than in the G9a −/− ES cells (data not shown). We also tested methylation of CpG sites in the PWS-IC region in embryonic day 9.5 G9a +/+ and −/− embryos arising from heterozygote intercrosses. We found no significant difference between the CpG methylation patterns in G9a +/+ and −/− embryos (Fig. 5). To determine whether CpG methylation of the PWS-IC region is required for normal levels of H3 Lys-9 methylation, we performed bisulfite genomic sequencing and ChIP analysis of a Dnmt1 −/− ES cell line. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of 10 clones showed a complete absence of CpG methylation of the PWS-IC region (data not shown). ChIP analysis showed that the association of the PWS-IC region with methyl Lys-9 H3 was unaffected by targeted inactivation of the Dnmt1 maintenance DNA methyltransferase (Fig.6). RNA FISH analysis of theDnmt1 −/− ES cells showed that >80% of cells contained either a single Snrpn signal or one strong and one very weakG9a signal per nucleus, as in wild-type ES cells (Fig.7).Figure 7Dnmt1 −/− ES cells show normal monoallelic expression of Snrpn. RNA FISH analysis of Snrpn expression was performed in male ES cells.Red signal, Snrpn; green signal,Xist. Dnmt1 −/− ES cells show either a single strong Snrpn signal or one strong Snrpn signal and one very weak signal per nucleus, the same result observed in wild-type (G9a +/+) ES cells (Fig. 4). All cells have a single copy of Xist.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our data show that the PWS-IC is H3 Lys-9-methylated specifically on the maternal allele, that H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC region is reduced in G9a −/− ES cells, and that maternal-specific CpG methylation of the PWS-IC is lost in G9a −/− ES cells. Previous authors have suggested that CpG methylation of the maternal copies of some imprinting centers, established in the female germline, serves as the gametic imprint for coordinately regulated clusters of imprinted genes such as those in the PWS/AS region and in the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) region (1Ferguson-Smith A.C. Surani M.A. Science. 2001; 293: 1086-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Although mouse data showing CpG methylation of the PWS-IC and the BWS-IC2 in oocytes but not in sperm are consistent with this hypothesis (4Engemann S. Strodicke M. Paulsen M. Franck O. Reinhardt R. Lane N. Reik W. Walter J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2691-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 8Shemer R. Birger Y. Riggs A. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10267-10272Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the recent demonstration that the PWS-IC is completely unmethylated on CpG dinucleotides in human oocytes (9El-Maarri O. Buiting K. Peery E. Kroise P. Balaban B. Wagner K. Urman B. Heyd J. Lich C. Brannan C. Walter J. Horsthemke B. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) implies that parent-specific CpG methylation differences at the human PWS-IC occur after fertilization and that CpG methylation of the human PWS-IC cannot be the gametic imprint for the human AS/PWS region. Tamaru and Selker (11Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) have shown that CpG methylation inNeurospora requires the Dim-5 H3 Lys-9 methyltransferase, and Jackson et al. (12Jackson J.P. Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Nature. 2002; 416: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that CpNpG methylation in Arabidopsis is dependent on the H3 Lys-9 methyltransferase KYP. We have demonstrated that maintenance of CpG methylation at the PWS-IC in mouse ES cells is also dependent on an H3 Lys-9/Lys-27 methyltransferase, G9a. The mechanisms leading to dependence of cytosine methylation on histone H3 Lys-9 methyltransferases in these three systems have not yet been elucidated.G9a +/+ and −/− ES cells show no differences in DNA methyltransferase activities or in expression levels ofDnmt1, Dnmt3a, orDnmt3b. 2M. Tachibana and Y. Shinkai, unpublished data. The level of H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC in G9a −/− ES cells is reduced to ∼30% of that observed in G9a +/+ ES cells. The residual H3 Lys-9 methylation in G9a −/− ES cells must be maintained by a histone methyltransferase other than G9a; either the methyltransferase or the pattern of Lys-9 methylation catalyzed by that methyltransferase must be unable to participate in maintaining CpG methylation of the PWS-IC. We have shown that restoration of G9a function in G9a −/− ES cells with a transgene leads to near normal levels of H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC but does not restore CpG methylation or monoallelic Snrpn expression. This result suggests that although G9a is required for maintenance of CpG methylation at the PWS-IC in ES cells, its presence is not sufficient for de novo CpG methylation of the PWS-IC, which must require molecules that are not present in ES cells. Biniszkiewicz et al. (20Biniszkiewicz D. Gribnau J. Ramsahoye B. Gaudet F. Eggan K. Humpherys D. Mastrangelo M.-A. Jun Z. Walter J. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2124-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of Dnmt1 in Dnmt1−/− ES cells does not lead to CpG methylation of the Snrpnpromoter, and they have suggested that de novo CpG methylation of this region can occur only during gametogenesis.G9a transgene expression in G9a −/− ES cells is also clearly not a sufficient condition for monoallelic expression ofSnrpn. Although G9a −/− ES cells show complete loss of CpG methylation at the PWS-IC, we have seen no effect of the G9amutation on CpG methylation of these regulatory regions in embryonic day 9.5 embryos. The reason for this difference is unclear. In both cases, the observed cytosine methylation represents maintenance, rather than de novo, methylation. Our results may indicate the existence of histone methylation-independent mechanisms for maintenance of CpG methylation at imprinting centers in embryos but not in ES cells; alternatively, other H3 methyltransferases may compensate for loss of G9a function in embryos but not in ES cells. We have seen no effect of targeted mutation of the Dnmt1maintenance cytosine methyltransferase on H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC. In the ES cell system, dependence of CpG methylation of the PWS-IC on the G9a H3 Lys-9/Lys-27 methyltransferase does not appear to be accompanied by a reciprocal dependence of H3 Lys-9 methylation on CpG methylation. RNA FISH analysis of these Dnmt1 −/− ES cells showed normal monoallelic expression of Snrpn, indicating that CpG methylation of the PWS-IC is not required for monoallelic expression of Snrpn in ES cells. Previous studies of imprinted gene expression in undifferentiatedDnmt1 −/− ES cells have not distinguished monoallelic from biallelic expression; however, Tucker et al. (21Tucker K. Beard C. Dausman J. Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P. Lei H. Li E. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) showed that the level of expression of Igf2r, which is normally maternally expressed, is the same in Dnmt1 +/+ and −/− ES cells. Our results suggest that, in undifferentiated ES cells, histone H3 Lys-9 methylation is sufficient and CpG methylation is not required for maintenance of Snrpn monoallelic expression. We hypothesize that the pattern of H3 Lys-9 methylation of the PWS-IC inG9a −/− ES cells with a G9a transgene is not the normal pattern established during gametogenesis, both in terms of allele specificity and distribution on nucleosomes, and that this qualitative abnormality of H3 Lys-9 methylation accounts for the biallelic expression of Snrpn in these cells. This hypothesis is difficult to test because the parental ES cell line used in these studies contains very few heterozygous polymorphic sites so that it is not possible to test for allele-specific association of modified histones with the PWS-IC and because it is very difficult to assess the sensitivity of ChIP to the density of histone modifications. Previously we have proposed, based on our observations of maternal-specific association of methyl Lys-9 H3 with the PWS-IC and on the lack of CpG methylation of the PWS-IC in human oocytes, that H3 methylation may be the gametic imprint for the maternal allele of the human AS/PWS region and may trigger CpG methylation of the PWS-IC and parent-specific expression throughout the AS/PWS region after fertilization (10Xin Z. Allis C.D. Wagstaff J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1389-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The data presented here, showing dependence of CpG methylation at the mouse PWS-IC on the G9a histone methyltransferase, are completely consistent with this hypothesis. Most putative germline imprints involve repression on the maternal alleles (22Reik W. Walter J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and a histone-modification-based gametic imprint can only be carried on the maternal allele because histones are replaced by protamines during spermatogenesis. It is clear that the PWS-IC is CpG methylated in mouse oocytes, unlike the situation in human oocytes. We hypothesize that this difference does not reflect a fundamental difference between mice and human in the imprinting process, but rather that the difference is in the timing of histone methylation-dependent CpG methylation: prefertilization in the mouse, postfertilization in human. Our data do not address the question of the role of G9a and histone methylation in the establishment of imprints in the germline; an answer to this question will require conditional knockouts ofG9a and other histone methyltransferases limited to the germline.

P2X7receptors have two transmembrane domains with intracellular amino and carboxyl termini, and the P2X7 receptor differs from other members of the P2X receptor family in having a long carboxyl terminus of 240 amino acids from the inner membrane face (11Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5482-5486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar).

Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). P2X7 has an oligomeric structure in the membrane based on trimeric or larger complexes of identical subunits (13Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G.

Jiang L.-H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a tyrosine at amino acid 343 of the P2X7primary structure has been proposed as being important for maintaining the full activity of the P2X7 channel (15Kim M. Jiang L.-H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).A number of regulatory domains or motifs have been identified in the intracellular carboxyl tail based on homology with other proteins. These include a potential Src homology 3 binding domain (amino acids 450–456) and an ankyrin repeat motif (amino acids 494–508) (16Denlinger L.C. Fisette L. Sommer J.A. Watters J.J. Prabhu U. Dubyak G.R. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1871-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Ankyrin repeats have been shown to play a major structural role in protein anchoring to the membrane or cytoskeleton, protein folding, and protein-protein interaction (17Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1binding motif with homology to the LPS-binding protein of plasma (16Denlinger L.C. Fisette L. Sommer J.A. Watters J.J. Prabhu U. Dubyak G.R. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1871-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) has been proposed between amino acids 573 and 590, whereas we have shown that a region within this motif (amino acids 551–581) is necessary for the surface expression of P2X7 (19Smart M.L.

Upstream from this motif we have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (1513A→C), present in around 207 of the population, which changes Glu to Ala at amino acid 496 and which leads to loss of function of the receptor (20Gu B.J. Zhang W.Y. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11135-11142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Surface expression of P2X7 on lymphocytes was not affected by the Glu-496 to Ala polymorphism, suggesting that the loss of function resulted from impaired protein-protein interactions in the P2X7 complex at the cell membrane rather than from trafficking to the surface (20Gu B.J. Zhang W.Y. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11135-11142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the functional effects of a second polymorphism of the humanP2X7 gene (thymine to adenine at position 1729 of cDNA) that is associated with loss of function of the P2X7receptor because of failure of its trafficking to the cell surface. This polymorphism changes Ile to Asn at amino acid 568, which localizes this residue as being within a trafficking motif in the carboxyl tail of the receptor.DISCUSSIONThe present study has identified a single nucleotide polymorphism that leads to a loss of function of P2X7because of a trafficking defect in this receptor. This polymorphism was at position 1729T→A of the cDNA that changes isoleucine to asparagine at amino acid position 568. Three of 85 normal subjects were found to be heterozygous for this polymorphic variation, and all three had half-normal expression of the P2X7 on the cell surface and reduction of P2X7 function to ∼257 of normal. Transfection experiments provided confirmation that the Ile-568 to Asn-mutated P2X7 fails to traffic to the cell surface. HEK-293 cells transfected with this mutated P2X7 showed neither surface expression nor function despite plentiful intracellular synthesis of this receptor (Figs. 4 and 5). In other experiments, we measured the physiological properties of the Ile-568 to Asn-mutated P2X7 in Xenopus oocytes and found channel currents in oocytes that were identical to those with the wild type P2X7 construct. 2M. L. Smart, unpublished observations. This result shows that the Ile-568 to Asn mutation does not alter the function of the P2X7 channel, although this result shows differences in trafficking between the mammalian and amphibian expression systems. A number of functional domains have been proposed in the long carboxyl terminus of P2X7 based on protein sequence homology. The most distal of these, the “LPS-binding domain” from amino acids 573 to 590, has homology with the LPS-binding protein of plasma and has been suggested to interact directly with internalized LPS (16Denlinger L.C. Fisette L. Sommer J.A. Watters J.J. Prabhu U. Dubyak G.R. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1871-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Using a series of truncated mutants of rat P2X7, we have identified previously a region between residues 551 and 581 that is both highly conserved and necessary for the surface expression of this receptor (19Smart M.L. Gu B. Panchel R.G. Wiley J. Cromer B. Williams D.A. Petrou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8853-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved residues at Cys-572, Arg-574, and Phe-581 abolished both cell surface expression and receptor function (19Smart M.L. Gu B. Panchel R.G. Wiley J. Cromer B. Williams D.A. Petrou S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8853-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), suggesting that the trafficking domain of P2X7 overlaps the putative LPS-binding domain. The present data add the conserved Ile-568 to the other residues within this trafficking domain required for cell surface expression of P2X7. Whether this domain binds directly to phospholipid or to one of the many protein partners in the P2X7 membrane complex (15Kim M. Jiang L.-H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) is uncertain. However, this domain includes a conserved cysteine, palmitoylation of which is required for cell surface expression in a number of other receptors such as CCR5 (28Blanpain C. Wittamer V. Vanderwinden J.M. Boom A. Renneboog B. Lee B. Le Poul E. El Asmar L. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol.

Recently, P2X4 but not P2X2receptors have been shown to undergo constitutive endocytosis in neurons (29Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4814-4824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether P2X7 also undergoes constitutive endocytosis is unknown, but the lack of 1729T→A-mutated P2X7 expressed on the surface of HEK-293 cells may be because of the rapid endocytosis of the receptor after initial trafficking to the cell surface. This, however, seems unlikely, as we failed to detect mutant P2X7 on the surface of HEK-293 cells using either flow cytometry or confocal microscopy.Wide variations in the function of the P2X7 receptor have been observed in lymphocytes both from normal subjects (20Gu B.J. Zhang W.Y. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol.

Gallo J. Manoharan A. Lancet. 2002; 359: 1114-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Some but not all of this variability is a result of a single nucleotide polymorphism (1513A→C) that changes Glu-496 to Ala and leads to loss of function without affecting surface expression of the receptor in lymphocytes (20Gu B.J. Zhang W.Y. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11135-11142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The trafficking-defective polymorphism identified in the present study, Ile-568 to Asn, contributes to this variability in P2X7function but with a lower heterozygote prevalence of ∼47 compared with ∼207 for the more common Glu-496 to Ala variation. Collectively, however, these two genotypes still do not account for all individuals with low or absent P2X7 function (20Gu B.J. Zhang W.Y. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A.

The coding region within exon 13 of the P2X7 gene is highly polymorphic with five single nucleotide polymorphisms identified within a 0.5-kb stretch of cDNA, 3C. Li, R. Sluyter, B. J. Gu, and J. S. Wiley, unpublished observations. and it is likely that other loss-of-function polymorphisms exist in the P2X7gene, both within the coding region and in the upstream promoter of this gene (31Li C.M.

Recently a polymorphism affecting the function of the mouse P2X7 receptor has been recognized in inbred strains of mice. Although most strains of mice carried Pro-451 with good P2X7 function, C57BL and DBA strains possessed a Leu-451 allele with lower P2X7 function (32Adriouch S. Dox C. Welge V. Seman M. Koch-Nolte F. Haag F. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4108-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Whether the recognition or docking sequence around residue 451 lies within a domain interacting with a Src homology 3-binding protein is not known. We have surveyed 99 human base sequences coding for residue 451 but have found no deviations from the wild type sequence. 4C. Li and J. S. Wiley, unpublished observations. An increasing number of channelopathies have been associated with human disease. Thus hypokalemic periodic paralysis and familial hemiplegic migraine result from missense or point mutations in a voltage-sensitive calcium channel (33Jurkat-Rott K. Lehmann-Horn F. Elbaz A. Heine R.

There is increasing interest in channelopathies that affect cells of the immune system and the impact of reduced or absent P2X7 channel function on human susceptibility to infectious diseases. P2X7 receptor expression is up-regulated on differentiation of monocytes to macrophages (27Hickman S.E. El Khoury J. Greenberg S. Schieren I. Silverstein S.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2452-2456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where its activation is necessary both for the ATP-induced killing of ingested mycobacterial species and for the subsequent apoptotic death of this phagocytic cell (37Lammas D.A.

Whether Asn-568 (1729A allele) as well as Ala-496 (1513C allele) contribute to the genetic susceptibility to tuberculous infection is uncertain, although macrophages from subjects heterozygous for Asn-568 failed to up-regulate P2X7 function to the same extent as wild type subjects (Fig. 6). Although a mouse strain of P2X7-null genotype has been developed, there is no distinctive adverse phenotype of this animal (40Solle M. Labasi J. Perregaux D.G. Stam E. Petrushova N. Koller B.H.

However, the severity of inflammatory arthritis induced by anti-collagen antibody was markedly attenuated in these animals (41Labasi J.M. Petrushova N. Donovan C. McCurdy S. Lira P. Payette M.M.

It seems likely that the P2X7 receptor and its polymorphic variants will be central in our understanding of certain inflammatory and infectious diseases. The purinergic P2X7 receptor is a ligand-gated channel, selective for cationic permeants, which has a wide distribution including cells of the immune and hemopoietic system (1Di Virgilio F.

Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Activation of this receptor by brief exposure to extracellular ATP opens a channel that allows Ca2+ and Na+ influx and K+ efflux and that initiates a cascade of intracellular downstream events.

Mutation of the conserved residues at Cys-572, Arg-574, and Phe-581 abolished both cell surface expression and receptor function (19Smart M.L. Gu B. Panchel R.G. Wiley J. Cromer B. Williams D.A.

The present data add the conserved Ile-568 to the other residues within this trafficking domain required for cell surface expression of P2X7. Whether this domain binds directly to phospholipid or to one of the many protein partners in the P2X7 membrane complex (15Kim M. Jiang L.-H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A.

However, this domain includes a conserved cysteine, palmitoylation of which is required for cell surface expression in a number of other receptors such as CCR5 (28Blanpain C. Wittamer V.

Recently, P2X4 but not P2X2receptors have been shown to undergo constitutive endocytosis in neurons (29Bobanovic L.K. Royle S.J. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J.

Whether P2X7 also undergoes constitutive endocytosis is unknown, but the lack of 1729T→A-mutated P2X7 expressed on the surface of HEK-293 cells may be because of the rapid endocytosis of the receptor after initial trafficking to the cell surface. This, however, seems unlikely, as we failed to detect mutant P2X7 on the surface of HEK-293 cells using either flow cytometry or confocal microscopy.Wide variations in the function of the P2X7 receptor have been observed in lymphocytes both from normal subjects (20Gu B.J.

Some but not all of this variability is a result of a single nucleotide polymorphism (1513A→C) that changes Glu-496 to Ala and leads to loss of function without affecting surface expression of the receptor in lymphocytes (20Gu B.J. Zhang W.Y. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11135-11142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The trafficking-defective polymorphism identified in the present study, Ile-568 to Asn, contributes to this variability in P2X7function but with a lower heterozygote prevalence of ∼47 compared with ∼207 for the more common Glu-496 to Ala variation. Collectively, however, these two genotypes still do not account for all individuals with low or absent P2X7 function (20Gu B.J. Zhang W.Y. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A.

The coding region within exon 13 of the P2X7 gene is highly polymorphic with five single nucleotide polymorphisms identified within a 0.5-kb stretch of cDNA, 3C. Li, R. Sluyter, B. J. Gu, and J. S.

Recently a polymorphism affecting the function of the mouse P2X7 receptor has been recognized in inbred strains of mice. Although most strains of mice carried Pro-451 with good P2X7 function, C57BL and DBA strains possessed a Leu-451 allele with lower P2X7 function (32Adriouch S. Dox C. Welge V. Seman M. Koch-Nolte F.

An increasing number of channelopathies have been associated with human disease.

There is increasing interest in channelopathies that affect cells of the immune system and the impact of reduced or absent P2X7 channel function on human susceptibility to infectious diseases. P2X7 receptor expression is up-regulated on differentiation of monocytes to macrophages (27Hickman S.E. El Khoury J. Greenberg S. Schieren I. Silverstein S.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 2452-2456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where its activation is necessary both for the ATP-induced killing of ingested mycobacterial species and for the subsequent apoptotic death of this phagocytic cell (37Lammas D.A.

Whether Asn-568 (1729A allele) as well as Ala-496 (1513C allele) contribute to the genetic susceptibility to tuberculous infection is uncertain, although macrophages from subjects heterozygous for Asn-568 failed to up-regulate P2X7 function to the same extent as wild type subjects (Fig. 6). Although a mouse strain of P2X7-null genotype has been developed, there is no distinctive adverse phenotype of this animal (40Solle M. Labasi J. Perregaux D.G. Stam E. Petrushova N. Koller B.H.

However, the severity of inflammatory arthritis induced by anti-collagen antibody was markedly attenuated in these animals (41Labasi J.M. Petrushova N. Donovan C. McCurdy S. Lira P. Payette M.M. Brissette W. Wicks J.R. Audoly L. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6436-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the P2X7 receptor and its polymorphic variants will be central in our understanding of certain inflammatory and infectious diseases. The present study has identified a single nucleotide polymorphism that leads to a loss of function of P2X7because of a trafficking defect in this receptor. This polymorphism was at position 1729T→A of the cDNA that changes isoleucine to asparagine at amino acid position 568. Three of 85 normal subjects were found to be heterozygous for this polymorphic variation, and all three had half-normal expression of the P2X7 on the cell surface and reduction of P2X7 function to ∼257 of normal. Transfection experiments provided confirmation that the Ile-568 to Asn-mutated P2X7 fails to traffic to the cell surface. HEK-293 cells transfected with this mutated P2X7 showed neither surface expression nor function despite plentiful intracellular synthesis of this receptor (Figs. 4 and 5). In other experiments, we measured the physiological properties of the Ile-568 to Asn-mutated P2X7 in Xenopus oocytes and found channel currents in oocytes that were identical to those with the wild type P2X7 construct. 2M. L. Smart, unpublished observations. This result shows that the Ile-568 to Asn mutation does not alter the function of the P2X7 channel, although this result shows differences in trafficking between the mammalian and amphibian expression systems. A number of functional domains have been proposed in the long carboxyl terminus of P2X7 based on protein sequence homology. The most distal of these, the “LPS-binding domain” from amino acids 573 to 590, has homology with the LPS-binding protein of plasma and has been suggested to interact directly with internalized LPS (16Denlinger L.C.

Here we show that p300 and CBP co-activate TFAP2A in the presence of CITED2. TFAP2A transcriptional activity was modestly impaired in p300+/− and CBP+/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts; this was rescued by ectopic expression of p300/CBP. p300, TFAP2A, and endogenous CITED2 could be co-immunoprecipitated from transfected U2-OS cells indicating that they can interact physically in vivo. CITED2 interacted with the dimerization domain of TFAP2C, which is highly conserved in TFAP2A/B. In mammalian two-hybrid experiments, full-length p300 and TFAP2A interacted only when CITED2 was co-transfected. N-terminal residues of TFAP2A, containing the transactivation domain, are both necessary and sufficient for interaction with p300, and this interaction was independent of CITED2. Consistent with this, N-terminal residues of TFAP2A were required for p300- and CITED2-dependent co-activation. A histone acetyltransferase-deficient p300 mutant (D1399Y) did not co-activate TFAP2A and did not affect the expression or cellular localization of TFAP2A or CITED2. In mammalian two-hybrid experiments p300D1399Y failed to interact with TFAP2A, explaining, at least in part, its failure to function as a co-activator. Our results suggest a model wherein interactions among TFAP2A, CITED2, and p300/CBP are necessary for TFAP2A-mediated transcriptional activation and for normal neural tube and cardiac development."

The monomeric PSI reaction center complex is composed of more than 11 different proteins, of which the PsaA and PsaB are functionally the most important since they bind the majority of the chlorophyll (Chl) and redox-active cofactors involved in energy conversion and charge separation. Recently a high resolution structure of PSI isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has been obtained at 2.5 Å resolution (2Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). This work revealed the precise organization of the transmembrane helices of PsaA and PsaB proteins together with the redox active cofactors and Chls they bind. Surrounding these two proteins are other, smaller transmembrane PSI subunits of which some, namely PsaJ, PsaK, PsaL, PsaM, and PsaX, were also shown to directly or indirectly bind Chl a in the x-ray structure of cyanobacterial PSI and are likely to aid or regulate excitation energy transfer within the PSI complex. In addition, three stromally bound extrinsic proteins, PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE, optimize the binding of the mobile electron carriers ferredoxin or flavodoxin prior to reduction of NADP+ with PsaC containing the iron-sulfur centers FA and FB (1Chitnis P.R. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In higher plants, green algae, and red algae, the outer light-harvesting system associated with PSI is made up of Lhca proteins that are encoded by the cab genes and known collectively as LHCI (light-harvesting complex I) (3Green B.R. Durnford D.G. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1996; 47: 685-714Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of Lhca proteins in vivo is as yet not well understood but is often assumed to be dimeric, with each Lhca monomer having a structure similar to that of the related Lhcb proteins of the LHCII complex of photosystem II (PSII), which has been determined to 3.4 Å (4Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Note that in cyanobacteria another type of outer light-harvesting system is present, composed of phycobiliproteins encoded by apc andcpc genes (5Glazer A.N. Gindt Y.M. Chan C.F. Sauer K. Photosynthesis Res. 1994; 40: 167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which may, under some circumstances, attach to the stromal surface of the PSI core complex, although this has yet to be shown conclusively. Under conditions of iron deficiency, however, cyanobacteria form an additional outer light-harvesting system, composed of an 18-subunit membrane-intrinsic antenna “ring” around a PSI trimeric reaction center core (6Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 7Boekema E.J. Hifneg A. Yakushevska A.E. Piotrowski M. Keegstra W. Berry S. Michel K.P. Pistorius E.K. Kruip J. Nature. 2001; 412: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The subunit is the Chla-binding protein encoded by the isiA gene, which is homologous to the CP43 Chl a-binding protein of PSII. A similar protein, known as Pcb, which binds both Chl a and Chl b has also been found to form an 18-subunit light-harvesting antenna ring around trimeric PSI of the prochlorophyteProchlorococcus marinus SS120 (8Bibby T.S. Nield J. Partensky F. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 413: 590Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To date all studies of the structure of PSI have concluded that unlike cyanobacteria, PSI is monomeric in higher plants and green algae (9Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Some studies have explored the structural basis by which LHCI acts as the outer light-harvesting system of PSI. Indeed, Boekema et al. (10Boekema E.J. Jensen P.E. Schlodder E. van Breemen J.F. van Roon H. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) concluded that in spinach the Lhca proteins were bound to one side of the PSI monomer. The increase in antenna size by 100 Chla would correspond to the association of eight subunits of Lhca proteins with the PSI reaction center assuming that each subunit binds 12 Chl molecules as does the Lhcb monomer (4Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). However, unlike LHCII, the Chl a/b ratio is higher for LHCI, often assumed to be 3.3 or more (11Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Scheller H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Bassi R. Soen S.Y. Frank G. Zuber H. Rochaix J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25714-25721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) compared with 1.4 for LHCII (4Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). Also it has been found that higher plant Lhca proteins bind 10 Chls (11Croce R. Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Scheller H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Boekema et al. (10Boekema E.J. Jensen P.E. Schlodder E. van Breemen J.F. van Roon H. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) also noted that according to their interpretation of images derived from electron microscopy and single particle analysis, the positioning of LHCI on the outer side of the PSI reaction center would not preclude the possibility that under some conditions PSI of higher plants and green algae could form trimers similar to those found in cyanobacteria. Indeed PSI from these eukaryotic organisms contains the PsaL subunit, which in cyanobacteria is required for the stabilization of trimeric PSI (13Chitnis P. Chitnis P.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii we set out to examine the oligomeric state of PSI in this green alga and establish structural details of the arrangement of LHCI with the reaction center core. A LHCI-PSI supercomplex preparation has been isolated using a His-tagged mutant. Projection maps of PSI with and without LHCI components bound have been obtained by electron microscopy and single particle image processing of negatively stained preparations. By difference mapping and by modeling in higher resolution structures of the underlying intrinsic proteins derived from x-ray diffraction studies (2Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar) and electron crystallography (4Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar), these maps have provided information about the number and positioning of the Lhca proteins within the supercomplex. The C. reinhardtii mutant psb d-His containing C-terminal fusion of a His6 tag with the D2 protein (14Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Minagawa J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was kindly donated by J. Minagawa (Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan). Cells were grown in Tris acetate-phosphate medium (15Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) to exponential growth phase. Thylakoid membranes were isolated from 20 liters of cultures by a procedure of Diner and Wollman (16Diner B.A. Wollman F.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 400 mm sorbitol/5 mm Hepes-OH, pH 7.5/15 mm NaCl/10 mm MgCl2. LHCI-PSI supercomplexes were purified from the thylakoids by a modified method of Fischer et al. (17Fischer N. Setif P. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were harvested at 149,000 × g for 30 min, washed with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/15 mm NaCl/10 mm MgCl2, centrifuged as above, and resuspended in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at a chlorophyll concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. The membranes were solubilized with 0.9% (w/v) β-d-dodecyl-maltoside (DDM) on ice in the dark for 20 min and then centrifuged at 48,400 × g for 25 min to remove insoluble material. To remove His-tagged PSII complexes, solubilized membranes were incubated with equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) at a 4:1 (v/v) ratio for 1 h in the dark. Partially PSII-depleted samples (unbound fraction) were subjected to fractionation on continuous sucrose density gradients prepared by the modified “freeze-thaw” method (18Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with the interim buffer composed of 0.5 m sucrose/5 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8/0.05% DDM/0.5 m betaine. The LHCI-PSI supercomplexes were observed in the lowest, most dense green fraction of the gradient. LHCI complexes were purified as described in Croce et al. (19Croce R. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17355-17360Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using the Tris-Tricine system described by Schägger and von Jagow (20Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Protein bands were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 6 m urea and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 using standard procedures. For Western blotting, proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (BioRad) in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11/10% methanol using Mini-Trans-Blot apparatus (BioRad), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against maize LHCI complex and Chlamydomonas psa gene products, kindly donated by R. Bassi (University of Verona, Verona, Italy) and J.-D. Rochaix (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland), respectively. C. reinhardtii Lhca3- and Lhcb1-specific polyclonal antisera were kindly provided by M. Hippler (University of Jena, Jena, Germany). Anti-Lhcb2 and anti-phosphothreonine polyclonal antisera were purchased from AgriSera and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Blots were developed with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocomplexes were visualized by the ECL method using a SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (Pierce). Optical absorption spectra were measured at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer with a 2-nm slit size. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrometer LS 50 at 77 K and an excitation wavelength of 435 nm. For the P700+ measurements, PSI complexes were diluted to 20 μg/ml Chl in 50 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.5/10 mm CaCl2/0.05% DDM. P700+ was quantified by measuring absorbance changes at 700 nm in the presence of 0.2 mmdichlorophenolindophenol, 2 mm ascorbate as a reductant, and 0.5 mm ferricyanide as an oxidant as described in Marsho and Kok (21Marsho T.V. Kok B. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 515-522Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reverse phase HPLC pigment analyses to determine Chl a/b ratios were performed according to Zheleva et al. (22Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15074-15079Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The samples were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate by the droplet method and imaged using a Philips CM100 electron microscope (EM) at 80 kV. Phase contrast was introduced by defocusing the microscope whereby the first minima of the contrast transfer function (23Ruprecht J. Nield J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 75: 121-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was subsequently calculated to fall consistently in the range of 18–22 Å. Subsequent image analyses were conducted using the best 23 micrographs, imaged at 51,500× and displaying minimal or no discernible astigmatism and drift, of the C. reinhardtii LHCI-PSI supercomplex fraction. In addition, 11 micrographs for the PSI monomer/PSII dimer fraction were selected through similar criteria. The micrographs were digitized using a Leafscan 45 densitometer at a step-size of 10 μm (1.94 Å per pixel on the specimen scale). All image processing was performed within the Imagic-5 software environment (24Orlova E.V. Serysheva I.I. van Heel M. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), running under the Linux operating system on dual processor PC computers. For the LHCI-PSI supercomplex a data set of 8,950 single particle images was obtained by interactively picking all discernible particles that were not overlapping or in close contact with other particles, and each image was floated into a 96 × 96 pixel box. A similar data set of 3300 images was picked from micrographs of the C. reinhardtii PSI/PSII fraction. Images of the particles were coarsened by a factor of 2–3.88 Å per pixel to aid the speed of subsequent processing. An analysis of these two data sets was made starting with the reference-free alignment-by-classification procedure (26Schatz M. van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1990; 32: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This identified several particle subpopulations of differing size and shape in each preparation. These subpopulations were in turn analyzed independently, with the reference-free alignment giving the initial class averages necessary for multireference alignments, eventually leading to averages with enhanced signal to noise ratios after iterative refinement (23Ruprecht J. Nield J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 75: 121-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Relative orientations were determined for the class averages by the angular reconstitution technique (27van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), resulting in initial three-dimensional reconstructions gained from implementation of the exact back projection technique (28Radermacher M. J. Electron Microsc. (Tokyo). 1988; 9: 359-394Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Reprojections were taken from each three-dimensional model and used to identify additional atypical views and to further refine the class averages within each subpopulation data set. The resolution was estimated by Fourier shell correlation between two independent three-dimensional reconstructions (23Ruprecht J. Nield J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 75: 121-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PDB coordinate data sets derived for a monomer of LHCII, a kind gift of W. Kühlbrandt, Frankfurt, Germany, calculated at 3.4 Å resolution by electron crystallography (4Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) and the 2.5 Å resolution PSI monomer (PDB accession number 1JB0; http://www.rcsb.org) from the cyanobacteriumS. elongatus (2Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar) were modeled into the reconstructions using the “O” modeling software package (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). After solubilization with DDM, PSII was partially removed by nickel affinity chromatography and the remaining fraction was subjected to sucrose density centrifugation. Three Chl-containing bands were obtained (F1, F2, and F3), and absorption spectroscopy identified the top fraction (F1) as LHC proteins having an absorption maximum at 673 nm and a shoulder at 653 nm due to Chl b. Fig.1 a shows strong absorption in the 450–500 nm range, in part due to Chl b (peaking at 476 nm) and in part due to the presence of carotenoids in the F1 fraction. F2 (Fig. 1 a) is characterized by the lack of Chlb absorption and a red shift of the long wavelength absorption peak to 676 nm compared with F1 (Fig. 1 a). In contrast the densest fraction (F3) showed some Chl babsorption at 653 nm and 467 nm and had maximum long wavelength absorption at 680 nm. Low temperature fluorescence was measured at 77 K for each band. The emission profile peaking at 681 nm for the top band is consistent with it containing free Lhc proteins. The middle fraction (F2) showed a broad emission spectrum peaking at 686 nm but having significant contribution beyond 700 nm. This broad, low temperature fluorescence spectrum is indicative of a mixture of PSII (emission <700 nm) and PSI (emission >700 nm). However, the fluorescence spectrum of F3 peaks at 715 nm, which implies that it is highly enriched in PSI. Reverse phase HPLC pigment analyses of the F3 sample gave a Chl a/b ratio of ∼4.5. To characterize further each fraction of the sucrose density gradient SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses were conducted. As shown in Fig.2 a, the top fraction (F1) was enriched in polypeptides, mainly LHCII but also LHCI as confirmed by immunoblotting (see Fig. 2 b). On the other hand, none of the PSI antibodies raised to the proteins of the reaction center core of PSI cross-reacted with proteins in this fraction. According to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, F2 contained a range of proteins consistent with it being a mixture of PSI and PSII core proteins, while the LHC protein level was generally lower in this fraction compared with F1. F3 was distinguished by having no cross-reactions with antibodies raised to PSII (D1-antibody) or to LHCII antibodies raised against Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 (see Fig. 2 b). On the other hand the SDS-PAGE profile and immunoblotting showed that F3 contains the PSI core subunits, PsaA/B, PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, and PsaF. Moreover polypeptides having apparent molecular masses in the range 22–30 kDa were present in F3. Immunoblotting showed these to be proteins of LHCI, and in particular Lhca3 was identified by a specific antibody response. The protein analysis shown in Fig. 2 seems to indicate that the dense fraction (F3) separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation consists of a supercomplex composed of PSI and its associated light harvesting Lhca proteins. To dissociate the Lhca proteins from the PSI reaction center core we treated the F3 fraction with 0.6% zwittergent 16 plus 1% DDM, and separated the solubilized products by sucrose density centrifugation. Despite the relatively strong solubilizing conditions used, we were unable to remove all the Lhca subunits from the PSI reaction center core. Those that were removed formed a band at the top of the sucrose gradient, and SDS-PAGE analyses coupled with immunoblotting showed that several different types of Lhca proteins were present (see Fig. 3 a inset), including Lhca3 (Western blot, not shown). The absorption spectrum of this LHCI fraction is shown in Fig.3 a, and its emission in Fig. 3 b. Reverse phase HPLC analyses gave a Chl a/b ratio of 2 for this LHCI fraction. Both spectra contrast with the corresponding spectra obtained with the F1 fraction shown in Fig. 1 a in that they have long wavelength maxima that are blue-shifted. Moreover, the lower level of Chl b is evident in the absorption spectrum of the Lhca proteins in comparison to F1 (compare Figs. 1 a and3 a). The differences between this LHCI fraction and fraction F1 are consistent with the presence of a significant level of LHCII proteins in the latter. To investigate further the nature of the LHCI-PSI complex in F3, the contents of this fraction were viewed by EM after negative staining and the images processed by single particle analysis. Fig. 4 a shows an averaged top view obtained by processing 8950 particles, which has maximum dimensions of 220 × 180 Å. To interpret this projection map the EM structure of the PSI complex of Chlamydomonas, free of LHCI protein, was investigated. To this end, images of fraction F2 were recorded and subjected to single particle analysis. After multistatistical analysis of the data set it was clear that the F2 fraction contained two subpopulations based on their surface area and differences in domain organization. The subpopulation with a two-domain character were assigned to the PSII dimeric core present in F2, which is known to have dimensions of 220 × 150 Å in negative stain (not shown) (30Büchel C. Morris E. Orlova E. Barber J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Boekema E.J. Hankamer B. Bald D. Kruip J. Nield J. Boonstra A.F. Barber J. Rögner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), while the other major population contains particles having a single domain and dimensions of 150 × 100 Å, indicative of a PSI core monomer. Fig. 4 c shows the average top view of the Chlamydomonas PSI monomer obtained by processing 680 particles. Of note is that neither in fractions F2 nor F3 did we observe larger particles that would suggest oligomerization of the PSI monomer and, in particular, the existence of a trimer similar to that found for PSI in cyanobacteria (2Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). The LHCI-PSI supercomplex projection shown in Fig. 4 a has strong density features along one side. We assign these features to the Lhca proteins present. To focus on and improve the quality of these features, we overlaid the PSI monomer projection onto the projection of the supercomplex and used this as a mask to conduct further rounds of image analyses utilizing the whole supercomplex data set. The resulting image is shown in Fig. 4 b. The overlaying of the PSI monomer projection onto that of the supercomplex was aided by reference to the x-ray structure of PSI derived by Jordan et al. (2Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). In the x-ray map the PsaL subunit, with its three transmembrane helices, forms a distinctive bulge at one end of the monomer. We therefore assumed that a similar feature in the projection maps of the supercomplex and monomer (starred in Fig. 4, a and c) are due to PsaL and used this for an approximate alignment of the maps (Fig. 4 d). This comparison further suggests that the top views of the supercomplex and monomer (shown in Fig. 4, aand c) are being viewed from the stromal side since the feature assigned to PsaL lies left of center in the stromal top view of the x-ray-derived PSI asymmetric monomer (see red ring; Fig.4 d). As our native EM data set contained images of the LHCI-PSI supercomplex in different orientations we have obtained a range of class averages and calculated a low resolution, three-dimensional model. Fig.5 shows typical class averages taken from the total pool of 76 class averages and shows a range of orientations. All 76 class averages were used to construct the three-dimensional model presented in Fig. 5 c as surface-rendered views and at the same orientation as the class averages given in Fig. 5 a. The calculated projections derived from the three-dimensional model are shown in Fig. 5 b and, according to Fourier shell correlation analysis, have a resolution of about 30 Å. First, we conclude that using mild isolation conditions we have not identified a trimeric form of PSI in Chlamydomonas as typically found in cyanobacteria (1Chitnis P.R. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N.

The monomeric nature of PSI in higher plants and green algae has also been concluded by others (9Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 10Boekema E.J. Jensen P.E. Schlodder E. van Breemen J.F. van Roon H. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P.

On the other hand Chlamydomonas has a dimeric PSII reaction center core similar to that found in higher plants and cyanobacteria (30Büchel C. Morris E. Orlova E. Barber J. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1988730256,"The acoustic features useful for converting auditory information into perceived objects are poorly understood. Although auditory cortex neurons have been described as being narrowly tuned and preferentially responsive to narrowband signals, naturally occurring sounds are generally wideband with unique spectral energy profiles. Through the use of parametric wideband acoustic stimuli, we found that such neurons in awake marmoset monkeys respond vigorously to wideband sounds having complex spectral shapes, preferring stimuli of either high or low spectral contrast. Low contrast-preferring neurons cannot be studied thoroughly with narrowband stimuli and have not been previously described. These findings indicate that spectral contrast reflects an important stimulus decomposition in auditory cortex and may contribute to the recognition of acoustic objects."
https://openalex.org/W2078431575,"G2A, a G protein-coupled receptor for which lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a high affinity ligand, belongs to a newly defined lysophospholipid receptor subfamily. Expression of G2A is transcriptionally up-regulated by stress-inducing and cell-damaging agents, and ectopic expression of G2A leads to growth inhibition. However, the G proteins that functionally couple to G2A have not been elucidated in detail. We report here that G2A ligand independently stimulates the accumulation of both inositol phosphates and cAMP. LPC does not further enhance inositol phosphate accumulation but dose-dependently augments intracellular cAMP concentration. Expression of Gαq and Gα13 with G2A potentiates G2A-mediated activation of a NF-κB-luciferase reporter. These results demonstrate that G2A differentially couples to multiple G proteins including Gαs, Gαq, and Gα13, depending on whether it is bound to ligand. G2A-transfected HeLa cells display apoptotic signs including membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, G2A-induced apoptosis can be rescued by the caspase inhibitors, z-vad-fmk and CrmA. Although apoptosis occurs without LPC stimulation, LPC further enhances G2A-mediated apoptosis and correlates with its ability to induce cAMP elevation in both HeLa cells and primary lymphocytes. Rescue from G2A-induced apoptosis was achieved by co-expression of a Gα12/13-specific inhibitor, p115RGS (regulator of G proteinsignaling), in combination with 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine treatment. These results demonstrate the ability of G2A to activate a specific combination of G proteins, and that G2A/LPC-induced apoptosis involves both Gα13- and Gαs-mediated pathways. G2A, a G protein-coupled receptor for which lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a high affinity ligand, belongs to a newly defined lysophospholipid receptor subfamily. Expression of G2A is transcriptionally up-regulated by stress-inducing and cell-damaging agents, and ectopic expression of G2A leads to growth inhibition. However, the G proteins that functionally couple to G2A have not been elucidated in detail.

G2A, named for its ability to cause accumulation of cells in G2/M of the cell cycle, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorLPClysophosphatidylcholineInsPinositol phosphatePTXpertussis toxinERKextracellular signal-related kinaseDDAdideoxyadenosineRGSregulator of G protein signalingβARKβ-adrenergic receptor kinasezbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketoneTMREtetramethylrhodamine ethyl esterIBMXisobutylmethylxanthineNF-κBnuclear factor κ BGFPgreen fluorescent proteinKSHVKaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpes virusEdgendothelial differentiation geneDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumRTreverse transcriptionctcarboxyl terminusGRKG protein-coupled receptor kinase with tumor suppressor-like properties (1Weng Z.

Ectopic expression of G2A in fibroblasts antagonizes BCR-ABL-mediated transformation. Unlike most GPCRs, the expression of G2A is up-regulated by various DNA-damaging and stress-inducing stimuli (1Weng Z. Fluckiger A.C. Nisitani S. Wahl M.I. Le L.Q. Hunter C.A. Fernal A.A.

It was recently reported that targeted deletion of the mouse G2A gene results in the development of a late-onset autoimmunity resembling systemic lupus erythematosus (2Le L.Q. Kabarowski J.H. Weng Z.

T lymphocytes isolated from these mice display enhanced sensitivity and proliferative responses to T cell receptor stimulation, suggesting that G2A may negatively regulate peripheral lymphocyte numbers or increase the threshold required for T cell receptor activation (2Le L.Q.

Because immune cells that recognize self-antigens are destined for self-destruction and routinely undergo apoptosis, disruption of this process can lead to autoimmunity (3Hilderman D.A. Zhu Y. Mitchell T.C. Kappler J. Marrack P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, a possible explanation for the phenotype ofG2A−/− mice is that G2A plays a role in programmed death of these self-recognizing T cells.

Lee S.Y. Choi Y. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 168: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). OGR1, or ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1, has been shown to cause pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive growth inhibition when stimulated by its high affinity ligand, sphingosylphosphorylcholine (5Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the respective genes for G2A, TDAG8, and OGR1 are clustered in chromosome 14q31–32.1, a region in which mutations are associated with T cell leukemias and lymphomas (1Weng Z. Fluckiger A.C. Nisitani S. Wahl M.I. Le L.Q. Hunter C.A. Fernal A.A. Le Beau M.M. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These properties distinguish these 3 members of this GPCR subfamily from other lysophospholipid receptors such as the Edg (endothelialdifferentiation gene) family of receptors, many of which have been shown to cause cellular proliferation by activating multiple G proteins (7Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). On the contrary, GPR4, a fourth member of the G2A subfamily, is located on chromosome 19. Stimulation of GPR4-overexpressing cells with its high affinity ligand sphingosylphosphorylcholine enhances DNA synthesis (8Zhu K. Baudhuin L.M. Hong G. Williams F.S. Cristina K.L. Kabarowski J.H. Witte O.N. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41325-41335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), indicating that this receptor may share more functional properties with the Edg subfamily of receptors than with the other receptors in the G2A subfamily. The signaling properties of several lysophospholipid receptors, such as platelet-activating factor receptor and Edg receptors, have been extensively characterized. In comparison, much less is known about the signaling properties of the G2A family of GPCRs. Studies conducted thus far show that G2A couples to Gα13 and activates RhoA, leading to actin stress fiber formation and serum-response factor-mediated transcription. These observations were made while G2A was still considered an orphan receptor (6Kabarowski J.H. Feramisco J.D. Le L.Q. Gu J.L. Luoh S.W. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). LPC was subsequently discovered to be the high affinity ligand for G2A and could stimulate PTX-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ transients and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in transfected cells, suggesting the involvement of Gαi(10Kabarowski J.H. Zhu K. Le L.Q. Witte O.N. Xu Y. Science. 2001; 293: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, other GPCRs that couple to Gα13 and Gαi (e.g. protease-activated receptor-1 and certain Edg receptors) do not display functional properties similar to that of G2A (7Hla T. Lee M.J. Ancellin N. Paik J.H. Kluk M.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1875-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 11Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). Moreover, although G2A has been previously characterized as having growth inhibitory effects, at least one contradictory study exists that depicts G2A as capable of inducing morphological changes resembling oncogenic transformation (9Zohn I.E. Klinger M. Karp X. Kirk H. Symons M. Chrzanowska- Wodnicka M. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, an essential question that remains unanswered is whether G2A has a direct effect on cell fate. The primary objectives of this study are to ascertain which G proteins functionally couple to G2A and to determine the biological consequences that result from activation of these G proteins. Using transfected cells and primary lymphocytes, we found that G2A couples to multiple G proteins that include Gαs, Gαq, and Gα13. Exogenous expression of G2A results in constitutive activation of these G proteins, whereas LPC can further stimulate Gαs activation. Activation of this specific group of G proteins by G2A contributes to caspase-mediated apoptosis. PTX and 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine were obtained fromCalbiochem (San Diego, CA). The pCMVβ (β-galactosidase) vector and the caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The 3× NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed as described previously (12Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol.

LPC, 16:0, was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Myc-tagged GRK2 RGS and p115RGS were generous gifts from Dr. Tohru Kozasa (University of Illinois at Chicago). Expression vectors for Bcl-2 and CrmA were kindly provided by Dr. Elena Efimova (University of Illinois at Chicago). Expression vectors containing wild type and constitutively active (QL) Gα subunits were gifts from Drs. Cindy Knall and Gary Johnson (University of Colorado, Denver, CO). The expression vector containing the βγ scavenger, myc-tagged β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) carboxyl terminus fragment linked to transmembrane domain of CD8, was kindly provided by Dr. Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health). Anti-Gαqand anti-Gα13 polyclonal antibodies were acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Wild type human G2A was cloned as described in Ref. 1Weng Z. Fluckiger A.C. Nisitani S.

This PCR product was then amplified using primers containing EcoRI and BamHI sites, respectively: XGR7R1 (5′-CGGAATTCCCGCCATGTGCCCAATGCTACTG-3′) and XGR8Bam (5′-GCGGGATCCTCAGCAGGACTCCTCAAT-3′). The final PCR product was subcloned into the pRK5 vector (BD Biosciences), and its full sequence was confirmed by comparison with the GenBankTMentry for human G2A. The N-terminal AU5 (TDFYLK)-tagged G2A construct (AU5-G2A) was created by PCR and subcloned into the pRK5 vector. Functionality of AU5-G2A was comparable with that of wild type G2A in apoptosis assays, second messenger accumulation, and NF-κB activation. The G2A-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct was prepared as described in Weng et al. (1Weng Z. Fluckiger A.C. Nisitani S. Wahl M.I. Le L.Q. Hunter C.A. Fernal A.A. Le Beau M.M.

HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected at 40–80% confluence in 6-well plates using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (12Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with pRK5, G2A, and/or other constructs of interest and with 0.2 μg of the 3× NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct and 0.02 μg of pCMVβ (β-galactosidase expression vector) for normalization of transfection efficiency. Total DNA was made equivalent between samples by adding empty vector (pRK5). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved for 16–18 h in serum-free DMEM and treated with ligand for 4 h if necessary. Cells were then washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and supernatant was collected. Luciferase substrate (Promega) and β-galactosidase substrate were added to two different aliquots of supernatant and luminescence measured with a Femtomaster FB12 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). Luciferase activities were normalized against β-galactosidase. Normalized data for all samples were plotted using Prism software (Version 3.0, GraphPad, San Diego, CA). To confirm expression of G2A in transiently transfected HeLa cells or primary lymphocytes by RT-PCR, first-strand cDNA was synthesized with 2 μg of total RNA isolated using the Trizol reagent and the Superscript II preamplification system (Invitrogen). Fifteen percent of the first strand cDNA synthesis product was then used for PCR with the primers XGR3 (5′-CTCGTCGGGATCGTTCACTAC-3′) and HG2AC1 as described previously (1Weng Z. Fluckiger A.C. Nisitani S. Wahl M.I. Le L.Q. Hunter C.A. Fernal A.A. Le Beau M.M. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12334-12339Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). GPR4 expression in primary cells was detected using the primers FmidGPR4 (5′-CCGGGGCATCCTGCGGGCCG-3′) and RevGPR4 (5′-GCTGGCGGCAGC ATCTTCAGC-3′). G2A receptor expression on the cell surface was determined by using a 1:500 dilution of monoclonal anti-AU5 primary antibody (Covance, Denver, PA) and 1:200 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Stained cells were analyzed on a Coulter Elite ESP flow cytometer with care to exclude cellular debris and aggregates. Markers and statistics were determined using WinMDI 2.8 software (facs.scripps.edu/software.html). Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) was used to measure changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were incubated at 37 °C with 100 nm TMRE for 10 min and/or 1 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 min. Cells were then washed and immediately visualized by Nikon Eclipse TE300 fluorescence microscope and pictures captured using a Hamamatsu CCD camera and SimplePCI software (C-Imaging Systems, Cranberry Township, PA). Alternatively, after TMRE staining, both floating and attached cells were collected by trypsinization, centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 3 min, washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for analysis by flow cytometry. Samples were analyzed using the Coulter Elite ESP and percentages calculated using WinMDI 2.8 software. All samples were gated to exclude cellular debris and aggregates and count a standard of 20,000 events. Inositol phosphate accumulation was determined in transfected cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the culture medium in each well was replaced with inositol-free DMEM (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) supplemented with 0.1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 3 μCi/ml myo-[3H] inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were then washed twice and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm LiCl, pH 7.4, for 45 min, ± 1 μm LPC. Accumulated InsP was measured using ion exchange chromatography and scintillation counting. Cyclic-AMP was measured using a competitive enzyme immunoassay (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum and cAMP production accumulated in the presence of DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), ± LPC for 45 min at 37 °C. Alternatively, cells were pre-treated with PTX (500 ng/ml) or 100 μm 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (DDA) for 4 h before ligand stimulation. The medium was then removed and replaced with 0.1m HCl. After the specified incubation times,p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added, the reaction was stopped, and OD was determined using a microplate reader at 405 nm. Standard cAMP curves and calculations were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cells were co-transfected with pCMVβ, and all data were normalized against β-galactosidase to account for variances in transfection efficiency. Anti-coagulated whole blood from human donors was diluted 1:1 with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution, and lymphocytes were separated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Amersham Biosciences) gradient centrifugation according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lymphocyte fraction was enriched for CD4+ T cells using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). The kit consists of a mixture of hapten-conjugated specific cell surface marker antibodies (anti-CD8, CD11b, CD19, CD16, CD36, and CD56) and an anti-hapten secondary antibody conjugated to magnetic microbeads. Depletion of non-helper T cells is achieved by incubation with the primary antibody mixture/secondary antibody and subjecting the labeled cells to a magnetic column on an autoMACS cell sorter (Miltenyi Biotec). The resulting population of cells were eluted from the column, stained with an anti-CD4-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and subject to flow cytometric analysis (85–90% CD4+ T cells, 10–15% red blood cells, as determined by fluorescein isothiocyanate and forward scatter). Red blood cells were lysed if necessary by quick (<10 s) resuspension of cell pellet in a hypotonic solution followed by rapid addition of 2× phosphate-buffered saline. CD4+ T cells were then stimulated with vehicle or LPC for 90 min then lysed for cAMP analysis or incubated for 14–16 h, stained with TMRE, and analyzed by flow cytometry. In the latter case, lymphocytes were kept in RPMI medium containing 5% of donor serum, which was collected from the upper phase after gradient centrifugation of diluted whole blood. G2A is a transcriptionally regulated, stress-inducible GPCR that has been shown to ligand-independently couple to Gα13 in the activation of RhoA (6Kabarowski J.H. Feramisco J.D. Le L.Q. Gu J.L. Luoh S.W. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12109-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Zohn I.E. Klinger M. Karp X. Kirk H. Symons M. Chrzanowska- Wodnicka M. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We examined whether G2A also activates other Gα proteins because Gα13-coupling GPCRs are often found to interact with more than one G protein. Upon GPCR activation, certain Gα subunits (e.g. Gαq) and βγ subunits activate phospholipase-Cβ (PLCβ), which cleaves phosphoinositol diphosphate into two products, diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate. Thus, the accumulation of InsP is a useful and effective indication of GPCR-mediated PLCβ activation. G2A was exogenously expressed in HeLa cells, a human carcinoma cell line devoid of endogenous G2A. Expression of G2A was confirmed by RT-PCR, and cell surface expression of the receptor was observed by flow cytometric analysis using a monoclonal antibody against an AU5 tag that was fused to the N terminus of G2A. Approximately 30% of transfected cells showed a high level of cell surface receptor expression 24 h after transfection (data not shown). Expression of G2A resulted in a 3.5-fold increase of InsP accumulation, as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). Stimulation of transfected cells with the G2A agonist LPC did not further increase InsP accumulation. PTX, which ADP-ribosylates Gαi/Gαo and prevents functional coupling to their respective GPCRs, did not inhibit G2A-mediated increase in InsP accumulation. To determine the role of Gβγ in this response, HeLa cells were transfected with an expression construct containing the carboxyl terminus fragment of βARK (βARKct), a known βγ scavenger (13Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It was found that βARKct did not inhibit G2A-mediated InsP accumulation (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that G2A activates a Gα protein, most likely Gαq, regardless of LPC stimulation. As a positive control, expression of a constitutively active Gαq (Q209L) led to a ∼3-fold induction of InsP accumulation (data not shown). It was recently reported that certain Gα proteins, including Gαq and Gα13, are involved in GPCR-mediated activation of NF-κB (12Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol.

We used this property of G proteins to further confirm functional coupling of G2A to these two G proteins. HeLa cells were co-transfected with expression constructs for a NF-κB luciferase reporter and G2A, and in some samples, one of the Gα proteins. As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of G2A resulted in a potent induction of NF-κB-mediated transcription characterized by an increase in luciferase activity. Co-expression of Gαq was found to augment G2A-induced luciferase activity by ∼90%, whereas co-expression of Gα13, known to couple to G2A (6Kabarowski J.H. Feramisco J.D. Le L.Q. Gu J.L. Luoh S.W.

Der C.J. Kay R.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), also potentiated luciferase reporter activity. Neither of these Gα proteins was able to induce the expression of NF-κB-driven luciferase activity when expressed alone, indicating that the observed enhancement results from specific functional coupling with G2A. Consistent with the ligand-independent nature of these coupling events, LPC stimulation did not further increase G2A-induced NF-κB-luciferase activity (data not shown). We also employed a loss-of-function approach that utilizes RGS constructs to block specific G protein pathways (17Kehrl J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). P115RhoGEF, an effector that couples Gα13 to the activation of RhoA, contains an N-terminal RGS domain that serves to down-regulate the Gα13 signal (19Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). GRK2 contains an N-terminal RGS domain that binds to and specifically inhibits Gαq signaling (20Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The two RGS truncation constructs shown in Fig. 2Bwere used to down-regulate signaling by Gα13 and Gαq, respectively. Our results show that either GRK2RGS or p115RGS alone inhibited G2A-induced NF-κB activation by 50 and 36%, respectively (Fig. 2C). When both RGS constructs were used together, a more complete inhibition of G2A-mediated NF-κB activation was observed. These data provide additional support for the functional coupling of G2A to Gαq and Gα13. GPCR-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase and the subsequent production of cAMP involve the activation of Gαs in most cases. On the other hand, if there is an inhibition of stimulated adenylate cyclase and/or sensitivity to PTX, activation of the Gαi/o family is inferred. To test these possibilities in G2A-transfected cells, we measured cAMP production with and without LPC stimulation, in the presence or absence of PTX pre-treatment. Without LPC stimulation, expression of G2A induces a ∼3-fold elevation in intracellular cAMP (Fig.3A). This cAMP elevation is partially inhibited by the cell-permeable adenylate cyclase inhibitor, DDA. LPC stimulation further increases cAMP elevation by an additional 60%, from 3-fold to ∼5-fold. This effect was also inhibited by DDA. PTX pre-treatment enhances G2A-mediated cAMP elevation by ∼30%. Based on these observations, it appears that G2A couples to Gαs, and possibly Gαi, in the absence of LPC stimulation, in that the ligand-independent increase in cAMP is slightly enhanced by abrogating the inhibitory effect of Gαi with PTX pre-treatment. The inhibitory activity by Gαi appears to be relatively weak, as LPC stimulation further increased cAMP levels, indicating that G2A-mediated activation of Gαs offsets the inhibition by Gαi. To examine the dose effect of LPC on G2A-mediated cAMP elevation, we treated both mock-transfected and G2A-transfected cells with increasing concentrations of LPC (Fig. 3B). Indeed, there exists a correlation between LPC dose and G2A-mediated cAMP elevation, with a maximum response at 0.5 μm LPC. At ≥ 10 μm LPC, there was no further increase in cAMP. This may be due to nonspecific effects or decreasing activity of LPC at concentrations ≥ 10 μm (5Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Evidence exists that expression of G2A is induced by various DNA-damaging agents such as chemotherapeutics, UV, and x-ray. Furthermore, it is known that expression of G2A causes NIH 3T3 cells to accumulate at G2/M in the cell cycle and that it inhibits transformation of cells by the oncogene BCR-ABL (1Weng Z. Fluckiger A.C. Nisitani S. Wahl M.I. Le L.Q. Hunter C.A. Fernal A.A. Le Beau M.M. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12334-12339Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a potential link between G2A expression and suppression of cell growth, and prompted us to examine whether G2A also induces apoptosis. HeLa cells were transfected to express G2A as described above. 24–48 h after transfection, G2A-transfected cells, but not mock (vector)-transfected cells, began to display significant cytoplasmic shrinkage, cell rounding, and membrane blebbing (Fig. 4A). Expression of G2A also caused a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential as determined by negative staining with TMRE. TMRE is a cationic, lipophilic dye that is dissipated when there is a large reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, an event that o"

Here, we showed that the levels of MMP-26 protein in human prostate carcinomas from multiple patients were significantly higher than those in prostatitis, benign prostate hyperplasia, and normal prostate glandular tissues. The role of MMP-26 in prostate cancer progression is unknown. MMP-26 was capable of activating pro-MMP-9 by cleavage at the Ala93–Met94 site of the prepro-enzyme. This activation proceeded in a time- and dose-dependent manner, facilitating the efficient cleavage of fibronectin by MMP-9. The activated MMP-9 products generated by MMP-26 appeared more stable than those cleaved by MMP-7 under the conditions tested. To investigate the contribution of MMP-26 to cancer cell invasion via the activation of MMP-9, highly invasive and metastatic human prostate carcinoma cells, androgen-repressed prostate cancer (ARCaP) cells were selected as a working model. ARCaP cells express both MMP-26 and MMP-9. Specific anti-MMP-26 and anti-MMP-9 functional blocking antibodies both reduced the invasiveness of ARCaP cells across fibronectin or type IV collagen. Furthermore, the introduction of MMP-26antisense cDNA into ARCaP cells significantly reduced the MMP-26 protein level in these cells and strongly suppressed the invasiveness of ARCaP cells. Double immunofluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopic images revealed that MMP-26 and MMP-9 were co-localized in parental and MMP-26 sense-transfected ARCaP cells. Moreover, MMP-26 and MMP-9 proteins were both expressed in the same human prostate carcinoma tissue samples examined. These results indicate that MMP-26 may be a physiological and pathological activator of pro-MMP-9.

Recently, we have found that the levels of MMP-26 gene and protein expression are higher in a malignant choriocarcinoma cell line (JEG-3) than in normal human cytotrophoblast cells (10Zhang J. Cao Y.J. Zhao Y.-G. Sang Q.-X. Duan E.-K. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 8: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our preliminary studies indicate that expression of MMP-26 may be correlated with the malignant transformation of human prostate and breast epithelial cells. The specific expression of MMP-26 in malignant tumors and the proteolytic activity of this enzyme against multiple components of the ECM, including fibronectin, type IV collagen, vitronectin, gelatins, and fibrinogen, as well as non-ECM proteins such as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 and α1-protease inhibitor (6Park H.I.

Another member of the MMP family considered to be an important contributor to the processes of invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis exhibited by tumor cells is gelatinase B (MMP-9) (11Scorilas A.

López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4745-4751PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that MMP-26 is able to cleave MMP-9, and here we examine the possibility that MMP-26 facilitates tumor cell invasion through the activation of pro-MMP-9. The highly invasive and metastatic cell line utilized for this study, an androgen-repressed human prostate cancer (ARCaP), was derived from the ascites fluid of a patient with advanced prostate cancer that had metastasized to the lymph nodes, lungs, pancreas, liver, kidneys, and bones (15Zhau H.Y. Chang S.M. Chen B.Q. Wang Y. Zhang H. Kao C. Sang Q.A. Pathak S.J. Chung L.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15152-15157Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This cell line produces high levels of MMP-9 and gelatinase A (MMP-2) (15Zhau H.Y. Chang S.M. Chen B.Q. Wang Y. Zhang H. Kao C. Sang Q.A. Pathak S.J. Chung L.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6012-6019PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that MMP-26 is capable of activating pro-MMP-9, and that once activated, MMP-9 cleaves fibronectin, type IV collagen, and gelatin with great efficiency. Both the MMP-26 and MMP-9 proteins were highly expressed in the ARCaP cells, and co-localization of their expression patterns was consistently observed. The invasiveness of ARCaP cells through FN or type IV collagen was significantly decreased in the presence of antibodies specifically targeting MMP-26 or MMP-9. In addition, cells transfected with antisense MMP-26, showing significant reduction of MMP-26 at the protein level, exhibited a reduction of invasive potential in vitro in addition to a significant diminution in observed levels of active MMP-9 protein. These results support the hypothesis that activation of MMP-9 by MMP-26 may promote the in vitroinvasiveness of ARCaP cells through FN or type IV collagen, whereas the co-expression of MMP-26 and MMP-9 in many human prostate carcinoma tissues indicates that this relationship may also occur in vivo. ARCaP, DU145, PC-3, and LNCaP, which are all established human prostate carcinoma cell lines, were routinely grown in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle′s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2at 37 °C. Purified recombinant MMP-26 (6Park H.I. Ni J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D. Belozerov V.E. Sang Q.-X. J. Biol.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or pro-MMP-2 (18Sang Q.A. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) in HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Brij-35) at 37 °C. For the dosage dependence of MMP-9 activation, MMP-9 (0.2 μm, final concentration) was incubated with MMP-7 and MMP-26 at the indicated molar concentration ratio (2:1, 4:1, and 8:1) for 24 h. The MMP-9 activation was quenched by 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm EDTA. The resulting solution was further diluted five times and 5 μl of the diluted sample was loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8%). For the time dependence of MMP-9 activation, MMP-9 (0.2 μm) was incubated with MMP-7 (0.05 μm) and MMP-26 (0.05 μm) for the indicated time periods (0, 4, 8, 24 and 48 h) before quenching with the sample buffer. For FN cleavage assays, 2 μl of FN (0.25 mg/ml) were incubated with 30 μl of MMP-26 (final concentration 0.05 μm), pro-MMP-9 (final concentration 0.2 μm), or MMP-26-activated MMP-9 solutions in 1× HEPES buffer at 37 °C for 18 h. For silver staining, the reaction was stopped by adding 4× reducing sample buffer (6% SDS, 40% glycerol, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm EDTA, and 0.08% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Following electrophoresis on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the protein bands were visualized by silver staining (19Zhao Y.G. Wei P. Sang Q.-X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For gelatin zymogram, the gel was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C before it was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue solution (17Sang Q.-X. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Zhao Y.-G. Xiao A.Z. Cao X.M. Zhu C. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 62: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Bauzon D.E. Xu X. Tschesche H. Cao J. Sang Q.-X. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 22: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to ProBlottTM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Applied Biosystems) using CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS, pH 11, 0.005% SDS). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 solution (0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 40% methanol, 1% acetic acid) and excised fragments were sent for sequencing. N-terminal sequencing was performed at the Bioanalytical Core Facility, Florida State University. RNA was extracted from the original cells by Trizol according to manufacturer protocols (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 2 μg of total RNA were subjected to reverse transcriptase-PCR according to the standard protocol provided with the PCR kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The MMP-26 forward primer was 5′-ACCATGCAGCTCGTCATCTTAAGAG-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-AGGTATGTCAGATGAACATTTTTCTCC-3′; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase the forward primer was 5′-ACGGATTTGGTCGTATTGGG-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-TGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCGC-3′. PCR reactions were performed using a Biometra Personal Cycler (Biometra, Germany) with 30 thermal cycles of 10 s at 94 °C denaturing, 30 s at 60 °C annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C elongation. Ten μl of the amplified PCR products were then electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide for analysis of size differences. To confirm the amplification of the required cDNA sequences, PCR products were digested with a restriction enzyme as directed by the manufacturer. Specific antigen peptides corresponding to unique sequences in the pro-domain and metalloproteinase domain of MMP-26 were synthesized by Dr. Umesh Goli at the Biochemical Analysis, Synthesis and Sequencing Services Laboratory of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Florida State University (Tallahassee, FL). The sequence selected from the pro-domain was Thr50-Gln-Glu-Thr-Gln-Thr-Gln-Leu-Leu-Gln-Gln-Phe-His-Arg-Asn-Gly-Thr-Asp67, and the sequence selected from the metalloproteinase domain was Asp188-Lys-Asn-Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Ala-Ser-Asp-Thr-Gly-Tyr-Asn201of the prepro-enzyme. Using the BLAST search method at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site against all of the sequences in the data banks, no peptide with >45% level of identity was found (6Park H.I. Ni J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D. Belozerov V.E. Sang Q.-X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20540-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), predicting the antibodies directed against these two peptides should be specific. The purity of these peptides was verified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Rabbit anti-human antibodies were then generated, purified, and characterized as described previously (19Zhao Y.G. Wei P. Sang Q.-X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Bauzon D.E. Xu X. Tschesche H. Cao J. Sang Q.-X. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 22: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses have demonstrated that these two antibodies are highly specific for MMP-26 because they do not cross-react with human matrilysin (MMP-7), stromelysin (MMP-3), gelatinase A (MMP-2), gelatinase B (MMP-9), and some other proteins tested (data not shown). Western blotting for MMP-26 was performed by lysing the cells with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 1.5% (v/v) Triton X-114 as described previously (21Li H. Bauzon D.E. Xu X. Tschesche H. Cao J. Sang Q.-X. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 22: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Aliquots (20 μl) of cell lysate and media containing equal volumes (20 μl) from each treatment treated with SDS sample buffer were then loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Samples were electrophoresed and then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactive MMP-26 bands were visualized using a horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Western blot analysis for MMP-9 was performed with a 1 μg/ml dilution of polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA). MMP-9 bands were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) followed by the addition of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. The blot membranes were then scanned, and the signal intensities were measured by integrated morphometry analysis (IMA) (Metamorph System, version 4.6r8, Universal Imaging Corporation, Inc., West Chester, PA). The signal intensities obtained were expressed as integrated optical density (the sum of the optical densities of all pixels that make up the object). All the bands used the same exclusive threshold for analysis. Cells were fixed in 50% methanol, 50% acetone for 15 min and permeated with 1% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human prostate cancer tissues were sectioned to 4 μm thickness and fixed on slides. The sections were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated in 100 and 95% ethanol. Nonspecific antibody binding in cells and sections was blocked with blocking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 5% normal goat serum, and 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature prior to overnight incubation with affinity-purified specific rabbit anti-human MMP-26 antibody in the same buffer (5 μg/ml for immunocytochemistry and 10 μg/ml for inmmunohistochemistry) or goat anti-human MMP-9 antibody (25 μg/ml for immunohistochemistry, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 4 °C. Cells and sections were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted (1:5000) in the blocking buffer for 4 h at room temperature. The signals were detected by adding Fast-Red (Sigma). Purified preimmune IgGs from the same animal were used as negative controls for MMP-26. Normal goat serum was used as a negative control for MMP-9. The sections were counterstained lightly with hematoxylin for viewing negatively stained cells. Full-length cDNA ofMMP-26 was amplified by PCR according to published sequences (6Park H.I. Ni J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D. Belozerov V.E. Sang Q.-X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20540-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and cloned into modified mammalian expression vector pCRTM3.1-Uni with a FLAG tag at its C-terminal as described (22Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Following confirmation of cDNA sequencing, plasmids containing correct inserts were used as sense vectors and plasmids with reversibly inserted cDNA were used as antisense vectors (22Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ARCaP cells were transfected with sense and antisense MMP-26cDNA-containing vectors using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described earlier (22Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Kang T. Zhao Y.-G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.-X. J. Biol.

Sense- and antisense-transfected cell lines were treated identically with regard to transfection conditions and maintenance in the selection medium. Stable transfectants were selected by growing the cells in 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418; Invitrogen). Cells that survived were then expanded in the absence of G418 for additional studies. Stable transfectants were screened on the basis of FLAG and MMP-26 expression. Clones with MMP-26 sense- and antisense-integrated constructs were selected and analyzed for MMP-26 expression, invasive capabilities in modified Boyden chamber invasion assays, and co-localization with MMP-9. Parental ARCaP cells served as controls. The invasiveness of ARCaP cells cultured in the presence of MMP-26 or MMP-9 functional blocking antibodies, parental ARCaP cells, sense MMP-26- and antisense MMP-26-transfected cells through reconstructed ECM was determined as per our previous report (24Sang Q.-X.

The final concentrations of MMP-26 antibody were 10 and 50 μg/ml. The preimmune IgG from the same animal was used as control for MMP-26 antibody, and the final concentration was 50 μg/ml. The mouse anti-human MMP-9 monoclonal antibody is Ab-1, clone 6-6B, which is a functional neutralizing antibody that inhibits the enzymatic activity of MMP-9 (25Ramos-DeSimone N. Moll U.M.

Inc., San Antonio, TX) was used as control, and the concentration was 25 μg/ml. Briefly, modified Boyden chambers containing polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Becton Dickinson, Boston, MA) were coated with 0.5 mg/ml human plasma FN (Invitrogen) or 0.5 mg/ml type IV collagen (Sigma). Three-hundred μl of prepared cell suspension (1 × 106 cells/ml) in serum-free medium was added to each insert, and 500 μl of media containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chamber. After 60 h of incubation, invasive cells that had passed through the filters to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma). The cells were then stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution and photographed with an Olympus DP10 digital camera (Melville, NY) under a Nikon FX microscope (Melville, NY). The cells were then counted by IMA. For statistical analyses, the number of invasive cells treated with preimmune IgG was assumed to reflect 100% cell invasion. The ratio of the number of invaded cells that were treated with antibody or theMMP-26 gene-transfected cells to preimmune IgG or parental cells, respectively, was used for subsequent comparative analyses by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Media from each insert was collected for Western blot and gelatin zymogram analyses. Cells were cultured on 8-well slides for 24 h, then fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 10% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed, permeabilized cells were stained for 1 h at room temperature with anti-human MMP-26 (25 μg/ml) or a goat anti-human antibody targeting MMP-9 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (1:200 dilution). Secondary rhodamine red-X-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG for MMP-26 or fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for MMP-9 were subsequently applied at a 1:200 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Slow Fade mounting medium was added to the slides, and fluorescence was analyzed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a multiphoton laser according to our previous report (23Kang T. Zhao Y.-G. Pei D. Sucic J.F. Sang Q.-X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25583-25591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Images were processed for reproduction using Photoshop software version 6.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountainview, CA). Purified preimmune IgGs from the same animal were used as negative controls for MMP-26, and normal goat serum was used as a negative control for MMP-9. Samples were simultaneously stained with antibody and preimmune IgG on the same slide, and the areas of MMP-26 immunostaining were quantified by IMA. Four photographs were taken from each sample with an Olympus DP10 digital camera under a Nikon FX microscope. An appropriate color threshold was determined (color model, HSI; hue, 230–255; saturation and intensity, full spectrum), the glandular epithelia from each image was isolated into closed regions, and all areas of staining in compliance with these specific parameters were measured by IMA. The total area of these closed regions was determined by region measurement, and the ratio of signal area to total area was then determined. The average of the four ratios obtained from each sample was then used for subsequent analysis. The same color threshold was maintained for all samples. The preimmune staining ratio was subtracted from the antibody-staining ratio, and this value was then divided by the preimmune staining ratio to yield the reduced signal to background ratios used for subsequent comparative analyses by ANOVA. Statistical analysis of all samples was performed with the least significant difference correction of ANOVA for multiple comparisons. Data represent the mean ± S.D. from three experiments where differences withp < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Gelatin zymography was utilized for determination of MMP-9 activity levels following cleavage by MMP-26. Zymography revealed that pro-MMP-9 presented as 225-, 125-, and 94-kDa gelatinolytic bands under non-reducing conditions (Fig.1, A, lane 1, andB, lanes 1 and 6). The 225-kDa band is a homodimer of pro-MMP-9, the 125-kDa band is a heterodimer of pro-MMP-9 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and the 94-kDa band is a monomer of pro-MMP-9 (17Sang Q.-X.

New 215-, 115-, and 86-kDa bands were generated after incubation with MMP-26 (Fig. 1,A and B), and their activities were increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A andB). Compared with MMP-7, the cleavage products generated by MMP-26 at the concentrations tested appear more stable (Fig. 1,A and B). However, pro-MMP-2 was not activated after incubation with identical concentrations of MMP-26 (data not shown). MMP-26 cleaved pro-MMP-9 (94 kDa) to yield a new 86-kDa band on a silver-stained gel under reducing conditions (Fig. 1C,lane 4). N-terminal sequencing showed that the 86-kDa protein had the sequence of MRTPRXG, which is the same N terminus as reported during activation of pro-MMP-9 by HgCl2 (28Triebel S. Blaser J. Reinke H.

https://openalex.org/W2002644225,"YY1 is a zinc finger DNA-binding transcription factor that influences expression of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes. YY1 is essential for the development of mammalian embryos. It regulates the expression of genes with important functions in DNA replication, protein synthesis, and cellular response to external stimuli during cell growth and differentiation. How YY1 accomplishes such a variety of functions is unknown. Here, we show that a subset of the nuclear YY1 appears to be O-GlcNAcylated regardless of the differentiation status of the cells. We found that glucose strongly stimulates O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) on YY1. Glycosylated YY1 no longer binds the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Upon dissociation from Rb, the glycosylated YY1 is free to bind DNA. The ability of theO-glycosylation on YY1 to disrupt the complex with Rb leads us to propose that O-glycosylation might have a profound effect on cell cycle transitions that regulate the YY1-Rb heterodimerization and promote the activity of YY1. Our observations provide strong evidence that YY1-regulated transcription is very likely connected to the pathway of glucose metabolism that culminates in theO-GlcNAcylation on YY1, changing its function in transcription.

A subset of the nuclear RNA polymerase II itself is also O-GlcNAc-modified (28Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the carboxyl-terminal moiety (CTD) of the largest subunit.O-GlcNAcylation is highly dynamic, with rapid cycling in response to cellular signals or cellular stages. It was found to be reciprocal to phosphorylation on some well studied phosphoproteins, including the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Although the precise function of O-GlcNAc is not exactly determined, recent data suggest a wide variety of key cellular events, including gene transcription (21Vosseller K. Sakabe K. Wells L. Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that a subset of the nuclear YY1 appears to be O-GlcNAcylated regardless of the differentiation status of the cells. We show that the amount ofO-glycosylated YY1 changes in response to external stimuli. We have determined that high glucose stimulates the O-GlcNAc on YY1 in cells. In glucose-stimulated cultures, theO-glycosylated YY1 is mostly free of Rb. The YY1-Rb complex is significantly more abundant in glucose-deprived cultures where YY1 is mostly not O-glycosylated. We observed a correlation between the activated YY1 O-glycosylation and the formation of DNA-YY1 complexes in nuclear extracts. The results led us to propose that O-GlcNAc on YY1 favors dissociation with Rb and association with consensus DNA promoter elements that may repress or activate gene expression depending on the context of its binding site within a promoter. The dynamic and reversibleO-GlcNAcylation further expands the possible molecular and functional range of YY1. Primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC) (Clonetics) were grown as recommended by the supplier. Recombinant YY1 was purified from Escherichia coli (6Usheva A. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HeLa YY1 was purified from HeLa nuclear extract as described previously except that the pooled DNA affinity column fractions were next loaded onto a wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-agarose (Vector) matrix and eluted from this matrix at pH 3 in the presence of 1 m GlcNAc as recommended by the supplier. The pooled WGA fractions were applied onto Superose 12 support (Amersham Biosciences) in 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 6. The purified guanidine HCl-denatured YY1 was next folded as described previously. The molecular mass of YY1 was determined by protein chip tandem mass spectroscopy (Ciphergen). Rb was purified from Sf9 cells (29Kim S.J. Wagner S. Liu F. O'Reilly M.A. Robbins P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To test for a YY1-Rb interaction in solution, Rb (50 μg) and YY1 (30 μg) were incubated alone or in a mixture for 30 min at 22 °C and then separated by gel filtration on Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) as described (9Petkova V.

Chymotrypsinogen A (18 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), and myosin (206 kDa) were used as markers. To test for a YY1-Rb interaction in cells, nuclear extracts were prepared (30Usheva A. Maldonado E. Goldring A. Lu H. Houbavi C. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 871-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) from cells that were growth-arrested by serum starvation for 48 h in 30 mm of glucose or from cells that were growth-arrested in the absence of glucose. YY1, Rb, and control pre-immune IgG immunoaffinity matrices were prepared and used as described (9Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For Western blot assays, YY1 was localized using a rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibody, Rb was identified with a monoclonal antibody to Rb (a gift from E. Harlow, Harvard Medical School), and TFIIB was monitored with rabbit polyclonal antibody. The assay was conducted as described previously (31Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8049-8057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Whiteheart S.W. Passaniti A. Reichner J.S. Holt G.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 82-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). [3H]galactose-labeled YY1 or protein fractions were mixed and incubated with 0.1 m NaOH at 22 °C for no longer than 6 h. Incubation longer than 6 h was avoided because of strong YY1 degradation. [3H]galactose-labeled protein samples were systematically digested with PNGase F (BioLabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations overnight at 37 °C. The gel shift assays and in vitro transcription reactions were performed as described previously (6Usheva A. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13571-13576Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. Inc. The apparent molecular weight of the major cellular YY1 variant is greater than that of a peptide encoded by the open reading frame of the human YY1. Similar observations were reported for theO-GlcNAcylated forms of other proteins with functions in transcription, such as Sp1, Pax-6, and c-Myc. Accordingly, we tested for the presence of glycosylated nuclear YY1, applying in vitro labeling procedure with bovine galactosyl transferase (GTase). This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-[3H]galactose to glycoproteins with accessible terminal residue (32Whiteheart S.W. Passaniti A. Reichner J.S. Holt G.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 82-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), creating a covalently bound radioactive marker for the presence of GlcNAc (Fig.1A). When affinity purified YY1 from HeLa cells (Fig. 1B, lane 1) or smooth muscle cell nuclear extract (Fig. 1B, lane 3) were incubated with galactosyl transferase and UDP-[3H]galactose and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography, a 3H-labeled product migrating at the position of YY1 was observed (Fig. 1C, lanes 1and 3). In a Western blot, the migration position of the3H-labeled product was found to overlap with the position of the immunologically reactive YY1 in both HeLa-purified YY1 and nuclear extract from smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1D,lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, the bacterially produced recombinant His6-YY1 (Fig. 1D, lane 2) and the majority of proteins present in the extract from smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1B, lane 3) were not labeled (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and3). To confirm 3H-labeling of YY1, we performed YY1-immuno affinity capturing (Fig. 1E). [3H]galactose-labeled nuclear extract (NE) from human CASMC was incubated with YY1-specific IgG covalently coupled to activated Sepharose beads. The unbound and the captured products were visualized by fluorography and Western blot with YY1-specific antibodies and HCL reaction. We observed that the YY1 affinity beads specifically captured 3H-labeled YY1 (Fig. 1E,lanes 3 and 7). Less than 2% of the initial3H-labeled YY1 amount in the labeled NE was found to bind to the control matrix with pre-immune rabbit IgG (Fig. 1E,lanes 4 and 8). The results strongly suggest that the nuclear YY1 carries covalently attached terminal GlcNAc. Determining by mass spectroscopy the amount of [3H]galactose incorporated into a known quantity of purified HeLa YY1 and assuming that each molecule of the present YY1 was a substrate for labeling, we have estimated that each YY1 molecule in the HeLa purified YY1 carries, on average, approximately two GlcNAc moieties. To confirm that YY1 is glycosylated, we employed a WGA-capturing experiment. Lectins have been used to isolate and characterize transcription factors based on their glycosylation profile (34Debray H. Decout D. Strecker G. Spik G. Montreuil J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). For instance, the O-GlcNAc-modified transcription factor Sp1 has been isolated and detected by its association with WGA, which is dependent on the presence of β-O-GlcNAc groups (35Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Association with WGA has also been used to detectO-GlcNAc modification on the largest subunit of polymerase II (28Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this lectin would bind cellular YY1, WGA affinity beads were mixed together with a fraction of smooth muscle cell nuclear extract in the presence of 0.5 mNaCl. After removing the unbound fraction, the specifically captured proteins were eluted with 1 m GlcNAc and 0.5% SDS under reducing conditions (22Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 28Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound proteins were then visualized by Western blot with YY1-specific antibodies (Fig.2). YY1 was present in the WGA-captured fraction even after stringent washing with salt (Fig. 2A,lane 2). Preincubation of the YY1 fraction with different concentrations of GlcNAc before adding it to the affinity matrix reduced the amount of captured YY1 4–6-fold (Fig. 2A,lanes 3 and 4). No detectable YY1 retention was observed on a control Sepharose matrix lacking WGA (Fig. 2A,lane 5). Preincubation of the YY1 fraction with WGA also reduced significantly the amount of WGA-affinity matrix-captured YY1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3), therefore confirming the WGA matrix-glycoprotein retention specificity. The lectin concanavalin A (ConA) was also probed as a competitor for the YY1-WGA interaction. ConA is a lectin with high specificity for mannose-containing sugars (34Debray H. Decout D. Strecker G. Spik G. Montreuil J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). It was found previously that Sp1 and RNA polymerase II do not bind ConA specifically (22Jackson S.P. Tjian R.

Similarly we observed that ConA was not a competitor for the WGA-YY1 interaction, and most of the YY1 remained captured on the WGA affinity matrix in the presence of ConA (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Similar results were obtained when HeLa YY1 (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and HeLa nuclear extract were used in the experiments (not shown). YY1 forms complexes with other WGA targets such as Sp1, c-Myc, and the CTD of the polymerase II; therefore, it could be these and not YY1 glycosylation that are causing the retention of YY1 on the WGA matrix. To eliminate this possibility, we repeated the capturing experiments with denatured nuclear extract fractions treated with 0.5% SDS and β-mercaptoethanol before incubation with the WGA matrix (Fig.2C). We found that ∼25% of the YY1 from CASMC extract was retained on the WGA matrix (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Less than 1% was captured on the control beads without WGA (Fig.2C, lane 3), confirming the existence of a specific and direct interaction between YY1 and WGA. WGA is known to be specific for terminal GlcNAc moieties and GlcNAc oligomers (36Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Sene C. Maget-Dana R. Delmotte F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 104: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The WGA-YY1 interaction strongly suggests that a subset of the nuclear YY1 is a glycoprotein with terminal GlcNAc. High GlcNAc concentration, SDS, and reducing conditions are needed to strip the WGA-captured YY1. The high affinity of WGA for YY1 supports the idea that YY1 is likely to be glycosylated at multiple sites, as was reported for the human Sp1 (22Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and the CTD of the RNA polymerase II (28Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carbohydrates are attached to proteins in two broad groups, i.e. linked to the nitrogen of Asn in the consensus sequence NXT (N-linked) and linked to the oxygen of Ser or Thr in Ser/Thr-rich regions (O-linked) (37Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). To determine the linkage by which the carbohydrate moiety is attached to YY1, we made use of the fact that the O-linked sugars, but not the N-glycosidic linkage, is susceptible to removal by reductive β−elimination reaction under mild alkaline conditions (Fig.3A). The β−elimination reaction was previously used to characterize theO-glycosylation on Sp1 (22Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). When HeLa YY1 was subjected to β-elimination at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 m NaOH for 3 and 6 h, significantly less 3H label was found attached to YY1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and3). Possibly because of the lack of customary borohydride in our system, Western blotting surprisingly shows little or no protein degradation, even after 6 h. We also analyzed for the presence of N-linked carbohydrates, which can be deglycosylated by the enzyme PNGase F. This enzyme specifically releases N-linked carbohydrates by cleaving between the first internal GlcNAc residue and the asparaginyl moiety. The [3H]galactose-labeled YY1 was found to be resistant to overnight digestion with PNGase F, as the [3H]galactose-labeling of YY1 remained essentially unaffected after the reaction (Fig. 3B, lane 4). The amount of YY1 before and after the reactions was monitored by analyzing aliquots of the reactions in a Western blot (Fig.3B). We did not observe a significant change in the YY1 protein presence as a result of the enzymatic and NaOH treatment (Fig.3B), suggesting that the reduced amount of3H-labeled YY1 after alkali treatment was not because of protein degradation. This clearly indicates that the glycosylation of YY1 consists of carbohydrates attached via O-linkages to serine and/or threonine residues. It was recently reported that activation of the cellular hexosamine pathway by hyperglycemia results in a significant enhancement ofO-linked protein glycosylation (38Liu K. Paterson A.J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We asked whether there would be a difference in the level of O-glycosylated YY1 in glucose-deprived and glucose-stimulated cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared from both CASMC stimulated with 30 mm glucose (NE-HG) or deprived of glucose (NE-NG) for 48 h. Aliquots of both extracts with equal amounts of protein were SDS-denatured and finally mixed with WGA affinity beads. Unbound protein was removed, and the beads were incubated in 1 mglucosamine and 0.5% SDS to remove bound proteins. The eluted fractions were assayed for YY1 by Western blot (Fig.4). When NE-NG was applied to the WGA beads, <20% of the initial YY1 remained in the bound fraction (Fig.4A, lane 3). In contrast, the WGA affinity matrix captured >60% of the YY1 in NE-HG (Fig. 4B). Slightly reduced levels of YY1 were also observed in NE-NG (Fig. 4A, lane1) compared with YY1 in NE-HG (Fig. 4B, lane 1). The results clearly demonstrate that high glucose stimulatesO-GlcNAcylation of YY1 in the CASMC. TheO-linked GlcNAc moiety has been found in several viral, cytoplasmic, and nucleoplasmic proteins, but its function in the regulation of protein behavior is still subject to speculation. YY1 interacts with several proteins with important functions in transcription. Here we tested how the O-GlcNAcylation of YY1 would affect YY1-Rb complex formation. Previously, we have shown that Rb binds YY1 in vitro and in growth-arrested CASMC (9Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, we compared the content of YY1-Rb complexes in glucose-stimulated and glucose-deprived growth-arrested CASMC. We mixed nuclear extracts from both glucose-stimulated and glucose-deprived growth-arrested cells with Rb-immunoaffinity beads and measured the amount of captured YY1 together with Rb by Western blot (Fig. 5,A and B). As expected, in extracts from glucose-deprived and growth-arrested cells (NE-NG) Rb-antibody captured ∼40% of the YY1 together with Rb (Fig. 5A, lane 3). However, in extracts from growth-arrested CASMC cultures in high glucose (NE-HG) where most of YY1 was found to beO-GlcNAc-modified, the Rb antibody captured <15% of the YY1 (Fig. 5B, lane 3), suggesting that theO-glycosylated YY1 was not predominantly in a complex with Rb. Therefore, the glycosylated YY1 should be mainly in the unbound fraction. To confirm that the glycosylated YY1 was not bound to the Rb matrix, we mixed the Rb-unbound fraction with a WGA matrix. We observed that most of the YY1 in this fraction was captured on the WGA matrix (Fig. 5C, lane 3). Importantly, the Rb-captured YY1 was not retained on the WGA affinity matrix (Fig.5D, lane 3). Consistent with the above experiments, when purified recombinant Rb and partially purified O-GlcNAcylated YY1 from HeLa cells (Fig.1A) were mixed in solution and analyzed for complex formation by gel filtration chromatography, both proteins eluted alone, and complex formation was not observed (Fig. 5E,rows 4). When E. coli-produced, unmodified YY1 and Rb were mixed before chromatography, a substantial portion of both proteins co-eluted as a large complex (Fig.5E, rows 3). GlcN Acylation Coincides with YY1-CArG DNA Box Interaction in CASMC—We have previously demonstrated that, in complex with Rb, YY1 will no longer bind DNA. Therefore, we reasoned that the inability of the glycosylated YY1 to interact with Rb should allowO-GlcNAcYY1-DNA interaction. To test this idea, we used the YY1 binding site on the smooth muscle α-actin promoter. When bound to the CArG DNA box of the promoter, YY1 acts as a strong transcriptional repressor. We used a gel shift assay to analyze the YY1 interaction with a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the CArG DNA box of the smooth muscle α-actin promoter, which contains a binding site for YY1 and SRF. As a positive control, we conducted gel shift reactions with the P5 adeno-associated viral promoter element, which is known to present a strong YY1 binding element. Reactions were assembled with equal protein amounts from NE-HG and NE-NG cell extracts. The obtained results suggest that more YY1 was indeed available for interaction with DNA in NE-HG than in NE-NG. YY1 glycosylation alone did not affect the thermodynamics of the DNA complex formation (Fig.6B) as was found to be the case for the glycosylated forms of Sp1 and SRF. These results illustrate how O-glycosylation may alter YY1 function. Preventing YY1 from interacting with Rb will restore its ability to bind to DNA resulting in the repression or activation of YY1-regulated transcription. We have shown that a subset of the nuclear human YY1 exists as a glycoprotein carrying GlcNAc moieties. Together with β-elimination, we used PNGase F treatment, in vitro labeling with galactosyl transferase, and WGA binding to demonstrate that the carbohydrate is attached by O-glycosidic linkage to serine and/or threonine on YY1. All of the transcription factors that have been reported to undergo glycosylation are O-linked and notN-linked. Our data also fit these observations. YY1 typically migrates as a 69-kDa band in SDS-PAGE, though its average peptide mass is only 44.7 kDa. Careful removal of the glycosidic moieties under mild alkaline conditions did not significantly change the migration of YY1. Therefore, the altered electrophoretic migration presumably occurs because of modifications other than glycosylation. A similar observation was reported for the major 95–105 kDa variants of transcription factor Sp1, a peptide with an average mass of 72 kDa and multiple O-linked monosaccharides per single peptide chain. The observed high affinity of YY1 for WGA binding together with the level of [3H]galactose incorporation suggest that YY1 may carry more than one GlcNAc residue, as has been found for other transcription factors such as Sp1 (22Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), Pax-6 (26Lefebvre T. Planque N. Leleu D. Bailly M. Caillet-Boudin M.L. Saule S. Michalski J.C. J. Cell.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact stoichiometry of GlcNAcylation on YY1, however, remains to be determined. It is likely that the nuclear YY1 represents a heterogeneous population of molecules with respect to the attached GlcNAc residues. YY1 is ubiquitously expressed regardless of the differentiation status of the cell. We observed the presence ofO-GlcNAcylation on YY1 in nuclear extracts from both actively proliferating and quiescent cell types, suggesting that this modification occurs independently of the cell type. It would not be surprising, however, if we were to find that the level of O-GlcNAc on YY1 is dependent on cell type and cell cycle position, thereby adjusting the YY1 functions in gene expression regulation according to the specific cellular requirements. The levels of O-GlcNAcylation of proteins are regulated, at least in part, by the levels of cytoplasmic UDP-GlcNAc (38Liu K. Paterson A.J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) produced by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which is directly responsive to intracellular glucose concentrations. Therefore, it is not surprising that we found the GlcNAcylation on YY1 to be directly responsive to the glucose level in the cellular growth medium. How the external glucose level is translated to GlcNAcylation on YY1 remains to be determined. At present, the function of the O-linked GlcNAcyl moieties in the regulation of protein behavior are not well understood. Though sugars are hydrophilic in nature, specific orientations of their non-polar CH-groups can create a hydrophobic patch that could interact with a hydrophobic pocket on a neighboring protein. Highly hydrophilic clusters of carbohydrate may alter the polarity of the proteins with which they are conjugated and prevent specific interactions with other proteins. The bulkiness and amphipathic nature of the sugar moieties may alter protein-protein interactions. Therefore, it is not surprising that the activated GlcNAcylation on YY1 in response to high glucose results in dramatically different functional outcomes. First, when YY1 is glycosylated it no longer binds to Rb. Upon dissociation from Rb, the glycosylated YY1 becomes an effective repressor of the α-actin promoter by binding efficiently to the CArG DNA box. The repression of this promoter results from the competitive displacement by YY1 of SRF, which was also found to be O-GlcNAcylated (25Reason A.J. Morris H.R. Panico M. Marais R. Treisman R.H. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Kelly W.G. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16911-16921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).O-GlcNAcylation on both YY1 and SRF does not inhibit their DNA binding capability. It appears likely that theO-GlcNAcyl moieties on both YY1 and SRF play a role in the competitive interaction for regulation, but their relative contribution is unknown. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that glycosylation of YY1 represents a novel means of regulating the activity of YY1. Finally, the YY1-Rb interaction is cell cycle-dependent (9Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), with complex formation occurring to a greater extent in the G0/G1 compartment than in S, where Rb is hypophosphorylated. The ability of O-glycosylation on YY1 to block interaction with hypophosphorylated Rb in vitroleads us to speculate that O-glycosylation might have a profound effect on cell cycle transitions regulating the YY1-Rb heterodimerization and promoting activity in YY1. It appears likely that the heterodimer formation is the culmination of several signaling cascades that regulate both the O-GlcNAcylation on YY1 and differential phosphorylation of Rb. The glycosylation of YY1 represents a novel means of regulating the activity of YY1. Our observations provide strong evidence that YY1-regulated transcription may be directly connected to glucose metabolism via O-GlcNAcylation on YY1. We thank E. Harlow for the monoclonal antibody to Rb and V. Gelev for suggestions."

More than 15 PcG genes have been characterized to date, and subfamilies can be identified based on the presence of common protein domains. The human L(3)MBT protein contains three MBT repeats, making it a member of a subfamily that includes at least three other genes: h-l(3)mbt-like(13Wismar J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), SCMH1 (14Berger J. Kurahashi H. Takihara Y. Shimada K. Brock H.W. Randazzo F.

PcG proteins function in large multiprotein complexes to maintain long term repression of gene expression thereby permitting stable and heritable transmission of gene activity. This function is crucial to maintaining differentiated identity of cells over subsequent generations. The mechanism by which the PcG proteins maintain repression is unknown; however, recent evidence indicates that an important component of this repression occurs via chromatin remodeling. Another set of proteins, the trithorax group, is thought to antagonize PcG-mediated repression and maintain active gene expression. The trithorax group complex include proteins with diverse activities including histone acetyltransferase (16Bantignies F. Goodman R.H. Smolik S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9317-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling (SWI/SNF) activities (17Tamkun J.W. Deuring R. Scott M.P. Kissinger M. Pattatucci A.M.

The h-l(3)mbt gene gives rise to three major mRNA species that encode protein isoforms that differ at their C-terminal region and contain respectively, 772, 752, and 738 amino acids. H-L(3)MBT protein contains three MBT repeats, which are 95–105-amino acid motifs of unknown function. Although analysis of the MBT motif has not shown homology with any catalytic domains or sequence-specific DNA binding domains (13Wismar J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these repeats are highly conserved between theDrosophila and human homologs, suggesting that they have an important function. The SPM domain present at the H-L(3)MBT C terminus is an α-helical structure of ∼60 amino acids. The SPM domains in theDrosophila Sex Comb on Midleg (SCM) and polyhomeotic (PH) proteins have been found to mediate protein-protein interactions (18Peterson A.J. Kyba M. Bornemann D. Morgan K. Brock H.W. Simon J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6683-6692Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The predicted α-helical secondary structure and conservation of hydrophobic residues prompt comparison of the SPM domain with the helix-loop-helix type motifs used for homotypic and heterotypic protein interactions in other transcriptional regulators. The SPM domain belongs to the extended family of SAM (sterilealpha motif) domains (also known as HLH or pointed domains) which are found in several regulatory proteins including kinases, adaptor proteins, and transcription factors (19Ponting C.P.

Even though the PcG-SPM and the TEL-SAM domains share very little sequence identity, the polyhomeotic SPM domain has been recently reported to form a helical polymer structure similar to the one formed by TEL-SAM, with both domains displaying closely related structural architecture (33Kim C.A. Gingery M. Pilpa R.M. Bowie J.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 453-457PubMed Google Scholar). This homology prompted us to screen several SAM-containing ETS proteins for their ability to interact with H-L(3)MBT. We report that H-L(3)MBT is an HDAC-independent transcriptional repressor, and we have characterized its in vivo andin vitro physical association with TEL; this interaction requires their respective SPM and SAM domains. Using both the stromelysin-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-3) promoter, which is physiologically regulated by TEL, and an artificial TEL-regulatable promoter, we show that H-L(3)MBT is targeted to these promoters through its interaction with TEL, enhancing the repressive effect of TEL on transcription. We believe that this is the first report of a functional interaction between a PcG protein and a mammalian DNA sequence-specific binding transcription factor. Given the pivotal role that ETS factors (and TEL in particular) play in human malignancies, the functional interaction between H-L(3)MBT and TEL provides a clue as to the potential role of PcG proteins such as L(3)MBT in cancer. To generate a full-lengthh-l(3)mbt cDNA clone, total RNA from placenta (Research Genetics) was reverse transcribed using a GeneAmp RNA PCR Core kit (Roche Diagnostics). cDNA products were PCR-amplified with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Diagnostics) in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. using forward (5′-GAGTCTTGAGGCCTGCTGAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGATCCTTGCAGTAAATCACAA-3′) primers for the entire open reading frame of the type I h-l(3)mbt transcript (1Koga H. Matsui S. Hirota T. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3799-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Full-length h-l(3)mbt cDNA was FLAG- or HA-tagged at the 5′-end using PCR methodology. To generate an h-l(3)mbt cDNA lacking the SPM domain, the pCR2.1-FLAG/HA-h-l(3)mbt construct was digested withStuI and SspI to liberate a 525-bp fragment containing the SPM domain sequences. Blunt end ligation of the larger fragment generated an h-l(3)mbt clone with an intact reading frame, lacking the SPM domain. To generate an h-l(3)mbtcDNA lacking the MBT repeats, the splicing by overlap extension (SOEing) method was used (34Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). The SOEing process involves amplification of two products (P1/P2 and P3/P4) in which a tail is added to one product (P1/P2) that is complementary to the end of the second sequence. The two fragments are then able to anneal by virtue of the complementary terminal tails and can self-prime with subsequent amplification of the full-length product by flanking primers (P1 and P4). Hence a template pCR2.1-FLAG-h-l(3)mbt construct DNA was PCR amplified using primer P1 (5′-TCGTTCGACCCCGCCTCGAT-3′) and P2 (5′-TGAGAGGGGGACAGCCCCCAGCAGGCTGGCTGCTGCTCCA-3′) to generate a P1/P2 fragment, and P3 (5′-TGGGGGCTGTCCCCCTCTCA-3′, which is complementary to the end of P2) and P4 (5′-TCCAAGCGGCTTCGGCCAGT-3′) to generate a P3/P4 fragment. Equimolar amounts of P1/P2 and P3/P4 were mixed and PCR amplified using P1 and P4. The resulting P1/P4 fragment encodes an in-frame H-L(3)MBT polypeptide lacking 330 amino acids corresponding to the MBT repeats. The GAL4-DBD-H-L(3)MBT construct was generated by cloning the h-l(3)mbt cDNA in-frame into pFA vector (Stratagene). For creation of the MBT mutant version of this GAL4 fusion construct, SOEing was applied using the P2 and P3 primers mentioned above, with P1 (5′-TGCGACATCATCATCGGAAGAGAG-3′) and P4 (5′-GGGCCTGAAATGAGCCTTGG-3′) amplifying within the pFA vector. For the GAL4-H-L(3)MBT-C2HC deletion mutant 5′-CTTCTTGCGGGCTGAGGCCCCAGGGGAGGCAGAGC-3′ was used for P2, and 5′-GCCTCAGCCCGCAAGAAGA-3′ was used for P3. For the SPM mutant the pFA-h-l(3)mbt DNA was digested with BamH1 andStuI, and the resulting fragment lacking SPM domain sequences was subcloned into the BamHI and SmaI sites of pFA. NIH3T3, U2OS, and 293 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics and were trypsinized and replated to the needed density the day before transfection. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen); 293 cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate DNA precipitation technique (ProFection, Promega, Madison, WI). Unless otherwise specified, 1 μg of expression construct (or empty vector), 2 μg of the reporter construct, and 0.2 μg of the cytomegalovirus-driven GFP expression plasmid (pEGFP-C3) control plasmid (Stratagene) were used for each transfection; the empty pcDNA3 expression vector was added, as needed, to keep the amount of transfected DNA the same for each sample. For the luciferase assays, cells were collected 48 h after transfection and lysed; luciferase activity was assessed using Luciferase Assay Substrate (Promega) on a LUMAT LB9501 (Berthold) luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized according to the percent GFP-positive cells (as assessed by flow cytometry) and the total protein concentration. To rule out general effects of the transfected proteins on the cytomegalovirus promoter the mean fluorescence of the GFP peaks was determined for the samples and found to be comparable. After collection, cells were washed with PBS once, lysed by brief sonication in NET-N lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris pH 8, 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of proteinase inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate), and then clarified by centrifugation. The protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml, and the lysates were incubated with 2 μg of specific antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A+G- agarose beads (Santa Cruz) were added to the extracts and mixed for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed four times with NET-N lysis buffer, once with high salt buffer (1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), and once with low salt buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5); they were released by adding SDS sample buffer and boiled for 4 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE with 7.5% gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Western blotted with the following antibodies: FLAG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (M2, Sigma), HA mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), GAL4-DBD (RK5C1, Santa Cruz), anti-TEL (gift of P. Marynen), and anti-H-L(3)MBT (MBT1) generated in our laboratory (see below). In each experiment, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with the appropriate antibody to assess the correct expression of the cotransfected expression plasmids. Nuclear extracts were prepared in 0.4 m NaCl, according to the protocol of Dignam and co-workers (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitates from nuclear extracts were washed with a buffer containing 0.4m NaCl. The GST fusion protein plasmids were transformed into theEscherichia coli BL21 strain (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). After overnight culture, protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2–4 h. The bacterial pellets were then lysed in 1 ml of PBS-T buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3, 1% Triton X-100), with the aid of sonication. 5 μg of GST-TEL fusion protein (or GST) was incubated with 20 μl of 50% slurry glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 1 ml of PBS-T for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml PBS-T and then incubated with 2 μl ofin vitro transcribed and translated 35S-labeled protein in 1 ml of NET-N buffer for 2–4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with 1 ml of NET-N six times. The bound proteins were released from the beads by boiling in SDS-gel loading buffer for 4 min. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with 7.5% gel and autoradiography. The TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to generate in vitro translated proteins, following the procedures specified by the manufacturer. Anti-H-L(3)MBT antisera were generated by immunizing rabbits with either a 174-amino acid fragment encoding the second half of the MBT repeats (MBT1) or a protein fragment containing the three MBT repeats (MBT2). Each fragment was bacterially expressed as a GST fusion protein using pGEX-4T expression plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The antisera were affinity purified usingN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to GST alone (first passage for negative selection) and then GST-MBT-coupled beads (second passage for positive selection). The affinity-purified MBT2 antibody (suitable for immunoprecipitation) was then coupled to recombinant protein A gel, using the Immunopure rProtein A IgG Plus Orientation kit from Pierce. PcG proteins form large multiprotein complexes, thus we examined the dimerization properties of H-L(3)MBT. First, we determined whether H-L(3)MBT protein could homodimerize using FLAG or HA epitope-tagged H-L(3)MBT cDNAs (shown in Fig.1a), which we transfected into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1b (the 6thlane) the H-L(3)MBT protein clearly homodimerizes; to determine whether the self-binding ability resides in the SPM domain, epitope-tagged versions of mutant H-L(3)MBT proteins lacking either the SPM domain or the three MBT repeats were cotransfected with the full-length HA-H-L(3)MBT. Removal of the SPM domain is sufficient to abrogate homodimerization of H-L(3)MBT (Fig. 1b, 10th lane), whereas removal of the three MBT repeats had no effect on homodimerization (Fig. 1c, 4th lane). The protein membrane was stripped and probed for HA antibody to confirm the presence of equal amount of the HA-tagged proteins (not shown). We conclude that H-L(3)MBT self-associates in vivo and that self-association requires the SPM domain. PcG proteins maintain a chromatin-repressed state, but unlike classic transcription factors they do not recognize specific DNA target sequences. Thus far, the only PcG protein shown to have sequence-specific DNA binding activity is pleiohomeotic, theDrosophila homolog of mammalian YY1 (36Brown J.L. Mucci D. Whiteley M. Dirksen M.L. Kassis J.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although PcG proteins act on chromatin, their repressive function can also be detected in transcriptional assays using transiently transfected reporter gene plasmids (which are believed to form less organized chromatin-like structures) (37Bunker C.A. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1721-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To evaluate the transcriptional regulatory activity associated with H-L(3)MBT, we fused it to the DNA-binding domain (DBD, amino acids 1–147) of GAL4. The GAL4-H-L(3)MBT construct was tested using a luciferase reporter plasmid that contains four copies of the GAL4 DNA recognition sequence positioned immediately upstream of a thymidine kinase (tk80) minimal promoter (diagrammed in Fig.2a, upper panel). Increasing amounts of GAL4-H-L(3)MBT were cotransfected into 293 cells together with a constant amount of luciferase reporter plasmid; a GAL4-TEL fusion protein was included as a positive control for repression. The GAL4-H-L(3)MBT repressed transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a), and the magnitude of this trans-repression effect was similar to that observed with TEL. (The correct expression of the GAL4 fused protein was verified with an anti-GAL4 DBD antibody on the protein lysates (Western blot not shown).) Cotransfection of full-length H-L(3)MBT without the GAL4 moiety (pcDNA3-H-L(3)MBT) did not repress the promoter activity, excluding a general effect on transcription (Fig. 2a). Thus, H-L(3)MBT can function as a transcriptional repressor. Notably, repression of the reporter by GAL4-H-L(3)MBT was not influenced by the addition of a range of concentrations of trichostatin A, whereas repression by GAL4-TEL was partially reversed by it (Fig.2b). This suggests that transcriptional repression by H-L(3)MBT does not depend on HDAC activity. To determine the regions of H-L(3)MBT involved in transcriptional repression, we generated constructs fusing the GAL4-DBD to the N terminus of H-L(3)MBT mutants in which either the three MBT repeats, the SPM domain, or the zinc finger region was deleted. These mutants (diagrammed in Fig.3a) were tested for expression by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3c) and were shown to localize in the cell nucleus by immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). Mutants lacking either the zinc finger or the SPM domain retained the ability to repress the GAL4-reporter gene (Fig.3b). In contrast, the mutant missing the three MBT repeats had a minimal capacity to repress the GAL4-TK-LUC reporter (30% repression compared with ∼90% repression for the wild type protein). Thus, the trans-repressive ability of H-L(3)MBT requires the presence of the MBT repeats for full activity, whereas the zinc finger and SPM domains appear to be dispensable for this function. Repression by H-L(3)MBT-Δ-SPM suggests that self-dimerization is not necessary for trans-repression; however, a role for protein dimerization cannot be completely excluded because the GAL4-DBD itself can direct the oligomerization of GAL4 and GAL4-derived proteins. The SPM domain contained in several PcG proteins shares structural homology with the SAM domain found in a subset of members of the ETS family of transcriptional factors (e.g. TEL) (33Kim C.A. Gingery M. Pilpa R.M. Bowie J.U. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 453-457PubMed Google Scholar, 38Bornemann D. Miller E. Simon J.

To determine whether H-L(3)MBT and TEL interact in vivo we performed immunoprecipitation assays, using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (MBT2) to precipitate H-L(3)MBT followed by Western blotting for TEL. To avoid interference from the heavy chain of the antibody used to pull down H-L(3)MBT, it was necessary to cross-link covalently both the H-L(3)MBT antibody and the normal rabbit polyclonal IgG to protein A-agarose gel (see “Materials and Methods”). Using the osteosarcoma-derived U2OS cells, which express readily detectable levels of both proteins, we showed that the MBT2 anti-H-L(3)MBT antibody, but not the preimmune antiserum, could coprecipitate H-L(3)MBT and TEL (Fig.4). The intensity of the bands in the immunoblot suggests that more TEL protein than H-L(3)MBT protein is present in the immunoprecipitate, however, potential differences in the affinities of the two antisera may account for some of the differences seen. Nonetheless H-L(3)MBT and TEL clearly interact in vivo. To map the regions of H-L(3)MBT and TEL involved in their interaction, we expressed full-length FLAG-H-L(3)MBT and HA-TEL in 293T cells and subjected the cell lysates to immunoprecipitations, using either an anti-HA monoclonal antibody or mouse IgG as a control. HA-TEL coprecipitates with FLAG-H-L(3)MBT (Fig.5a, lane 1); and using intact H-L(3)MBT or TEL, or deletion mutants lacking the MBT repeats or the SAM/SPM domains, we show (in lane 5) that the MBT repeats of H-L(3)MBT are not required for its interaction with TEL. In contrast, deletion of the SAM domain of TEL or the SPM domain of H-L(3)MBT completely abrogates heterodimerization (lanes 3,7, and 9). Thus, these domains are involved in the physical association of TEL and H-L(3)MBT. Recently, TEL2 (or TELB), a new member of the ETS family of transcription factors which is very similar to TEL, was cloned (39Potter M.D. Buijs A. Kreider B. van Rompaey L. Grosveld G.C.

https://openalex.org/W2002268977,"We analyzed the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (i) in powering mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake and (ii) in maintaining a sustained elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](c)). For this purpose, we expressed in HeLa cells aequorin-based Ca(2+)-sensitive probes targeted to different intracellular compartments and studied the effect of two agonists: histamine, acting on endogenous H(1) receptors, and glutamate, acting on co-transfected metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1a), which rapidly inactivates through protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation and thus causes transient inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production. Glutamate induced a transient [Ca(2+)](c) rise and drop in ER luminal [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](er)), and then the ER refilled with [Ca(2+)](c) at resting values. With histamine, [Ca(2+)](c) after the initial peak stabilized at a sustained plateau, and [Ca(2+)](er) decreased to a low steady-state value. In mitochondria, histamine evoked a much larger mitochondrial Ca(2+) response than glutamate ( approximately 15 versus approximately 65 microm). Protein kinase C inhibition, partly relieving mGluR1a desensitization, reestablished both the [Ca(2+)](c) plateau and the sustained ER Ca(2+) release and markedly increased the mitochondrial Ca(2+) response. Conversely, mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake evoked by histamine was drastically reduced by very transient ( approximately 2-s) agonist applications. These data indicate that efficient mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake depends on the preservation of high Ca(2+) microdomains at the mouth of ER Ca(2+) release sites close to mitochondria. This in turn depends on continuous Ca(2+) release balanced by Ca(2+) reuptake into the ER and maintained by Ca(2+) influx from the extracellular space."

It is now well established that MEF2 plays a role in the differentiation of these cell types as well as functioning in a protective role against neuronal apoptosis. To respond to diverse developmental and physiological cues, MEF2 is structurally organized to receive and respond to multiple signals from several intracellular signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 3Naya F.S.

Moreover, consistent with its role as a signal sensor, putative phosphoacceptor motifs in the carboxyl terminal MEF2 transactivation domain may prove to further modulate MEF2 function in response to extracellular cues. Given that MEF2, and the biological processes it regulates, are intrinsically governed by MEF2 phosphorylation status, we undertook to systematically document MEF2 phosphorylation patterns in mammalian cells; previous phosphopeptide mapping studies used in vitrophosphorylated MEF2 protein. The purpose thus being to detect physiologically relevant, and possibly novel, in vivo MEF2 phosphorylation sites. To accomplish this we used several state-of-the-art mass spectrometric techniques to detect phosphorylation sites from MEF2 expressed in mammalian cells. To this end, we have made use of a mammalian tandem affinity purification (TAP) method (16Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 17Cox D.M. Du M. Guo X. Siu K.W. Michael McDermott J.C. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) for low-abundance nuclear transcription factors that allows purification to homogeneity and provides amounts compatible with mass spectrometric analysis of phosphorylation sites. In these studies, we have identified two important and novel aspects of MEF2 regulation. One is a highly conserved phosphoacceptor motif that regulates MEF2 stability and function. The second is an indirect pathway of MEF2 regulation by p38 MAPK mediated by the CK2 holoenzyme. These studies on MEF2 regulation thus identify novel aspects of functional MEF2 regulation that will serve to modulate MEF2 controlled gene expression in a variety of cell types. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (NEB). COS7 and HeLa cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing penicillin, streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals). Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. The coding region for human MEF2A was cloned into the EcoRI site of pCDNA 3.1/His (Invitrogen). The coding region for the N-terminal His-MEF2A was then subcloned into the PstI site of pCDNA4/TO/His (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with 30 μg of DNA per 100-mm dish. Typically, 20 plates of cells were used for a single purification. A standard manufacturer's protocol was used for purification using Ni-Agarose resin (Qiagen).

Michael McDermott J.C. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were lysed by freeze/thawing. The lysate was passed over IgG resin (Sigma), and the beads were washed. Tagged proteins were eluted by cleaving with TEV protease (Invitrogen) then supplementing with Ca2+ and passed over calmodulin resin (Stratagene) for a second round of purification. Proteins were finally eluted using either 2 mm EGTA or SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized using Gelcode Blue (Pierce). Protein bands were excised, cut into 1 mm3 pieces, and washed 3 times with 50% acetonitrile/25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min with shaking. Gel pieces were incubated with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate + 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 50 °C, washed with acetonitrile, then incubated with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate + 55 mm iodoacetamide (freshly made) for 20 min in the dark. The gel pieces were washed with acetonitrile, air dried, and rehydrated with 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, then incubated at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were extracted once using 3% formic acid, 1 min at 80 °C, followed by 20 min of shaking and 1 min of centrifugation. Peptides were concentrated prior to analysis using μZipTipsTM (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Peptides were eluted directly onto a steel target using 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 65% acetonitrile/0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. To purify phosphopeptides, metal-chelating ZipTipsTM (Millipore) were used with copper(II)-sulfate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peptide fingerprinting was performed on a Voyager DE-STR (Applied Biosystems) using positive ion reflector mode under optimized conditions. Fragmentation analysis was performed using a nanospray ion source on a prototype Q-Star instrument (Sciex). The instrument was optimized and calibrated daily. The MEF2A antibody was generated in rabbits using full-length His-MEF2A purified from bacterial cells. The serum was purified against an immobilized MEF2A column (CnBr-activated agarose, Amersham Biosciences) and IgG was concentrated using a protein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Total protein was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred (Semi-Dry, Hoefer) to nitrocellulose (Osmonics), blocked with 5% milk in PBS, and probed with α-MEF2A overnight. Blots were washed 3 × 10 min with milk in PBS, incubated with secondary (1:10,000, Pierce) for 1 h, then washed 2 × 10 min with milk in PBS + 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 3 × 10 min in PBS + 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescence (Pierce) was used for detection. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and resolved on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of 6.2% formaldehyde and then blotted on to Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in 20× SSC. The complete cDNA (2.9 kb) of MEF2A, excised from pMT2 vector with EcoRI, and a 316-bp glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment, derived from exons 5–8 (Ambion) and excised with SacI andHindIII, were used as probes for MEF2A and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. The probes were labeled with32P using Random Primers DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen) and purified on MicroSpinTM G-25 Columns (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization (2 h) and hybridization (overnight) were carried out in 50% deionized formamide, 5× Denhardt's, 5× SSC, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were washed and signals were visualized by exposure to film (BioMax MR, Kodak). Between labeling with MEF2A and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the blots were stripped for 2 h in 50% deionized formamide, 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS preheated to 68 °C. COS7 cells were seeded at 250,000 cells/well in a 6-well dish the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with GAL4 luciferase (0.5 μg), pSV40-β-galactosidase (0.5 μg), and either GAL4-DBD, GAL4-MEF2A, GAL4-MEF2A (S255D), or GAL4-MEF2A (S255A) (0.3 μg). Cells were fed at 24 h and harvested at 48 h post-transfection in 500 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, + 0.1% Triton X-100. 100 μl was used to assay β-galactosidase activity as an internal control of transfection efficiency. 100 μl of lysate was used to assay luciferase activity (Promega, according to manufacturer's instructions) on a Berthold luminometer (LB9507). The GAL4-MEF2A S255A and S255D mutations were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used were: S255A-GTC ATG CCT ACA AAG GCT CCC CCT CCA CCA G and S255D-GTC ATG CCT ACA AAG GAT CCC CCT CCA CCA G. Two purification strategies, His6 and TAP, were employed for obtaining suitable material to probe the phosphorylation status of MEF2A in mammalian cell culture. The His6-MEF2A was expressed in HeLa followed by purification using Ni2+affinity beads. This strategy was capable of purifying amounts of MEF2A that could be visualized using Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.1A). More importantly, the purified MEF2A was found in two distinct bands, indicating that a fraction of it had been post-translationally modified. This pattern of mobility is in agreement with previous detection of MEF2A from HeLa (18Lemercier C. Verdel A. Galloo B. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15594-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), COS7, and muscle cell cultures (19Quinn Z.A. Yang C.C. Wrana J.L. McDermott J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) by Western immunoblotting, and is in sharp contrast to the single band obtained when MEF2A is purified from bacterial cells (data not shown). Purified MEF2A protein was subsequently used to characterize its endogenous phosphorylation status. To investigate the effect of p38 MAPK on the phosphorylation status of MEF2A, we employed an additional purification strategy utilizing the TAP scheme. TAP-MEF2A was expressed in COS7 cells in the absence or presence of expression vectors for p38 MAPK and a constitutively active upstream regulator, MKK6. The TAP scheme purified MEF2A to near homogeneity, allowing us to use Coomassie Blue staining to reveal the sizable shift in mobility of MEF2A caused by p38 MAPK (Fig.1B). This shift has previously only been detected by immunoblotting or radiolabelling. This purification was used to probe for novel p38 phosphorylation sites in MEF2A. Proteins were identified by either tryptic mass fingerprinting or CID fragmentation. The MALDI-TOF spectrum for the tryptic digest of MEF2A (Fig.2A) contains a number of peaks whose masses match the expected mass of peptides from MEF2A. This confidently identifies the protein as MEF2A. Further confirmation was obtained, using a nanospray-QStar instrument, by CID fragmentation of selected peptides. The fragmentation products reveal short sequences and characteristic ions (Fig. 2B) that could only be derived from specific MEF2A peptides. These two types of analyses were subsequently used for identification of phosphopeptides. We used a broad range of techniques to characterize the phosphorylation status of MEF2A in mammalian cell culture. This included comparative analysis between tryptic mass fingerprints, characteristic 80 Da shifts in mass caused by phosphorylation, CID fragmentation, immobilized metal-affinity capture of phosphopeptides, and sequence homology. The details of these analyses will be discussed below. The MALDI-TOF spectra for tryptic mass fingerprints of MEF2A expressed in mammalian cells were very similar to MEF2A expressed in bacterial cells with one notable exception. A peak at mass 1437.69 Da, corresponding to the amino acids 255–269 (SPPPPGGGNLGMNSR), was significantly lower when MEF2A was expressed and purified from mammalian cells (Fig.2A), whereas it was prominent in MEF2A expressed in bacterial cells. This prompted us to investigate what was the cause of this difference. A post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation, was a likely candidate; however, no peak was detected at 80, 160, or 240 Da higher in mass. Careful inspection of the region near 2000 m/z (Fig. 2C) revealed a small peak with an m/z value of 1994.02, corresponding to a MEF2A peptide with one missed trypsin cleavage, amino acids 250–269 (VMPTKSPPPPGGGNLGMNSR), and a peak 79.94 Da higher in mass (2073.96). Phosphate incorporation adds 79.97 Da. These data indicate that a measurable fraction of the MEF2A protein pool in mammalian cells is phosphorylated at Ser-255. This sample was then analyzed on a nanospray-QStar instrument to obtain CID fragmentation data (Fig. 2D). Fragmentation of the potential phosphopeptide revealed a clear set of y fragments identifying a stretch of 4 proline residues. Additionally, the fragment at m/z 1419.76 can only be explained by ay15 fragment that has lost H3PO4 (mass loss of 98 Da). These fragments and others confidently identify this peptide as MEF2A 250–269 phosphorylated at Ser-255. To ascertain the potential importance of this phosphorylation site we compared the sequence of human MEF2A with the other MEF2 family members from various organisms (Fig. 3). The level of sequence homology for this region is remarkable and confirms the high degree of evolutionary conservation of the KSPP phosphorylation motif. The lack of conservation at Thr-253 is in agreement with the fragmentation data, which demonstrates the phosphorylation of Ser-255, not Thr-253. Because Ser-255 is in the MEF2 C-terminal transactivation domain, we assessed the function at this site in a GAL4-based transcriptional response assay by generating mutations of Ser-255 in a GAL4-MEF2A (residues 99–507) fusion protein. These include Ser-255 to aspartic acid (S255D) and Ser-255 to alanine (S255A) mutations. A GAL4 luciferase assay system in COS7 cells was used to determine the activity of these proteins (Fig.4C). The activity of the S255D mutation was markedly lower than that of either the wild type GAL4-MEF2A or the GAL4-MEF2A (S255A) mutation. A Western blot for MEF2A on cells transfected with these expression vectors indicates decreased full-length protein levels for GAL4-MEF2A (S255D) and evidence of degradation products (Fig. 4B). A Northern blot on these samples demonstrates that transcript expression levels can not account for the differences in GAL4-MEF2A protein levels indicated in Fig.4B, thus indicating that the decreased protein levels for GAL4-MEF2A (S255D) are likely due to instability of the protein. This is further supported by the detection of at least one large proteolytic fragment by Western analysis (Fig. 4B). Next, we re-visited the p38 MAPK-catalyzed phosphorylation of MEF2A, because p38 MAPK is a potent physiological activator of MEF2 transactivation potential (10Ornatsky O.I. Cox D.M. Tangirala P. Andreucci J.J. Quinn Z.A. Wrana J.L. Prywes R. Yu Y.T. McDermott J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thr-312 and Thr-319 are known phosphorylation sites important for the increased transcriptional activation of MEF2A by p38 MAPK. Ser-453 and Ser-479 are phosphorylated in vitro but were not important functionally (11Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, previous results indicate that the in vivo phosphorylation of MEF2A by p38 MAPK is possibly more complicated than previously reported (10Ornatsky O.I. Cox D.M. Tangirala P. Andreucci J.J. Quinn Z.A. Wrana J.L. Prywes R. Yu Y.T. McDermott J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A two-dimensional phosphopeptide map of MEF2A expressed in COS7 cells with p38 MAPK and MKK6 showed a very complex pattern of phosphorylation (10Ornatsky O.I. Cox D.M. Tangirala P. Andreucci J.J. Quinn Z.A. Wrana J.L. Prywes R. Yu Y.T. McDermott J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that was different from phosphorylation data derived from in vitro analysis (11Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Because this could have important regulatory consequences, we have used mass spectrometry to further dissect and characterize p38 MAPK phosphorylation of MEF2A in mammalian cells. The tryptic mass fingerprint of MEF2A, co-expressed with p38 MAPK and MKK6, was compared with the lower-mobility band from cells expressing MEF2A alone (Fig. 5). This simple comparison reveals a number of phosphorylated peptides, the evidence for which will now be considered individually. The peptide of mass 4223.05 (MEF2A 190–233, note that the fourth carbon isotope, 4226.06, is labeled in Fig. 5) has one methionine residue and two potential p38 MAPK phosphorylation sites. Methionine residues are often partially oxidized due to exposure to air. In the p38 MAPK-treated sample there is a peak at a mass 80 Da higher, indicating phosphorylation. This peak is not present in the sample from cells expressing MEF2A alone. Furthermore, the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides both show evidence of an oxidized form at a mass 16 Da higher from each respective peak. This confirms that this peptide is the phosphorylated form of MEF2A 190–233. A similar analysis reveals a phosphorylated peptide at mass 2714.32 (MEF2A 475–498). Again, this peptide is 80 Da higher than the non-phosphorylated peptide and is absent from the non-treated sample. Interestingly, in the sample from cells expressing MEF2A alone, the non-phosphorylated peptide is also absent. Occasionally, phosphopeptides lose their phosphate group, either in solution or during ionization. Because this peptide is actually a missed tryptic cleavage of Arg-492, there is the possibility that phosphorylation of this peptide interfered with the trypsin digestion, prior to the loss of phosphate. The MEF2A 95–114 peptide has a mass of 2247.99 whereas its phosphorylated form is found at 2327.96. The intensity of the latter peak is quite high compared with the former peak. However, it is difficult to quantify these peptides based on peak intensity, as the energy required to ionize a phosphopeptide may differ from its non-phosphorylated form. In addition to peptide mass fingerprinting, we employed CID fragmentation to sequence putative phosphopeptides. Furthermore, the efficiency of nanospray ionization employed in this instrument differs from that of the MALDI source used for peptide mass fingerprinting. This form of ionization was particularly suitable for detecting the MEF2A phosphopeptide 404–413 (doubly charged m/zof 617.28). Subsequent CID fragmentation of this peptide confirmed the presence of phosphorylation (loss of H3PO4 from the precursor ion and several fragment ions) at Ser-408 (Fig.6). Of particular interest is the MEF2A peptide 283–300. This region of MEF2A is alternatively spliced, and this particular splice variant is abundant in muscle and nerve cells. Phosphorylation of this peptide is indicated by the 80 Da shift in mass to 2182.95; however, this peptide does not contain a proline-directed MAPK consensus site (Fig.7A). Further evidence that this peptide is phosphorylated is provided by the oxidation of the two methionine residues in this peptide. The phosphorylated peptide shows evidence of two oxidized methionine residues, in agreement with the two oxidized methionine residues seen for the non-phosphorylated peptide. Additional evidence that at least a fraction of this peptide is phosphorylated is provided by the use of a copper immobilized metal-affinity capture purification. MEF2A tryptic peptides were fractionated using a copper(II)-sulfate-treated metal chelating ZipTipTM. Phosphorylated peptides have a higher affinity for Cu2+ than non-phosphorylated peptides. The selectively bound peptides were eluted, concentrated on a C-18 ZipTipTM, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The presence of them/z 2182.92 peptide in this eluate confirms the phosphorylation status of the MEF2A 283–300 peptide (Fig.7B). Sequence analysis of this peptide reveals a strong consensus motif that is targeted by protein kinase CK2. Because phosphorylation of this peptide is dependent on p38 MAPK activation, cross-talk between p38 and protein kinase CK2 in MEF2A phosphorylation is implicated by these data (see “Discussion”). In these studies we have used state-of-the-art mass spectrometric techniques to asses the in vivo phosphorylation pattern of the MEF2A transcriptional regulator. This approach has yielded novel information concerning the regulation of MEF2: first, the identification of a novel phosphoacceptor site that regulates MEF2 stability; second, the identification of previously uncharacterized p38 MAPK phosphoacceptor sites; and third, the discovery of a protein kinase CK2 consensus phosphoacceptor site that requires p38 MAPK activity to be phosphorylated. These studies constitute several novel aspects of MEF2 regulation by reversible phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser-255 in MEF2A by endogenous kinases is detected in several cell types (C2C12, COS, and HeLa), and this phosphorylation is independent of the activity of p38 MAPK (Fig. 5). This sequence is highly conserved in members of the MEF2 family across numerous species, highlighting the importance of this site in the regulation of MEF2 proteins. The conserved sequence consists of a KSP motif, which is a known phosphoacceptor site for several kinases. This includes MAPK members (ERK1, ERK2, and stress-activated protein kinase) (20Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9466-9472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cdc2-like kinases (including CDK5) (22Shetty K.T. Link W.T. Pant H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8262-8267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of these proteins in both muscle and nerve cells is suggestive of a link between these pathways and the functional consequences of phosphorylation of this site in MEF2. The extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) are abundant in nerve cells (25Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in the myogenic program (26Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M.

Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The activity of ERK is biphasic, with higher activity in myoblasts and later stage myotubes (26Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Puri P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3951-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 28Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the early stages of the myogenic program, ERK has an inhibitory effect on the expression of myogenic regulators and muscle-specific proteins (28Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 29Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In later stages of differentiation, ERK appears to enhance the formation of mature myotubes (26Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Puri P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3951-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 27Gredinger E. Gerber A.N.

Olson E.N. Rosenthal N. Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation-induced degradation of MEF2 proteins by ERK would explain the early inhibitory effect that ERK has on the myogenic program. The CDK5 protein is found predominantly in nervous tissue, although it has also been detected in muscle and other non-neural tissues. It has been implicated in migration, actin dynamics, microtubule transport, cell adhesion, axon guidance, synaptic structure and plasticity, membrane transport, and myogenesis (31Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). In muscle cells CDK5 can be detected throughout the myogenic program. The level of expression and activity of CDK5 is increased during myogenesis. In addition, proliferating myoblasts show a predominantly cytoplasmic localization of CDK5, whereas differentiating cells have an increase in nuclear levels of CDK5 (32Lazaro J.B. Kitzmann M. Poul M.A. Vandromme M. Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility exists that CDK5 has a role in regulating the activity of MEF2 proteins by direct phosphorylation, although how this would pertain to regulation of MEF2 by degradation would require further investigation. The ubiquitous phosphorylation of Ser-255, coupled with its role in the degradation of MEF2, points tantalizingly toward a role for glycogen synthase kinase 3. Originally thought of as an enzyme solely involved in glycogen metabolism, this ubiquitous kinase is now known to be involved in numerous cellular signaling functions (33Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Overexpression of active glycogen synthase kinase 3 induces apoptosis in neuronal cells by phosphorylation of downstream targets (34Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). In addition, glycogen synthase kinase 3 is known to phosphorylate several proteins, which are subsequently targeted for degradation (35Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 36Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that MEF2 has recently been identified as protecting neuronal cells from apoptosis (2Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 37Okamoto S. Li Z. Ju C. Scholzke M.N. Mathews E. Cui J. Salvesen G.S. Bossy-Wetzel E. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 38Okamoto S. Krainc D. Sherman K. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7561-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and that it is also targeted for degradation by phosphorylation (39Li M. Linseman D.A. Allen M.P. Meintzer M.K. Wang X. Laessig T. Wierman M.E. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6544-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether Ser-255 is the targeted residue that links MEF2 degradation and neuronal apoptosis will be of great interest. MEF2A has been convincingly identified as a target for p38 MAPK. Phosphorylation of MEF2A by p38 MAPK strongly increases the transcriptional activity of MEF2A, and this increase in activity has been mapped to a couple of key residues (Thr-312 and Thr-319) (10Ornatsky O.I. Cox D.M. Tangirala P. Andreucci J.J. Quinn Z.A. Wrana J.L. Prywes R. Yu Y.T. McDermott J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, in vivo phosphorylation of MEF2A by p38 MAPK produces a complex pattern of phosphorylation that cannot be entirely explained by these two key residues. The possibility, therefore, remains that other sites within MEF2A are involved in p38 MAPK signaling. Although the tryptic phosphopeptide containing Thr-312 and Thr-319 was too large to detect by mass spectrometry, the data from this study conclusively identify several new phosphorylation sites, induced by p38 MAPK activity (Fig.8). Most notable among these p38 MAPK-induced phosphorylation sites is the confirmation of phosphorylation at a consensus protein kinase CK2 site, Ser-289. This region of MEF2A (and the homologous region of MEF2C) is known to be alternatively spliced in different tissues (40McDermott J.C. Cardoso M.C. Yu Y.T. Andres V. Leifer D. Krainc D. Lipton S.A. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 41Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible tissue-specific functional role for this region. Its sequence is highly suggestive of a protein kinase CK2 site ((S/T)XX(D/E)) that, until now, had not been confirmed as a phosphoacceptor site. The data presented here demonstrates that Ser-289 is likely a target of protein kinase CK2, but more interestingly, it suggests a link between p38 MAPK activity and the phosphorylation of MEF2A by protein kinase CK2. In fact, a previous report indicates that the CK2 holoenzyme (α and β subunits) can be activated specifically by p38 MAPK (42Sayed M. Kim S.O. Salh B.S. Issinger O.G. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16569-16573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), indicating the possibility that CK2 and p38 MAPK may cooperatively dock with MEF2A. MEF2 proteins are involved in a number of different cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and hypertrophy. These disparate roles for MEF2 are partly explained by the regulated activation of specific signaling pathways. Here we provide conclusive evidence for the phosphorylation of MEF2A by a number of signal-dependant kinases. These data concerning reversible phosphorylation of MEF2A will be a fundamental aspect of understanding the diverse function of MEF2 proteins.

Up-regulation, an increase in numbers of radioligand-binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), occurs on exposure to nicotine at high concentrations. To determine whether altered gene expression might account for long term changes and up-regulation following nicotine exposure, we assessed effects of 1 h of 1 mm nicotine exposure on alteration of gene expression in the neuron-like SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma clonal line. Repeat and cross-controlled microarray analyses yielded a list of 17 genes from the initially screened ∼5,000 whose expression was consistently altered following nicotine treatment. Subsequent quantitative, real time reverse transcriptase PCR analyses confirmed altered expression in 14 of 16 genes tested. Further, the general nAChR antagonist, d-tubocurarine, blocked all but two of the observed changes in gene expression, indicating that these changes are dependent on nAChR activation. Use of other antagonists revealed that nAChR subtypes can differentially affect gene expression. The genes affected code for proteins that may be broadly categorized into four groups: transcription factors, protein processing factors, RNA-binding proteins, and plasma membrane-associated proteins. Our results suggest that nicotinic activation of nAChR may have a broad role in affecting cellular physiology through modulating gene expression.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Nicotine is a tobacco alkaloid that acts acutely to stimulate nAChR channel opening, as does the endogenous nAChR ligand, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This functional response is a transient event thought only to alter electrical activity in excitable cells. However, some nAChR are expressed in nonexcitable tissues. Moreover, longer term psychological and physiological effects of nicotine on the brain and body also must reflect interactions with nAChR, but only if there are lasting consequences of ligand binding and/or ion channel opening. An improved understanding of both the molecular signaling cascades initiated by short or longer term interactions of nicotine with nAChR and the specific targets of those signaling cascades is essential to enhanced perspectives on normal physiological roles of nAChR. Nicotine is known to affect the expression of several genes. Among these is the gene coding for tyrosine hydroxylase, which is involved in a rate-limiting step in catecholamine synthesis (5Carr L.A. Rowell P.P. Pierce W.M. Neurochem. Res. 1989; 14: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Shim I.S. Won J.S. Lee J.K. Song D.K. Kim S.E. Huh S.O. Kim Y.H. Suh H.W. J. Ethnopharmacol. 2000; 70: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), as well as genes involved in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure, such as neuropeptide Y, orexins, and their receptors (7Kane J.K. Parker S.L. Matta S.G. Fu Y. Sharp B.M. Li M.D. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3623-3629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Li M.D. Kane J.K. Parker S.L. McAllen K. Matta S.G. Sharp B.M. Brain Res. 2000; 867: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, nicotine, like other substances of abuse, such as cocaine and alcohol, induces the expression of immediate early genes such as c-fos and junB in various brain regions (9Pich E.M. Pagliusi S.R. Tessari M. Talabot-Ayer D. van Hooft H. Chiamulera C. Science. 1997; 275: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 10Harlan R.E. Garcia M.M. Mol.

Nicotine also up-regulates the mRNA levels of c-fos and c-jun in the neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line. 2L. Lucero and R. J. Lukas, unpublished observation. Because these immediate early genes function as transcription factors, their nicotine-mediated up-regulation suggests that nicotine may regulate the expression of additional genes in SH-SY5Y cells. Nicotine activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in a variety of tissues and cell types (12Heusch W.L. Maneckjee R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Tang K. Wu H. Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mol.

Recent work indicates that nicotine also activates this signaling pathway in SH-SY5Y cells (16Dajas-Bailador F.A. Soliakov L. Wonnacott S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Further, nicotine and MAPK signaling pathways affect many of the same cellular processes, such as cell survival and memory processing (1Levin E.D. Simon B.B. Psychopharmacology. 1998; 138: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 3Donnely-Roberts D.L. Brioni J.D. Arneric S.P. Brioni J.D.

Beyond the role of nicotine in activating the MAPK cascade and early immediate gene expression, little is known about the specific genes that nicotine may regulate. We therefore investigated the effects of nicotine exposure on gene expression in the SH-SY5Y cell line using a microarray-based approach to identify candidate nicotine-regulated genes. We show that nicotine, at a concentration that induces up-regulation of nAChR, a process that has been implicated in nicotine dependence and tolerance, affects the expression of a wide range of genes that code for proteins with seemingly diverse functions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that nicotine can modulate the gene expression profile of a neuron-like cell line and suggest that some of the cellular and physiological effects of nicotine may result from these nAChR-mediated effects. The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma-derived cell line was grown to 90% confluence and treated with 1 mm nicotine for 1 h at 37 °C under standard incubation conditions (95% humidity, 5% CO2) (19Lukas R.J. Norman S.A. Lucero L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1993; 4: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA was isolated using the Oligotex®Direct mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. In a repeat experiment for RT-PCR analyses (see below), SH-SY5Y cells at 90% confluence were treated with 1 mmnicotine alone, 100 μm d-tubocurarine (d-TC) alone, or 1 mm nicotine plus 100 μm d-TC for 1 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). To assess nAChR subtype-specific effects on gene expression, SH-SY5Y cells were grown to 90% confluence and treated with 1 mm nicotine, 1 μm α-cobratoxin, 1 μm α-cobratoxin plus 1 mm nicotine, 3 μm mecamylamine, or 3 μm mecamylamine plus 1 mm nicotine for 1 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). RNA concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry and adjusted accordingly. Only RNA samples with anA 260/A 280ratio > 1.4 were used for microarray hybridizations and RT-PCR experiments. Microarray analyses were performed by the University of Arizona Cancer Center Microarray Core Facility on a fee-for-service basis. Briefly, for both the control sample and the nicotine-treated sample, 4 μg of mRNA was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, incorporating Cy3-dUTP into the control sample cDNA and Cy5-dUTP into the nicotine-treated sample cDNA. In separate reverse transcription reactions for an independent hybridization, the control sample cDNA was labeled with Cy5-dUTP, and the nicotine-treated sample cDNA was labeled with Cy3-dUTP. These reciprocal labeling reactions were performed twice and hybridized to individual arrays, yielding four replicate sets of “dye switch” data designed to control for any bias caused by selectivity of dye staining intensity of specific cDNAs. The labeled cDNA probes were purified using the QIAquick® PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified cDNA was then mixed with a hybridization buffer containing 15 μg of poly(dA), 6 μg of yeast tRNA, 15 μg of CoT 10 DNA, 2× Denhardt's, 2.7× SSC, and 0.2% SDS, denatured, and hybridized for 16 h at 62 °C on a 5K cDNA microarray. The cDNAs imprinted on these arrays are available from Research Genetics. For detailed information about the microarray used in these experiments and the genes represented on the array refer to azcc-microarray.arl.arizona.edu/index.php3. Following hybridization, the slides were washed for 15 min in 0.5× SSC, 0.01% SDS and for 15 min in 0.06× SSC, 0.01% SDS, followed by a final 5-min wash with 0.06× SSC. The slides were then scanned for fluorescence emission from each spot on the array at 570 and 670 nm for Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. In microarray studies performed at the Arizona Cancer Center microarray facility, median intensity of a given spot of 1.4-fold above background intensity in both the Cy5 and Cy3 channels was required for calculation of expression ratios. Background intensity was assessed by measuring fluorescence from a spot containing no cDNA. The raw levels of fluorescence for each spot were corrected for this background fluorescence and analyzed. The fluorescence intensity values in the two fluorescence channels were normalized relative to a set of housekeeping genes. Lastly, the standard deviation of the mean of the log10 of the ratios for the housekeeping genes was used to calculate 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, and 99% confidence intervals, against which the ratios of signal intensities for all other spots on the arrays with fluorescence above background were compared. The statistical significance of the changes identified were calculated using a paired, two-tailed t test comparing the observed expression ratios for the four replicates to a reference value of 1. For this analysis, 5 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA from the untreated SH-SY5Y cells and from each of the drug-treated cells was reverse transcribed using SuperScript® II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Following reverse transcription, each sample was diluted such that cDNA corresponding to that produced from 10 ng of total RNA was used in subsequent PCRs. PCRs were performed using the LightCycler® (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which allows real time monitoring of the increase in PCR product concentration after every cycle based on the fluorescence of the double-stranded DNA specific dye SYBR green (20Rasmussen R.P. Morrison T. Herrmann M. Wittwer C.T. Biochemica. 1998; 2: 8-11Google Scholar, 21Roche Biochemicals (2000) LightCycler operators manual, version 3.0.Google Scholar). The number of cycles required to produce a detectable product above background was measured for each sample. These cycle numbers were then used to calculate fold differences in the starting mRNA level for each sample using the following method. First, the cycle number difference for vimentin, a housekeeping gene, was determined in the control sample and the appropriate drug-treated sample. This difference was referred to as ΔH. Next, the cycle number difference for the gene of interest was determined in the control sample and the appropriate drug-treated sample, yielding another value, ΔI. The cycle number difference for the gene of interest was then corrected for slight differences in the amount of total RNA in control and drug-treated samples by subtracting ΔH from ΔI, yielding a new value, ΔK. The expression ratio for the gene of interest was then calculated as 2−(Δ K) for genes that were induced and as −(2ΔK) for genes that were repressed. The expression ratios reported are the averages of three to eight replicate PCRs. The statistical significance was calculated using a paired, two-tailed t test comparing the cycle number difference for the gene of interest (ΔI) to that of vimentin (ΔH) across all replicates. Specificity of each primer pair was confirmed by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers were designed using Primer3 software (bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/cgi-bin/primer/primer3.cgi) and subsequently checked for specificity using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/HsBlast.html). To assess the extent to which nicotine modulates gene expression in neuronal cells, we have performed analyses using a microarray containing cDNAs corresponding to ∼5,000 different genes. These results provide the foundation for more exhaustive whole genome screening. However, here we have focused on a smaller number to identify novel nicotine-regulated genes and firmly establish the extent to which nicotine alters the expression of these genes. For these analyses, the neuroblastoma-derived SH-SY5Y cell-line was treated with 1 mm nicotine for 1 h. Treatment with 1 mmnicotine maximally induces a long lasting up-regulation in numbers of nAChR radioligand-binding sites in SH-SY5Y cells, and this up-regulation has been implicated in long lasting effects of nicotine exposure, such as nicotine dependence and tolerance (22Ke L. Eisenhour C.M. Bencherif M. Lukas R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 825-840PubMed Google Scholar). Messenger RNA isolated from these cells or from control cells was used in the microarray analyses. Based on previous results investigating the effects of nicotine on gene expression (23Zhang S. Day I.N. Ye S. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we anticipated that nicotine may have subtle effects on gene expression in the SH-SY5Y cell line. For this reason, we performed reciprocal fluorescent labeling of the control and nicotine-treated mRNA populations in duplicate, yielding a data set consisting of four independently hybridized, cross-controlled microarrays (see “Materials and Methods”). Multiple replicate hybridizations using reverse labeled samples are necessary to elucidate significant changes in gene expression in the 1.2–1.6-fold range (see Ref. 24Mirnics K. Middleton F.A. Lewis D.A. Levitt P. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 479-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar and references therein). These multiple hybridizations and reciprocal labeling experiments were then assessed to identify the most consistent and significant (reproducible changes in effects between experiments) changes in gene expression. We compared all of the data at the 40% confidence interval (see “Materials and Methods”) for genes whose expression was consistently up-regulated or down-regulated in all four replicate hybridizations. We selected the 40% confidence interval to avoid excluding subtle gene expression changes. Using this comparison we identified a list of 17 consistently altered genes (TableI). Statistical analyses using Student'st test showed these changes to be significant at thep < 0.05 level for all but one of these genes (RAB6A). The number of affected genes increased to 51 when comparing only three arrays and to 392 genes if only one reciprocal labeling experiment was used. Thus, multiple replicate arrays using reverse labeled samples were necessary to minimize the number of false positives from the large data set and to confirm identification of candidate genes whose expression was changed subtly but reproducibly. Importantly, because there was some variability in expression ratios between hybridizations, it is possible that significant but subtle changes in gene expression were lost as more replicates were added to the analysis. The genes identified and the significance of their sensitivity to nicotine exposure will be discussed in greater detail below. However, it is notable that there were increases in expression of only 3 of the 17 genes, whereas expression of the other 14 genes was repressed by nicotine treatment. Also notable was the low magnitude of these changes resulting from nicotine treatment, including 26–38% increases in gene expression for the three up-regulated genes and a greater than 2-fold decrease in expression for only one of the 14 down-regulated genes.Table IMicroarray analyses reveal numerous, consistent, nicotine-induced alterations of gene expressionGene nameGenBank™ numberArray 1 ratioArray 2 ratioArray 3 ratioArray 4 ratioAverage ratioS.D.Matrin3, Mat3AA0753071.291.521.331.391.381-aSignificance at the p < 0.05 level as measured by paired t test.0.10Contactin 1, CNTN1H205660.730.690.480.830.681-bSignificance at the p < 0.01 level.0.15Fasciculation and elongation protein zeta, ZyginH207591.261.161.551.521.371-bSignificance at the p < 0.01 level.0.19Tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2, TFPI2AA3994731.131.161.311.451.261-bSignificance at the p < 0.01 level.0.15Chromosome 2 open reading frame 2, C2orf2N647310.850.680.620.820.741-bSignificance at the p < 0.01 level.0.11Zinc finger RNA binding protein, ZFRAA2329790.840.850.720.630.761-bSignificance at the p < 0.01 level.0.10Protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type A, PTPαH824190.830.740.740.850.791-aSignificance at the p < 0.05 level as measured by paired t test.0.06RAB6AH201380.810.790.480.770.710.16PIG7/LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor, PIG7/LITAF1AA6256660.790.790.770.820.791-aSignificance at the p < 0.05 level as measured by paired t test.0.02Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 3, MLL3N913020.790.750.800.810.791-aSignificance at the p < 0.05 level as measured by paired t test.0.02Dihydrofolate reductase, DHFRN529800.780.660.770.680.721-aSignificance at the p < 0.05 level as measured by paired t test.0.06Regulatory factor X-associated protein, RFXAPAA0574360.760.780.770.820.781-aSignificance at the p < 0.05 level as measured by paired t test.0.03ESTT697540.730.570.710.710.681-aSignificance at the p < 0.05 level as measured by paired t test.0.07Ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, UBE3AR852130.700.750.760.810.751-aSignificance at the p < 0.05 level as measured by paired t test.0.05Retinoblastoma binding protein 6, RBBP6R887410.650.640.680.790.691-aSignificance at the p < 0.05 level as measured by paired t test.0.07Homo sapiens mRNA; cDNA DKFZp564F112N282680.490.520.750.450.541-bSignificance at the p < 0.01 level.0.14Early growth response 1, EGR1AA4866280.360.540.550.310.441-bSignificance at the p < 0.01 level.0.12Listed are the gene names, GenBank™ accession numbers, and expression ratios for each individual array, as well as the average ratio (±S.D.) across all four microarray hybridizations.

We used a pharmacological approach both as another way to test the significance and specificity of changes in gene expression and, because nicotine readily crosses the cell membrane, to assess whether nicotine altered gene expression through nAChR-dependent or nAChR-independent pathways. In the course of these studies, we also obtained sample replicates and analyzed them by real time RT-PCR to confirm the results of the microarray surveys. The SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 1 mm nicotine alone, 100 μm d-TC (a general nAChR antagonist) alone, or the combination of 100 μm d-TC plus 1 mm nicotine. We then utilized quantitative, real time RT-PCR using total RNA as the template to verify and replicate the gene expression changes observed in the microarray experiments (see “Materials and Methods”). Vimentin mRNA was chosen as the control for normalization because its expression level was unchanged in the microarray analyses (−1.03 ± 0.31). In addition, subsequent RT-PCR experiments wherein the levels of vimentin mRNA were compared with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA showed that both mRNAs were present at comparable levels in all drug-treated samples relative to the control sample (Fig.1 and TableII (GAPDH row)). Further, when normalized to the amount of total RNA in each sample, none of the drug treatments altered the expression of either GAPDH or vimentin.

Both the 22-kDa N-terminal domain and 10-kDa C-terminal domain of apoE contain a heparin binding site; the N-terminal site overlaps with the low density lipoprotein receptor binding region and the C-terminal site is undefined. To understand the molecular details of the apoE-heparin interaction, we defined the microenvironments of all 12 lysine residues in intact apoE3 and examined their relative contributions to heparin binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance measurements showed that, in apoE3-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine discs, Lys-143 and -146 in the N-terminal domain and Lys-233 in the C-terminal domain have unusually low pKa values, indicating high positive electrostatic potential around these residues. Binding experiments using heparin-Sepharose gel demonstrated that the lipid-free 10-kDa fragment interacted strongly with heparin and a point mutation K233Q largely abolished the binding, indicating that Lys-233 is involved in heparin binding and that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment is critical for the interaction with heparin. With lipidated apoE3, it is confirmed that the Lys-233 site is completely masked and the N-terminal site mediates heparin binding. In addition, mutations of the two heparin binding sites in intact apoE3 demonstrated the dominant role of the N-terminal site in the heparin binding of apoE even in the lipid-free state. These results suggest that apoE interacts predominately with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans through the N-terminal binding site.

Through its interaction with these receptors and with the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE mediates the catabolism of remnant lipoproteins (4Cooper A.D. J.

In the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE is postulated to interact initially with cell-surface HSPG and then to transfer to the LRP for internalization (6Ji Z.S. Fazio S. Lee Y.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Therefore, the interaction of apoE with HSPG is an initial step in the clearance of apoE-containing lipoproteins from the plasma. The apoE-HSPG interaction is also involved in the differential effects of the apoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth (8Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J. Nathan B. Mahley R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain exists in the lipid-free state as a four-helix bundle of amphipathic α-helices and contains the LDL receptor binding region (residues 136–150 in helix 4) (17Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The amphipathic nature of the α-helix containing residues 136–150 is critical for normal binding to the LDL receptor (18Zaiou M. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Segall M.L.

Our recent studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) demonstrated that Lys-143 and Lys-146 have unusually low pKa values because of local increases in positive electrostatic potential associated with the region surrounding residues 136–150 (19Lund-Katz S.

The C-terminal domain is also predicted to be a highly α-helical structure and contains the major lipid binding region (21Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

The detailed molecular features of the α-helices in the C-terminal domain are poorly understood.The N- and C-terminal domains each contain a heparin binding site (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N.

The N-terminal domain site is located between residues 142–147 and overlaps with the receptor binding region (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the HSPG binding activity of apoE variants is significantly decreased by mutations of Arg-142, Arg-145, and Lys-146, indicating that these basic amino acid residues contribute to heparin binding (25Ji Z.S. Fazio S. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13421-13428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study on the interaction between a heparin-derived oligosaccharide and the N-terminal domain of apoE4 found that Arg-142 and -145 form salt bridges with sulfate groups from the octasaccharide fragment (26Dong J. Peters-Libeu C.A. Weisgraber K.H. Segelke B.W. Rupp B. Capila I. Hernaiz M.J. LeBrun L.A. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2826-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), consistent with a dramatically reduced binding affinity of apoE4(R142C) and apoE4(R145C) mutants for HSPG (25Ji Z.S. Fazio S. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13421-13428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study also predicted additional interactions between the heparin fragment and Lys-143, Lys-146, and Arg-147. Most recently, a site-directed mutagenesis study showed that Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 are required for high-affinity binding to heparin, with Lys-146 participating in an ionic interaction with the heparin fragment and Lys-143 participating in a hydrogen bond (27Libeu C.P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Wehrli S. Hernaiz M.J. Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Raffai R.L. Newhouse Y.M. Zhou F. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

We demonstrated that the isolated C-terminal domain binds to heparin with higher affinity than the N-terminal domain in the lipid-free state and that an unusual basic microenvironment around Lys-233 is involved in heparin binding. Surprisingly, this C-terminal site is unavailable for heparin binding in both the lipid-free and lipidated states of the intact apoE molecule, suggesting that only the N-terminal site contributes to the interaction of apoE with HSPGin vivo.DISCUSSIONThe interaction between apoE and HSPG is important in several processes, such as lipoprotein remnant clearance (5Mahley R.W.

ApoE has at least two heparin binding sites located between residues 142 and 147 in the N-terminal receptor binding region (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and less well defined sites in the C-terminal lipid binding region (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N.

The N-terminal site has recently been characterized using apoE4 22-kDa fragments and an enzymatically prepared heparin oligosaccharide; Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 within this site are involved in the interaction with the heparin fragment (27Libeu C.P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Wehrli S. Hernaiz M.J. Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Raffai R.L. Newhouse Y.M. Zhou F. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol.

In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified Lys-233 as a key lysine residue in the C-terminal site and also estimated the relative contributions of both sites to the heparin binding of full-length apoE. Earlier studies using either synthetic apoE peptides or blocking monoclonal antibodies suggested that residues 211–218 (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and 243–272 (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contain heparin binding sites. The former site is not a factor in the observed binding of the C-terminal 10-kDa fragment to heparin because it is not included in this domain. It is also not functional in the 12-kDa fragment because this does not bind to heparin (Fig. 6). Presumably, the small peptide containing residues 211–218 (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) can bind because its conformation is different from when it is present as part of the apoE molecule. It is possible that Lys-233 is part of the heparin binding site identified by a blocking antibody with an epitope located between residues 243–272 (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the presence of the antibody may interfere with the functionality of Lys-233.Our NMR results imply that among all 12 lysines of full-length apoE3, Lys-143 and -146 in the N-terminal domain and Lys-233 in the C-terminal domain have unusually low pKa values, indicative of high positive electrostatic potential around these residues. Previous studies showed that this greater positive electrostatic potential around Lys-143 and -146 is involved in the high-affinity binding of the N-terminal domain of apoE to the LDL receptor and heparin. In this study, we demonstrated that residue Lys-233 is critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3), indicating that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment in the C-terminal domain is also involved in the heparin interaction. In an amphipathic α-helix spanning this region, the basic residues Arg-226, Lys-233, and Lys-240 are aligned, two turns apart, along one side of the helix. It is interesting that there are several acidic residues in the amino acid sequence near Lys-233, but they are mostly located on the opposite side of the amphipathic α-helix. Consequently, they do not reduce the positive electrostatic potential around the side chain of Lys-233.Comparison of the heparin binding abilities of full-length apoE3 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments yields interesting insights. In the lipid-free state, the 10-kDa fragment binds to heparin with higher affinity than the 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the heparin binding of the 10-kDa fragment was completely abolished when complexed with lipid (Fig. 4B), consistent with previous observations showing that the C-terminal site is only available for interaction in the lipid-free state (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Dong J. Balestra M.E. Newhouse Y.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1783-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of apoE forms a stable tetramer and is responsible for self-association of apoE in aqueous solution, whereas the N-terminal domain is primarily monomeric (16Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the stronger interaction of the C-terminal domain with heparin appears to be because of its tetramerization. As shown in Fig. 6, the heparin binding affinity of the apoE3 (1–260) variant, which is monomeric in solution, is much lower than that of wild-type apoE3 and is comparable with that of the 22-kDa fragment, indicating that tetramerization through the C-terminal domain is crucial for the heparin binding ability of the lipid-free apoE. Multiple sequences of heparin binding peptide enhance heparin binding through cooperativity effects (45Verrecchio A. Germann M.W. Schick B.P. Kung B. Twardowski T. San Antonio J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly, multiple copies of the receptor binding domain are necessary for the high affinity interaction of apoE with the LDL receptor (46Funahashi T. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem.

In this regard, the different binding affinities of full-length apoE3 and the 22-kDa fragment in DMPC discs (Fig. 4B) may be explained by the difference in cooperativity arising from different numbers of the N-terminal domain per particle.Despite the strong heparin binding ability of the 10-kDa fragment, the C-terminal site of full-length apoE3 does not appear to be involved in the heparin binding of lipid-free apoE. As shown in Fig. 5C, there were only small differences in heparin binding among the lipid-free wild-type apoE3, apoE3(K233Q), and apoE3(K233E) variants, suggesting that, even in the lipid-free state, only the N-terminal site is involved in the heparin interaction of full-length apoE. It is not clear why the C-terminal site of the lipid-free apoE is unavailable to interaction with heparin. One possible explanation is that the heparin interaction of the C-terminal domain is sterically hindered by the hinge region (residues 192–215), which acts as a spacer connecting the two domains. Indeed, the 12-kDa fragment, which contains both the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region, bound defectively to heparin (Fig.6). Thus, interaction between the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region might mask the C-terminal heparin binding site (the basic residues around Lys-233), preventing interaction with heparin. A recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer study of apoE3 indicates spatial proximity between the N- and the C-terminal domains in the lipid-free state, with the hinge region tethering the N-terminal domain close to the C-terminal domain (48Narayanaswami V.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37853-37860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).ApoE-containing high density lipoproteins bind to the proteoglycan, biglycan, in arterial walls, and apoE is thought to act as a bridging molecule that traps these particles in atherosclerotic intima (49O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This binding interaction between apoE and biglycan was shown recently to occur via the C-terminal domain in which the charged residues, especially lysine and arginine between residues 223 and 230, are involved in the binding (50Klezovitch O.

The results of the present study suggest that the unusually basic microenvironment around Lys-233 contributes to the apoE-biglycan interaction. Recent studies demonstrated that C-terminal fragments of apoE are complexed with amyloid in the brain (52Castano E.M. Prelli F. Pras M. Frangione B. J. Biol.

Sanan D.A. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8838-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The presence of apoE proteolytic fragments in vivo raises the possibility that the C-terminal fragment may contribute to Alzheimer's disease by interaction with HSPG in the brain.In conclusion, we have identified the heparin binding site of the C-terminal domain of apoE. Our data show that the basic residues around lysine 233 are critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain but are unavailable for heparin binding in full-length apoE even in the lipid-free state. Thus, it seems that lipid-poor apoE associates with cell surface HSPG only through the N-terminal domain, leaving the C-terminal domain available for binding to lipoprotein particles. Apolipoprotein E (apoE)1is a critical ligand for several hepatic lipoprotein receptors, including the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), and for cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 2Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 507-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Through its interaction with these receptors and with the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE mediates the catabolism of remnant lipoproteins (4Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2173-2192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the HSPG-LRP pathway, apoE is postulated to interact initially with cell-surface HSPG and then to transfer to the LRP for internalization (6Ji Z.S. Fazio S. Lee Y.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mahley R.W. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 32: 414-429PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of apoE with HSPG is an initial step in the clearance of apoE-containing lipoproteins from the plasma. The apoE-HSPG interaction is also involved in the differential effects of the apoE isoforms on neurite outgrowth (8Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J. Nathan B. Mahley R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L.

In addition, several studies suggest that binding of apoE to HSPG may be involved in Alzheimer's disease (5Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,15Shuvaev V.V. Siest G. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 280: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ApoE, a 299-amino acid, single chain protein, contains two independently folded functional domains, a 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1–191) and a 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 222–299) (2Weisgraber K.H.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain exists in the lipid-free state as a four-helix bundle of amphipathic α-helices and contains the LDL receptor binding region (residues 136–150 in helix 4) (17Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The amphipathic nature of the α-helix containing residues 136–150 is critical for normal binding to the LDL receptor (18Zaiou M. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Segall M.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) demonstrated that Lys-143 and Lys-146 have unusually low pKa values because of local increases in positive electrostatic potential associated with the region surrounding residues 136–150 (19Lund-Katz S.

The C-terminal domain is also predicted to be a highly α-helical structure and contains the major lipid binding region (21Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The detailed molecular features of the α-helices in the C-terminal domain are poorly understood. The N- and C-terminal domains each contain a heparin binding site (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain site is located between residues 142–147 and overlaps with the receptor binding region (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the HSPG binding activity of apoE variants is significantly decreased by mutations of Arg-142, Arg-145, and Lys-146, indicating that these basic amino acid residues contribute to heparin binding (25Ji Z.S. Fazio S. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13421-13428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study on the interaction between a heparin-derived oligosaccharide and the N-terminal domain of apoE4 found that Arg-142 and -145 form salt bridges with sulfate groups from the octasaccharide fragment (26Dong J. Peters-Libeu C.A. Weisgraber K.H. Segelke B.W. Rupp B. Capila I. Hernaiz M.J. LeBrun L.A. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2826-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), consistent with a dramatically reduced binding affinity of apoE4(R142C) and apoE4(R145C) mutants for HSPG (25Ji Z.S. Fazio S. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13421-13428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study also predicted additional interactions between the heparin fragment and Lys-143, Lys-146, and Arg-147. Most recently, a site-directed mutagenesis study showed that Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 are required for high-affinity binding to heparin, with Lys-146 participating in an ionic interaction with the heparin fragment and Lys-143 participating in a hydrogen bond (27Libeu C.P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Wehrli S. Hernaiz M.J. Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Raffai R.L. Newhouse Y.M. Zhou F. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39138-39144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The goal of the current study was to identify the heparin binding site in the C-terminal domain of apoE and to characterize its contribution to the apoE-heparin interaction in both lipid-free and lipidated states. We demonstrated that the isolated C-terminal domain binds to heparin with higher affinity than the N-terminal domain in the lipid-free state and that an unusual basic microenvironment around Lys-233 is involved in heparin binding. Surprisingly, this C-terminal site is unavailable for heparin binding in both the lipid-free and lipidated states of the intact apoE molecule, suggesting that only the N-terminal site contributes to the interaction of apoE with HSPGin vivo. DISCUSSIONThe interaction between apoE and HSPG is important in several processes, such as lipoprotein remnant clearance (5Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J.

ApoE has at least two heparin binding sites located between residues 142 and 147 in the N-terminal receptor binding region (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and less well defined sites in the C-terminal lipid binding region (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N.

Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal site has recently been characterized using apoE4 22-kDa fragments and an enzymatically prepared heparin oligosaccharide; Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 within this site are involved in the interaction with the heparin fragment (27Libeu C.P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Wehrli S. Hernaiz M.J. Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Raffai R.L. Newhouse Y.M. Zhou F. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39138-39144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified Lys-233 as a key lysine residue in the C-terminal site and also estimated the relative contributions of both sites to the heparin binding of full-length apoE. Earlier studies using either synthetic apoE peptides or blocking monoclonal antibodies suggested that residues 211–218 (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and 243–272 (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contain heparin binding sites. The former site is not a factor in the observed binding of the C-terminal 10-kDa fragment to heparin because it is not included in this domain. It is also not functional in the 12-kDa fragment because this does not bind to heparin (Fig. 6). Presumably, the small peptide containing residues 211–218 (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) can bind because its conformation is different from when it is present as part of the apoE molecule. It is possible that Lys-233 is part of the heparin binding site identified by a blocking antibody with an epitope located between residues 243–272 (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the presence of the antibody may interfere with the functionality of Lys-233.Our NMR results imply that among all 12 lysines of full-length apoE3, Lys-143 and -146 in the N-terminal domain and Lys-233 in the C-terminal domain have unusually low pKa values, indicative of high positive electrostatic potential around these residues. Previous studies showed that this greater positive electrostatic potential around Lys-143 and -146 is involved in the high-affinity binding of the N-terminal domain of apoE to the LDL receptor and heparin. In this study, we demonstrated that residue Lys-233 is critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3), indicating that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment in the C-terminal domain is also involved in the heparin interaction. In an amphipathic α-helix spanning this region, the basic residues Arg-226, Lys-233, and Lys-240 are aligned, two turns apart, along one side of the helix. It is interesting that there are several acidic residues in the amino acid sequence near Lys-233, but they are mostly located on the opposite side of the amphipathic α-helix. Consequently, they do not reduce the positive electrostatic potential around the side chain of Lys-233.Comparison of the heparin binding abilities of full-length apoE3 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments yields interesting insights. In the lipid-free state, the 10-kDa fragment binds to heparin with higher affinity than the 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the heparin binding of the 10-kDa fragment was completely abolished when complexed with lipid (Fig. 4B), consistent with previous observations showing that the C-terminal site is only available for interaction in the lipid-free state (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Dong J. Balestra M.E. Newhouse Y.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1783-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of apoE forms a stable tetramer and is responsible for self-association of apoE in aqueous solution, whereas the N-terminal domain is primarily monomeric (16Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the stronger interaction of the C-terminal domain with heparin appears to be because of its tetramerization. As shown in Fig. 6, the heparin binding affinity of the apoE3 (1–260) variant, which is monomeric in solution, is much lower than that of wild-type apoE3 and is comparable with that of the 22-kDa fragment, indicating that tetramerization through the C-terminal domain is crucial for the heparin binding ability of the lipid-free apoE. Multiple sequences of heparin binding peptide enhance heparin binding through cooperativity effects (45Verrecchio A. Germann M.W. Schick B.P. Kung B. Twardowski T. San Antonio J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly, multiple copies of the receptor binding domain are necessary for the high affinity interaction of apoE with the LDL receptor (46Funahashi T. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem.

In this regard, the different binding affinities of full-length apoE3 and the 22-kDa fragment in DMPC discs (Fig. 4B) may be explained by the difference in cooperativity arising from different numbers of the N-terminal domain per particle.Despite the strong heparin binding ability of the 10-kDa fragment, the C-terminal site of full-length apoE3 does not appear to be involved in the heparin binding of lipid-free apoE. As shown in Fig. 5C, there were only small differences in heparin binding among the lipid-free wild-type apoE3, apoE3(K233Q), and apoE3(K233E) variants, suggesting that, even in the lipid-free state, only the N-terminal site is involved in the heparin interaction of full-length apoE. It is not clear why the C-terminal site of the lipid-free apoE is unavailable to interaction with heparin. One possible explanation is that the heparin interaction of the C-terminal domain is sterically hindered by the hinge region (residues 192–215), which acts as a spacer connecting the two domains. Indeed, the 12-kDa fragment, which contains both the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region, bound defectively to heparin (Fig.6).

The N-terminal site has recently been characterized using apoE4 22-kDa fragments and an enzymatically prepared heparin oligosaccharide; Arg-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Arg-147 within this site are involved in the interaction with the heparin fragment (27Libeu C.P.

In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified Lys-233 as a key lysine residue in the C-terminal site and also estimated the relative contributions of both sites to the heparin binding of full-length apoE. Earlier studies using either synthetic apoE peptides or blocking monoclonal antibodies suggested that residues 211–218 (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and 243–272 (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contain heparin binding sites. The former site is not a factor in the observed binding of the C-terminal 10-kDa fragment to heparin because it is not included in this domain. It is also not functional in the 12-kDa fragment because this does not bind to heparin (Fig. 6). Presumably, the small peptide containing residues 211–218 (23Cardin A.D. Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) can bind because its conformation is different from when it is present as part of the apoE molecule. It is possible that Lys-233 is part of the heparin binding site identified by a blocking antibody with an epitope located between residues 243–272 (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the presence of the antibody may interfere with the functionality of Lys-233. Our NMR results imply that among all 12 lysines of full-length apoE3, Lys-143 and -146 in the N-terminal domain and Lys-233 in the C-terminal domain have unusually low pKa values, indicative of high positive electrostatic potential around these residues. Previous studies showed that this greater positive electrostatic potential around Lys-143 and -146 is involved in the high-affinity binding of the N-terminal domain of apoE to the LDL receptor and heparin. In this study, we demonstrated that residue Lys-233 is critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3), indicating that an unusually basic lysine microenvironment in the C-terminal domain is also involved in the heparin interaction. In an amphipathic α-helix spanning this region, the basic residues Arg-226, Lys-233, and Lys-240 are aligned, two turns apart, along one side of the helix. It is interesting that there are several acidic residues in the amino acid sequence near Lys-233, but they are mostly located on the opposite side of the amphipathic α-helix. Consequently, they do not reduce the positive electrostatic potential around the side chain of Lys-233. Comparison of the heparin binding abilities of full-length apoE3 and its 22- and 10-kDa fragments yields interesting insights. In the lipid-free state, the 10-kDa fragment binds to heparin with higher affinity than the 22-kDa fragment (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the heparin binding of the 10-kDa fragment was completely abolished when complexed with lipid (Fig. 4B), consistent with previous observations showing that the C-terminal site is only available for interaction in the lipid-free state (24Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Dong J. Balestra M.E. Newhouse Y.M. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1783-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of apoE forms a stable tetramer and is responsible for self-association of apoE in aqueous solution, whereas the N-terminal domain is primarily monomeric (16Aggerbeck L.P. Wetterau J.R. Weisgraber K.H. Wu C.S. Lindgren F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the stronger interaction of the C-terminal domain with heparin appears to be because of its tetramerization. As shown in Fig. 6, the heparin binding affinity of the apoE3 (1–260) variant, which is monomeric in solution, is much lower than that of wild-type apoE3 and is comparable with that of the 22-kDa fragment, indicating that tetramerization through the C-terminal domain is crucial for the heparin binding ability of the lipid-free apoE. Multiple sequences of heparin binding peptide enhance heparin binding through cooperativity effects (45Verrecchio A. Germann M.W. Schick B.P. Kung B. Twardowski T. San Antonio J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7701-7707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly, multiple copies of the receptor binding domain are necessary for the high affinity interaction of apoE with the LDL receptor (46Funahashi T. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 47Dyer C.A. Smith R.S. Curtiss L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15009-15015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, the different binding affinities of full-length apoE3 and the 22-kDa fragment in DMPC discs (Fig. 4B) may be explained by the difference in cooperativity arising from different numbers of the N-terminal domain per particle. Despite the strong heparin binding ability of the 10-kDa fragment, the C-terminal site of full-length apoE3 does not appear to be involved in the heparin binding of lipid-free apoE. As shown in Fig. 5C, there were only small differences in heparin binding among the lipid-free wild-type apoE3, apoE3(K233Q), and apoE3(K233E) variants, suggesting that, even in the lipid-free state, only the N-terminal site is involved in the heparin interaction of full-length apoE. It is not clear why the C-terminal site of the lipid-free apoE is unavailable to interaction with heparin. One possible explanation is that the heparin interaction of the C-terminal domain is sterically hindered by the hinge region (residues 192–215), which acts as a spacer connecting the two domains. Indeed, the 12-kDa fragment, which contains both the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region, bound defectively to heparin (Fig.6). Thus, interaction between the 10-kDa domain and the hinge region might mask the C-terminal heparin binding site (the basic residues around Lys-233), preventing interaction with heparin. A recent fluorescence resonance energy transfer study of apoE3 indicates spatial proximity between the N- and the C-terminal domains in the lipid-free state, with the hinge region tethering the N-terminal domain close to the C-terminal domain (48Narayanaswami V. Szeto S.S.W. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37853-37860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ApoE-containing high density lipoproteins bind to the proteoglycan, biglycan, in arterial walls, and apoE is thought to act as a bridging molecule that traps these particles in atherosclerotic intima (49O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This binding interaction between apoE and biglycan was shown recently to occur via the C-terminal domain in which the charged residues, especially lysine and arginine between residues 223 and 230, are involved in the binding (50Klezovitch O. Formato M. Cherchi G.M. Weisgraber K.H. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18913-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 51Olin K.L. Potter-Perigo S. Barrett P.H. Wight T.N. Chait A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results of the present study suggest that the unusually basic microenvironment around Lys-233 contributes to the apoE-biglycan interaction. Recent studies demonstrated that C-terminal fragments of apoE are complexed with amyloid in the brain (52Castano E.M. Prelli F. Pras M. Frangione B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17610-17615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 53Aizawa Y. Fukatsu R. Takamaru Y. Tsuzuki K. Chiba H. Kobayashi K. Fujii N. Takahata N. Brain Res. 1997; 768: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and that C-terminal-truncated forms of apoE occur in Alzheimer's disease (54Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Wyss-Coray T. Brecht W.J. Sanan D.A. Mahley R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8838-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The presence of apoE proteolytic fragments in vivo raises the possibility that the C-terminal fragment may contribute to Alzheimer's disease by interaction with HSPG in the brain. In conclusion, we have identified the heparin binding site of the C-terminal domain of apoE. Our data show that the basic residues around lysine 233 are critical for the heparin binding of the C-terminal domain but are unavailable for heparin binding in full-length apoE even in the lipid-free state. Thus, it seems that lipid-poor apoE associates with cell surface HSPG only through the N-terminal domain, leaving the C-terminal domain available for binding to lipoprotein particles."

Insights in the extents of conservation and divergence in these mechanisms were particularly increased by the availability of many complete genome sequences. Unfortunately, the biological significance of such insights is often difficult to test as the majority of organisms with sequenced genomes is poorly amenable to biochemical or genetic approaches. In this respect, the Gram-positive eubacterium Bacillus subtilis, the complete genome sequence of which was published by Kunst et al. (4Kunst F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar), turned out to be a very useful exception. First, because this organism has a natural system for genetic transformation and second, because it has a huge capacity for the secretion of proteins directly into the growth medium (5Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D.H. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 515-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar).The functional genomic approach to dissect the protein secretion process in B. subtilis has yielded a number of remarkable surprises. These include striking differences in the composition of the general secretion (Sec) andtwin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathways for the transport of secretory pre-proteins across the membranes of B. subtilis and Escherichia coli (6Bolhuis A.

Specifically, translocated pre-proteins ofB. subtilis with Sec-type or twin-arginine signal peptides were shown to be subject to processing by the largest number of type I signal peptidases (SPases)1known in any organism. In addition to five chromosomally encoded SPases (SipS, -T, -U, -V, and -W; 11), some B. subtilis strains even contain plasmid-encoded SPases (12Meijer W.J.J. de Jong A. Wisman G.B.A. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SipW was the first known eubacterial SPase of a type that is mainly encountered in Archaea and the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticular membrane (11Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L.

Another highly remarkable finding was that the unique type II SPase (Lsp) of B. subtilis (14Prágai Z. Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Dijl J.M. Venema G. Bron S. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which specifically catalyzes the maturation of lipid-modified pre-proteins, turned out to be required for the secretion of non-lipoproteins, such as α-amylase, chitosanase, and lipase (15Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Prágai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,16Antelmann H.

Hecker, unpublished observations. 2H. Antelmann, H. Tjalsma, J. M. van Dijl, and M. Hecker, unpublished observations.When the negative effect of an SPase II (lsp) mutation on non-lipoprotein secretion was first observed for the α-amylase AmyQ, it was largely attributed to a possible malfunctioning of the lipoprotein PrsA, which is essential for the proper folding of various translocated proteins, such as AmyQ. An unexplained observation was, however, that B. subtilis cells lacking SPase II accumulated significantly increased levels of pre-AmyQ (15Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Prágai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As the latter effect was never observed in prsA mutant strains (17Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Jacobs M. Andersen J.B. Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 957-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it was concluded that the increased pre-AmyQ accumulation in lspmutant strains was because of the malfunction of one or more lipoproteins other than PrsA. This formed the incentive to search for lipoproteins of B. subtilis with an as yet unknown role in protein secretion. For this purpose, the amino acid sequences of all 114 (predicted) lipoproteins of B. subtilis (15Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Prágai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) were used for similarity searches in public databases. Strikingly, the predicted lipoproteins SpoIIIJ and YqjG both showed significant similarity to the Oxa1 protein of yeast mitochondria (Fig. 1). This inner membrane protein has been implicated in the export of the amino and carboxyl termini of the mitochondrially encoded precursor of cytochromec oxidase subunit II from the mitochondrial matrix (21Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that the E. coliorthologue of Oxa1p, denoted YidC, is associated with the Sec translocase (23Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, it was conceivable that SpoIIIJ and YqjG are involved in protein secretion by B. subtilis. On the other hand, Samuelson and co-workers (24Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrated that YidC ofE. coli is of major importance for the biogenesis of several membrane proteins, whereas the export of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins was hardly affected in YidC-depleted cells. Therefore, the present studies were aimed at the identification of possible roles of SpoIIIJ and YqjG in protein secretion and/or membrane protein biogenesis. The results show that, even though the phenotype of SpoIIIJ- and YqjG-depleted cells is quite different from that of SPase II mutant cells, SpoIIIJ and YqjG have an important impact on the accumulation of secretory proteins in the growth medium. Consistent with an important role in secretion, the presence of at least one of these two Oxa1p orthologues is essential for cell growth. Notably, under SpoIIIJ- and YqjG-limiting conditions that strongly affect the stability of secretory proteins, the stability of various membrane proteins is not or only mildly affected. Also, whereas SpoIIIJ is essential for sporulation (25Errington J. Appleby L. Danie R.A. Goodfellow H. Partridge S.R. Yudkin M.D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2609-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), its paralogue YqjG is not required for this developmental process. Taken together, these data imply that SpoIIIJ and YqjG have acquired functions that are at least partly different from those of other members of the Oxa1 family.DISCUSSIONProteins homologous to Oxa1p are conserved in eubacteria and eukaryotic organelles, where they appear to have important functions in protein transport and membrane protein assembly. In fact, SpoIIIJ of B. subtilis was the first protein of this family to which a function was assigned. Errington and co-workers (25Errington J. Appleby L. Danie R.A. Goodfellow H. Partridge S.R. Yudkin M.D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2609-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed in 1992 that a spoIIIJ mutation blocks sporulation of B. subtilis cells at stage III, after the completion of forespore engulfment. It was thought that this protein was involved in a signal transduction pathway, coupling gene expression in the forespore to concomitant events in the mother cell. However, the exact mechanism of SpoIIIJ function in sporulation was not unraveled.Our present observations demonstrate that the synthesis of either SpoIIIJ, or its paralogue YqjG, is required for growth of the Gram-positive eubacterium B. subtilis, which is in good agreement with recent data from Murakami and co-workers (47Murakami T. Haga K. Takeuchi M. Sato T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1998-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the accumulation of the mature AmyQ, PhoA, and LipA proteins in the growth medium is strongly impaired under conditions of SpoIIIJ/YqjG-limitation. Notably, the reduction in AmyQ and PhoA levels in the medium is not paralleled by reduced rates of pre-AmyQ or prepro-PhoA translocation and processing, or the cellular accumulation of the respective precursors, as previously documented forsecDF, tepA, or sip mutant strains with translocation defects (6Bolhuis A.

Instead, pulse-chase labeling experiments combined with cell fractionation indicate that AmyQ and PhoA are degraded upon release of these proteins into the growth medium. Thus, the AmyQ and PhoA secretion defects observed for SpoIIIJ-depleted cells lacking YqjG seem to occur during post-translocational stages that involve the folding of secretory proteins into their active and protease-resistant conformation. The latter is of particular importance because the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane, the cell wall, and the growth medium of B. subtilis are highly proteolytic (5Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D.H. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 515-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 16Antelmann H. Tjalsma H. Voigt B. Ohlmeier S. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Hecker M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1484-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).In a wild-type cell, SpoIIIJ and YqjG might facilitate the folding of translocated proteins in several ways. First, it is conceivable that SpoIIIJ and YqjG have a direct role in the correct folding of mature proteins shortly after their translocation across the membrane, similar to the essential function proposed for the folding catalyst PrsA (15Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Prágai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,17Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Alternatively, SpoIIIJ and YqjG might have an indirect role in protein secretion by modulating the activity of folding catalysts, such as PrsA. A third possibility would be that SpoIIIJ and YqjG depletion impacts on the composition of the cell wall. For example, it has been shown that negatively charged teichoic acids can increase the rate of folding and stability of certain exported proteins (50Hyyrylainen H.L. Vitikainen M. Thwaite J. Wu H. Sarvas M. Harwood C.R. Kontinen V.P. Stephenson K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26696-266703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that the release of mature LipA from the cell wall into the growth medium is affected upon SpoIIIJ/YqjG limitation could point to the direction that the composition of the cell wall is altered under these conditions. However, it is also conceivable that the depletion of SpoIIIJ and YqjG affects the folding of LipA, and that malfolded LipA interacts more strongly with cell wall components than correctly folded LipA (51van Dijl J.M.

C.2001: 337-355Google Scholar).In recent years, the Oxa1p protein of yeast mitochondria was shown to be required for the processing of mitochondrially encoded precursors (52Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the export of amino and carboxyl termini from precursor cytochrome c oxidase subunit II synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix (21Hell K.

Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the insertion of transmembrane domains into the mitochondrial inner membrane in a pairwise fashion (53Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Considering the facts that yeast mitochondria completely lack Sec components, and that the Oxa1p orthologue in chloroplasts (Albino III) is required for the Sec-independent integration of the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein into the thylakoid membrane (54Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), members of the Oxa1p family might represent the key components of a novel pathway for protein export or membrane protein assembly (55Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Nature. 2000; 406: 575-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, YidC of E. coli was shown to facilitate the Sec-independent insertion of certain membrane proteins, such as the M13 procoat, being of minor importance for the export of Sec-dependent preproteins (24Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 56Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, YidC, was also shown to be associated with the Sec machinery, indicating that this protein has a more general role in membrane protein biogenesis inE. coli, for example, by catalyzing the exit of membrane proteins from the Sec translocase (23Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 24Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 57Houben E.N. Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Brunner J. de Gier J.L. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Indications for such a lateral movement were obtained by Urbanus and co-workers (58Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), who showed a sequential interaction of the membrane protein FtsQ with SecY and YidC. Recent studies by Houben et al. (59Houben E.N. Urbanus M.L. Van Der Laan M. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Driessen A.J.M. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35880-35886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that YidC can contact a transmembrane domain during biogenesis, even when it is not yet fully exposed on the outside of the ribosome. Thus, YidC seems to have a role in both the reception and lipid partitioning of transmembrane segments. Our present studies support the view that SpoIIIJ and YqjG of B. subtilis are also involved in membrane protein biogenesis as the stability of the membrane proteins FtsH and CtaC is affected under conditions of SpoIIIJ/YqjG limitation. However, pulse-chase labeling and protease mapping experiments indicate that not all membrane proteins of B. subtilis require SpoIIIJ and YqjG for their biogenesis. For example, the insertion kinetics of SipS and QoxA were not significantly affected upon SpoIIIJ/YqjG limitation. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the membrane topology of QoxA of B. subtilis is similar to that of Lep of E. coli for which it has been shown that the rate of membrane insertion is significantly affected in YidC-depleted cells (24Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Even though the post-translocational protein secretion defect is presently the most prominent phenotype of SpoIIIJ/YqjG-depleted cells of B. subtilis, it is important to bear in mind that this secretion defect may be indirectly caused by the misassembly of an as yet unidentified membrane protein.Our present results, together with the well documented requirement of Oxa1p and YidC for membrane protein biogenesis, suggest that SpoIIIJ and YqjG have rather specific roles in membrane protein biogenesis inB. subtilis. It is therefore concluded that different orthologous members of the Oxa1 protein family have acquired different species-specific functions in Sec-dependent and Sec-independent membrane protein biogenesis and protein secretion. Interestingly, not only orthologous Oxa1-like proteins, but also Oxa1-like paralogues within one organism have acquired (partly) distinct functions, as evidenced by the present observation that SpoIIIJ, but not YqjG, is required for spore development. Similarly, only one of the two Oxa1p orthologues of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is essential for respiration (60Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M. Grodinsky O. Dujardin G. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As only minor differences in the timing of transcription have been observed for the genes specifying the paralogous Oxa1p proteins of B. subtilis(Fig. 3 C) and S. pombe (60Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M. Grodinsky O. Dujardin G. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1135-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the differences in function of these protein pairs are, most likely, based on differences in their primary structures.Finally, what is the mechanism underlying SpoIIIJ involvement in the sporulation process? First, in view of the fact that SpoIIIJ and YqjG are important for post-translocational protein folding steps in the secretion process, it is conceivable that SpoIIIJ is specifically required for the folding of certain, as yet unknown, translocated sporulation factors. The importance of protein transport for sporulation is underscored by the observations that SecA, and the type I SPases SipT and SipV, are required for this process (61Asai K. Kawamura F. Sadaie Y. Takahashi H.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 544-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,62Jiang M. Grau R. Perego M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).3 Second, SpoIIIJ might be involved in the insertion of specific membrane proteins that are essential for the sporulation process after stage III. Possibly, these membrane proteins are involved in the communication between the forespore and the mother cell as originally proposed by Errington and co-workers (25Errington J. Appleby L. Danie R.A. Goodfellow H. Partridge S.R. Yudkin M.D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2609-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our ongoing research is focused on the identification of specific substrates of SpoIIIJ, and determinants for the different specificities of SpoIIIJ and YqjG. This will provide better insights into the molecular mode-of-action of the members of the Oxa1 protein family. In recent years, not only interesting similarities, but also striking differences between protein transport mechanisms in eubacteria, Archaea, eukaryotes, and eukaryotic organelles have been documented (1Pohlschröder M. Prinz W.A. Hartmann E. Beckwith J. Cell. 1997; 91: 563-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 3Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 51-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Insights in the extents of conservation and divergence in these mechanisms were particularly increased by the availability of many complete genome sequences. Unfortunately, the biological significance of such insights is often difficult to test as the majority of organisms with sequenced genomes is poorly amenable to biochemical or genetic approaches. In this respect, the Gram-positive eubacterium Bacillus subtilis, the complete genome sequence of which was published by Kunst et al. (4Kunst F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar), turned out to be a very useful exception. First, because this organism has a natural system for genetic transformation and second, because it has a huge capacity for the secretion of proteins directly into the growth medium (5Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. Jongbloed J.D.H. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 515-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The functional genomic approach to dissect the protein secretion process in B. subtilis has yielded a number of remarkable surprises. These include striking differences in the composition of the general secretion (Sec) andtwin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathways for the transport of secretory pre-proteins across the membranes of B. subtilis and Escherichia coli (6Bolhuis A.

Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Specifically, translocated pre-proteins ofB. subtilis with Sec-type or twin-arginine signal peptides were shown to be subject to processing by the largest number of type I signal peptidases (SPases)1known in any organism. In addition to five chromosomally encoded SPases (SipS, -T, -U, -V, and -W; 11), some B. subtilis strains even contain plasmid-encoded SPases (12Meijer W.J.J. de Jong A. Wisman G.B.A. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SipW was the first known eubacterial SPase of a type that is mainly encountered in Archaea and the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticular membrane (11Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Roosmalen M.L.

Another highly remarkable finding was that the unique type II SPase (Lsp) of B. subtilis (14Prágai Z. Tjalsma H. Bolhuis A. van Dijl J.M. Venema G. Bron S. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which specifically catalyzes the maturation of lipid-modified pre-proteins, turned out to be required for the secretion of non-lipoproteins, such as α-amylase, chitosanase, and lipase (15Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Prágai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,16Antelmann H.

Hecker, unpublished observations. 2H. Antelmann, H. Tjalsma, J. M. van Dijl, and M. Hecker, unpublished observations. When the negative effect of an SPase II (lsp) mutation on non-lipoprotein secretion was first observed for the α-amylase AmyQ, it was largely attributed to a possible malfunctioning of the lipoprotein PrsA, which is essential for the proper folding of various translocated proteins, such as AmyQ. An unexplained observation was, however, that B. subtilis cells lacking SPase II accumulated significantly increased levels of pre-AmyQ (15Tj"

In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as indomethacin, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, sulindac sulfide, and flurbiprofen, in NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes. We found that all of the examined NSAIDs inhibited apoptosis and dedifferentiation. NO production in chondrocytes caused activation of ERK-1/2 and p38 kinase, which oppositely regulate apoptosis and dedifferentiation. NO production also caused inhibition of PKCα and -ζ independent of and dependent on, respectively, p38 kinase, which is required for apoptosis and dedifferentiation. Among the signaling molecules modulated by NO, NSAIDs blocked NO-induced activation of p38 kinase, potentiated ERK activation, and blocked inhibition of PKCα and -ζ. NSAIDs also inhibited some of the apoptotic signaling that is downstream of p38 kinase and PKC, such as NFκB activation, p53 accumulation, and caspase-3 activation. The inhibitory effects of NSAIDs on apoptosis and dedifferentiation were independent of the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, as evidenced by the observation that specific inhibition of COX-2 activity and PGE2 production or exogenous PGE2 did not affect NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation.

Rheumatol. 1998; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism is not yet clear, dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes is believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of arthritis. In addition to dedifferentiation, increased apoptotic death of chondrocytes was observed in arthritic cartilage, and apoptosis is closely related to cartilage destruction (6Blanco F.J. Guitian R. Vazquez-Martul E. de Toro F.J. Galdo F. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 7Hashimoto S. Oche R.L. Komiya S. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1632-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), indicating that chondrocyte apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of arthritis.NO is generally believed to be an important mediator of the dedifferentiation and apoptosis of articular chondrocytes in arthritic cartilage (5Amin A.R. Abramson S.B. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1998; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8Amin A.R. Attur M. Abramson S.B. Curr. Opin.

Rep. 2001; 3: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). NO is produced in chondrocytes by the action of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β. NO production in chondrocytes causes activation of matrix metalloproteinases (10Tamura T. Nakanishi T. Kimura Y. Hattori T. Sasaki K. Norimatsu H. Takahashi K. Takigawa M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3729-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), decreased production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonists (11Jouzeau J.Y. Pacquelet S. Boileau C. Nedelec E.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 3402-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibition of NO production protects against damage of cartilage and chondrocytes in a number of experimental models. For instance, in experimentally induced osteoarthritis in a range of animal species, a significant correlation was observed between the level of NO and the prevalence of apoptotic cells in cartilage tissue (7Hashimoto S. Oche R.L. Komiya S. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1632-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of NO resulted in reduced articular cartilage damage and apoptotic cell death (11Jouzeau J.Y. Pacquelet S. Boileau C. Nedelec E. Presle N. Netter P. Terlain B. Biorheology. 2002; 39: 201-214PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pelletier J.P. Jovanovic D. Fernandes J.C. Manning P.T. Connor J.R. Currie M.G. Di Battista J.A. Martel-Pelletier J.

In our previous studies, we have shown that direct production of NO by treating chondrocytes with an NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), induces apoptosis and dedifferentiation of primary culture articular chondrocytes (16Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol.

NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes were regulated by opposite functions of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase subtypes, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), and p38 kinase (16Kim S.-J. Ju J.-W. Oh C.-D. Yoon Y.-M. Song W.-K. Kim J.-H. Yoo Y.-J. Bang O.-S. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1332-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). NO-induced activation of ERK-1/2 induces dedifferentiation with the inhibitory effects on apoptosis, whereas activation of p38 kinase induces apoptosis and is responsible for the maintenance of differentiated phenotype. In addition to MAP kinase signaling, NO production caused the inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) α and -ζ activities (17Kim S.-J. Kim H.-G. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30375-30381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The inhibition of PKCα activity is caused by inhibition of its expression, which is independent of MAP kinase signaling. In contrast, PKCζ activity is blocked as a result of p38 kinase activation, and inhibition of PKCζ activity is followed by proteolytic cleavage by caspase-3. We also found that p38 kinase induces NO-induced apoptosis by accumulating p53 via NFκB-dependent transcription and stabilization by serine 15 phosphorylation (18Kim S.-J. Hwang S.-G. Shin D.-Y. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33501-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).NSAIDs such as aspirin and indomethacin have been used to relieve pain and inflammation in arthritic cartilage. NSAIDs exert their effects primarily by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), a key enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) (19Dubois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Van De Putte L.B. Lipsky P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). In addition to the alleviation of inflammation, some NSAIDs also modulate homeostasis of chondrocyte and cartilage such as matrix molecule synthesis. For example, several NSAIDs, such as sodium salicylate, inhibit proteoglycan synthesis but others, such as nimesulide, induce cartilage matrix synthesis, whereas others including piroxicam have no effect on matrix synthesis (20Ding C. Inflammation. 2002; 26: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Dingle J.T. Rheumatology. 1999; 58: 125-129Google Scholar). In addition, some NSAIDs, such as nimesulide and ibuprofen, have a protective effect in staurosporine-induced apoptosis of chondrocytes (22Mukherjee P. Rachita C. Aisen P.S. Pasinetti G.M. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2001; 19: S7-11PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that some of the effects of NSAIDs are independent of the inhibition of COX (23Tegeder I. Pfeilschifter J. Geisslinger G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2057-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that NSAIDs modulate COX-independent signaling pathways, such as Ras (24Herrmann C.

Because the role of NSAIDs in the maintenance of homeostasis and apoptosis of articular chondrocytes is not clearly understood, although the action of NSAIDs in inflammation is clear, we investigated the function of various NSAIDs in NO-induced dedifferentiation and apoptosis and characterized the molecular mechanism of NSAIDs action in articular chondrocytes.DISCUSSIONNO production in articular chondrocytes plays a central role in the pathophysiology of arthritis (5Amin A.R.

In this study, we investigated the effects of various NSAIDs on NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes cultured on plastic or in a 3-dimensional natural matrix (i.e. explants culture) and found that all of the examined NSAIDs inhibit apoptosis and dedifferentiation in both conditions independent of the inhibition of COX-2 expression and PGE2production. As summarized in Fig. 9, we also demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of NSAIDs on apoptosis are caused by their ability to potentiate NO-induced ERK activation, to inhibit activation of p38 kinase, and to block inhibition of PKCα and -ζ. In contrast, the inhibition of NO-induced dedifferentiation by NSAIDs is caused by the blockade of PKCα and -ζ signaling but not the modulation of ERK-1/2 and p38 kinase signaling.The cellular effects of NSAIDs are exerted primarily by the inhibition of COX and PGE2 production. PGE2 is known to regulate differentiation (34Goldring M.B. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Lai W.F. Am. J. Ther. 1996; 3: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Schwartz Z. Gilley R.M. Sylvia V.L.

Because NO production in chondrocytes causes COX-2 expression and PGE2production, it is possible that NSAIDs modulate NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation by inhibiting COX-2. However, our current results clearly indicate that the inhibitory effects of NSAIDs on NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation are independent of the inhibition of COX-2 and PGE2 production. This conclusion is clearly demonstrated by the specific inhibition of COX-2 activity and by the observation that PGE2 production or exogenous PGE2 did not affect NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation. In addition, the concentration of indomethacin that is required for the inhibition of NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation is higher than that needed for the inhibition of PGE2 synthesis. This is consistent with observations that the COX-independent actions of NSAIDs such as inhibition of cell cycle progression (39Shiff S.J. Qiao L. Tsai L.L. Rigas B. J. Clin.

The modulation of MAP kinase subtypes by indomethacin (i.e.inhibition of p38 kinase and potentiation of ERK) seems to be involved in the inhibition of NO-induced apoptosis based on the observation that NO-induced activation of p38 kinase induces apoptosis, whereas ERK activation inhibits apoptosis. The inhibition of p38 kinase and apoptosis by indomethacin is consistent with the inhibition of apoptotic signaling molecules located downstream of p38 kinase, such as PKCζ, NFκB, p53, and caspase-3 (Fig. 9). In contrast to the inhibition of apoptosis, the inhibitory effects of indomethacin on NO-induced dedifferentiation are attributable to its ability to block NO-induced inhibition of PKCα and -ζ, but not its ability to modulate MAP kinase subtypes. This conclusion is based on the observations that NO-induced inhibition of PKCα and -ζ is required for the induction of dedifferentiation as well as apoptosis and that the potentiation and inhibition of ERK and p38 kinase, respectively, are the signaling events leading to the potentiation of dedifferentiation (Fig. 9). Modulation of ERK and p38 kinase by indomethacin is independent of its ability to block COX activity, consistent with previously reported results. Indeed, many studies have indicated that COX-independent effects of NSAIDs are exerted by the modulation of ERK and p38 kinase. For example, NSAIDs such as aspirin and sodium salicylate exert their effects by the inhibition ERK-1/2 (26Huang C. Ma W.Y. Hanenberger D. Cleary M.P. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26325-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 45Jones M.K. Wang H. Peskar B.M. Levin E. Itani R.M. Sarfeh I.J. Tarnawski A.S. Nat.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 24: 14540-14545Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar), whereas p38 kinase is activated by sodium salicylate in human fibroblasts and is associated with induction of apoptosis (27Schwenger P. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our current results clearly indicate that indomethacin blocked the NO-induced inhibition of PKCα and -ζ activity that is required for the induction of apoptosis and dedifferentiation of SNP-treated chondrocytes (17Kim S.-J. Kim H.-G. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30375-30381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because the activity of PKCζ is blocked as a result of p38 kinase activation (17Kim S.-J. Kim H.-G. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30375-30381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), it is likely that the effects of indomethacin on PKCζ are caused by the inhibition of p38 kinase signaling. However, the possibility that indomethacin directly regulates PKCζ activity cannot be ruled out, although no evidence supports the direct action of NSAIDs in the regulation of PKC isoforms. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the blockade of the NO-induced inhibition of PKCζ by indomethacin inhibits both apoptosis and dedifferentiation of SNP-treated chondrocytes. In contrast to PKCζ, the inhibition of PKCα expression and activity is caused by the inhibition of its expression independent of ERK and p38 kinase signaling (17Kim S.-J. Kim H.-G. Oh C.-D. Hwang S.-G. Song W.-K. Yoo Y.-J. Kang S.-S. Chun J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30375-30381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that inhibition of PKCα activity is a prerequisite for the induction of apoptosis and dedifferentiation, the MAP kinase-independent inhibition of PKCα activity by indomethacin is also essential for the inhibitory effects of indomethacin on apoptosis and dedifferentiation. The mechanisms of indomethacin regulation of PKCα expression and activity remain to be determined, although it is possible that indomethacin regulates PKCα either directly or indirectly by modulating upstream signaling events. Nevertheless, because our present results indicated that indomethacin-induced inhibition of p38 kinase and potentiation of ERK is not directly involved in the inhibition of dedifferentiation as discussed above, we conclude that the blockade of the inhibition of PKCα and -ζ activities by indomethacin plays a critical role in the inhibition of NO-induced dedifferentiation.Consistent with the inhibition of apoptotic signaling mediators such as p38 kinase and PKC, indomethacin also blocked their downstream signaling molecules such as the activation of NFκB, accumulation of p53, and activation of caspase-3. Indeed, it has been shown that some types of NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, sulindac, sulindac sulfide, and flurbiprofen, are able to inhibit NFκB activation, whereas indomethacin, ketoprofen, and ketorolac are ineffective (23Tegeder I. Pfeilschifter J. Geisslinger G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2057-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Using a reporter gene assay and IκB degradation, we found that ectopic expression of wild type PKCα or -ζ by adenovirus infection in chondrocytes blocked the NO-induced activation of NFκB (48Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 206-211Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), indicating that p38 kinase-dependent and -independent PKCζ and -α regulates NFκB activation. We also found that NFκB activation is required for COX-2 expression (48Kim S.-J. Chun J.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 206-211Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This suggests that inhibition of PKCα and -ζ is an upstream signaling event leading to NFκB activation that causes COX-2 expression as summarized in Fig. 9. Given the inability of indomethacin to inhibit NFκB (23Tegeder I. Pfeilschifter J. Geisslinger G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2057-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that the inhibitory effects of indomethacin on NFκB activation observed in this study are caused by the inhibition of its upstream signaling molecules (i.e. p38 kinase and PKC) rather than by a direct action on NFκB.In summary, we found that various NSAIDs block apoptosis and dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes caused by NO production in a manner independent of their ability to inhibit COX-2 and PGE2 production. The inhibitory effects of NSAIDs on apoptosis are derived from their ability to block NO-induced activation of p38 kinase, to potentiate ERK activation, and to block inhibition of PKCα and -ζ, whereas the inhibition of NO-induced dedifferentiation by NSAIDs is caused by the blockade of PKCα and -ζ signaling but not the modulation of ERK-1/2 and p38 kinase signaling. Additionally, the effects of NO production and NSAIDs treatment on chondrocytes derived from adult rabbit joint cartilage (from 4-month-old rabbits) or human osteoarthritic cartilage obtained from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty are essentially same as in growth plate chondrocytes (from 2-week-old rabbits) (data not shown). Because NO production via inducible NO synthase in articular chondrocytes plays a central role in the pathophysiology of arthritis by causing inflammation, apoptosis, dedifferentiation, and the activation of matrix metalloproteinases, our results suggest that NSAIDs have protective effects on cartilage damage, not only by alleviating inflammation but also by inhibiting NO-induced apoptosis and dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes. Chondrocytes are a unique cell type in which the differentiated phenotype is reversible. The phenotype of chondrocytes is regulated by the balance between anabolic and catabolic reactions of molecules, which are involved in the maintenance of cartilage homeostasis (1Sandell L.J. Aigner I. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Differentiated chondrocytes both in vivo and in vitro dedifferentiate into fibroblastic cells upon exposure to interleukin-1β (2Frazer A. Bunning R.A. Thavarajah M. Seid J.M. Russell R.G.

Rheumatol. 1998; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism is not yet clear, dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes is believed to play a role in the pathophysiology of arthritis. In addition to dedifferentiation, increased apoptotic death of chondrocytes was observed in arthritic cartilage, and apoptosis is closely related to cartilage destruction (6Blanco F.J. Guitian R. Vazquez-Martul E. de Toro F.J. Galdo F. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 7Hashimoto S. Oche R.L. Komiya S. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1632-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), indicating that chondrocyte apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. NO is generally believed to be an important mediator of the dedifferentiation and apoptosis of articular chondrocytes in arthritic cartilage (5Amin A.R. Abramson S.B. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1998; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 8Amin A.R. Attur M. Abramson S.B. Curr. Opin.

Thus, the PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins participate in diverse mechanisms underlying neuronal activity and function. Tamalin (also termed GRP1-associated scaffold protein) is a scaffold protein that comprises multiple protein-interacting domains (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y.

It possesses a PDZ domain, a leucine-zipper region, a proline-rich region, and a carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding motif (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S.

The PDZ domain of tamalin interacts with the carboxyl termini of group 1 and group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and GABAB2 receptor (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the leucine-zipper region binds to the coiled coil region of guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesins (24Kitano J. Kimura K.

Tamalin promotes intracellular trafficking and cell surface expression of group 1 mGluRs in COS-7 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons through the interaction with cytohesins (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because tamalin has multiple, distinct protein-interacting domains and is enriched in the PSD fraction, we sought in this investigation to examine a protein complex formation of tamalin with other neuronal proteins, using several different approaches. Here we report that tamalin exists as a key element that forms a protein complex with several postsynaptic and protein-trafficking scaffold proteins through its distinct protein-binding domains. The amino acid sequence of rat tamalin (GenBankTMAF374272) was used as probe in a BLAST data base search for the expressed sequence tag (EST) and nr data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) with the TBLASTN algorithm. TheXenopus ESTs (GenBankTMBU906716, BU901589,BJ033586, BF613520, BJ029054, AI880945, BJ038540, BG487268, BJ048855,BJ043787, BJ053111, and BQ398412), the zebrafish EST (GenBankTMAW422012), and the zebrafish genomic DNA sequence (GenBankTMAL807377.9) were assembled to create electronic cDNA sequences from which the amino acid sequences ofXenopus and zebrafish tamalin were predicted. Human IMAGE clone cDNAs 4422992 and 6151168 (GenBankTMBC035500 andBU165906), Drosophila melanogaster RH12258 full-insert cDNA (GenBankTMAY089654.1), and C. eleganscDNA encoding the PDZ domain-containing protein (27.8 kDa) (GenBankTM NM 059763.1) were also identified as the cDNAs encoding proteins homologous to rat tamalin. Protein sequences were analyzed by the pfscan program on the ISREC profile scan server (hits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/PFSCAN). Sequence alignment was performed with the Clustal W software (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) and DNASIS software (Hitachi). The phylogenetic tree was generated with Clustal W software using the Neighbor-Joining method and displayed with NJPLOT (27Perriere G. Gouy M. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal portion of SAPAP3 (amino acid residues 853–977, GenBankTMU67139), the first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 (PSD-95 PDZ1 + 2) (residues 48–274, GenBankTMM96853), the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 (PSD-95 PDZ3) (residues 266–411, GenBankTMM96853), the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of PSD-95 (PSD-95 SH3) (residues 394–533, GenBankTMM96853), the guanylate kinase (GK) domain of PSD-95 (PSD-95 GK) (residues 504–724, GenBankTMM96853), the fifth PDZ domain of S-SCAM (S-SCAM PDZ5) (residues 1104–1277, GenBankTM AF04863), the PDZ domain of CASK (CASK PDZ) (residues 469–598, GenBankTMU47110), two PDZ domains of Mint1 (Mint1 PDZ1 + 2) (residues 640–839, GenBankTMAF029105), and the Munc18-interacting domain (MID) (residues 1–356, GenBankTMAF029107), the phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) (residues 349–601), and two PDZ domains (residues 550–750) of Mint2 were cloned by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from rat brain RNA. The PDZ domain of Veli2 (residues 57–207, GenBankTMAF173082) was amplified by PCR, using mouse brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) as a template. Isolated domains were subcloned in frame into pACT2 (Clontech), pGEX-4T-1/2 (Amersham Biosciences), or pET32a (Novagen). The deletional mutants of tamalin and SAPAP3 lacking the last 3 amino acid residues were constructed by PCR techniques. To prepare the full-length cDNAs for rat Mint2 and SAPAP3, we first cloned several partial cDNAs by RT-PCR with rat brain total RNA as a template and constructed the full-length cDNAs by connecting the partial cDNAs (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Barry B.A. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar). The isolated rat Mint2 cDNA was inserted in frame into pCMV-Tag3B (Stratagene). Proper in frame insertions and the absence of any sequence errors of all PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

For pull-down assay, 10 μg of GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (25 μl) and incubated with either supernatants (100 μg) containing recombinant tamalin transiently expressed in COS-7 cells or the purified recombinant thioredoxin fusion proteins (10 μg). Yeast two-hybrid screening and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-tamalin antisera were raised in rabbits against GST·N-tam (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) emulsified with TiterMax Gold Adjuvand (Funakoshi) and used for immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation from brain lysates, the affinity-purified anti-tamalin peptide antibody was used as described previously (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-S-SCAM and anti-Veli1/2/3 antibodies were gifts from Dr. Yutaka Hata (9Hirao K. Hata Y. Ide N.

Other primary antibodies were obtained from the following sources: mouse monoclonal anti-Mint1, anti-Mint2, anti-CASK, and anti-PSD-95 antibodies from BD Transduction Laboratories; mouse monoclonal anti-SAPAP1 antibody from StressGen; mouse monoclonal anti-hexahistidine tag and anti-myc tag antibodies from Clontech. The secondary antibodies were described previously (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse Brain Aging Blot (20 μg of total RNA/lane, Seegene) was probed with 32P-labeled cDNA fragments under high stringency conditions. The cDNA fragment used corresponded to amino acid residues 10–200 of mouse tamalin. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) probe was purchased from Clontech and used as a control. Since we had previously reported the sequences of rat and mouse tamalin (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the DNA data base of C. elegans,Drosophila, and human became available. We first addressed, by BLAST data base search of the above species as well asXenopus and zebrafish with the rat tamalin sequence as a probe, whether the characteristic structure of tamalin has been conserved during evolution. This analysis showed the existence of homologs of tamalin in all species analyzed (Fig.1). The deduced amino acid sequences of tamalin of rat, mouse, human, Xenopus, zebrafish,Drosophila, and C. elegans are composed of 394, 392, 395, 353, 379, 706, and 245 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig. 1A). They all possess a PDZ domain, a leucine-zipper region, and a carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding motif in common (Fig.1A). Although the amino-terminal position of the PDZ domain is deleted in the Drosophila tamalin homolog and the carboxyl-terminal portion between a leucine-zipper region and a carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding motif diverges between vertebrates and invertebrates, the amino acid sequences of tamalin are highly conserved over the PDZ domain, the leucine-zipper region, and the PDZ binding motif (Fig. 1, B–D). The result indicated that the multiple protein-interacting domains of tamalin are conserved during evolution and may serve as scaffold for other proteins in cell function. To identify tamalin-interacting proteins, we extended yeast two-hybrid screening of a rat brain cDNA library, using rat tamalin as bait. In addition to cytohesin-2 reported previously (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 65 positive clones were isolated, in which 19 different cDNA species were included; 7 of them possessed a typical PDZ binding motif at their carboxyl termini (TableI). Four independent cDNA clones isolated encoded SAPAP3, which represents a postsynaptic scaffold protein containing the conserved carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding motif (11Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The interaction between tamalin and SAPAP3 was analyzed in more detail with yeast two-hybrid assay by constructing a prey plasmid containing the intact carboxyl-terminal portion of SAPAP3 (SAPAP3-ct) or the truncated mutant of SAPAP3-ct lacking the last 3 amino acids (SAPAP3-ct del3). This analysis showed that tamalin bound to SAPAP3-ct, but not to SAPAP3-ct del3 (Fig.2A). The recognition of the PDZ binding motif of SAPAP3 occurred through the PDZ domain of tamalin, because in the yeast two-hybrid assay SAPAP3-ct bound to the amino-terminal portion containing the PDZ domain of tamalin (N-tam), but not to the carboxyl-terminal portion lacking the PDZ domain (C-tam) (Fig. 2B). The interaction of tamalin with SAPAP3 was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay using COS-7 cells cotransfected with the full-length tamalin and myc-tagged full-length SAPAP3. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-tamalin antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibody. Myc-SAPAP3 coimmunoprecipitated from cotransfected cells with anti-tamalin antibody (Fig. 2C, lane 6) but not with nonimmunized serum (Fig. 2C, lane 8). In control, immunoprecipitation of myc-SAPAP3 was not seen in cells transfected with either myc-SAPAP3 or tamalin alone (Fig. 2C,lanes 5 and 7). The result indicated that tamalin and SAPAP3 form a protein complex in mammalian cells.Table IClones isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening with tamalin as baitClones isolated by yeast two-hybrid screeningGenBank™accession no.Number of independent clonesPDZ binding motifSAPAP3U671394QTRLCytohesin-2U838964Homology to human CG003U505344GTSLKARP-1-binding protein 2AB0226583Homology to human 80 K-HJ030752Homology to human Zhx1AF1068622Homology to human BCRY006612STEVHomology to mouse FMR2NM 0080322Homology to human KIAA0769AB0183122ITLVHomology to human KIAA0354AB0023522STLLHomology to human NY-REN-58AF1551152Proteins encoded by isolated clones, their GenBank™ accession numbers, and the number of independently isolated clones encoding the same protein are shown.

Other clones isolated as a single clone and those with no homology to any GenBank™ sequences are omitted from the table. We next addressed whether tamalin forms a protein complex with scaffold proteins involved in postsynaptic protein assembly or subcellular protein transport in the brain. Solubilized rat brain membrane fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-tamalin antibody and immunoblotted with antibodies against candidate scaffold proteins (Fig. 3, A andB). S-SCAM, PSD-95, SAPAP1 were coimmunoprecipitated from rat brain membrane fractions with anti-tamalin antibody (Fig.3A). In addition, Mint2 and CASK were immunoprecipitated, but neither Mint1 nor Veli1/2/3 was precipitated with anti-tamalin antibody (Fig. 3B). Because the last 13 amino acids covering the carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding motif are identical between SAPAP1 and SAPAP3 (11Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), it is likely that SAPAP1, like SAPAP3 (Fig. 2), directly binds to the tamalin PDZ domain. That there was no coimmunoprecipitation of either Veli1/2/3 or Mint1 was rather unexpected, because CASK is known to form a ternary complex with Veli1/2/3 and Mint1. CASK/Mint1/Velis may not always exist as a tripartite complex form. We next addressed whether tamalin directly or indirectly interacts with S-SCAM, Mint2, PSD-95, and CASK in transfected heterologous cells. The myc-tagged full-length cDNA encoding either S-SCAM, Mint2, or PSD-95 was transiently co-transfected with the tamalin cDNA in COS-7 cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-tamalin antibody and immunoblotted with the respective antibody. Anti-tamalin antibody immunoprecipitated all these scaffold proteins, whereas no such immunoprecipitate was detected in cells untransfected with the tamalin cDNA (Fig.4, A–C). The result indicated that tamalin interacts with S-SCAM, Mint2, and PSD-95 in mammalian cells. CASK was found to be endogenously highly expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4D). Only tamalin was exogenously transfected into COS-7 cells, and anti-tamalin immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-CASK antibody. No immunoblotting band of CASK was detected in anti-tamalin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4D), suggesting that no direct interaction occurs between tamalin and CASK. We performed in vitro pull-down assay to identify tamalin-binding domains of S-SCAM, PSD-95, and Mint2. GST was fused to the PDZ domains of the scaffold proteins analyzed in this investigation. The resultant GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified. The GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with the recombinant tamalin expressed in COS-7 cells. Bound proteins were eluted and immunoblotted with anti-tamalin antibody. This analysis showed GST·S-SCAM PDZ5 bound to tamalin (Fig.5A). Interestingly, the PDZ domains of PSD-95 had no ability to interact with tamalin in in vitro pull-down assay (Fig. 5A). In addition, consistent with the above findings of brain and COS-7 cell extracts, none of the GST proteins fused to Veli2 PDZ, Mint1 PDZ1 + 2, or CASK PDZ showed the ability to bind to tamalin (Fig. 5A). To confirm that tamalin binds to S-SCAM PDZ5 through its PDZ binding motif, we divided tamalin into N-tam and C-tam and deleted the last 3 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of C-tam (C-tam del3). S-SCAM PDZ5 was fused to hexahistidine-tagged thioredoxin at the amino terminus (His·S-SCAM PDZ5). Truncated or deleted tamalin fused to GST was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with His·S-SCAM PDZ5. This pull-down assay revealed that His·S-SCAM PDZ5 bound to GST·C-tam, but not to GST·N-tam or GST·C-tam del3 (Fig.5B). The result indicated that S-SCAM PDZ5 directly binds to the PDZ binding motif of tamalin. Interestingly, GST·N-tam bound to tamalin (Fig. 5A). Further pull-down assay showed that His-tagged N-tam was retained on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads attached with GST·C-tam, but not on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads attached with either GST·N-tam or GST-C·tam del3 (Fig. 5C), indicating that tamalin forms a homomeric complex through its PDZ domain and PDZ binding motif. To identify the tamalin-binding domain of PSD-95, we divided the carboxyl-terminal portion following the PDZ domains of PSD-95 into the SH3 domain and the GK domain. These two domains were fused to GST and their ability to bind to tamalin was determined by GST pull-down assay (Fig. 5C). This analysis showed that tamalin bound to GST·GK but not to other protein domains of PSD-95 (Fig.5C), indicating that the GK domain of PSD-95 is responsible for the specific interaction with tamalin. We also examined the tamalin-binding domain of Mint2 by GST pull-down assay. Mint2 was dissected into the amino-terminal MID, the middle PTB, and the carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain, each of which was fused to GST. GST pull-down assay showed that tamalin bound to GST·MID and GST·PTB, but not to GST·PDZ1 + 2 (Fig. 5D). The result indicated that Mint2 interacts with tamalin through its MID and PTB domains rather than the PDZ domain. Collectively, these results demonstrated that tamalin distinctly interacts with many scaffold proteins through its multiple protein-binding domains. Tamalin mRNA is expressed mainly in the telencephalic region of the mouse adult brain (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined developmental changes of tamalin mRNA expression in the mouse brain by Northern blotting analysis. Expression levels of tamalin mRNA were low before and at birth, continuously increased during the postnatal period, and reached the highest level after postnatal 2 weeks (Fig. 6,upper panel). In control, G3PDH mRNA levels remained unchanged during the time course analyzed (Fig. 6, lower panel). The result suggested that tamalin may play some roles in developing and mature brain. Tamalin is a scaffold protein possessing evolutionarily conserved protein-protein-interacting domains including a PDZ domain, a leucine-zipper region, and a carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding motif. The multiple protein domains of tamalin are now revealed to interact with many neuronal proteins in different modes (Fig.7). The PDZ domain of tamalin binds to the PDZ binding motifs of not only mGluR1/mGluR5 and GABAB2receptor (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also SAPAP3. Anti-SAPAP3 antibody was presently not available, and an interaction between tamalin and SAPAP3 in the brain remained elusive, but the identical carboxyl-terminal sequences between SAPAP1 and SAPAP3 (11Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11943-11951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) most likely drive a protein assembly between tamalin and both SAPAP1 and SAPAP3 in vivo. The carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding motif of tamalin directs a specific binding with the PDZ domains of S-SCAM and tamalin. To our knowledge, the latter is the first example indicating that the PDZ domain has the ability to associate with its own PDZ binding motif. Mint2 and PSD-95 also bind to tamalin by mechanisms different from a PDZ-mediated interaction. In addition, CASK forms a complex with tamalin indirectly via unknown scaffold proteins. Thus, tamalin has the ability to associate with many key proteins involved in neuronal function. The PSD is a highly organized signal-processing machinery composed of supramolecular protein complexes. Many proteins identified as a composite of the PSD have PDZ domains and are involved in organizing the complex protein lattice at the PSD (2Scannevin R.H. Huganir R.L. Nat. Rev.

Tamalin is enriched in the PSD fraction and promotes cell surface expression of mGluR1 in heterologously expressed COS-7 cells (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, mGluR1 is present in the NMDA receptor-associated macromolecular assembly (32Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G.N.

Tamalin interacts with typical postsynaptic scaffold proteins, PSD-95, S-SCAM, and SAPAP1/3, and the tamalin-mediated different assembly of postsynaptic scaffold proteins may have an distinct and important role in organizing a postsynaptic signal-processing machinery specific for group 1 mGluRs. Tamalin interacts with cytohesins, and its transfection with the tamalin-containing adenovirus promotes a neurite distribution of endogenous mGluR5 in cultured hippocampal cells (24Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytohesins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors specific for the ADP-ribosylation factor family of small GTP binding proteins and control intracellular protein transport (34Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends. Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 35Jackson T.R. Kearns B.G. Theibert A.B. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Tamalin also associates with Mint2 and CASK. Mint2 binds to munc-18 (20Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), a protein required for exocytosis and essential for protein transport from Golgi apparatus to cell surface in epithelial cells (36Rowe J. Calegari F. Taverna E. Longhi R. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3323-3332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CASK is also involved in synaptic targeting of N-type calcium channels in cultured hippocampal neurons (37Maximov A. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6939-6952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the orthologs of the Mint family protein (LIN-10) and CASK (LIN-2) in C. elegans are required for the normal basolateral localization of LET-23 (1Bredt D.S.

Moreover, LIN-10 is essential for postsynaptic localization of the glutamate receptor GLR-1 in nematode neurons (1Bredt D.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev.

It is thus possible that the transport of group 1 mGluRs could be regulated by tamalin-associated trafficking complexes, including not only cytohesins but also Mint2 and CASK. Several postsynaptic proteins show significant changes in expression levels during development. The expression of tamalin mRNA is regulated developmentally and is well correlated with developmental changes of tamalin-interacting proteins such as SAPAP1 (39Kawashima N. Takamiya K. Sun J. Kitabatake A. Sobue K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and PSD-95 (40Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

Res. 1999; 33: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Importantly, immunoreactive signals for mGluR1 show developmental changes in that they are mainly localized at soma and proximal dendrites at the first postnatal week and thereafter become concentrated at distal dendrites, preferentially at synapses (42Liu X.-B. Munoz A. Jones E.G. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 395: 450-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The developmental change of tamalin expression, in concert with other scaffold proteins, may contribute to developmentally regulated distribution of mGluR1 and other signaling proteins in neurons. In summary, our study shows that tamalin interacts with many important scaffold proteins involved in postsynaptic organization and protein trafficking in neurons. This indicates that tamalin may participate in receptor clustering, trafficking, and intracellular signaling. Further study will help to understand regulatory mechanisms of receptor-mediated neuronal function.

This is accomplished by phosphorylation and inactivation of several key anabolic elements, including TFIIIB, TFIID, RNA polymerase II, poly(A) polymerase, and translation elongation factor 1γ. We report here that ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a protein kinase linked to the translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs, is also subject to regulation by Cdc2 in mitosis. In mitotic HeLa cells, when the activity of Cdc2 is high, S6K1 is phosphorylated at multiple Ser/Thr, Pro (S/TP) sites, including Ser371, Ser411, Thr421, and Ser424. Concomitant with this, the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif site, Thr389, is reduced resulting in a decrease in the specific activity of S6K1. The mitotic S/TP phosphorylation sites are readily phosphorylated by Cdc2·cyclin B in vitro. These proline-directed phosphorylations are sensitive to chemical inhibitors of Cdc2 but not to inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, MEK1/2, or p38. In murine FT210 cells arrested in mitosis, conditional inactivation of Cdc2 reduces phosphorylation of S6K1 at S/TP sites while simultaneously increasing phosphorylation of Thr389 and of the S6K1 substrate, RPS6. A physical interaction exists between Cdc2 and S6K1, and this interaction is enhanced in mitotic cells. These results suggest that Cdc2 provides a signal that triggers inactivation of S6K1 in mitosis, presumably serving to spare energy for costly mitotic processes at the expense of ribosomal protein synthesis.

During this period, anabolic processes in the cell are actively repressed (1Prescott D.M. Bender M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1962; 26: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Steward D.L.

Transcription, mRNA processing, and translation are among the metabolic activities to undergo mitotic silencing. The collective inactivation of these processes is due in large part to phosphorylation of key pathway components by the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2/Cdk1. A number of mitotic Cdc2 targets involved in the silencing of gene expression have been identified, including RNA polymerase II, TFIID, TFIIIB (reviewed in Ref. 4Gottesfeld J.M. Forbes D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 197-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), poly(A) polymerase (5Colgan D.F. Murthy K.g. K. Zhao W. Prives C. Manley J.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Among the most energetically expensive processes in cycling cells is ribosome biogenesis, which, as a result of transcription, processing, translation, and assembly of ribosomal proteins, has been calculated to demand as much as 80% of the energy expenditure of a proliferating cell (reviewed in Ref. 7Thomas G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E71-E72Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cdc2 may act at multiple levels during mitosis to repress ribosome biogenesis. Inhibition of rDNA transcription is achieved by disruption of the RNA polymerase I complex through Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of TATA-binding protein (8Sirri V. Roussel P. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the TATA-binding protein-associated factor TAFI110 (8Sirri V. Roussel P. Hernandez-Verdun D. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Additionally, Cdc2 may also suppress the translation of ribosomal protein-encoding mRNAs through regulation of S6K11(9Papst P.J. Sugiyama H. Nagasawa M. Lucas J.J. Maller J.L. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15077-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Much of what is known of the function and regulation of S6K1 derives from studies conducted during the transition from the quiescent state (G0) to G1. As cells re-enter the cell cycle from G0, S6K1 is coordinately phosphorylated on multiple residues, leading to a robust stimulation of kinase activity. In quiescent cells, it is postulated that S6K1 is rendered inactive by virtue of an interaction between the putative autoinhibitory C-terminal tail and the catalytic pocket. This serves both to hinder the interaction of S6K1 with its substrates as well as to conceal internally situated sites of phosphorylation essential for maximal enzyme activity (reviewed in Ref. 10Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In response to serum, up to six S/TP sites (i.e. Ser411, Ser418, Thr421, Ser424, Ser429, and Thr447) are phosphorylated (11Ferrari S. Bannwarth W. Morley S.J. Totty N.F. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7282-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Han J.W. Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Thomas G. J. Biol.

However, phosphorylation of S/TP sites within the S6K1 autoinhibitory domain is not sufficient for stimulation of the catalytic activity as deletion variants lacking the autoinhibitory domain (and the six S/TP sites residing therein) are activated in response to mitogens to an extent similar to the full-length protein (13Weng Q.-P.

Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, within the kinase extension, phosphorylation of Thr389 increases the affinity of the requisite S6K1 kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (15Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). PDK1 then phosphorylates Thr229 within the T-loop of the catalytic domain (16Pullen N.

A requirement for phosphorylation of Ser371, an additional S/TP site removed from the S/TP cluster within the autoinhibitory domain, for kinase activity has been demonstrated (18Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Williamson N.A. Wettenhall R.E.H. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5648-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although its order in the hierarchy of serum-stimulated phosphorylations is unclear. Several candidate Thr389 kinases have been suggested, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (19Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), PDK1 (20Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1155-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although the provenance of the Thr389 kinase has yet to be unequivocally demonstrated.The nature of the proline-directed kinase (or kinases) that catalyzes the serum-stimulated, multisite phosphorylation of S/TP sites is also unclear. In vitro, a number of proline-directed kinases have been shown to phosphorylate S6K1, including ERK1/2, JNK, and Cdc2 (22Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ser411 lies within a strong consensus for Cdc2 phosphorylation (K/RpSPR/PR/K/H (23Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar)) and is phosphorylated during mitosis when the activity of Cdc2 is augmented (9Papst P.J. Sugiyama H. Nagasawa M. Lucas J.J. Maller J.L. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15077-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by anion-exchange chromatography, significant H1 kinase activity coeluted with a proline-directed kinase activity toward a peptide substrate (p70 S6 kinase autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate) encompassing the S6K1 C terminus (22Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The H1 kinase activity was Suc1-precipitable (22Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the premise that the cofractionating S6K1 kinase was Cdc2.The catalytic activity of Cdc2 is reliant on the formation of a Cdc2·cyclin B complex, also known as maturation promoting factor. The abundance of the Cdc2 protein is constant throughout the cell cycle (24Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3093-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas cyclin B accumulates progressively throughout interphase until late in mitosis, at which point it is rapidly destroyed by the anaphase promoting complex (reviewed in Refs. 25King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar and 26Townsley F.M. Ruderman J.V. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 238-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The destruction of cyclin B, therefore, serves as a mechanism of Cdc2 inactivation. Additionally, the Cdc2·cyclin B heterodimer is stabilized by phosphorylation of Cdc2 at Thr161 and is maintained inactive by dual phosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 (reviewed in Ref. 27Nigg E.A. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). At the end of G2, Cdc2 is dephosphorylated at Thr14 and Tyr15 by the Cdc25 phosphatase, inducing the rapid activation of Cdc2 and triggering entry into mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 28Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar).Numerous mitotic Cdc2 substrates have been identified, all of which are phosphorylated at S/TP sites. The abundance of mitotic Cdc2 substrates is illustrated by the appearance of numerous phospho-epitopes recognized by the MPM-2 antibody upon entry into mitosis (29Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), although some of these epitopes may result from phosphorylation by kinases other than Cdc2. The substrate specificity of Cdc2 shows an absolute requirement for proline in the +1 position, a secondary requirement for Arg or Lys at +3, and a preference for basic residues at +2 or +3 positions (23Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Although peptide library screens of potential Cdc2·cyclin B substrates predict that HHHKpSPRRR represents the optimal sequence of Cdc2 phosphorylation (23Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), circumstances in which the consensus has been relaxed are not uncommon (30Nigg E.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 261-270PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, many Cdc2 substrates possess multiple S/TP sites, not all of which conform to the consensus sequence of phosphorylation, e.g. lamins (31Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbee J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 591-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), Src (32Morgan D.O. Kaplan J.M. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the case of S6K1, eight S/TP sites exist, one of which, Ser411, lies within a strong consensus for Cdc2 phosphorylation (RpSPRR), whereas the contexts of the remaining seven diverge somewhat (Fig. 1). Given the abundance of S/TP sites within S6K1 and that Cdc2 phosphorylates the consensus site, Ser411, in vitro, we postulated that other non-consensus S/TP sites were likely to be regulated by Cdc2 during mitosis. Here, we present biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic evidence that Cdc2 phosphorylates S6K1 at multiple S/TP sites during mitosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cdc2 is required for mitotic inactivation S6K1 in FT210 cells.RESULTSAlthough the specific activity of S6K1 is reduced in nocodazole-arrested Cos7 cells compared with cells in interphase (9Papst P.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15077-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a similar treatment has no apparent effect in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (36Edelmann H.M.L. Kuhne C. Petritsch C. Ballou L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 963-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the consensus Cdc2 S/TP site, Ser411, is induced both in nocodazole-arrested Cos7 cells and in primary human T cells during G2/M (9Papst P.J. Sugiyama H. Nagasawa M. Lucas J.J. Maller J.L. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15077-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether S6K1 prepared from nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells displayed reduced kinase activity and whether or not this was associated with changes in site-specific phosphorylation. Initially, FACS analysis was performed on growing HeLa cells incubated for increasing periods with nocodazole (Fig.2 A). These results indicate that 24 h of nocodazole exposure induced a near-complete M phase arrest. We therefore chose a 24 h incubation for all subsequent nocodazole treatments. This M phase arrest was associated with a prominent activation of Cdc2 as indicated by dephosphorylation of Tyr15 (Fig. 2 B) and by an increase in H1 kinase activity detected in anti-Cdc2 immunoprecipitates (Fig.2 C).Figure 2Mitotic arrest induces S6K1 inactivation despite increased S/TP-specific phosphorylation. A, HeLa cells were incubated with nocodazole (0.4 μg/ml) for the times indicated. Histograms show cell cycle distribution at each time point. Whole cell lysates (WCL) were prepared from HeLa extracts of asynchronous populations (interphase, I) or after 24-h incubation with nocodazole (mitotic arrest, M).B, HeLa lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE then immunoblotted with antibodies specific for Cdc2 or Cdc2 phosphorylated on Tyr15. C, Cdc2 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa extracts and incubated in a kinase reaction using purified histone H1 as substrate. The kinase reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then subjected to auto- radiography. A representative autoradiogram is presented.D, HeLa lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for S6K1 or S6K1 phosphorylated on Ser371, Ser411, Thr421/Ser424, or Thr389. E, S6K1 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa extracts and incubated with a synthetic peptide substrate corresponding to the region of phosphorylation of RPS6. The reactions were spotted onto filters and counted by liquid scintillation counting. The data are representative of five independent experiments. F, HA-S6K1 was transiently expressed in and purified from asynchronous 293T cells and incubated with purified, baculovirus-expressed Cdc2·cyclin B in a Cdc2 kinase reaction. The reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and either subjected to autoradiography or immunoblotted with anti-phosphopeptide antisera as indicated. The data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We observed an interesting profile of phosphorylation for mitotic S6K1. Using anti-phosphopeptide antibodies, four S/TP sites, Ser371, Ser411, Thr421, and Ser424, showed reproducible increases in phosphorylation in response to nocodazole, although to differing extents (Fig.2 D). The fold increases in site-specific, mitotic phosphorylation were as follows: Ser371, ∼50%; Ser411, ∼100%; and Thr421 and Ser424, ∼1000%. This was in stark contrast to Thr389, which showed substantial dephosphorylation upon mitotic arrest (Fig. 2 D). Because stimulation of the kinase activity of S6K1 is absolutely reliant upon phosphorylation of Thr389, the reduction in S6 kinase activity measured in anti-S6K1 immunoprecipitates prepared from mitotic cells was consistent (Fig. 2 E). It is noteworthy, however, that multisite phosphorylation of S/TP sites is predicted to disengage the autoinhibitory function of the C-terminal tail, thereby facilitating (and indeed being associated with) the activation of S6K1. These findings, therefore, are suggestive of a novel function of mitotic S/TP phosphorylation distinct from the mitogen-stimulated activation of S6K1.Previous studies have established that S6K1 is a substrate of Cdc2·cyclin B in vitro, particularly at Ser411(9Papst P.J. Sugiyama H. Nagasawa M. Lucas J.J. Maller J.L. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15077-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Given the presence of multiple, neighboring S/TP sites within the S6K1 protein, and the fact that these sites are phosphorylated in mitotic cells, we reasoned that these sites may be substrates for Cdc2·cyclin B as well. N-terminal HA-tagged S6K1 was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated from asynchronous cells with anti-HA antibody. Active Cdc2·cyclin B complexes were expressed in and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and used to phosphorylate immunopurified HA-S6K1 in vitro. Of the S/TP sites evaluated, Ser411, Thr421, and Ser424 were heavily phosphorylated, whereas Ser371 was only modestly phosphorylated. The non-proline-directed hydrophobic motif site, Thr389, was not phosphorylated in the reaction (Fig. 2 F). Thus, phosphorylation of S6K1 by Cdc2·cyclin B is specific for Ser/Thr in S/TP motifs, although both consensus and non-consensus sites are efficiently phosphorylated.To confirm that the observed effects on S6K1 were due to mitotic arrest rather than nonspecific effects secondary to microtubule destabilization, we monitored the pattern of site-specific phosphorylation of S6K1 throughout the HeLa cell cycle by immunoblotting with anti-phosphopeptide antibodies. Cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by sequential thymidine/aphidicolin blocks and then released into the cell cycle. FACS analysis revealed that synchronization of these cells was achieved and maintained over the entire cell cycle (Fig.3 A). Generally, from early S phase to G2/M (0–9 h), the phosphorylation of S6K1 at the S/TP sites, Ser371, Thr421, and Ser424, rose steadily (Fig. 3 B). Upon entry into the new cycle, these sites were dephosphorylated, and then subsequently their phosphorylation increased as the latter half of the subsequent phase approached (13–27 h). The phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), a natural S6K1 substrate, was elevated from early S phase (3 h) to G2/M (9 h) then returned to basal levels as cells progressed into the new cycle (Fig. 3 B, histogram). It is important to point out that, although populations are enriched in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle at 9 h after release from the G1/S block, FACS analysis cannot distinguish between G2 and M phase cells. Dephosphorylation of Cdc2 at Tyr15 by Cdc25 is an event that triggers the activation of Cdc2 and entry into mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 28Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar). Hence, Tyr15 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is a reliable marker of G2 and M phases, respectively. In view of this, the presence of Tyr15 phosphorylation at 9 h (Fig.3 B) indicates that most of these cells had yet to enter mitosis and thus were synchronized in G2. Furthermore, although by 13 h of release, cells had accumulated in G1, a small percentage remained in the G2/M phase; these are likely to have been in M phase rather than G2 (see below).Figure 3S/TP-specific phosphorylation of S6K1 increases during late phases of the cell cycle. HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by sequential thymidine/aphidicolin blocks. Cells were released into the cell cycle and harvested at the time points indicated. A, HeLa cells were washed and ethanol-fixed. FACS analysis was performed on propidium iodide-stained cells. The respective cell cycle distributions are presented as histograms for each time point. For comparison, asynchronously growing cells (AS) were included in this analysis. B, extracts from HeLa cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, then immunoblotted with antibodies specific for S6K1 or S6K1 phosphorylated at Ser371, Ser411, or Thr421/Ser424 or for RPS6 phosphorylated of Ser240/244 or for Cdc2 or Cdc2 phosphorylated on Tyr15. Site-specific S/TP phosphorylation was calculated as the ratio of phospho-specific signal to total S6K1 signal for individual time points. These data are presented in the histogram above the immunoblots. These data represent means ± S.E. for five independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To precisely monitor the site-specific phosphorylation of S6K1 during mitosis, we performed a narrower time course corresponding to the interval between 8.5 and 15 h after release from G1/S block. In these experiments, FACS analysis was carried out in conjunction with a visual assay of Hoescht-stained HeLa cells to identify those times at which the percentage of mitotic cells was greatest. The cell cycle distribution at each time point is shown in Fig. 4 A. Based on this analysis, the period of 8.5–10 h comprised the end of G2, whereas that of 13.5–15 h represented the beginning of G1. The period from 10.5–12.5 h displayed the greatest enrichment in mitotic cells as determined by Hoescht staining. It is important to point out that only ∼50% of Hoescht-stained cells were discernibly mitotic at 11.5 h, although this time point displayed the greatest mitotic index (data not shown). The C-terminal S/TP sites of S6K1, Ser411, Thr421, and Ser424, all displayed peak phosphorylation during mitosis (Fig. 4 B). Conversely, RPS6 was increasingly dephosphorylated as cells entered mitosis, concomitant with dephosphorylation of Cdc2 at Tyr15 (Fig. 4, compare B–D).Figure 4RPS6 is dephosphorylated in mitosis despite peak phosphorylation of S6K1 at S/TP sites. HeLa cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary by thymidine/aphidicolin block were released into the cell cycle and harvested at the time points indicated. A, cells were processed as described in the legend of Fig. 3 A. The percentage of the total population of cells in G1, S, or G2/M was determined for each time point. These percentages are presented in the histogram. The time points displaying the greatest percentage of mitotic cells were determined in a visual assay of Hoescht-stained cells and comprised the period from 10.5 to 12.5 h after release. The 11.5-h time point showed the greatest percentage of mitotic cells; ∼50% of these cells were mitotic. B–D, HeLa extracts were prepared at the indicated time points and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for: S6K1 or S6K1 phosphorylated at Ser411 or Thr421/Ser424(B); RPS6 or RPS6 phosphorylated at Ser240/244(C); or Cdc2 or Cdc2 phosphorylated at Tyr15(D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given that Cdc2 phosphorylates S6K1 at multiple S/TP sites in vitro (Ref. 9Papst P.J.

Murthy K.g. K. Zhao W. Prives C. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the non-consensus S/TP sites found in S6K1 (e.g. Ser371, Thr421, and Ser424) may also be under Cdc2 control in vivo. It would then be reasonable to predict that pharmacological inhibition of Cdc2 during mitosis would block the appearance of phospho-epitopes at putative consensus and non-consensus Cdc2 sites. To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells were arrested in mitosis with nocodazole followed by the addition of various phosphatase and kinase inhibitors. The addition of sodium orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, has been classically used to inhibit tyrosine dephosphorylation of Cdc2 by the dual-specificity phosphatase, Cdc25 (37Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), thereby maintaining Cdc2 inactivity. Because the Thr14 and Tyr15kinases, Wee1 and Myt1, remain active (or, in fact, may be activated as a result of inhibition of Cdc2), Cdc2 is rephosphorylated after vanadate-induced inhibition of Cdc25. Addition of this inhibitor resulted in dephosphorylation of S6K1 at both consensus (Ser411) and non-consensus (Thr421 and Ser424) Cdc2 sites (Fig.5 A). Similar results were obtained with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, roscovitine and purvalanol A, insofar as S/TP site phosphorylation is concerned. Proline-directed phosphorylation of mitotic S6K1 was both rapa"

By taking advantage of the quantum dynamics of a Josephson junction, i.e., the interplay of interlevel transitions and the Coulomb blockade of Cooper pairs, we created transistor-like devices, Bloch oscillating transistors, with considerable current gain and high-input impedance. In these transistors, the correlated supercurrent of Cooper pairs is controlled by a small base current made up of single electrons. Our devices reached current and power gains on the order of 30 and 5, respectively. The noise temperature was estimated to be around 1 kelvin, but noise temperatures of less than 0.1 kelvin can be realistically achieved. These devices provide quantum-electronic building blocks that will be useful at low temperatures in low-noise circuit applications with an intermediate impedance level."

To determine a region of APP essential for the inhibitory activity, we prepared various derivatives of APP. Functional analyses of proteolytic fragments of soluble APP (sAPP) and glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins, which contain various COOH-terminal parts of sAPP, showed that a site containing residues 579–601 of APP770 is essential for the inhibitory activity. Moreover, a synthetic decapeptide containing the ISYGNDALMP sequence corresponding to residues 586–595 of APP770 had a gelatinase A inhibitory activity slightly higher than that of sAPP. Studies of deletion of the NH2- and COOH-terminal residues and alanine replacement of internal residues of the decapeptide further revealed that Tyr588, Asp591, and Leu593 of APP mainly stabilize the interaction between gelatinase A and the inhibitor. We also found that the residues of Ile586, Met594, and Pro595 modestly contribute to the inhibitory activity. The APP-derived decapeptide efficiently inhibited the activity of gelatinase A (IC50 = 30 nm), whereas its inhibitory activity toward membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase was much weaker (IC50 = 2 μm). The decapeptide had poor inhibitory activity toward gelatinase B, matrilysin, and stromelysin (IC50 > 10 μm). The APP-derived inhibitor formed a complex with active gelatinase A but not with progelatinase A, and the complex formation was prevented completely by a hydroxamate-based synthetic inhibitor.

The activities of activated MMPs are regulated by a family of inhibitors known as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The members of TIMP family have broad specificity against MMPs; the activities of almost all MMPs are susceptible to TIMP (TIMP-1–TIMP-4) inhibition, and some members of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase family are also inhibited by TIMP-3 (4Amour A.

A common architecture of catalytic sites of MMPs probably relates to the broad specificity of the inhibitors. Among the MMP family, gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) are critical in the invasion of tumor cells across basement membranes because of their strong activity against type IV collagen, a major component of basement membranes (11Liotta L.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 12Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L. Kronberger A. He C. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

Unlike other zymogen of MMPs, activation of progelatinase A is catalyzed specifically by a novel type of MMP that has a transmembrane domain and is thus localized on the cell surface (14Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). So far, six members of membrane type MMP have been identified, and membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP)-catalyzed progelatinase A activation has been well characterized (15Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 16Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 17Yana I. Seiki M. Clin.

In the activation of progelatinase A, the protease zymogen is firstly recruited on cell surface via MT1-MMP complexed with TIMP-2, and then a TIMP-2-free, noninhibited form of MT1-MMP also present on cell surface cleaves the propeptide of progelatinase A to initiate the activation (14Sato H.

After the activation, gelatinase A retained on cell surface plays a role in the local degradation of extracellular matrix. It is thought that both the cell-associated active gelatinase A and MT1-MMP are recruited into invadopodia, thus limiting proteolysis to the site of cell invasion (20Nakahara H. Howard L.

Therefore, exertion of gelatinase A activity is strictly regulated on its zymogen activation level. Recently, we further proposed that the ECM degrading activity of gelatinase A can be regulated through an MT1-MMP-catalyzed processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). 2S. Higashi and K.

In cultured cells, APP synthesized and maturated through the constitutive secretory pathway is proteolytically cleaved at the cell surface within the β-amyloid sequence, and the extracellular domain of APP is released as a soluble APP (sAPP) into the culture medium (22Sisodia S.S.

Nature. 1993; 362: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), this molecule is assumed to protect ECM from the gelatinase A-catalyzed degradation. On the other hand, we recently found that MT1-MMP-catalyzed processing of APP releases a soluble fragment of APP that lacks the inhibitor domain against gelatinase A.2 This inhibitor domain-less fragment is still able to interact with ECM, and it displaces ECM-associated sAPP or APP, thereby removing the gelatinase A inhibitor from ECM. Together with the MT1-MMP-catalyzed activation of progelatinase A, the removal of gelatinase A inhibitor from ECM facilitates the ECM degradation only in the vicinity of MT1-MMP. Because the MT1-MMP-catalyzed cleavage of APP at a peptide bond between Asn579 and Met580 leads to release of the inhibitor-less fragment,2 the COOH-terminal part of this cleavage site is thought to be essential for the inhibitory activity of sAPP. However, the exact location of the inhibitory domain in APP remains to be determined. In this study, we identified a minimal structural unit of the gelatinase A inhibitor domain. Unlike other natural or synthetic MMP inhibitors, the APP-derived inhibitor was found to have a high selectivity toward gelatinase A. Therefore, the determination of the inhibitor structure may provide not only a detailed understanding of the APP-mediated regulation of gelatinase A activity but also the potential to design novel anti-cancer drugs that block specific processes of tumor invasion.

The transformant was cultured in 2× YT medium (0.08% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, and 0.25% (w/v) NaCl) at 37 °C, and the GST fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After a 4-h induction, the E. coli cells were broken in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm dithiothreitol with a sonicator, and the resultant lysate was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column that had been equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After washing the column with the equilibration buffer, the adsorbed protein was eluted with the equilibration buffer supplemented with 10 mm glutathione. The eluted GST fusion protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl, and its concentration was determined by the Bradford dye method with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. 20 μl of 4.0 μm sAPP was incubated with various concentrations of human thrombin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1m NaCl at 37 °C for 4 h. After incubation, each of the samples was mixed with 5 μl of 50 mm APMSF, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h to inactivate thrombin. The resultant digests were subjected to SDS-PAGE or gelatinase A reverse zymography analysis. 10 μl of 4.0 μm GST-APP439–678 was incubated with various concentrations of lysyl endopeptidase in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, each of the samples was mixed with 10 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, and 20% glycerol, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min to terminate the enzyme reaction. The resultant digests were subjected to SDS-PAGE and gelatinase A reverse zymography analyses. sAPP (120 μg) was incubated with 0.2 m KNCO in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl at 37 °C for 6 h. The sAPP sample was further incubated with 0.2m hydroxylamine hydrochloride at 25 °C for 1 h and then dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl. This treatment appeared to result in complete carbamylation of the α-amino group of NH2-terminal Leu18 because no phenylthiohydantoin derivative was detected in the NH2-terminal sequence analysis on the modified sAPP. The modified sAPP (2 μm) was then incubated with human thrombin (25 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m NaCl at 37 °C. After 4 h, the sample was further incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with 10 mm APMSF. The resultant digest was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, using an Atto Immunodot apparatus (Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was washed extensively with pure water and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The stained spot was subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis. TIMP-2-free form of progelatinase A, progelatinase B, or prostromelysin was activated by incubation with 1 mmAPMA at 37 °C for 1 h as described previously (30Miyazaki K. Hattori Y. Umenishi F. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7758-7764PubMed Google Scholar, 33Miyazaki K. Funahashi K. Numata Y. Koshikawa N. Akaogi K. Kikkawa Y. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14387-14393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated gelatinase A (0.61 nm), gelatinase B (4.8 nm), stromelysin (6.2 nm), matrilysin (3.8 nm), and the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (3.2 nm) were each incubated with various concentrations of derivatives of APP (sAPP, GST fusion proteins, or peptides) in 190 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij 35, and 0.01% BSA at 37 °C for 15 min. Then 10 μl of 1 mm 3163v (1 mm 3168v in case of assay of stromelysin activity) was added to the mixture, and the incubation was further continued for 40 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 7.5). The amounts of the synthetic substrate hydrolyzed by MMPs were measured fluorometrically with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. The amount of the substrate hydrolyzed without enzyme was subtracted from the total amount of the hydrolyzed substrate. Zymography (30Miyazaki K. Hattori Y. Umenishi F. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7758-7764PubMed Google Scholar) and gelatinase A reverse zymography (29Miyazaki K. Hasegawa M. Funahashi K. Umeda M. Nature. 1993; 362: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were carried out on 10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml of gelatin, as described previously. The expression vectors of GST fusion proteins were transfected into theE. coli strain DH5α. Each of the transformants was cultured in 2× YT medium at 37 °C, and expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After a 4-h induction, E. coli cells were dissolved in a SDS sampling buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins on the gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot apparatus. The membrane was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% skim milk at 37 °C for 2 h, washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA (PBS-Tween), and then incubated at room temperature with anti-GST polyclonal antibody (0.2 μg/ml) in PBS-Tween. After a 12-h incubation, the membrane was washed with PBS-Tween and incubated for 1 h with a biotinylated anti-goat IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) that had been diluted 1000-fold with PBS-Tween. After washing with PBS-Tween, the membrane was incubated with 1000-fold diluted avidin-alkaline phosphatase (Vector) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed extensively and then incubated in a reaction mixture containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium to develop a colored product on the membrane. Gelatinase A-catalyzed hydrolysis of synthetic substrate was measured in the presence of various concentrations of APP-derived inhibitors as described above. The IC50 values were determined from the data, where IC50 represents a concentration of the inhibitors giving a 50% inhibition of the activity of gelatinase A. In the condition that the concentration of APP-derived inhibitor is excessive to that of gelatinase A, IC50 is close to [I]50, where [I]50 represents a concentration of the free inhibitor giving a 50% inhibition. On the other hand, considering that APP-derived inhibitor inhibits the gelatinase A activity in a competitive manner (29Miyazaki K. Hasegawa M. Funahashi K. Umeda M. Nature. 1993; 362: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), Equation 1 can be derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation (34Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975: 320-329Google Scholar). [I]50=Kd·(1+[S]/Km)(Eq. 1) where Kd represents a dissociation constant between enzyme and the inhibitor, [S] is a concentration of free substrate, and Km is the Michaelis constant for the gelatinase A-catalyzed hydrolysis of synthetic substrate. On the other hand, the change in binding energy between gelatinase A and various APP-derived inhibitors before and after deletion/replacement of a single amino acid residue is given by Equation 2.ΔΔG=RT·1n(Kda/Kdb)(Eq. 2) where Kdb andKda are the dissociation constants (Kd values) for the binding of gelatinase A to various peptide inhibitors before and after the modification, respectively. Considering that a fixed concentration of the synthetic substrate was used for the assay of gelatinase A activity, the value of (1 + [S]/Km) can be assumed to be constant. Therefore, in the condition that the concentration of peptide inhibitor is excessive to that of gelatinase A, Equation 3 can be derived from Equation 2, using Equation 1.ΔΔG=RT·1n(IC50a/IC50b)(Eq. 3) where IC50 b and IC50 a are the IC50 values for inhibition of gelatinase A by various inhibitors before and after the modification, respectively. The energetic contributions of individual amino acid residues of the APP-derived inhibitor in its interaction with gelatinase A were calculated, using Equation 3. The samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 477A gas phase sequencer. Phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were detected using an Applied Biosystems 120A PTH analyzer with an on-line system. 30 μl of the TIMP-2-free form of progelatinase A (930 nm) was incubated with 1 mm APMA at 37 °C for various lengths of time in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mmCaCl2 and 0.01% Brij 35. After incubation, the sample was transferred to an ice water container and was added with 270 μl of ice-cold buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Brij 35, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 to quench the activation reaction. 100 μl of the preparation was mixed with 20 μl of APP586–601-Affi-Gel 10 beads (200 nmol of hexadecapeptide, which has a sequence corresponding to residues 586–601 of APP770, was coupled to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 10) and incubated in the presence or absence of 1.0 μm KB-8301 at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. After washing the beads with the incubation buffer, the adsorbed sample was extracted with the SDS sampling buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol. Various gelatinase A forms in the extract were analyzed by gelatin zymography. The gelatinase A samples prepared as described above but incubated without APP586–601-Affi-Gel 10 beads were also subjected to the zymographic analysis. It has been reported that recombinant APP produced in E. coli can be cleaved by thrombin at a peptide bond between Arg585 and Ile586 (35Igarashi K. Murai H. Asaka J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This thrombin-susceptible site is near the Asn578-Met579 bond in sAPP, which is susceptible to MT1-MMP cleavage.2 To examine whether thrombin cleavage of sAPP affects its gelatinase A inhibitory activity, we digested purified sAPP with thrombin and tested the gelatinase A inhibitory activities of the resultant fragments by reverse zymography. We found that the digestion of sAPP (105 kDa) mainly yielded a 90-kDa fragment (Fig. 1B), but this fragment did not show inhibitory activity toward gelatinase A (Fig.1A). The LEVPTDGNAG sequence corresponding to residues 18–27 of APP770 was determined in the NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the 90-kDa fragment, indicating that this fragment was derived from an NH2-terminal region of sAPP. To determine the site of cleavage, we tried to isolate the fragment derived from a COOH-terminal region of sAPP by SDS-PAGE. However, isolation of the fragment was not feasible because it was hardly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Then we treated sAPP with KNCO to mask its NH2terminus by carbamylation and then digested the modified sAPP with thrombin. The newly exposed NH2 terminus by the thrombin cleavage was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that the treatment of"

We expressed the EL5 RING-H2 finger domain in Escherichia coliand determined its structure in solution by NMR spectroscopy. The EL5 RING-H2 finger domain consists of two-stranded β-sheets (β1, Ala147–Phe149; β2, Gly156–His158), one α-helix (Cys161–Leu166), and two large N- and C-terminal loops. It is stabilized by two tetrahedrally coordinated zinc ions. This structure is similar to that of other RING finger domains of proteins of known function. From structural analogies, we inferred that the EL5 RING-H2 finger is a binding domain for ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). The binding site is probably formed by solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues of the N- and C-terminal loops and the α-helix. We demonstrated that the fusion protein with EL5-(96–181) and maltose-binding protein (MBP) was polyubiquitinated by incubation with ubiquitin, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), and a rice E2 protein, OsUBC5b. This supported the idea that the EL5 RING finger domain is essential for ubiquitin-ligase activity of EL5. By NMR titration experiments, we identified residues that are critical for the interaction between the EL5 RING-H2 finger andOsUBC5b. We conclude that the RING-H2 finger domain of EL5 is the E2 binding site of EL5. EL5, a RING-H2 finger protein, is rapidly induced by N-acetylchitooligosaccharides in rice cell.

We conclude that the RING-H2 finger domain of EL5 is the E2 binding site of EL5. maltose-binding protein root mean square deviation Upon sensing the invasion of microorganisms, plants evoke a variety of defense reactions, including the synthesis of antimicrobial compounds (phytoalexins) and proteins. Many of these biochemical reactions are based on the activation of defense-related genes. In some cases, the level of protein accumulation and the rapidity of gene induction in the host plant are correlated to the degree of its disease resistance. Therefore, it might be possible to control disease resistance by modifying the regulatory factors for the expression of defense-related genes. Such regulatory factors could be elements of signal transduction pathways leading from the recognition of invading pathogens to the activation of defense-related genes. Most of the defense responses are reproducible in suspension-cultured cells treated with specific substances called elicitor (1Boller T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 189-214Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Chitin fragments (N-acetylchitooligosaccharides) can act as elicitors (2Shibuya N. Minami E. Phys. Mol. Plant Path. 2001; 59: 223-233Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar), which induce the transient expression of several “early responsive” genes, such as EL5 (3Takai R. Hasegawa K. Kaku H. Shibuya N. Minami E. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). EL5 is a RING finger protein, which is structurally related to proteins of the Arabidopsis ATLfamily. These proteins are characterized by a transmembrane domain (domain I), basic domain (domain II), conserved domain (domain III), and RING-H2 finger domain (domain IV) followed by the C-terminal region with highly diverse amino acid sequences (4Martinez-Garcia M. Garciduenas-Pina C. Guzman P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 587-596PubMed Google Scholar). Although some ATL family genes resemble EL5 in being induced in early stages of the defense responses (5Salinas-Mondragon R.E. Garciduenas-Pina C.G. Guzman P. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), their biochemical function is obscure. Recently, it was shown that the fusion protein of EL5 with maltose-binding protein (MBP)1 was polyubiquitinated by incubation with ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Apparently, EL5 acted as a ubiquitin ligase (E3) and catalyzed the transfer of ubiquitin to the MBP moiety. Further, it was shown that a rice E2, OsUBC5b was induced by elicitor (6Takai R. Matsuda N. Nakano A. Hasegawa K. Akimoto C. Shibuya N. Minami E. Plant J. 2002; 30: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although these results strongly suggest that EL5 andOsUBC5b have roles in plant defense response through the turnover of protein(s) via the ubiquitin/proteasome system, their molecular function has not been clarified at the atomic level. The RING finger motif, which is known from many functionally distinct proteins, was first identified in the product of the human gene RING1 (Really Interesting New Gene 1) that is located proximal to the major histocompatibility region on chromosome 6 (7Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). The RING finger motif is defined by the consensus sequence Cys-X2-Cys-X9–39-Cys-X1–3-His-X2–3-(Cys/His)-X2-Cys-X4–48-Cys-X2-Cys, in which X can be any amino acid. It binds two zinc atoms with its Cys and His residues in a unique “cross-brace” arrangement. The invariable spacing between the second and third pair of Cys/His residues indicates conservation of the distance between the two zinc-binding sites (8Borden K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The RING finger motif is widely distributed among proteins that play major roles in cell growth and differentiation (9Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemond P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Certain types of RING finger domains seem to be required for multimerization, while others are elements of proteins involved in ubiquitination (10Borden K.L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Ubiqutination usually results in the formation of a bond between the C terminus of ubiquitin (Gly76) and the ε-amino group of a substrate Lys residue. This reaction requires the sequential action of three enzymes: (i) an activating enzyme (E1) that forms a thiol ester with the carbonyl group of Gly76 in ubiquitin, (ii) a conjugating enzyme (E2) that transiently carries the ubiquitin as a thiol ester, and (iii) a ligase (E3) that transfers the activated ubiquitin from the E2 to the substrate Lys residue. The efficiency and high selectivity of ubiquitination reactions depend on the accuracy of E3 action. All known E3s utilized either of catalytic domains, the RING finger domain or the HECT domain (11Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). The structures of RING finger domains have been determined by NMR (12Borden K.L.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Hanzawa H. Ruwe M.J. Albert T.K.

Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between molecular function and high order structure has not yet been established. To elucidate the properties of EL5 at the atomic level, we determined the three-dimensional structure of its RING-H2 finger domain in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, we characterized its functional properties by an ubiquitination assay in vitroand by NMR titration experiments. Our results illuminate the function of not only EL5 but also the ATL family proteins in general. EL5 RING-H2 finger domains and OsUBC5b were cloned as fusion proteins with thioredoxin (Trx) and His tag. The fusion proteins were constructed in the vector pET32a (Novagen). EL5(129–181) and EL5(96–181) DNA fragments from EL5 cDNA (AB045120) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).OsUBC5b was amplified by PCR from OsUBC5b cDNA (AB074412). Trx-EL5(129–181) was constructed using the primers 5′-CATGCCATGGACGACGGCGTCGAGTG-3′ and 5′-CGAATTCTTACACGACGACGGTGAGGC-3′. Trx-EL5-(96–181) was constructed using the primers 5′-CATGCCATGGGGGTCGACCCGGAGGTG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTTACACGACGACGGTGAGGC-3′. The purified PCR products were digested with NcoI and EcoRI or BamHI and were ligated into pET32a. Trx-OsUBC5b was constructed with the primers 5′-TTCCATGGCGTCCAGCGGATCCTCAAG-3′ and 5′-AACTCGAGCTAGCCCATAGCATATTTCTGGGT-3′. The purified PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI and was ligated into pET32a. All of the clones were transformed into Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) cells. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani for non-labeled protein and in M9 minimal medium for uniformly15N- and 15N/13C-labeled protein, with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a concentration of 1 mm. For EL5(129–181) and EL5(96–181), ZnSO4 (final concentration 100 μm) was added at the same time. After 3 h the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were frozen. Trx-EL5(129–181) and Trx-EL5(96–181) were purified by a similar procedure. Frozen pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnSO4, and 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, before lysis by sonication. Insoluble material remaining after lysis was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml Ni-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the column with buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.4), 20 μm ZnSO4, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 15 mm imidazole), protein was eluted in buffer using 400 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were concentrated and applied to a HiLoad Superdex 75pg 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnSO4, 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Trx tag was removed by cleavage with 75 units of enterokinase (Invitrogen) per 31.5 mg of protein at 37 °C for 16 h. The solution was applied to a HiLoad Superdex 75pg 26/60 column. The peak fraction was 5-fold diluted with 50 mmTris-HCl, 20 μm ZnSO4, and 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences). Peak fractions were dialyzed against NMR buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, 20 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and were concentrated using a Centricon spin dialysis tube (3-kDa cutoff; Amicon, Inc.). For purification of Trx-OsUBC5b, frozen pellets were thawed on ice, resuspended in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 500 mm NaCl, and lysed by sonication. Insoluble material remaining after lysis was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml Ni-chelating column. After washing the column with buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl), protein was eluted in buffer using a linear gradient of imidazole (0–500 mm). Peak fractions were concentrated and applied to a HiLoad Superdex 75 pg 26/60 column equilibrated in buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl). Trx tag was removed by cleavage with 28 units of thrombin (Novagen) per about 13 mg of protein at 37 °C for 12 h. The solution was applied to a Ni-chelating column. Remaining tag was removed by cleavage with 130 units of enterokinase per about 5 mg of protein at 37 °C for 16 h. Then the solution was applied to a HiLoad Superdex 75pg 26/60 column. Peak fractions were dialyzed against NMR buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and concentrated using a Centricon spin dialysis tube (30-kDa cutoff; Amicon, Inc.). All NMR spectra were recorded at 35 °C on a Bruker DMX750 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm inverse triple resonance probe head with three-axis gradient coils. 1H,13C, and 15N sequential resonance assignments were obtained using two-dimensional double resonance and three-dimensional double and triple resonance through-bond correlation experiments (16Bax A.

Stereospecific assignments of α- and β-protons and the methyl side chains of Val and Leu residues were achieved by a combination of quantitative J measurements and NOESY data. 3J couplings were measured using quantitative two-dimensional and three-dimensional J correlation spectroscopy (18Clore G.M.

These spectra were processed using NMRPipe software (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11562) Google Scholar) and were analyzed using Capp/Pipp/Stapp software (20Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts were referenced to HDO (4.68 ppm at 35 °C), indirectly to TSP (13C) (21Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar), and to liquid ammonia (15N), respectively (22Live D.H. Davis D.G. Agosta W.C. Cowburn D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 1934-1941Google Scholar). NOE-derived interproton distance restraints were classified into four ranges: 1.8–2.7, 1.8–3.3, 1.8–4.3, and 1.8–5.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, weak, and very weak NOEs. The upper limit was corrected for constraints involving methyl protons and methylene protons that were not assigned stereospecifically (23Wüthrich K. Billetter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond distance restraints were applied to N and O atoms (2.8–3.3 Å) and to HN and O atoms (1.8–2.3 Å), in regular secondary structures that had small amide exchange rates. Torsion angle restraints on φ and ψ were derived from3JHNHα coupling constants (24Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), short-range NOEs (αHi to NHi+1 and βHi to NHi+1), and a data base analysis of backbone (13Cα, 13Cβ,13C′, 1Hα, 15N) chemical shifts using the program TALOS (25Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Side-chain χ1 angle restraints were derived from HOHAHA connectivities and the distances between αH and β1H and between αH and β2H, which were estimated from NOEs and ROEs. Values for 3JHαHβ and3JNHβ coupling constants were also taken into consideration. The structures of the RING-H2 finger domain of EL5 were calculated using the hybrid distance geometry-dynamical simulated annealing method (26Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brunger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), as contained in X-PLOR 3.1 (27Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). For structure calculations, we used 755 interproton distance restraints (comprising 290 intraresidue, 185 sequential (‖i − j‖ = 1), 73 medium range (1 < ‖i − j‖ < 5), and 207 long range (‖i − j‖ ≥ 5) restraints) obtained from heteronuclear three- and four-dimensional NOE spectra. In addition to the NOE-derived distance restraints, 18 distance restraints for 9 hydrogen bonds and 140 dihedral angle restraints (46 φ, 47 ψ, 38 χ1, and 9 χ2) were included in the calculation. A final set of 15 lowest energy structures was selected from 100 calculations. None of them had NOE and dihedral angle violations of >0.5 Å and >5°, respectively. Structural statistics calculated for the final 20 structures are summarized in Table I. Statistics did not change significantly when the 40 lowest energy structures were used for calculation. The average coordinate of the ensembles of the final 15 structures was subjected to 500 cycles of Powell restrained energy minimization to improve stereochemistry and non-bonded contacts. The structural statistics for the restrained energy minimized average structure are also summarized in Table I. Figures were generated using MOLMOL (28Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab A series of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra was recorded for the RING-H2 finger domain in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm dithiothreitol, as a function of OsUBC5b concentration. Solutions containing 0.25 mm of either15N-labled RING-H2 finger domain or non-labeledOsUBC5b were mixed to yield molecular ratios (OsUBC5b : RING-H2 finger domain) of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, and 2. Assignments of the HSQC signals of EL5 RING finger domain bound to E2 were made by tracing the peaks during titration and were confirmed by analyzing three-dimensional triple resonance experiments carried out on the solution containing 0.6 mm15N/13C-labeled EL5 RING finger domain and 0.72 mmOsUBC5b. The EL5 fragments Gly96–Asn325and Gly96–Val181 were amplified by PCR using 5′-GAATTCGGAGGAGGGGTCGACCCG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAATCCGGACATGCGC-3′ primers or 5′-CGAATTCGGAGGAGGGGTCGACCCG-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCTCAATCCGGACATGCGC-3′ primers, respectively. The PCR products were digested withEcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site of pMAL-p2 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) to express MBP-EL5(96–325) and MBP-EL5(96–181). To yield MBP for negative control experiments, pMAL-p2 was digested with EcoRI, blunted, and self-ligated. All PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were introduced into the E. coli strain JM109 to produce the recombinant proteins and were purified by amylose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England BioLabs). The ubiquitination reaction was performed in 150 μl of ubiquitination buffer containing 300 ng/μl bovine ubiquitin (Sigma), 50 ng of mouse E1, 10 ngOsUBC5b as E2, and 250 ng of MBP fusion protein. The reaction buffer was incubated at 35 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-MBP antibody (New England BioLabs). EL5 consists of a transmembrane domain (domain I), a basic domain (domain II), a conserved domain (domain III), and the RING-H2 finger domain (domain IV) followed by the C terminus (Fig.1a). For NMR experiments, two protein fragments were prepared: EL5 (129–181, domain IV), containing the RING-H2 finger domain only, and EL5 (96–181, domain III + IV), which additionally contained the conserved domain. The1H-15N HSQC spectrum of EL5(129–181) obtained at 35 °C showed dispersed, intense signals, indicating a well-defined molecular structure (Fig. 1b). In the spectrum of EL5(96–181), the strengths of peaks differed considerably (Fig.1c). The weak signals corresponded to those of EL5(129–181), that is, to the RING-H2 finger domain. The intense signals were concentrated in the center of the spectrum, indicating that domain III is a highly flexible random coil structure. To investigate the role of Zn2+ in the folding of the EL5 RING-H2 domain, Zn2+ was chelated by EDTA. Removal of zinc from the purified domain by addition of EDTA led to a loss of the chemical shift dispersion characteristics of the folded proteins (Fig.1d). The protein was reversibly refolded upon addition of excess Zn2+, as indicated by the reappearance of a spectrum that was identical to that in Fig. 1b. Therefore we decided to carry out the purification of recombinant EL5(129–181) and its NMR analysis in the presence Zn2+. The backbone amide resonances in the1H-15N HSQC spectrum were sequentially assigned to all non-proline residues based upon the analysis of correlations observed in CBCA(CO)NH and HNCACB spectra, respectively. The former type of spectrum correlates each 15N, HN signal pair to the Cα and Cβ signals of the preceding residue, while the latter additionally provides the 15N, HN, Cα, and15N, HN, Cβ intraresidue correlations. The assignments were checked and extended to backbone Hα and CO signals, and to1H and 13C side-chain signals by correlations observed in the three-dimensional spectra, 15N-separated HOHAHA-HSQC, HBHA(CO)NH, HNCO, C(CO)HN, and HCCH-TOCSY. Side-chain1H and 13C signals in aromatic regions were assigned to aromatic amino acids according to cross-peak patterns observed in 1H-13C CT-HSQC and CT-HSQC-relay spectra that were optimized for aromatic side chains. The aromatic Hδ and Cδ signals were then correlated to sequentially assigned backbone signals through cross-peaks observed in three-dimensional15N-separated NOESY-HSQC and13C/15N-separated NOESY-HSQC spectra and a four-dimensional 13C/13C-separated NOESY spectrum. In order to obtain a high-resolution NMR structure, the resonance assignments were refined by stereospecific assignments of numerous methylene and methyl protons of Val and Leu residues. Stereospecific assignments of Gly α-protons were derived from3JHNHα coupling constants (24Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), intraresidue NOEs between HN and α-protons, and sequential NOEs between Gly α-protons (i) and HN protons (i+1). β-protons were stereospecifically assigned using J couplings obtained from HNHB (29Archer S.J. Ikura M. Torchia D.A. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 636-641Google Scholar) and HOHAHA-HSQC spectra, and by intraresidue α-β distances estimated from NOE/ROE spectra, as described by Clore and Gronenborn (17Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Science. 1991; 252: 1390-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In some cases, information from local secondary structure and short-range NOEs was used to facilitate stereospecific assignments. Signals from all Val γ-methyl groups were stereospecifically assigned from estimates of 3JNCγ (30Vuister G.W. Wang A.C. Bax A J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5334-5335Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar),3JNHβ (29Archer S.J. Ikura M. Torchia D.A. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 636-641Google Scholar), and3JHNHα coupling constants and from NOEs between Val α-β and α-γ protons. Leu δ-methyl group signals were stereospecifically assigned from NOE patterns observed in three-dimensional NOESY, ROESY, and four-dimensional NOESY spectra. On the basis of essentially complete signal assignments, interproton distance constraints were derived from short range NOE connectives obtained from three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC,13C/15N-separated NOESY-HSQC, and four-dimensional 13C/13C-separated HSQC-NOESY-HSQC spectra. Dihedral constraints for φ angles were determined from 3JHNHα coupling constants derived from Hα/HN intensity ratios measured in HNHA experiments. Slowly exchanging amide protons were assigned in1H-15N HSQC hydrogen exchange experiment and were identified as protons involved in interresidue hydrogen bonds. The β-strand and helical domains indicated by the NOE and J coupling data were corroborated by secondary structural elements predicted"

HIF-1α is stabilized, translocates to the nucleus, interacts with hypoxia-responsive elements, and promotes the activation of target genes. This report shows that cyclosporin A (CsA) interferes with the hypoxic signaling cascade in C6 glioma cells. CsA inhibits hypoxia-dependent gene transcription in a reporter gene assay and prevents the hypoxic accumulation of HIF-1α. Addition of the 530–603 C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1α to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) destabilized the protein in an oxygen-dependent manner. CsA prevented the hypoxic stabilization of an ODD·GFP fusion protein. An assay for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases was developed using a light mitochondrial kidney fraction as a source of enzyme. It uses the capacity of specific peptides to stimulate the degradation of [14C]2-oxoglutarate. CsA stimulated the enzymatic activity in the presence of a peptide that mimicked the 557–576 sequence of HIF-1α. The enzyme promoted [35S]vHL binding to glutathione S-transferase (GST)·ODD fusion protein. This association increased in the presence of CsA. CsA effects were not observed when the proline residue corresponding to Pro-564 in the HIF-1α sequence was replaced by a hydroxyproline or an alanine residue. Finally, CsA increased vHL-ODD interaction during hypoxia. We conclude that CsA destabilizes HIF-1α by promoting hydroxylation of Pro-564 in the ODD domain. Such a mechanism may prevent hypoxic adaptation during CsA-induced nephrotoxicity and contribute to the adverse effects of this drug.

The transcriptional activation of target genes is induced by a common transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1).1 HIF-1 was first identified as a heterodimeric transactivator that recognizes a specific DNA sequence, termed hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) in the 3′-untranslated region of the erythropoietin gene (1Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). HIF-1 consists of two subunits, HIF-1α and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, both of which belong to the large family of basic helix-loop-helix-per-arnt-sim transcription factors (2Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α subunits are unstable, being rapidly targeted to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Degradation is mediated by a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) complex, in which the von Hippel-Lindau protein (vHL) binds to a specific hydroxylated proline residue (Pro-564) within the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1α (4Ivan M.

Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar). A major action of hypoxia is to suppress prolyl hydroxylation and degradation of HIF-1α by the proteasome. As a consequence, the protein accumulates, migrates to the nucleus, and associates with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, and the complex interacts with the HRE of target genes (6Huang L.E.

The importance of this mechanism is ascertained by the facts that vessel formation is hampered in HIF-1α −/− knock out mice (8Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) is a potent immunosuppressive agent used after organ transplantation and in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases. CsA is well known to be nephrotoxic probably as a consequence of the constriction of renal vessels and of the resulting hypoxia. Circumstantial evidence further suggests that CsA interferes with the hypoxic signaling cascade. (i) Maruyama et al. (9Maruyama K. Tomizawa S. Seki Y. Arai H. Kuroume T. Nephron. 1992; 62: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported that CsA inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor production by human lymphocytes.

These would suggest that CsA inhibits the cellular responses that are mediated by HIF-1α and HRE. In the present study, we examine the possible influence of CsA on the hypoxic signaling. Results show that CsA inhibits hypoxia-induced gene transcription by preventing hypoxia-induced and ODD-dependent stabilization of HIF-1α. We also show that CsA stimulates a kidney prolyl hydroxylase activity that specifically modifies Pro-564 in the ODD domain of HIF-1α. Culture medium, restriction, and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Promega. Culture media and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from the following sources: HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals), GFP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), α-tubulin (Sigma), vHL (Pharmingen).

It was originally described as four tandemly repeated HRE motifs (5′-GATCGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′).

The resulting fragment was inserted into aXhoI/NcoI-blunted pSV40-Luc plasmid. The pCMV-ODD-eGFP vector was prepared as follows. The same 222-bp PCR-amplified fragment of HIF-1α was digested by XhoI andXbaI and fused in-frame with the eGFP of aXhoI/XbaI-digested pCI-eGFP2 plasmid (vector kindly provided by Dr. F. Lesage). The generated product, pCI-ODD-eGFP2, was then digested by BglII andNotI. The BglII-ODD-eGFP-NotI fragment was finally inserted into the BglII/NotI-digested pCDNA 3.1 (+) vector (Invitrogen). The pCMV-eGFP vector was prepared as follows. The pCI-eGFP2 plasmid was digested by EcoRI and NotI. TheEcoRI-eGFP-NotI fragment was purified and inserted into the EcoRI/NotI-digested pCDNA 3.1 (+) vector. Sequences of all products were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy terminator method. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). They were incubated with a mixture of 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μg of LipofectAMINE dissolved in 400 μl of OPTI-MEM for 5 h at 37 °C. After a 16-h incubation time, cells were dissociated and seeded into 12-well tissue culture clusters. Eight h after seeding, cells were submitted to hypoxic conditions in the presence or absence of CsA as indicated. Luciferase assays (Promega) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized by the total amount of cellular protein as assayed by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Stable GFP and ODD·GFP cells were selected using 1.5 mg/ml G418 and cloned by limited dilution. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min with continuous rocking and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay. Protein extracts were electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) using standard procedures. For immunoprecipitation, lysis was performed in lysis buffer. After clearance by centrifugation, 250-μg aliquots of cell lysate were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-GFP monoclonal antibody followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (10 μl) and an overnight incubation. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer, eluted with sample buffer, and immunoblotted. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) instant non-fat milk powder in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary monoclonal antibodies against HIF-1α (1:1,000), GFP (1:1,000), or α-tubulin (1:5,000). Monoclonal antibodies against GFP (1:1,000) or against vHL (1:2,000) were used to probe the immunoprecipitates. Blots were washed three times in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibodies (1:10,000) in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20. After extensive washes in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, chemiluminescence detection was performed by incubating the membranes with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2.65 mmH2O2, 0.45 mm luminol, and 0.625 mm coumaric acid for 1 min followed by exposure to x-ray films. Rat kidneys were homogenized at 4 °C in 250 mm sucrose, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μmbacitracin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris and nuclei. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet, usually referred to as the light mitochondrial fraction, was suspended in 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5. Kidney extracts (0.3 mg of protein/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm ammonium ferrous sulfate, 1 mm ascorbate, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.4 mg/ml catalase, 50,000 dpm of [5-14C]2-OG, 0.1 mmunlabeled 2-OG, and 100 μm of HIF peptide. HIF peptides used were: Pro-402 (DALTLLAPAAGDTIISLDFK) and Pro-564 (LDLEALAPYIPADDDFQLRS), where the bold letters indicate Pro-402 and Pro-564. They corresponded to sequences 395–413 and 557–576 of human HIF-1α. Methionine residues were converted to alanines to avoid spurious oxidation events. At the end of the reaction, the radioactivity associated to succinate was determined as described previously (14Baader E. Tschank G. Baringhaus K.H. Burghard H. Gunzler V. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The basal, peptide-independent, enzymatic activity was determined in each experiment. It represented less than 50% of total activity and was subtracted from all counts. The 222-bp DNA fragment (nucleotides 1616–1837) of human HIF-1α (pcDNA3-HIF-1α) was PCR-amplified with the forward 5′-GGAATTCAAGTTGGAATTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGGAATACTGTAACTGT-3′ set of primers. The P564A mutant was generated following three rounds of PCR amplification. (i) The 1616–1741 fragment was PCR-amplified with the forward 5′-GGAATTCAAGTTGGAATTGG-3′ and the reverse 5′-GTCATCATCCATTGGGATATAGGCAGCTAACATCTCCAAGTCTAA-3′ set of primers. (ii) The 1697–1837 fragment was amplified with the forward 5′-TTAGACTTGGAGATGTTAGCTGCCTATATCCCAATGGATGATGAC-3′ and the reverse 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGGAATACTGTAACTGT-3′ set of primers. (iii) The final PCR amplification was initiated in the presence of an equimolar ratio of the two PCR-purified products and followed by the addition of the forward 5′-GGAATTCAAGTTGGAATTGG-3′ and the reverse 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGGAATACTGTAACTGT-3′ primers. The ODD and the P564A ODD fragments were purified, digested with EcoRI andXhoI, and ligated into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate N-terminal GST-tagged fusion protein. Both plasmids were authenticated by DNA sequencing. The constructs (pGEX-GST·ODD and pGEX-GST-P564A) were transformed into Escherichia coliBL21(DE3), grown at 37 °C in LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min and pelleted. Cells were sonicated on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the clarified sonicates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. After four washes in PBS, the GST-tagged fusion proteins were eluted in 50 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione (pH 8). The integrity and yield of purified GST fusion proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Glutathione-purified GST·ODD and GST·ODD P564A fusion proteins were in vitro hydroxylated using a kidney homogenate prepared as described above. The reaction products were incubated at 4 °C in 200 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 120 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with glutathione-Sepharose beads and 50,000 dpm of 35S-labeled human vHL. After 2 h of incubation time, beads were washed three times with cold buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The bound proteins were eluted in SDS running buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. [35S]vHL was synthesized by using pcDNA3.1/V5-His-vHL as a template (a gift of Dr. S. L. McKnight) and the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). HRE-mediated transcriptional activation was analyzed using the pHRE4-Luc construct. The kinetics of transcriptional activation reveals that luciferase expression reached a 4-fold increase after 16 h of hypoxia (data not shown). Fig.1A shows that hypoxia-induced luciferase expression was inhibited by CsA in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, CsA did not alter reporter gene expression under normoxic conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that HIF-1α is rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway under normoxic conditions (15Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Activation of HIF-1α to a functional form requires protein stabilization. Expression of HIF-1α was analyzed using Western blots. Fig.1B shows that a 4-h hypoxia induced a large accumulation of endogenous HIF-1α protein. Stabilization of HIF-1α was also observed under hypoxia in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. CsA prevented most of the hypoxia-induced HIF-1α stabilization, but in contrast, it was inactive in proteasomally blocked hypoxic cells. These data thus indicated that the inhibitory action of CsA requires a functional proteasomal machinery. The ODD domain of HIF-1α is responsible for the proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α in normoxic cells. It has been located to the amino acid residues 401–603 of human HIF-1α. This region overlaps with a vHL binding domain (526–641) (16Sutter C.H. Laughner E. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4748-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and comprises two essential proline residues (Pro-402 and Pro-564) that are hydroxylated by PHDs under normoxic conditions (4Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar, 5Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M.

Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism of ODD-dependent protein stabilization, we generated chimeric proteins in which the C-terminal part of the ODD region of human HIF-1α (residues 530–603) was fused to the GFP or luciferase open reading frames (Fig. 2A). Stable transfectants expressing either ODD·GFP or control GFP were prepared. Expression of both proteins was analyzed by Western blots using an anti-GFP antibody. As expected, the antibody recognized a 27-kDa protein in GFP-expressing cells and a larger, 35–40-kDa, protein in ODD·GFP-expressing cells (Fig.3A).Figure 3Hypoxia stabilizes ODD·GFP and ODD-Luciferase fusion proteins. As shown in A, hypoxia stabilizes ODD·GFP but not GFP. ODD·GFP and GFP cells were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Whole cell extracts (20 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-GFP (top) or anti α-tubulin (bottom) antibodies. B, time course of ODD-induced protein stabilization. Cells were transfected with a pSV40-ODD-Luc reporter plasmid. 24 h after transfection, cells were exposed to 2% O2 (closed circles) or maintained at 21% O2 (open circles) for the time period indicated. Results show normalized luciferase activities (Means ± S.E.,n = 6) and are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GFP is well known to be highly stable in mammalian cells with an estimated half-life of 24 h. Addition of an ODD domain to GFP was expected to destabilize the protein. The stability of ODD·GFP was determined after blocking protein synthesis with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Fig. 2, B and C, shows that ODD·GFP was degraded with a half-life of about 6 h. The expression of the control GFP reporter was hardly affected after 8 h of exposure to cycloheximide. These results first confirmed the stability of GFP. They also indicated that the ODD sequence destabilized the GFP protein under normoxic conditions. We next exposed the cells to hypoxia. Fig. 3A shows that hypoxia increased the expression of ODD·GFP but not that of GFP. The time course of hypoxia-induced protein expression is analyzed in Fig.3B by using an ODD-luciferase reporter assay. Expression of luciferase reached a maximum after 4–6 h of hypoxia. An identical result was obtained with an ODD·GFP reporter or endogenous HIF-1α. Fig. 4A shows that CsA inhibited hypoxia-induced ODD·GFP protein stabilization. The dose-response curve for the action of CsA is shown in Fig.4B. CsA did not decrease expression of GFP (Fig.4C). Thus, CsA required the presence of an ODD domain to be active. Note that the extent of the inhibitory effects of CsA on hypoxia-induced ODD·GFP fusion protein stabilization was comparable with those of HRE-mediated reporter gene transcription (Fig.1B) and of hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein expression (Fig.2B). All together, these observations indicated that CsA prevented the ODD-dependent stabilization of HIF-1α in hypoxic cells. The oxygen-dependent destabilization of HIF-1α is governed by a novel family of PHDs that specifically modify HIF-1α at two conserved proline residues (Pro-402 and Pro-564) located in the ODD domain of HIF-1α. One hypothesis for the previous results could be that CsA increased activity of PHDs. We therefore developed an assay for PHDs. Prolyl hydroxylations are mediated by 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases (18Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J.

Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar) and can be followed by measuring the conversion of [5-14C]2-OG into [14C]succinate. Experiments were performed in the absence or presence of a HIF peptide that reproduced the 557–576 sequence of the ODD domain and that included Pro-564. Experiments were first performed with extracts from normoxic cultured cells. We observed a degradation of 2-OG by cell extracts, but this activity was not stimulated by the HIF peptide (data not shown). It represents undefined enzymatic activities that are unrelated to PHDs. The absence of peptide-stimulated activity does not mean that PHDs were not present. It could be that the specific activity of 2-OG was too low to detect low levels of activity. We then prepared homogenates from rat tissues and detected a large, peptide-dependent activity in whole kidney homogenates. The homogenate was fractionated by differential centrifugations. Activity was recovered in a light mitochondrial fraction. The peptide-dependent activity did not require Fe(II) or ascorbate. It required 2-OG. The dose-response curve for 2-OG-induced activation of the enzyme is presented in Fig.5A. Half-maximal activation was observed at 0.3 mm 2-OG. We also noticed that the peptide-independent enzymatic activity was more sensitive to 2-OG. As a consequence, large concentrations of 2-OG (0.3–1 mm) provide a better signal-to-noise ratio and should be used to monitor activity with precision. Fig. 5B documents the influence of different concentrations of the Pro-564 peptide on the enzymatic activity. It also shows that CsA increased the degradation of 2-OG. CsA did not modify the basal, peptide-independent activity. The stimulating action of CsA was dose-dependent (Fig. 5C). Two other immunosuppressive drugs, FK506 and rapamycin, were inactive (data not shown). We then performed experiments to demonstrate that 2-OG degradation was indeed associated to hydroxylation of Pro-564 by substituting the Pro-564 residue by a 4-hydroxyproline residue. This peptide was largely devoided of activity. We generated GST·ODD and GST·ODD P564A fusion proteins. GST·ODD promoted degradation of 2-OG to the same extent as the Pro-564 peptide (data not shown). The reaction products were probed with [35S]vHL. Fig. 5D shows that (i) degradation of 2-OG was accompanied by an increased [35S]vHL binding to ODD·GFP; (ii) CsA increased [35S]vHL binding, as expected if it had stimulated PHD activity; and (iii) [35S]vHL did not bind to GST·ODD P564A. Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that CsA inhibited hypoxic responses by promoting hydroxylation of Pro-564 in the ODD domain. Another substrate for PHDs is Pro-402. It is located in the N-terminal part of the ODD domain. The ODD domain used in the previous experiments comprised the 530–603 sequence of HIF-1α and did not include Pro-402. We therefore synthesized a peptide that mimicked the 395–413 sequence of HIF-1α and contains the Pro-402 residue. This peptide stimulated the degradation of 2-OG to the same extent as the Pro-564 peptide. Although we did not demonstrate hydroxylation of Pro-402, it would indicate that a light mitochondrial kidney fraction supported hydroxylations of both Pro-564 and Pro-402 peptides. Yet the Pro-402-dependent 2-OG degradation was insensitive to CsA. All together, our data suggest that CsA specifically promoted hydroxylation of Pro-564. Finally we tested poly(l-Pro-Gly-l-Pro), a well known substrate of procollagen prolyl hydroxylase(s). It was inactive in this assay. The previous results indicated that CsA increases in vitro PHD activity when experiments were performed at ambient oxygen tensions. An obvious hypothesis for the inhibitory action of CsA on ODD-dependent protein stabilization is that CsA also increased PHD activity under conditions of reduced oxygen supply. To test this hypothesis, the ODD·GFP fusion protein was immunoprecipitated from normoxic or hypoxic cell extracts, and the bound, endogenous vHL was detected by Western blots using an anti-vHL antibody. Fig. 5E shows that hypoxia-stabilized ODD·GFP did not bind to vHL as expected since it was not hydroxylated. Addition of CsA destabilized ODD·GFP and increased vHL association. This is a direct demonstration that CsA promoted hydroxylation of ODD·GFP by activating Pro-564 PHD under hypoxic in vivo conditions. The mechanism by which hypoxia induces gene transcription involves the inhibition of HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylase activity, which prevents vHL-dependent targeting of HIF-1α to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HIF-1α is stabilized, associates with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, and interacts with HRE to promote the activation of target genes (see the Introduction). This study demonstrates that CsA inhibits the hypoxic signaling pathway by activating Pro-564 hydroxylation. (i) CsA prevents HRE-dependent gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. (ii) CsA blocks hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein accumulation, and this blockade is overcome by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. (iii) CsA inhibits hypoxia-induced stabilization of an ODD·GFP chimeric protein, indicating that its action requires the C-terminal part of ODD. This sequence comprises the Pro-564 residue that is hydroxylated by PHDs and that is recognized by vHL (4Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin W.G.

(iv) CsA increases a kidney PHD activity that selectively hydroxylates Pro-564 in the ODD domain. (v) Finally, we present experimental evidence that CsA increases PHD activity in hypoxic cells. Inhibitors of PHDs have been developed (20Ivan M. Haberberger T. Gervasi D.C. Michelson K.S. Gunzler V. Kondo K. Yang H. Sorokina I. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Kaelin W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13459-13464Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) to promote hypoxic responses. CsA is the first known activator of a PHD activity. The major consequence of this stimulating action is an inhibition of hypoxic responses. This report also describes an assay for PHDs. It was based on the capacity of peptides to stimulate the degradation of labeled 2-OG. Results indicated the presence in kidney extracts of enzymatic activities that were stimulated by Pro-402 and Pro-564 peptides. Both activities were enriched in light mitochondrial fractions and required exogenous 2-OG. They did not require Fe(II) or ascorbate, probably because cofactors were tightly bound to the enzymes. Based on our results, we cannot conclude that different PHDs mediate Pro-402 and Pro-564 hydroxylations. The same enzyme could mediate both reactions; however, only Pro-564 hydroxylation is activated by CsA. Four different PHDs are now identified (18Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J.

Comm. 2002; 296: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The identity of the enzyme(s) present in our light mitochondrial kidney fractions is not known. However, it is of interest to note that SM-20 contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence (22Lipscomb E.A. Sarmiere P.D. Freeman R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5085-5092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and that the newly described PHD-4 isoform is highly expressed in kidney tissues and associates to light microsomes (21Oehme F. Ellinghaus P. Kolkhof P. Smith T.J. Ramakrishnan S. Hütter J. Schramm M. Flamme I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 296: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). CsA is a well known immunosuppressive drug that binds to cyclophilins, a family of ubiquitous and conserved proteins with peptidyl-prolylcis-trans isomerase and molecular chaperone activities (23Fischer G. Tradler T. Zarnt T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,24Gothel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). We now show, for the first time, that CsA specifically stimulates Pro-564 hydroxylation. A hypothesis could be that hydroxylation of Pro-564 requires a specific configuration of the proline residue and that a cyclophilin controls in some way the presentation of the peptide to the enzyme. This hypothesis is unlikely, however, since CsA should not be active in hypoxic cells in which PHD activity is limited by oxygen availability. Indeed, in agreement with this observation, we were unable to show by immunoprecipitation experiments, using whole cell and kidney protein extracts, a direct interaction of cyclophilins (Cyp A and Cyp 40) with ODD substrates (GST·ODD, ODD·GFP, or endogenous HIF-1α). Another hypothesis could be that a cyclophilin associates to one PHD and controls its oxygen sensitivity. This hypothesis would agree with the recent evidence suggesting the existence of more than one oxygen sensor (18Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Rapamycin and FK506 recognize and bind to another class of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, termed FK-binding proteins (FKBP). Rapamycin, like CsA, inhibits cellular responses to hypoxic stresses by destabilizing the ODD domain of HIF-1α (25Hudson C.C. Liu M. Chiang G.G. Otterness D.M. Loomis D.C. Kaper F. Giaccia A.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7004-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Yet the molecular mechanisms involved are different. CsA promotes hydroxylation of the Pro-564 peptides. Rapamycin and FK506 do not. Hudson et al.(25Hudson C.C. Liu M. Chiang G.G. Otterness D.M. Loomis D.C. Kaper F. Giaccia A.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7004-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) further provided evidence that rapamycin acts via mammalian target of rapamycin, a downstream target of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. All together, these findings further support the idea that HIF-1α protein stabilization can be achieved by PHD-dependent and -independent mechanisms (26Chan D.A. Sutphin P.D. Denko N.C. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40112-40117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). CsA induces renal and systemic vasoconstrictions that are consecutive to changes in the production of vasoactive substances, such as endothelin-1 and nitric oxide. This study shows that CsA prevents HRE-mediated hypoxic adaptation. It is important to note that such a mechanism would exacerbate the toxicity of hypoxia that results from the vasoconstriction and may well contribute to the severity of hypoxic nephropathies. It is of interest to note that FK506, which is less nephrotoxic than CsA, does not promote PHD activity in kidney microsomes. In conclusion, this report shows that CsA increases peptidyl-prolyl hydroxylase activity in kidney extracts and hypoxic cells. By this mechanism, CsA abrogates hypoxic stabilization of HIF-1α and HIF-1α-mediated cellular responses in glioma cells. CsA can thus be considered as an oxygen sensitizer that limits adaptative responses to hypoxia. We are grateful to Dr. S. L. McKnight for the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-vHL vector, to Dr. P. J.

With the yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that the cytoplasmic domain of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), a type II integral membrane protein, interacts with the cytoplasmic region of BACE. In cultured cells, BACE and PLSCR1 were colocalized in the Golgi area and in endosomal compartments, whereas they were co-redistributed in late endosome-derived multivesicular bodies when treated with U18666A, suggesting that both proteins share a common trafficking pathway in cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that both proteins form a protein complex at an endogenous expression level in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Ycells, and the dileucine residue of the BACE tail is also revealed to be essential for the physical interaction with PLSCR1 in vitro andin vivo. Moreover, both BACE and PLSCR1 were localized in a low buoyant lipid microdomain in SH-SY5Y cells. The dileucine-defective BACE mutant was also fractionated into the lipid microdomain, but much less stably than wild-type BACE. Taken together, our current study suggests the functional involvement of PLSCR1 in the intracellular distribution of BACE and/or recruitment of BACE into the detergent-insoluble lipid raft. β-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme (BACE) is an integral membrane aspartic proteinase responsible for β-site processing of APP, and its cytoplasmic region composed of 24 amino acid residues has been shown to be involved in the endosomal localization of BACE.

Caveolae in the plasma membrane constitute a microdomain that has a unique lipid composition with a high content of both cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. In the brain, the caveolae-like microdomain has been referred to as a detergent-insoluble glycolipid membrane complex (DIG) (18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8019) Google Scholar). Brain-derived DIG, or so-called lipid raft, has been reported to accumulate APP (19Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. Rougon G.

Moreover, BACE has also been shown to be localized in the lipid microdomain in cultured cells in a cholesterol-dependent manner (21Riddell D.R. Christie G. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Curr.

Therefore, DIGs represent putative sites where amyloid biogenesis or transport takes place, and cholesterol metabolism is strongly assumed to be associated with the APP processing events.The present study showed that the cytoplasmic tail of BACE binds directly to phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), another component of the plasma membrane lipid microdomain (22Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The interaction required a dileucine repeat in BACE (Leu499,500), which was required for the endocytic transport of BACE (14Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol.

Coprecipitation experiments also showed that BACE forms a protein complex with PLSCR1 in SH-SY5Y cells, a neuroblastoma cell line. We also demonstrated that BACE and PLSCR1 are fractionated in the DIGs at an endogenous expression level in SH-SY5Y cells. These findings strongly suggest that PLSCR1 is a binding partner of BACE in vivo and provide a functional implication of PLSCR1 in the intracellular trafficking of BACE.

In turn, subcellular targeting, protein-protein interactions, or post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may shape RGS activity and specificity. We found previously that RGS16 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation on conserved tyrosine residues in the RGS box. Phosphorylation on Tyr168 was mediated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We show here that endogenous RGS16 is phosphorylated after epidermal growth factor stimulation of MCF-7 cells. In addition, p60-Src or Lyn kinase phosphorylated recombinant RGS16 in vitro, and RGS16 underwent phosphorylation in the presence of constitutively active Src (Y529F) in EGFR− CHO-K1 cells. Blockade of endogenous Src activity by selective inhibitors attenuated RGS16 phosphorylation induced by pervanadate or receptor stimulation. Furthermore, the rate of RGS16 degradation was reduced in cells expressing active Src or treated with pervanadate or a G protein-coupled receptor ligand (CXCL12). Induction of RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation was associated with increased RGS16 protein levels and enhanced GAP activity in cell membranes.

Kadowaki S. Haga T. Takaesu H. Mitaku S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), mediate extracellular signals that control such diverse processes as sensation, cognition, cell growth and proliferation, cell migration, and hormone secretion. GPCRs signal through a common element, the heterotrimeric G protein, whose α subunit undergoes agonist-evoked GTP binding and dissociation from its tonic repressor, βγ. Each G protein component elicits diverse outcomes including increased enzyme activity or concentration, gene transcription, or cellular movement. The intrinsic GTPase activity of the α subunit allows re-formation of an αβγ trimeric complex, terminating signaling. Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, which are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Gα subunits, may down-regulate G protein signaling cascades (2DeVries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar); however, their physiological roles have only begun to be elucidated. Some pathological conditions have been linked to abnormal RGS expression, suggesting that pharmaceutical modulation of RGS activity may impact the treatment of diseases associated with abnormal GPCR output (4Mittman C. Chug C.H. Hoeppner G. Michalek C. Nose M. Schueler C. Schuh A. Eschenhagen T. Weil J. Peiske B. Hirt S. Wieland T. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 55: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). How specific RGS proteins modify discrete GPCRs or G proteins remains an unclear but intensely studied question (5Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it is of vital importance to understand how individual RGS proteins are regulated. One means by which RGS proteins may be modified is phosphorylation (6–17). Sst2 undergoes signal-dependent phosphorylation by MAP kinase, which slows Sst2 degradation (6Garrison T.R. Zhang Y. Pausch M. Apanovitch D. Aebersold R. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36387-36391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins interact with phosphorylated RGS7, which reduces RGS7 GAP activity (7Benzing T. Kottgen M. Johnson M. Schermer B. Zentgraf H. Walz G. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32954-32962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C phosphorylates RGS2 on a serine residue in the RGS box, resulting in decreased GAP activity toward Gαq (8Cunningham M.L. Waldo G.L. Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5438-5444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). By contrast, ERK2 phosphorylation of RGS-Gα-interacting protein enhances GAP activity toward Gαi3 (9Fischer T. Elenko E. Wan L. Thomas G. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RGS16 is phosphorylated on Ser194 after epinephrine stimulation of cells expressing the α2A-adrenergic receptor (11Chen C. Wang H. Fong C.W. Lin S.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutation of this serine residue impairs RGS16 GAP activity and its regulation of epinephrine-stimulated MAP kinase activation. In addition to direct effects on RGS enzymatic activity, Ser phosphorylation may alter intracellular localization of certain RGS proteins. Protein kinase A phosphorylates RGS10, and mutation of the protein kinase A target Ser residue prevents RGS10 translocation from the plasma membrane and cytosol to the nucleus (12Burgon P.G. Lee W.L.

Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22287-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RGS proteins also contain conserved tyrosine residues in the RGS box that appear to affect their function. Phosphorylation of the RGS domain-containing protein PDZ-RhoGEF by focal adhesion kinase enhances Rho activation after stimulation of Gα12/13-coupled GPCRs (15Chikumi H. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12463-12473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We reported previously that RGS16 undergoes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation on a conserved tyrosine residue in the RGS box, Tyr168, which enhances RGS16 GAP activity in single turnover assays (16Derrien A. Druey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48532-48538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, when cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity is inhibited by pervanadate, RGS16 lacking Tyr168 is also phosphorylated, indicating that Tyr177 (the only other tyrosine residue in RGS16) is a possible site of phosphorylation. Moreover, although mutation of Tyr177 does not affect RGS16 GAP activity in vitro, the mutant protein is unable to modulate Gi-coupled adenylyl cyclase inhibition or Gq-coupled MAP kinase activation in cells. These results suggest that phosphorylation of this residue is of critical importance to the biological activity of RGS16. In this study we investigated further mechanisms of RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation and their possible effects on RGS16 function. We found that RGS16 was a substrate for Src family kinases in vitroand in mammalian cells. Src-mediated RGS16 phosphorylation did not affect RGS16 intracellular localization or GAP activity, but instead appeared to slow RGS16 protein degradation. Moreover, sustained phosphorylation correlated with an expanded pool of RGS16 and increased GAP activity in cell membranes. These results demonstrate that RGS16 function is modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in mammalian cells, suggesting a novel form of feedback regulation of G protein signaling by tyrosine kinases. ATP, sodium orthovanadate, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), doxorubicin, EGF, and carbachol were purchased from Sigma. PP2, PP3, and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 were obtained from Calbiochem. Pervanadate consisted of a mixture of 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 10 mmH2O2. HEK 293T and CHO-K1 cells were maintained in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 20 ng/ml gentamicin, in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. BaF3 cells stably expressing mouse HA-RGS16, the gift of Cheryl Miller (Millennium Pharmaceuticals), were grown in RPMI + 10% fetal bovine serum and interleukin-3 (10 ng/ml, PeproTech). For transfections, 2 × 106 cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected with appropriate plasmids for 18 h using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) or for 5 h using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After removal of the DNA mixture, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium until harvest 24–48 h after transfection. Plasmids encoding pcDNA3-HA-RGS16 (human) (the kind gift of Drs. Carol Beadling and Kendall Smith (Cornell University Medical College)), pcDNA3.1-RGS16-V5/His, and tyrosine mutants thereof have been described previously (16Derrien A. Druey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48532-48538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as have plasmids encoding His6RGS16, His6RGS2, and the purification of recombinant RGS proteins from Escherichia coli. The plasmid pUSEamp-Src (Y529F) (constitutively active) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., as were the recombinant kinases Src, Lyn, Csk, and Abl. In some kinase assays, Src or Btk kinases purified from Sf9 cells were used, as described elsewhere (17Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.-Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding the m2 muscarinic receptor was the gift of J. Silvio Gutkind (NICDR, National Institutes of Health). After stimulation, we rinsed cells twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before lysis in buffer P, containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a Complete tablet of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). We immunoprecipitated equal protein amounts (500–600 μg) with either rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (2 μg ml−1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or polyclonal anti-RGS16 (CT265, raised against mouse His6RGS16, the gift of Melvin I. Simon and Ching-Kang Chen, California Technical Institute (18Chen C.K. Wieland T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12885-12889Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)). Antigen-antibody complexes were recovered using sheep anti-rabbit IgG magnetic beads (Dynal) or protein A-agarose (Invitrogen). Cells transfected with RGS16-V5/His were lysed in buffer P-Ni (20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 15 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4). We extracted RGS16 from lysates with a 30-μl slurry of Probond resin (Invitrogen). We washed beads three times prior to addition of Laemmli buffer and SDS-PAGE. Antibodies against phospho-ERK, ERK1, 5-HT1A receptor, and HA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-V5 from Invitrogen, and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The antibody raised against His6RGS4 has been described previously (19Sullivan B. Harrison-Lavoie K.J. Marshansky V. Lin H.Y. Kehrl J.H. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Druey K.M. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16768-16774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Signal was detected with SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). BaF3 cells were stimulated with CXCL12 (50 ng/ml, R & D Systems) for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G + M (IgG + IgM) (Fab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) essentially as described (21Lanier L. Corliss B. Wu J. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We determined RGS phosphorylation by incubating 10–25 pmol of His6RGS16 for 1 h at 30 °C with recombinant Lyn, Csk, or Abl kinases (1 μl) in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 μm cold ATP, and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 30 Ci mmol−1, Amersham Biosciences). For some reactions containing c-Src or Btk kinase, His6RGS16 or His6RGS2 (200 ng) was incubated in 40 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 5 μm ATP) containing 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci mmol−1) for 1 h at 30 °C. Reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried prior to autoradiography. The RGS16 band was excised and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was calculated based on the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP and RGS16 concentration determined by Bradford assay. Protease digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C (500 ng, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was carried out after phosphorylation in 30 μl of incubation buffer (25 mmTris, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 37 °C. His-tagged RGS16 was phosphorylated as described for 1 h before affinity purification by nickel-agarose chromatography. Beads were washed twice in detergent-containing buffer P-Ni and once in protease incubation buffer before the addition of protease. Digests were separated on 16% Tricine gels and run alongside Mark 12 protein ladders (Invitrogen). We performed single turnover GTPase assays by loading recombinant, myristoylated Gαi1(Calbiochem) with [γ-32P]GTP (1 μm, 50–100 cpm fmol−1) at 30 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% C12E10 (buffer C). The reaction was chilled on ice before gel filtration on a G-25 Sepharose column that was equilibrated with buffer C plus bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg ml−1). GTP hydrolysis was initiated by adding G protein to a tube containing unlabeled GTP (100 μm) and MgSO4 (10 mm) with or without RGS. Aliquots were removed at various time points from 10 s prior to the start of the reaction (arbitrarily set as time 0) to 5 min and quenched in a chilled, activated charcoal/phosphoric acid slurry. Inorganic phosphate in supernatants was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry after centrifugation at 1500 × g. Net release of Pi was determined by subtracting the amount at time 0. BaF3/RGS16 cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were washed once in methionine-free RPMI (Biofluids) and then incubated for an additional 30 min in this medium to deplete intracellular methionine pools. [35S]Methionine (Amersham Biosciences, >1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) was added at a final concentration of 150 μCi/ml for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then pelleted, washed in chase medium (serum-free RPMI supplemented with cold methionine (Sigma, 15 mg/liter)), and incubated at 37 °C in chase medium for the indicated times in the presence or absence of the appropriate agonist or inhibitor. Cells were lysed in buffer P and immunoprecipitated with either anti-RGS16 antibodies or HA-coupled agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and exposed to autoradiography at −70 °C. Generation of HEK 293 cells stably expressing a 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor (5-HT1A)/Gαo1 fusion protein have been described previously (22Kellett E. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 684-692PubMed Google Scholar). 30 h post-transfection, cells were treated overnight with pertussis toxin (PTX, 50 ng/ml, Calbiochem) to eliminate endogenous Gαi/o activity. The next day, cells were scraped and harvested in Tris-buffered saline and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold Tris-HCl/EDTA (TE), pH 7.4, and homogenized with 30–50 passages through a Dounce homogenizer followed by 15 passages through a 25-gauge needle. Unbroken cells and debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the membrane fraction. Membranes were resuspended in TE buffer to ∼2 mg/ml and stored as aliquots at −80 °C. Steady-state GTPase activity was determined in membranes expressing the fusion protein. Membrane preparations (10 μg of total protein) were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of 5-HT in an ATP-regenerating buffer system (20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 unit/μl creatine kinase, 200 μm AMP-PNP, 500 μm ATP, 1 μm GTP, 2 mm ouabain (all from Sigma), 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 80 mm Tris, pH 7.5), spiked with 50,000 cpm [γ-32P]GTP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol), and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of ice-cold 10% (w/v) activated charcoal in 50 mm phosphoric acid followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing free [γ-32P]phosphate were analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific GTPase activity was determined in simultaneous reactions containing 100 mm GTP. Immunoblots and autoradiographs were quantitated using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Our previous studies demonstrated EGF-mediated RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation in transfected cells. To explore RGS16 phosphorylation further, we first investigated whether endogenous RGS16 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. Rgs16 was discovered as a target of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and shown to be up-regulated by genotoxic stress in these cells (23Buckbinder L. Velasco-Miguel S. Chen Y. Xu N. Talbott R. Gelbert L. Gao J. Seizinger B.R. Gutkind J.S. Kley N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7868-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). By using specific anti-RGS16 antibodies to immunoblot MCF-7 cell lysates, we identified a single band of the predicted molecular weight of RGS16 (23 kDa) (Fig.1 A, top). The intensity of the band increased after treatment of the cells with doxorubicin, suggesting an increase in RGS16 protein expression similar to the rise in RNA levels observed in the previous study (23Buckbinder L. Velasco-Miguel S. Chen Y. Xu N. Talbott R. Gelbert L. Gao J. Seizinger B.R. Gutkind J.S. Kley N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7868-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To confirm the identity of this band as RGS16, we immunoprecipitated MCF-7 cell lysates or recombinant RGS16 with anti-RGS16 antibodies or anti-RGS4 as a control. Immunoprecipitates were then immunodetected with the same anti-RGS16 antibody used for immunoprecipitation. We visualized the 23-kDa band only in anti-RGS16 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 A,bottom). Finally, to determine whether endogenous RGS16 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation, we treated the cells with either medium alone or EGF, and we immunoblotted cell lysates with either anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1 B, top) or anti-RGS16 (Fig. 1 B, bottom). RGS16 was not phosphorylated under basal conditions but was significantly phosphorylated after EGF treatment. These results suggest that RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in response to a physiological stimulus in MCF-7 cells. To determine which, if any, additional kinase(s) mediate RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation, we tested the capacity of purified RGS16 to act as a substrate for various kinases in vitro. We incubated RGS2 or RGS16 with recombinant kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and measured ATP incorporation into the protein by autoradiography. RGS16 was phosphorylated by recombinant p60-Src and Lyn but not by Btk or Abl kinases, and RGS2 was not phosphorylated by either Src or Btk kinase (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, purified Csk kinase was able to phosphorylate RGS16in vitro; however, this phenomenon was not explored further. We determined the stoichiometry of phosphorylation by measuring counts/min of the RGS16 band excised from gels divided by the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP. Based on this measurement, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was 0.6 ± 0.1 mol of phosphate per mol of RGS16 (mean ± S.E. of 5 independent experiments), suggesting that Src phosphorylated RGS16 at a single site in vitro. We next determined whether Src plays a role in RGS16 phosphorylation in mammalian cells. This hypothesis is difficult to test directly in cells that express both Src and EGFR because EGFR stimulates Src kinase activity (24Sato K. Nagao T. Kakumoto M. Kimoto M. Otsuki T. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Owada K. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29568-29576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and in turn Src enhances EGFR activity (25Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Rel. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). To minimize a possible effect of EGFR kinase, we examined RGS16 phosphorylation in CHO-K1 cells, which do not express functional EGFR but do express a closely related EGFR family member ErbB2 (26Egan J.E. Hall A.B. Yatsula B.A. Dafna B.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6041-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Chausovsky A. Waterman H. Elbaum M. Yarden Y. Geiger B. Bershadsky A.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 878-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether these cells respond to EGF, we measured MAP kinase activation after EGF or carbachol stimulation in cells transfected with m2R by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK and ERK1 antibodies. Similar to previous studies, EGF treatment of CHO-K1 cells did not induce ERK activation, whereas increased ERK activity was observed after carbachol treatment (28Krug A. Schuster C. Gassner B. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Troppmair J. Gekle M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45892-45897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). To evaluate RGS16 phosphorylation in the presence of Src activation, we expressed HA-RGS16 with control or constitutively active Src (Y529F) plasmids, and we assessed RGS16 phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA and detection with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. RGS16 underwent pronounced tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of active Src (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether endogenous Src kinase(s) in CHO-K1 cells mediated RGS16 phosphorylation, we expressed RGS16-V5/His and treated cells with pervanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases. We affinity-purified recombinant His-tagged proteins with Ni2+/nitriloacetic acid-coupled agarose and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-V5. There were no tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins in affinity precipitations from vector-transfected or RGS16-transfected cells without pervanadate stimulation. In contrast, we observed strong RGS16 phosphorylation in pervanadate-treated cells, which was blocked by the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 3 C). This result indicates that pervanadate-induced RGS16 phosphorylation in CHO-K1 cells is attributable to activity of endogenous Src kinase(s). We have shown previously (16Derrien A. Druey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48532-48538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that GPCR stimulation (m2R) induces RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation. To examine whether Src plays a role in GPCR-induced RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation, we utilized BaF3 B-lymphoblastoid cells lacking endogenous RGS16 that stably overexpress HA-RGS16. We stimulated cells with CXCL12, which activates endogenous CXCR4 chemokine receptors coupled to Gαi. Activation of Gαi is associated with increased Src activity (17Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.-Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We immunoprecipitated RGS16 using anti-RGS16 antibodies and immunodetected with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-HA. Treatment with the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 induced RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation, which was blocked by PP2 (Fig.4 A). To test whether Src-dependent RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation could occur independently of GPCR stimulation, we stimulated BaF3/RGS16 cells with anti-IgM + IgG to cross-link the B-cell receptor, which activates the endogenous Src family kinase Lyn (21Lanier L. Corliss B. Wu J. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In these cells, we observed robust RGS16 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to Ig receptor cross-linking that was attenuated by PP2 but not by its inactive homologue PP3 (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that Src family kinases are required for RGS16 phosphorylation in response to either B-cell receptor cross-linking or stimulation of CXCR4 receptors in BaF3 cells. To determine which residue might be phosphorylated by Src, we incubated purified Src and ATP with recombinant WT RGS16 or mutants and detected phosphorylation by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. We observed Src-induced phosphorylation of RGS16 WT and reduced phosphorylation of Y168F but no phosphorylation of Y177F or the double mutant. These results suggest that Src-mediated phosphorylation requires both residues (Fig.5 A). However, we hypothesize that the diminished phosphorylation of the Y168F mutant may be because of altered protein folding or conformation, as this mutation reduces GAP activity of the recombinant protein in vitro, independently of phosphorylation (16Derrien A. Druey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48532-48538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To map the phosphorylation site in the WT protein, we digested phosphorylated RGS16 with endoproteinase Lys-C (EndoLys-C). This protease cleaves at the C terminus of lysine residues, and RGS16 contains 15 potential cleavage sites. Of the tyrosine-containing peptides, EndoLys-C is predicted to generate a C-terminal fragment consisting of residues 174–202 (containing Tyr177) plus an additional 13 linker residues contained in the plasmid used to generate recombinant RGS16. Together, this polypeptide has an expected mass of 4.2 kDa. After incubation with Src kinase plus [γ-32P]ATP, we affinity-purified His-RGS16 WT or Y177F by nickel chromatography before digestion with EndoLys-C. We visualized a radioactive band at ∼4 kDa in reactions containing RGS16 WT but not Y177F (Fig. 5 B). There was also a radioactive band at ∼10 kDa, which we hypothesize to be a partial digestion product. Coomassie Blue staining demonstrated a similar cleavage pattern for both RGS16 WT and Y177F (Fig. 5 C), indicating that the C-terminal peptide was not phosphorylated in the Y177F mutant. This result suggests Src phosphorylates native RGS16 at residue Tyr177 in vitro. To determine the site of phosphorylation of RGS16 in cells, we expressed HA-RGS16 WT or mutants with active Src (Y529F) in CHO-K1 cells. We immunoprecipitated RGS16 with anti-HA and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-HA to confirm equal RGS16 levels. Whereas phosphorylation of RGS16 (Y168F) was similar to WT, the level of phosphorylation of RGS16 (Y177F) was reduced by at least 50% (Fig.5 D), and Y168/Y177F was not phosphorylated (data not shown). Collectively, although these experiments suggest that Tyr177 may be the site of Src-mediated RGS16 phosphorylation, it also appears that Tyr168 is phosphorylated in the presence of constitutively active Src in vivo. As mentioned above, Tyr168 phosphorylation could be an indirect consequence of Src activation, which is discussed below. In a previous study, we found that EGFR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of RGS16 increased its GAP activity on Gαi in single turnover assays. To determine whether Src-mediated RGS16 phosphorylation also affected its catalytic activity, we phosphorylated RGS16 with Src prior to measuring GTP hydrolysis by Gαi1. However, we observed no difference in the GAP activity of RGS16 in the pre"

Apo-CaM increases RyR1 channel activity, but Ca2+-CaM is inhibitory. Here we examine the functional effects of CaM oxidation on RyR1 regulation by both apo-CaM and Ca2+-CaM, as assessed via determinations of [3H]ryanodine and [35S]CaM binding to skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. Oxidation of all nine CaM Met residues abolished functional interactions of CaM with RyR1. Incomplete CaM oxidation, affecting 5–8 Met residues, increased the CaM concentration required to modulate RyR1, having a greater effect on the apo-CaM species. Mutating individual CaM Met residues to Gln demonstrated that Met-109 was required for apo-CaM activation of RyR1 but not for Ca2+-CaM inhibition of the channel. Furthermore, substitution of Gln for Met-124 increased the apo- and Ca2+-CaM concentrations required to regulate RyR1. These results thus identify Met residues critical for the productive association of CaM with RyR1 channels and suggest that oxidation of CaM may contribute to altered regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release during oxidative stress.

The homotetrameric RyR1 is the largest known ion channel having a molecular mass of more than 2,000 kDa (1Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The N-terminal two-thirds of the channel forms a large cytoplasmic domain to which numerous signaling proteins are anchored, including the FK506 binding protein and calmodulin (CaM) (2Marks A.R. Marx S.O. Reiken S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In vitro, the channel is activated by Ca2+ in the nm to μm range and inactivated by μm-mm Ca2+. CaM binding to the channel enhances the sensitivity to both Ca2+ activation and inactivation. The 148-amino acid Ca2+-binding protein, CaM, is composed of N-terminal and C-terminal globular domains connected by a flexible, central tether. CaM has an unusually high Met content, indeed 9 of the 148 amino acids are Met residues, resulting in an ∼6-fold higher Met content than the average protein (4O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In vertebrate CaM these Met residues are clustered primarily in the N (residues 36, 51, 71, and 72) and the C (residues 109, 124, 144, and 145) termini. A 9th Met is located in the tether at residue 76. High affinity Ca2+binding to EF-hand motifs in each of the globular domains induces a structural rearrangement that reveals the Met-rich hydrophobic patches (5Zhang M. Yuan T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These hydrophobic patches mediate Ca2+-CaM interaction with a large and diverse group of proteins that share little sequence homology (6Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). A less appreciated aspect of CaM regulation is the ability of Ca2+-free CaM (apo-CaM) to regulate certain targets (7Jurado L.A. Cockingham S.P. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 70: 661-682Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, the role of Met residues in apo-CaM interaction with targets is not clear. Although the high Met content of CaM contributes to effective target binding, the Met residues in the Ca2+-bound form of CaM are surface-exposed and susceptible to oxidation. Oxidation converts Met to Met sulfoxide, a physiologically relevant product (8Brot N. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Indeed, Met sulfoxide-containing CaM has been isolated from the brains of aged animals (9Michaelis M.L. Bigelow D.J. Schoneich C. Williams T.D. Ramonda L. Yin D. Huhmer A.F. Yao Y. Gao J. Squier T.C. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The present study examines the functional effects of CaM oxidation on the regulation of RyR1. To identify which of the individual Met residues are important for the functional interaction of CaM with RyR1, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change each of the nine CaM Met residues to Gln, introducing an oxygen atom at the same position in the side chain as the sulfoxide. Our results define CaM Met residues that are critical for the functional interaction between CaM and RyR1 and suggest that CaM oxidation may contribute to altered regulation of SR Ca2+ release during oxidative stress. Pigs were obtained from the University of Minnesota Experimental Farm. Tran35S-labeled Met and Cys were obtained from ICN Radiochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). [3H]Ryanodine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled ryanodine was obtained from Calbiochem. High performance liquid chromatography grade acetonitrile was purchased from Fisher Scientific. C4 ZipTips were from Millipore (Burlington, MA). RPMI 1640 medium was from ICN. Spectrophotometric grade trifluoroacetic acid, AMPPCP, and other reagents were from Sigma. Skeletal muscle SR vesicles were prepared from porcine longissimus dorsi muscle (10Mickelson J.R. Litterer L.A. Jacobson A. Louis C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Muscle was homogenized in 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 6.8, and centrifuged for 30 min at 2,600 ×g. The supernatant was filtered through gauze and centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g. Pelleted membranes were extracted in 1.1 m KCl, 5 mmTris, pH 6.8, centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 45 min, and then resuspended in 0.3 m sucrose, 0.4 mKCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, buffer. SR was then centrifuged through a discontinuous sucrose gradient (22, 36, and 45% sucrose) at 130,000 × g for 5 h, and the heavy SR fraction was collected from the 36 and 45% sucrose interface. Heavy SR vesicles were resuspended in 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. All buffers contained a protease inhibitor mixture (100 nm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Ryanodine selectively binds to the open RyR and therefore provides a useful indicator of channel activity (11Tanna B. Welch W. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SR vesicles (0.2 mg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 120 mm potassium propionate, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 3 mm AMPPCP, 100 nm [3H]ryanodine, and a Ca-EGTA buffer set to give the desired free Ca2+ concentration (12Brooks S.J.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). After 90 min, SR vesicles were collected on Whatman GF/B filters and washed with 8 ml of ice-cold 100 mm KCl buffer. Estimates of maximal [3H]ryanodine binding capacity of each SR vesicle preparation were determined in medium that in addition contained 500 mm KCl, 6 mm ATP, and 100 μmCa2+. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 20 μm nonradioactive ryanodine. [3H]Ryanodine binding is expressed as a percent of maximal [3H]ryanodine binding. RyR1 is the major CaM-binding protein in heavy SR (13Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar,14Yang H.C. Reedy M.M. Burke C.L. Strasburg G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), thus SR vesicle [35S]CaM binding reflects primarily RyR1 CaM binding. [35S]CaM binding to SR vesicles was performed as described by Balshaw et al. (15Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yanaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). SR vesicles were incubated in 150 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm GSH, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 nm [35S]CaM, and 0-5000 nmunlabeled CaM for 2 h at 24 °C. Pellets were collected after centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman TLA-55 rotor at 20 °C, solubilized by overnight incubation in 10% SDS, and resuspended in 200 μl of double distilled H2O. Bound [35S]CaM was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined using 100-fold excess unlabeled CaM. [35S]CaM binding is expressed asB/B 0, where B is the [35S]CaM bound in the presence of unlabeled CaM, andB 0 is the [35S]CaM bound in the absence of unlabeled CaM. Because the thioether group of Met is not protonated at low pH, it can be oxidized selectively under acidic conditions (8Brot N. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). 60 μm calmodulin was incubated in 50 mmHomopipes, pH 5.0, 0.1 m KCl, 2.0 mmMgCl2, 50 mm H2O2 at room temperature for 0.5–24 h. The reaction was stopped by overnight dialysis (molecular mass cutoff = 3,500) at 4 °C in distilled water (5 × 1 liter) buffered with 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.7. Recombinant rat CaM was expressed in Escherichia coliusing the pET-7 vector (16Wang S. George S.E. Davis J.P. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14539-14544Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), purified via phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (17Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 29: 830-836Crossref Scopus (718) Google Scholar), and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. CaM concentration was determined with the Micro BCA assay (Pierce) using wild-type CaM as a standard. The concentration of the CaM standard was determined using the published molar extinction coefficient, ε277–320 nm = 3,029m−1 cm−1 (18Strasburg G.M. Hogan M. Birmachu W. Thomas D.D. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 542-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamine was substituted for each of the Met residues (residues 36, 51, 71, 72, 76, 109, 124, 144, and 145) using QuikChange mutagenesis kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). DNA sequence analysis confirmed the correct generation of each mutant. The biosynthesis of 35S-labeled CaM was carried out essentially as described previously for [35S]FKBP12 (19Xin H.B. Rogers K. Qi Y. Kanematsu T. Fleisher S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15315-15319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial growth was initiated in M9 medium containing ampicillin. When the A 600 value of the bacteria reached 0.6 the pelleted bacteria were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing ampicillin, 1/40th of the Met and Cys concentration compared with the regular RPMI 1640 medium, and isopropy-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. A 1.4-mCi aliquot of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine was then added to the medium and the bacteria cultured for 5–7 h at the same conditions. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed at the University of Minnesota Mass Spectrometry Consortium for the Life Sciences using a Bruker Biflex III mass spectrometer (Bruker, Boston, MA) equipped with a N2 laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse length) and a microchannel plate detector. Data were collected in the linear mode, positive polarity, with an accelerating potential of 19 kV. Each spectrum was the accumulation of ∼200 laser shots. External calibration was performed using horse heart cytochrome c and horse skeletal muscle myoglobin. The matrix used for samples and standards was a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50:50, acetonitrile:nanopure water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Prior to MALDI-TOF analysis samples were desalted using Millipore's C4 ZipTips according to the manufacturer's protocol. The Ca2+-induced increase in tyrosine fluorescence intensity is thought to reflect a reduced quenching in Ca2+-bound CaM and has been used to monitor Ca2+ binding to the C terminus of CaM (20Klevit R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 82-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Pedigo S. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10676-10689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Spectra were collected at 25 °C using an ISS K2 fluorometer in ratio mode. The 3 μm CaM samples were excited at 275 nm using a xenon lamp, and corrected emission spectra were acquired from 280 to 400 nm in 1-nm increments. Excitation and emission bandwidths were 8 nm. Ca2+ titrations were performed by the addition of small aliquots of concentrated CaCl2 to the sample in the apo buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES, 1.0 mm EGTA, pH 7.0). A matching buffer scan was subtracted from each spectrum. The fluorescence readings, at 305 nm, for each titration were normalized to the high and low end points before nonlinear least squares analysis. CD spectra were recorded from 250 to 200 nm with a JASCO J-710 spectrophotometer coupled with a data processor. Spectra were recorded digitally and fed through the data processor for signal averaging and base line subtraction. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a CaM concentration of 150 μm in a solution of 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and either 500 μmNa2 EGTA or CaCl2 using quartz cuvettes with a path length of 1.0 mm. Spectra were recorded with a scan speed of 20 nm/min, signal-averaged six times, and an equally signal-averaged solvent base line was subtracted. CaMs were analyzed under denaturing conditions using SDS-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 30 min in sample buffer containing either 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA before loading onto 15% gel. No Ca2+ or EGTA was added to the gel or running buffer. The CaM concentration dependence of SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding and the inhibition of [35S]CaM binding by unlabeled CaM were fit with the Hill equation. The Ca2+ dependence of ryanodine binding was fit with Equation 1, which assumes a high affinity Ca2+ binding site, which when bound will activate the RyR and a lower affinity Ca2+ binding site which when bound will inhibit channel opening, B=Bmax×([Ca2+]na/([Ca2+]na +EC50na))×(1−[Ca2+]ni/([Ca2+]ni+IC50ni))Equation 1 where B is the ryanodine bound,B max is the maximal ryanodine binding, EC50 and IC50 are the half-activating and half-inhibiting Ca2+ concentrations, respectively, andna and ni are the Hill coefficients for activation and inhibition, respectively. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. [3H]Ryanodine and [3S]CaM binding curves in the presence and absence of CaM and CaM mutants were studied using a one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparison as apost hoc test or by Student's paired and unpairedt tests as appropriate. The level of significance was <0.05. As shown previously (14Yang H.C. Reedy M.M. Burke C.L. Strasburg G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), apo-CaM activated and Ca2+-CaM inhibited RyR1. Thus, in a medium containing 100 nmCa2+, CaM enhanced skeletal muscle SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding (EC50 = 54 ± 4 nm, n H = 1.3 ± 0.2), and in a medium containing 700 μm Ca2+, CaM decreased SR vesicle ryanodine binding (IC50 = 46 ± 15 nm, n H = 1.4 ± 0.1). The oxidation of CaM by incubation in 50 mmH2O2 for 24 h abolished apo- and Ca2+-CaM regulation of SR vesicle ryanodine binding (Fig.1, A and B). In addition, after incubation with 50 mmH2O2 for 24 h CaM was no longer able to inhibit [35S]CaM binding to SR vesicles in a medium containing either 100 nm or 700 μmCa2+ (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, the inability of oxidized CaM to modulate SR vesicle ryanodine binding was caused by the loss of CaM binding to SR vesicles. By comparison, partial oxidation of CaM by incubation in 50 mmH2O2 for 30 min did not fully abolish CaM modulation of ryanodine binding; however, both the half-activating (EC50 > 1000 nm) and half-inhibiting (IC50 = 104 ± 8, n H = 1.3 ± 0.2) CaM concentrations were increased (Fig. 1, A andB), with a larger effect occurring at 100 nmCa2+. These results suggest that the oxidation of critical CaM Met residues alters the productive association of CaM with the RyR1. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed to determine the extent of oxidative modification of CaM incubated with 50 mmH2O2 for either 30 min or 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2, the mass spectrum of native CaM displayed a single peak corresponding to a mass of 16,711 Da, which corresponds, within the measurement error, to the theoretical mass of unmodified CaM (16706.39 Da). Thus, the native CaM used in these experiments consisted of a single population of unmodified CaM. In contrast, the mass spectrum of CaM after incubation in 50 mm H2O2 for 30 min displayed four peaks corresponding to masses of 16,783, 16,798, 16,815, and 16,830 Da. Oxidation of Met to Met sulfoxide increased the mass by 16 Da. Consequently, this partially oxidized CaM was composed of multiple populations of CaM oxiforms with 5, 6, 7, or 8 Met residues oxidized to their corresponding sulfoxide. CaM incubated in 50 mmH2O2 for 24 h displayed a single peak corresponding to a mass of 16,861 Da. Therefore, incubation of CaM in 50 mm H2O2 for 24 h produced a single population of CaM with all 9 Met residues oxidized to their corresponding Met sulfoxides. To determine the role of specific CaM Met residues in regulating RyR1, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change each CaM Met to Gln. This substitution introduced an oxygen atom at the same position in the side chain as the sulfoxide. The greater polarity of the Gln side chain relative to Met was expected to decrease the hydrophobic interactions that normally stabilize the association of CaM with its target. However, substituting Gln for Met is unlikely to significantly disturb the structure of CaM because both amino acids have a similar propensity to form α-helices (23Chakrabartty A. Baldwin R.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 46: 141-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 and Tables I and II summarize the effects of CaM Met → Gln mutants on the CaM concentration dependence of skeletal muscle SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding in medium containing 100 nm Ca2+ or 700 μmCa2+. In a medium containing 100 nmCa2+, all of the N-terminal Met → Gln mutants and M76Q, in the tether, enhanced SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding. However, the maximal activation by the M71Q mutant exceeded wild-type CaM activation by ∼50%. Although the M72Q CaM mutant enhanced ryanodine binding to an extent similar to that of wild-type CaM, the EC50 was ∼3-fold greater than wild-type. In contrast, the extent and concentration dependence of Ca2+-CaM inhibition by all the N-terminal Met → Gln mutants and M76Q were similar to wild-type CaM.Table ICaM dependence of skeletal muscle SR vesicle [3 H]ryanodine binding in media containing 100 nM Ca2+EC50n H% ActivationnmWild-type65 ± 51.4 ± 0.1468 ± 37M36Q88 ± 221.6 ± 0.3353 ± 57M51Q108 ± 241.7 ± 0.3539 ± 204M71Q83 ± 81.4 ± 0.1715 ± 1421-aSignificantly different from wild-type;p < 0.05.M72Q216 ± 491-aSignificantly different from wild-type;p < 0.05.1.2 ± 0.1446 ± 37M76Q38 ± 11.1 ± 0.1456 ± 100M109Q0 ± 0M124Q1470 ± 3061-aSignificantly different from wild-type;p < 0.05.1.2 ± 0.1543 ± 93M144Q43 ± 61.5 ± 0.1456 ± 107M145Q71 ± 101.1 ± 0.1540 ± 2241-a Significantly different from wild-type;p < 0.05.

Open table in a new tab With the exception of the M109Q CaM mutant, in 100 nmCa2+, all of the C-terminal Met → Gln mutants enhanced ryanodine binding to an extent similar to that of wild-type CaM. Substitution of Gln for Met at position 109 completely abolished apo-CaM activation of RyR1. Replacing Met-124 with Gln increased the apo-CaM EC50 nearly 23-fold compared with wild-type CaM. In a medium containing 700 μm Ca2+, all of the C-terminal Met → Gln mutants, including surprisingly M109Q, inhibited ryanodine binding to an extent similar to that of wild-type CaM. Similar to the effect in 100 nm Ca2+, the M124Q mutation increased the IC50 for Ca2+-CaM inhibition of ryanodine binding. However, the 5-fold increase in the Ca2+-CaM IC50 was much smaller than the 23-fold increase in the apo-CaM EC50 caused by this mutation. The Ca2+ dependence of SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding was examined in the absence and presence of wild-type CaM and selected Met → Gln CaM mutants in medium containing 3 mm AMPPCP and 3 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 4 A and Table III). Similar to previous reports (24Balshaw D.M. Yamaguchi N. Meissner G. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 185: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Hamilton S.L. Serysheva I. Strasburg G.M. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 281-284PubMed Google Scholar), wild-type CaM significantly decreased both the Ca2+ EC50 and IC50. Similarly, the M71Q and M124Q CaM also lowered the Ca2+ EC50and IC50. In contrast, in the presence of the M109Q CaM mutant, the Ca2+ EC50 was significantly lower than in the absence of CaM, but the Ca2+ IC50was not significantly different. However, in the presence of M109Q CaM, the extent of channel activation was less than half that in the absence of CaM, and the shift in the EC50 was caused by the lower extent of activation rather than an enhancement of channel opening at low Ca2+. For example, at 0.1 μmCa2+, wild-type CaM and both the M71Q and M124Q CaM mutants significantly increased SR vesicle ryanodine binding compared with the absence of CaM. In contrast, ryanodine binding in the presence of the M109Q CaM was not significantly different from the binding in the absence of CaM.Table IIICa2+ dependence of skeletal muscle SR vesicle [3 H]ryanodine binding in media containing no CaM or 1 μm CaM3 mm AMPPCP + 3 mmMgCl2%B maxn aEC50n iIC50μmμmNo CaM31 ± 51.4 ± 0.21.86 ± 0.101.7 ± 0.6886 ± 42Wild-type19 ± 31.0 ± 0.11.03 ± 0.173-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.1.0 ± 0.2629 ± 663-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.M71Q17 ± 91.0 ± 0.10.63 ± 0.513-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.0.8 ± 0.5172 ± 643-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.M109Q14 ± 43-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.1.0 ± 0.20.93 ± 0.213-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.1.6 ± 0.1839 ± 139M124Q17 ± 50.8 ± 0.10.79 ± 0.383-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.1.0 ± 0.1591 ± 1313-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.3 mm AMPPCP no Mg%B maxn aEC50n iIC50μmμmNo CaM71 ± 51.0 ± 0.10.70 ± 0.281.0 ± 0.1422 ± 113Wild-type63 ± 50.9 ± 0.10.05 ± 0.013-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.1.2 ± 0.1332 ± 110M71Q73 ± 100.9 ± 0.10.04 ± 0.013-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.1.0 ± 0.1248 ± 79M109Q56 ± 90.7 ± 0.21.58 ± 0.861.3 ± 0.2431 ± 78M124Q68 ± 51.0 ± 0.10.10 ± 0.023-aSignificantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05.1.1 ± 0.1389 ± 1153-a Significantly different from No CaM; p< 0.05. Open table in a new tab To resolve better the effects of the Met → Gln substitutions on apo-CaM function, channel activation was enhanced by performing binding experiments in medium containing 3 mm AMPPCP but no MgCl2 (Fig. 4 B and Table III). Under these conditions, wild-type, M71Q and M124Q CaM clearly enhanced the Ca2+ sensitivity of channel activation while the M109Q CaM did not. To determine whether the Met → Gln mutations affected CaM regulation of RyR1 via changes in the affinity of CaM binding to the RyR or via alterations in CaM regulatory efficacy, we compared inhibition of SR vesicle [35S]CaM binding by wild-type and Met → Gln CaM mutants (Fig.5 and TableIV). Compared with wild-type CaM, greater concentrations of the M124Q CaM mutant were required to inhibit SR vesicle [35S]CaM binding in medium containing either 100 nm or 700 μm Ca2+. Thus, the effects of the M124Q mutation on CaM affinity for RyR1 were similar to the effects of the mutation on SR vesicle [3H]ryanodine binding.Table IVInhibition of [35 S]CaM binding to skeletal muscle SR vesicles by wild-type and met → Gen CaM mutants in media containing either 100 nm or 700 μm Ca2+100 nm Ca2+700 μm Ca2+n HIC50n HIC50nmnmWild-type1.0 ± 0.173 ± 40.9 ± 0.174 ± 5M71Q0.9 ± 0.165 ± 20.8 ± 0.146 ± 9M72Q1.0 ± 0.1110 ± 40.8 ± 0.1301 ± 1244-aSignificantly different from wild-type CaM,p < 0.05.M76Q1.0 ± 0.137 ± 20.8 ± 0.161 ± 2M109Q1.0 ± 0.12304 ± 5324-aSignificantly different from wild-type CaM,p < 0.05.0.7 ± 0.1145 ± 46M124Q0.7 ± 0.1641 ± 1684-aSignificantly different from wild-type CaM,p < 0.05.0.9 ± 0.2321 ± 1294-aSignificantly different from wild-type CaM,p < 0.05.4-a Significantly different from wild-type CaM,p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab At high Ca2+ concentrations, the M109Q CaM mutant inhibited SR vesicle [35S]CaM binding in a manner similar to wild-type CaM. However, in contrast to the inability of the M109Q apo-CaM to enhance SR vesicle ryanodine binding, this mutant inhibited [35S]CaM binding to SR vesicles. This suggests that at low Ca2+, the M109Q apo-CaM mutant does bind to the RyR1, but that binding does not affect channel opening. When CaM is denatured for SDS-PAGE in the presence of Ca2+, the mobility of the protein on SDS-PAGE is increased relative to that seen after denaturation in the presence of EGTA (26Klee C.B. Crouch T.H. Krinks M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1979; 76: 6270-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms underlying the mobility shift are not understood, it is thought to reflect some difference in the ability of SDS to bind and/or denature apo- and Ca2+-CaM (27Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mutation-induced structural changes in the Met → Gln mutant CaMs might be reflected in altered mobility on SDS-PAGE. As can be seen from Fig.6, none of the Met → Gln mutations altered the mobility of CaM in the presence of EGTA. Furthermore, none of the mutations prevented the mobility shift upon the addition of Ca2+. To assess further the potential structural alterations induced by the M109Q and M124Q CaM mutations, the CD spectra arising from these two mutants were compared with the spectra of wild-type CaM. The far UV spectra of wild-type CaM and the M109Q and M124Q mutant CaMs were not significantly different, either in the presence of 500 μmEGTA (Fig. 7 A) or in the presence of 500 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 7 B). Thus the Met → Gln mutations did not cause major changes in the secondary structure of CaM. To determine whether the M109Q or M124Q mutation altered the CaM Ca2+ affinity we determined the Ca2+ dependence of the change in intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence (20Klevit R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 82-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Pedigo S. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10676-10689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The apparent Ca2+ affinities of wild-type CaM, M109Q CaM, and M124Q CaM did not significantly differ (K Ca: wild-type CaM, 2.5 ± 0.3 μm; M109Q CaM, 1.5 ± 0.4 μm; M124Q CaM, 2.0 ± 0.3 μm). The unusually high CaM Met content (9 of 148 residues) is thought to allow CaM to associate with and regulate a large number of structurally diverse proteins. Here we defined the role of specific CaM Met residues in the regulation of RyR1. Oxidation of all 9 CaM Met residues to their corresponding sulfoxide abolished both apo- and Ca2+-CaM binding and modulation of RyR1. In comparison, incomplete oxidation, i.e. oxidation of 5–8 CaM Met residues, did not alter the extent of either apo-CaM activation or Ca2+-CaM inhibition, but rather increased the CaM concentration required for these effects. Thus it appears that the presence of 4 unoxidized Met residues is sufficient for the full extent of CaM regulation of RyR1 but not to provide CaM with the normal high affinity for RyR1. It is not clear, however, whether the ability of the incompletely oxidized CaM to regulate RyR1 fully was the result of the preservation of specific, vital Met residues or a critical Met surface area. Apo-CaM function appeared to be more sensitive to Met modification than Ca2+-CaM function. Incomplete oxidation caused a larger increase in apo-CaM EC50 than in Ca2+-CaM IC50. The differential effect of oxidation on the function of apo- and Ca2+-CaM was also reflected in the differing effects of some of the Met → Gln mutants. Thus, the M124Q mutation increased the apo-CaM EC50 by more than 20-fold but increased the Ca2+-CaM IC50 by only 5-fold. Even more dramatic were the effects of the M109Q mutant on apo-CaMversus Ca2+-CaM function. This single Met → Gln substitution completely abolished activation of RyR1 but did not alter Ca2+-CaM inhibition of the channel. Met-109 and Met-124 were necessary for the high affinity interaction of CaM with RyR1. Yuan et al. (28Yuan T. Ouyang H. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8411-8420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) found that in solution, the N-terminal Met residues in apo-CaM are largely buried, whereas the C-terminal Met residues are more exposed. They suggest that these C-terminal Met residues may play a role in the binding of apo-CaM to targets. Thus, in apo-CaM, Met-109 and Met-124 may be available to interact with RyR1. Consequently, a mutation in either of these residues significantly affects the functional interaction of apo-CaM with RyR1. Upon Ca2+ binding to CaM, there is an increased Met exposure (5Zhang M. Yuan T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, replacement of an individual Met is less deleterious to Ca2+-CaM than to apo-CaM function. The M109Q mutation could potentially abolish apo-CaM activation of RyR1 via three mechanisms. The mutation could disrupt the structure of CaM to such an extent that the mutant apo-CaM could not functionally interact with the channel. In agreement with Chin and Means (29Chin D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30465-30471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-induced mobility shifts on an SDS gel by M109Q CaM and wild-type CaM were similar. In addition the mutant could be purified via phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. Thus M109Q CaM preserved sufficient hydrophobic surface to be retained by the phenyl-Sepharose column and underwent a Ca2+-induced structural rearrangement similar to wild-type CaM. Finally, the CD spectra of the M109Q and M124Q CaM mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type CaM in the absence of Ca2+ and, also in agreement with Chin and Means (29Chin D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30465-30471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), in the presence of Ca2+. Thus we were unable to detect any substantial structural modification in these mutants. Alternatively, the M109Q mutation could increase the Ca2+affinity of the CaM such that a substantial fraction of the mutant CaM would exist as inhibitory Ca2+-CaM in medium containing 100 nm Ca2+. However, the Ca2+dependence of the change in intrinsic fluorescence did not differ between wild-type CaM and either M109Q or M124Q CaM. Finally, a Met residue might be required in position 109 to make specific interactions with RyR1. All of the Met → Gln mutants interacted, although with varying affinity, with RyR1. The initial nonspecific association of CaM with targets is thought to be followed by more precise interactions between specific residues (30Kranz J.K. Flynn P.F. Fuentes E.J. Wand A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2599-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In low Ca2+, M109Q CaM associated with RyR1, albeit with a low affinity, but did not activate the channel. Therefore, it is likely apo-CaM activation of RyR1 requires a specific interaction between Met-109 and the channel. Met → Gln substitutions have been used previously to define the Met residues required for Ca2+-CaM activation of a number of CaM-dependent protein kinases (29Chin D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30465-30471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Chin D. Winkler K.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31235-31240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (32Yin D. Sun H. Weaver R.F. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13654-13660Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although there was variability in the Met residues required for normal enzyme regulation, substitution of Gln for Met-124 decreased the affinity of CaM for all of these targets. The M124Q mutation also decreased the maximal CaM-dependent kinase activation but not CaM activation of the Ca2+ pump. Whereas apo- and Ca2+-bound M124Q CaM fully regulated RyR1, the substitution decreased the affinity of CaM for the channel. Thus, Met-124 appears to be an important determinant of the CaM affinity for all of these targets; however, its importance in determining CaM regulatory efficacy is target-dependent. CaM is functionally bifurcated (29Chin D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30465-30471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), thus the N and C termini of CaM may serve different roles in both apo- and Ca2+-CaM regulation of RyR1. The effects of Met → Gln mutations clearly demonstrate the importance of the C-terminal lobe Met-109 and Met-124 in apo-CaM activation of RyR1. In addition, M124Q was the only substitution that significantly altered the interaction of Ca2+-CaM with RyR1. Rodney et al. (34Rodney G.G. Krol J. Williams B. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12430-12435Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) proposed a model of RyR1 regulation by CaM in which Ca2+ binding to the CaM C-terminal pair of EF-hands mediates the conversion of CaM from an activator of RyR1 to an inhibitor. The requirement of Met-109 for apo-CaM activation of RyR1 but not for Ca2+-CaM inhibition of the channel suggests that a critical component of the Ca2+-induced structural change converting CaM from an activator to an inhibitor entails altering the interaction between CaM Met-109 and RyR1. In summary, oxidation of all 9 CaM Met residues abolished the functional interaction between CaM and RyR1. Incomplete oxidation decreased CaM affinity for RyR1 but not the extent of channel regulation. Site-specific substitution of Met with Gln at residue 109 abolished apo-CaM activation of RyR1 without altering Ca2+-CaM inhibition of the channel. Substitution of Met-124 with Gln decreased the affinity of both apo- and Ca2+-CaM for RyR1. Thus these results identify Met residues critical for the productive interaction of CaM for RyR1 and suggest that oxidation of CaM may contribute to RyR1 dysfunction during oxidative stress.

The protein transferred a Gal to the -β-Xyl residue, confirming it to be the Drosophilaortholog of human proteoglycan β4GalTI (hβ4GalTI). After that, we produced an inducible dβ4GalTI RNAi fly using the GAL4-UAS system as a first step toward clarifying the biological role of dβ4GalTI. The dβ4GalTImRNA was reduced specifically by RNAi, and the severity of the phenotype showed the correlation with the reduction indβ4GalTI mRNA. The death of the flies proved that dβ4GalTI is essential for viability. This is the first example of the use of reverse genetics to study Drosophilaglycosyltransferase systematically. The Drosophila expressed sequence tag clone CK02622 was obtained from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). UDP-Gal, p-nitrophenyl-α-xylopyranoside (Xylα-pNph), Xylβ-pNph,o-nitrophenyl-β-xylopyranoside (Xylβ-oNph),p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-1-thio-β-glucosaminide (GlcNAcβ-S-pNph),p-nitrophenyl-α-glucopyranoside (Glcα-pNph), Glcβ-pNph,p-nitrophenyl-α-galactopyranoside (Galα-pNph), Galβ-pNph,p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-α-galactosaminide (GalNAcα-pNph), and GalNAcβ-pNph were purchased from Sigma. The GlcNAcα-pNph, GlcNAcβ-pNph, andp-nitrophenyl-α-mannopyranoside (Manα-pNph) were purchased from Calbiochem. Galβ1,4Xylβ1-p-methoxyphenyl (Galβ1,4Xylβ1-pMph) was provided by Seikagaku Corp. Uridine diphosphate-[14C]galactose (UDP-[14C]Gal) (325 mCi/mmol) was supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. We performed a BLAST search of allDrosophila databases and identified oneDrosophila proteoglycan β1,4-galactosyltransferase I gene,CG11780. The Drosophila expressed sequence tag clone CK02622 including CG11780 was obtained. The plasmid DNA was prepared from CK02622 and sequenced using an ABI PRISM BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (ABI, Foster City, CA). The putative catalytic domain of dβ4GalTI (amino acids 36–322) was expressed as a secreted protein fused with a FLAG peptide in insect cells according to the instruction manual of GATEWAY™ Cloning Technology (Invitrogen). An ∼0.9-kb DNA fragment was amplified by two-step PCR. The first PCR used the plasmid DNA from expressed sequence tag clone CK02622 as a template, the forward primer 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTGTGCCCGCTGTCCAATCCGCTG-3′, and the reverse primer 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTACCCATCAGGTTTGTACCGC-3′. The second PCR used the first PCR product as a template, the forward primer 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGT-3′. The forward and reverse primers were flanked with attB1 and attB2 sequences, respectively, to create the recombination sites. The amplified fragment was recombined between the attP1 and attP2 sites of the pDONRTM201 vector using the BP CLONASE Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). Then the insert was transferred between theattR1 and attR2 sites of pVL1393-FLAG to yield pVL1393-FLAG-dβ4GalTI. pVL1393-FLAG is an expression vector derived from pVL1393 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and contains a fragment encoding the signal peptide of human immunoglobulin κ (MHFQVQIFSFLLISASVIMSRG), the FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK), and a conversion site for the GATEWAY system. pVL1393-FLAG-hβ4GalTI was also prepared by the same procedure using the two primers, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTGGGCAGTCAGGGGACAAG-3′ and 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTCACTGTCCAT- CCAGCTCA-3′. pVL1393-FLAG-dβ4GalTI and pVL1393-FLAG-hβ4GalTI were cotransfected with BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) intoSf21 insect cells according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated for 3 days at 27 °C to produce recombinant viruses. Sf21 cells were infected with each recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and incubated for 72 h to yield conditioned media containing recombinant β4GalTI proteins fused with FLAG peptide. A 5-ml volume of culture medium was mixed with 100 μl of anti-FLAG M1 AFFINITY GEL (Sigma). The protein-gel mixture was washed twice with 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mmCaCl2 and eluted with 100 μl of 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in 10 mm Tris-buffered saline (Sigma). The enzymes purified above were subjected to 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot analysis. The separated proteins were transferred to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was probed with anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and stained with Konica Immunostaining HRP-1000 (Konica, Tokyo, Japan). The intensity of positive bands on Western blotting was measured by densitometer to determine the amount of the purified enzyme using FLAG-BAP Control Protein (Sigma). To determine the galactosyltransferase activity, Xylα-pNph, Xylβ-pNph, Xylβ-oNph, GlcNAcα-pNph, GlcNAcβ-pNph, GlcNAcβ-S-pNph, Glcα-pNph, Glcβ-pNph, Galα-pNph, Galβ-pNph, GalNAcα-pNph, GalNAcβ-pNph, Manα-pNph, and Galβ1,4Xylβ1-pMph were utilized as acceptor substrates. With 10 nmol of each acceptor, the β4GalT activity reaction was performed at both 25 and 37 °C for 2 h in 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 14 mmHepes buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton X-100, 11 mmMnCl2, 3 μm UDP-[14C]Gal (325 mCi/mmol), 250 μm UDP-Gal, and 1.15 and 0.44 pmol of purified dβ4GalTI and hβ4GalTI, respectively. The enzyme reaction was terminated by the addition of 400 μl of water. After centrifugation of the reaction mixture, the supernatant was applied to a Sep-PakC18 column (Millipore Corp.) equilibrated with water. The unreacted UDP-Gal was washed out with water, and the products were eluted with methanol. The eluates were dried with an N2evaporator and dissolved in 30 μl of methanol. Then 10 μl of the product was applied to an HPTLC plate (Merck) and developed in chloroform/methanol/0.2% CaCl2 (55:45:10). The bands of reaction products incorporating radioactivity were detected with a BAS2000 Imaging Analyzer system (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). A cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal region (nucleotide 685–969 of coding sequence) or the amino-terminal (N-terminal) region (nucleotide 1 to 506 of coding sequence) of dβ4GalTI was amplified by PCR and inserted as an inverted repeat (IR) in a modified Bluescript vector, pSC1, which possesses an IR formation site consisting of paired CpoI and SfiI restriction sites. In all cases, the IR was in a head-to-head orientation. IR-containing fragments were cut out by NotI and subcloned into pUAST, a transformation vector. The cloning procedures will be described elsewhere. 2R. Ueda and K. Saigo, manuscript in preparation. The transformation of Drosophila embryos was carried out according to Spradling (22Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 175-197Google Scholar) with w 1118 mutant stock as a host to make 23 UAS-dβ4GalTI-IR fly lines. Then we made one line, N13, which has two copies of the IR, by crossing two lines, N2 and N4, in which the IR was on different chromosomes. Each line was mated with the Act5C-GAL4 fly line, and F1 progeny was raised at 28 °C to observe phenotypes. Total RNA was extracted fromAct5C-GAL4/UAS-dβ4GalTI-IR andAct5C-GAL4/+ third instar larvae and prepupae by the methods of Chomczynski and Sacchi (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63082) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from total RNA usingOligotex TM -dT30<super> (Takara Bio Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized in 50 μl of a reaction mixture containing 300 ng of mRNA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18, 0.5 mm each dNTP, 40 units of RNasin, and 50 units of Superscript II RT (Invitrogen). After incubation at 50 °C for 50 min, the reaction was terminated by heating at 70 °C for 15 min, followed by rapid chilling on ice. Competitive RT-PCR ofdβ4GalTI was carried out for the region except for the sequences using the IR construction for RNAi. The gene-specific primers used for amplification of dβ4GalTI,dβ4GalTA, dβ4GalTB, and ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32) genes are listed in Table I. The sense and antisense primers for construction of the DNA competitor were prepared by flanking the sequence for amplification of λDNA at the 3′ terminus of each sense and antisense primer for amplification of the target cDNA. The DNA competitors were generated using reagents supplied in the Competitive DNA construction kit (Takara Bio Inc.). Competitive RT-PCRs were performed using 1 μl of the first-strand cDNA mixture with a serial dilution of DNA competitor in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing a 0.2 μm concentration of each of the relevant primers (listed in TableI), 0.2 mm each dNTP, and 2.5 units of TaKaRa Ex Taq. To normalize the efficiency of cDNA preparation among individual samples, measurement ofRpL32 mRNA in each cDNA (0.5 μl) was carried out using the same competitive RT-PCR method as fordβ4GalTI mRNA. Amplifications involved 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s.

Open table in a new tab When human hβ4GalTI was used as the query sequence for a TBLASTN search of the BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project, one highly homologous gene,CG11780, was obtained as dβ4GalTI. The complete cDNA of the dβ4GalTI gene and the predicted amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1 A. The putative protein, consisting of 323 amino acids, was a type II transmembrane protein with a hydrophobic domain in the N-terminal region (Fig. 1 B). When the other members of the human β1,4-galactosyltransferase family, hβ4GalT1 to -6, were used as query sequences for the TBLASTN search, two highly homologous genes, CG8536 andCG14517, were also obtained as members of theDrosophila β1,4-galactosyltransferase family,dβ4GalTA and dβ4GalTB, respectively. dβ4GalTA and dβ4GalTB showed much lower homology of amino acids to hβ4GalTI (33 and 29%, respectively) than dβ4GalTI to hβ4GalTI (48%). The ClustalW alignment of the human and Drosophila β4GalT families showed that the three β4GalT motifs found in the human family, including the DXD motif, a metal binding site, were also conserved in the Drosophila β4GalT family (Fig.2 A) (24Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 25Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree of the three Drosophila (dβ4GalTI, dβ4GalTA, and dβ4GalTB) and seven human β4GalTs (hβ4GalT1 to -6 and hβ4GalTI) was generated based on the amino acid sequences (Fig. 2 B). dβ4GalTI was confirmed to be the Drosophila ortholog of hβ4GalTI. Both dβ4GalTA and d4βGalTB showed higher homology to hβ4GalT1 to -6 than hβ4GalTI. The FLAG-tagged recombinant dβ4GalTI was expressed in insect cells to determine whether or not dβ4GalTI has galactosyltransferase activity. The soluble form was prepared by replacing the N-terminal region including the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, amino acids 1–35, with an Igκ signal sequence and FLAG peptide sequence. The secreted enzyme was purified with anti-FLAG M1 gel and quantitated by Western blotting analysis using Anti-FLAG anti-body. FLAG-tagged recombinant hβ4GalTI was also prepared by the same procedure. The purified enzymes were used for a galactosyltransferase assay with various acceptor substrates (Table II). The determined amounts of dβ4GalTI and hβ4GalTI and the same amount of each substrate were used for the enzyme reactions, so we could determine relative activities that were comparable. hβ4GalTI had strong activity toward the -β-Xyl residue, whereas it had only slight activity toward -α-Xyl and no activity toward -β-GlcNAc, -β-Glc, -β-Gal, and -β-GalNAc as reported previously (6Okajima T.

These results demonstrated that dβ4GalTI was the Drosophila ortholog of hβ4GalTI in view of their activities. But the β4GalT activity of dβ4GalTI toward the -β-Xyl residue was almost half that of hβ4GalTI at both 25 and 37 °C.Table IIAcceptor substrate specificities of purified recombinant dβ4GalTI and hβ4GalTI expressed in the baculovirus systemAcceptor substrateEnzyme activitydβ4GalTIhβ4GalTI25 °C37 °C25 °C37 °Cnmol/nmol protein/minXylα-pNph0.170.220.390.49Xylβ-pNph4.47.97.88.5Xylβ-pNph6.313.115.127.6GlcNAcα-pNphND2-aND, not detected.NDNDNDGlcNAcβ-pNphNDNDNDNDGlcNAcβ-S-pNphNDNDNDNDGlcα-pNphNDNDNDNDGlcβ-pNphNDNDNDNDGalα-pNphNDNDNDNDGalβ-pNphNDNDNDNDGalNacα-pNphNDNDNDNDGalNacβ-pNphNDNDNDNDManα-pNphNDNDNDNDGalβ1,4Xylβ1-pMphNDNDNDND2-a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab Proteoglycan β4GalTI contributes to the synthesis of the common carbohydrate-protein linkage structure, GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ1-O-Ser, of proteoglycan including heparin/HS and CS/DS. If proteoglycan β4GalTI is inactivated, every proteoglycan lacks GAG, and a severe biological phenotype is expected. To test this hypothesis, we tried to make inducible dβ4GalTI RNAi flies according to the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” A scheme of the heritable and inducible RNAi system is shown in Fig.3. In this report, we usedAct5C-GAL4 as a GAL4 driver to inducedβ4GalTI gene silencing in all cells of the fly. The Act5C-GAL4 fly has a transgene containing yeast transcriptional factor GAL4, the expression of which is under the control of the cytoplasmic actin promoter. 24UAS-dβ4GalTI-IR fly stocks having a transgene containing two types of the IR of dβ4GalTIligated to the UAS promoter, a target of GAL4, were established (TableIII). The IR ofdβ4GalTI was separated by an unrelated DNA sequence that acts as a spacer to give a hairpin loop-shaped RNA. C-1 to C-11 have a transgene containing the IR of the sequence encoding the C-terminal region of the catalytic domain (amino acids 209–322). N-1 to N-13 have a transgene containing the IR of the sequence encoding the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–167). In the F1 generations of the Act5C-GAL4 fly and theUAS-dβ4GalTI-IR fly, dsRNA ofdβ4GalTI is expressed ubiquitously under the control of the cytoplasmic actin promoter to inducedβ4GalTI gene silencing.Table IIIViability of inducible dβ4GalTI RNAi flyUAS-dβ4GalTI-IR flyF1 progeny ofUAS-dβ4GalTI-IR fly crossed with Act5C-GAL4fly3-aIn F1, dsRNA of dβ4GalTI is expressed ubiquitously under the control of the cytoplasmic actin promotor.Stock no.Insertion chromosomeC13+3-b+, viable and morphologically normal.C22LethalC33+C42LethalC52LethalC63LethalC73+C83LethalC93+C102+C113+N13LethalN22LethalN32SemilethalN43LethalN52LethalN63+N72LethalN83LethalN93LethalN102LethalN112+N123LethalN133-cThe N13 line, which has two copies of the IR, was made by crossing N2 stock with N4 stock.2, 3Lethal3-a In F1, dsRNA of dβ4GalTI is expressed ubiquitously under the control of the cytoplasmic actin promotor.3-b +, viable and morphologically normal.3-c The N13 line, which has two copies of the IR, was made by crossing N2 stock with N4 stock. Open table in a new tab The phenotypes of the F1 of eachUAS-dβ4GalTI-IR fly crossed with theAct5C-GAL4 fly are shown in Table III; 65% (15 of 23) of these crosses caused lethality in the progeny (i.e. the flies could not develop into adults). The expression ofdβ4GalTI dsRNA by crossing the N13 line carrying two copies of UAS-dβ4GalTI-IR to theAct5C-GAL4 fly also led to lethality at the pupal stages. These results clearly demonstrated that proteoglycan β4GalTI is essential for the viability of flies. To test the efficiency and specificity of RNAi in this system, the mRNA levels of allDrosophila β4GalTs(dβ4GalTI, dβ4GalTA, and dβ4GalTB) were determined in eachdβ4GalTI RNAi fly by competitive RT-PCR (Fig.4). The relative amount of each β4GalT mRNA to RpL32 mRNA in F1 progeny of w 1118 crossed with theAct5C-GAL4 fly, Actin5C-GAL4/+, which corresponds to the wild type, was presented as 1. The F1 progeny of each N or C line of the UAS-dβ4GalTI-IR fly crossed with Act5C-GAL4 fly was designated asAct5C-GAL4/N orAct5C-GAL4/C, respectively. N lines have a transgene including the IR of the sequence encoding the N-terminal region of dβ4GalTI. N13 having two copies of the IR on chromosomes 2 and 3 was made from the N2 and N4 lines. The degree of expression of the transgene is known to depend on its sites of insertion on the chromosome. Act5C-GAL4/N2,Act5C-GAL4/N4, andAct5C-GAL4/N13 were pupal lethal, whereasAct5C-GAL4/N6 was viable and morphologically normal (Table III). First, we determined the amounts of the three kinds of dβ4GalTs mRNA in the third instar larvae of these four RNAi flies and the wild-type fly,Act5C-GAL4/+. The ratios of reduction indβ4GalTI mRNA ofAct5C-GAL4/N13,Act5C-GAL4/N4,Act5C-GAL4/N2, andAct5C-GAL4/N6 were 0.26, 0.32, 0.36, and 0.76, respectively, demonstrating a correlation with the severity of the phenotype (Fig. 4 A). F1 progeny of the N13 line having two copies of the IR had less dβ4GalTImRNA than those of the N2 line and N4 line, which were crossed to make the N13 line. Reductions in dβ4GalTAmRNA and dβ4GalTB mRNA were not observed in all RNAi flies. It was clearly demonstrated that thedβ4GalTI mRNA was disrupted specifically, and the ratio of degraded dβ4GalTI mRNA was well correlated with the severity of the phenotype. Similar analyses were performed for the F1 progeny of C lines crossed with Act5C-GAL4 fly,Act5C-GAL4/C5, andAct5C-GAL4/C6. Both RNAi flies showed lethality at the pupal stages (Table III). The dβ4GalTImRNAs in the third instar larvae were also interfered with specifically, and the ratios of degradeddβ4GalTI mRNA ofAct5C-GAL4/C5 andAct5C-GAL4/C6 (0.35 and 0.45, respectively) were almost the same as those of Act5C-GAL4/N2 andAct5C-GAL4/N4 (Fig. 4 B). The efficiency of RNAi did not depend greatly on the target sequences using the constructions of IR. We also determined the amount of dβ4GalTI mRNAs in prepupae of Act5C-GAL4/N4 andAct5C-GAL4/N13 (Fig. 4 C). The target efficiency in the prepupae was almost the same as that in the third instar larvae. The above results clearly demonstrated that the expression of the target gene was specifically reduced by RNAi in thisDrosophila RNAi system to induce the phenotype. We identified the Drosophila proteoglycan β4GalTI by molecular and biochemical analyses and then made the RNAi fly to investigate dβ4GalTI function in vivo. The expression of the target gene was disrupted specifically in the RNAi fly and the degree of interference was correlated to phenotype. The reduction ofdβ4GalTI mRNA caused lethality, indicating an essential function of dβ4GalTI for viability. This is the first example of a reverse genetics approach to the systematic study ofDrosophila glycosyltransferase. Drosophila has three members of the β4GalT family, dβ4GalTI, dβ4GalTA, and dβ4GalTB (Fig. 2 A). The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2 B) and acceptor substrate specificities (Table II) of the β4GalT family clearly demonstrated that dβ4GalTI is the Drosophila ortholog of hβ4GalTI. dβ4GalTA and dβ4GalTB showed higher homology to hβ4GalT1 to -6 than to hβ4GalTI, but the Drosophila ortholog of the six hβ4GalTs could not be identified. So there is a possibility that dβ4GalTA and dβ4GalTB share acceptor substrates, to which hβ4GalT1 to -6 can transfer Gal. Recently, hβ4GalT1 has been reported to transfer Gal to fringe-modifiedO-fucose glycans on the Notch protein and the elongation of glycans was necessary to modulate Notch signaling. A novelDrosophila galectin has also been isolated (26Pace K.E. Lebestky T. Hummel T. Arnoux P. Kwan K. Baum L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13091-13098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is still unknown which of the two dβ4GalTs works to elongateO-fucose glycans on Notch or synthesize the ligands ofDrosophila galectin. We are now attempting to determine the substrate specificity of the two dβ4GalTs. The three members of the dβ4GalT family also conserved the three β4GalT motifs found in the hβ4GalT family (Fig.2 A) (25Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the bovine β4GalT1 has already been reported (24Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 27Ramakrishnan B. Qasba P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 28Ramakrishnan B. Shah P.S. Qasba P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37665-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The DXD motif is a Mn2+-binding site, and the other two motifs expose the surface of the catalytic pocket. The FNRA motif is involved in UDP-Gal binding and the negatively charged residues of the GWGXEDD(D/E) motif contribute to UDP-Gal and UDP-glucose binding. The three motifs conserved between human andDrosophila had amino acid sequences that related to the binding of metal or donor substrates. dβ4GalTI showed roughly half the activity of hβ4GalTI toward each substrate at both 25 and 37 °C, although the substrate specificities of the two were similar (Table II). The breeding temperature of flies and the body temperature of humans are 25 and 37 °C, respectively. Under physiological conditions, hβ4GalTI performed a more efficient reaction than dβ4GalTI. Very recently, two papers about dβ4GalTI have been published (29Nakamura Y. Haines N. Chen J. Okajima T. Furukawa K. Urano T. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46280-46288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Vadaie N. Hulinsky R.S. Jarvis D.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reporting similar enzymatic activity to ours. We made 24 UAS-dβ4GalTI-IR fly lines and observed the F1 generation of eachUAS-dβ4GalTI-IR fly crossed with theAct5C-GAL4 fly. The severity of the phenotype differed between the stocks. Approximately 65% of the flies died at the pupal stages (Table III), but some lived to become adults, similar in morphology to the wild type. Because the degree of expression of the transgene is known to depend on its sites of insertion on the chromosome, it is reasonable that the phenotypes differed. The reduction in dβ4GalTI mRNA was correlated with the severity of the phenotype (Fig. 4 A). The severest phenotype should be considered to represent the real phenotype of the mutant. Although we have no data indicating that cell, tissue, or organ abnormalities caused the death of individual flies, finer analyses of the phenotype should reveal the in vivo function of dβ4GalTI. We analyzed the amounts of three dβ4GalTmRNAs (dβ4GalTI,dβ4GalTA, and dβ4GalTB) to estimate the specificity and efficiency of RNAi in ourDrosophila-inducible RNAi system. The RNAi occurred only ondβ4GalTI and had no effect on the other members of the dβ4GalT family, dβ4GalTA anddβ4GalTB (Fig. 4, A andB). During the process of RNAi, 21–23-nucleotide siRNA mediates the degeneration of the complementary homologous RNA (17Hutvagner G. Zamore P.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). If even one nucleotide differs between the siRNA and target mRNA, siRNA cannot mediate the degeneration of target RNA (17Hutvagner G. Zamore P.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Comparing the DNA sequence of dβ4GalTI with the sequences ofdβ4GalTA and dβ4GalTB, we could not find any identical regions longer than 21 nucleotides. This must be the reason why the RNAi ofdβ4GalTI was specific with no cross-effect fordβ4GalTA anddβ4GalTB. The efficiency of RNAi largely did not depend on the target sequences using the constructions of IR (Fig. 4, A and B), and the ratio of degraded dβ4GalTI mRNA was well correlated with the severity of the phenotypes. These findings demonstrate that our Drosophila inducible RNAi system has the potential to become a powerful tool for analyses of the biological roles of glycosyltransferase. However, one might have to make an effort to increase the efficiency of RNAi. A small amount of maternal RNA might remain even after the occurrence of RNAi. dβ4GalTI contributes to the synthesis of the common linkage structure of heparin/HS and CS/DS. When dβ4GalTI is inactivated in the RNAi fly, levels of both GAGs are reduced. Our results clearly demonstrated that GAGs on core proteins are important to viability (Table III). It has been reported that the hβ4GalTI gene of patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome has mutations that reduce β4GalTI activity (7Almeida R. Levery S.B. Mandel U. Kresse H. Schwientek T. Bennett E.P.

The patients show an aged appearance, developmental delay, dwarfism, craniofacial disproportion, generalized osteopenia, and various connective abnormalities. The RNAi fly ofdβ4GalTI should serve as a model of this kind of disease. D. melanogaster is well established as a model for genetic analysis. Recently, fly mutants with severe phenotypes related to developmental processes have begun to be used to address the defects of glycosyltransferases. As one example, the Drosophila fringegene has been demonstrated to encode an O-fucose β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that extends theO-fucose moieties on Notch to modulate Notch activation by the ligands, Delta and Serrate/Jagged (32Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 33Bruckner K.

Recently, one recessive lethal mutant has been reported to have a missense mutation causing a reduction of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity (35Ten Hagen K.G.

Considering the recent progress made in studies ofDrosophila glycans as mentioned above, D. melanogaster will become a powerful tool for analysis of the biological roles of glycans. In this report, we demonstrated the first systematic reverse genetics approach using RNAi of Drosophila glycosyltransferase and showed that RNAi worked well in the case of a glycosyltransferase. We found almost 70 Drosophila glycosyltransferases by performing a TBLASTN search of the Drosophila data bases using mammalian glycosyltransferases as the query sequence. It is possible to make a RNAi fly for each of the 70 glycosyltransferases, whereas knock-out mice cannot be made. The inducible glycosyltransferase RNAi fly obtained using the GAL4-UAS system will open the way for the analysis of the biological role of glycans.

MIA is translated as a 131-amino acid precursor molecule and is processed into a mature 107-amino acid protein after cleavage of a hydrophobic secretion signal. The position within the human genome was mapped to chromosome 19q13.32-13.33 (2Koehler M.R. Bosserhoff A. von Beust G. Bauer A. Blesch A. Buettner R. Schlegel J. Bogdahn U. Schmid M.

MIA mRNA was identified independently by differential display approaches comparing melanoma cell lines and also comparing differentiated and dedifferentiated cartilage cells in vitro. Therefore, MIA has also been referred to as cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein (3Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol.

Subsequent studies of murine embryos and murine adult tissues demonstrated specific mRNA expression patterns in cartilage but not in any other non-neoplastic tissue (4Bosserhoff A.K. Kondo S.

Functionally, MIA was initially purified and described to exert antitumor activity by inhibiting proliferation of melanoma cell lines in vitro (5Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Behl C.

However, further studies revealed expression patterns inconsistent with a tumor suppressor. Expression of the wild-type MIA protein gene was not detected in normal skin and melanocytes but was associated with progression of melanocytic tumors. More recently, it was suggested that the MIA protein specifically inhibits attachment of melanoma cells to fibronectin and laminin and thereby masks the binding site of integrins to these extracellular matrix components and promotes invasion in vitro (6Stoll R.

For this protein a homology of 59% to MIA was determined. OTOR expression was reported to be highly tissue-specific and restricted to the cochlea and eye (10Rendtorff N.D. Frodin M. Attie-Bitach T. Vekemans M. Tommerup N. Genomics. 2001; 71: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Robertson N.G. Heller S. Lin J.S. Resendes B.L. Weremowicz S. Denis C.S. Bell A.M. Hudspeth A.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40036-40041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The detection of OTOR stimulated us to search for further homologous proteins. Here we describe a novel MIA homologue, designated MIA2, and we define its expression pattern and regulation in hepatocytes.Interestingly, we found specific expression in the liver and mechanisms of transcriptional regulation that identify MIA2 as a potential novel acute phase protein. Furthermore, our analysis of the expression levels of MIA2 in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection may suggest that MIA2 can serve as a marker of hepatic disease activity and severity.RESULTSWe identified the MIA2 gene as a homologue of MIA by a gene search. MIA2, together with MIA,OTOR, and TANGO, belongs to a novelMIA gene family sharing important structural features, including an SH3 fold domain and two intramolecular disulfide bonds, and similar genomic organization. The four members share 34–45% amino acid identity and 47–59% cDNA sequence identity (Fig.1A). Surprisingly, MIA2 contains an additional C-terminal region of 422 amino acids having no homology to known proteins. MIA2 therefore encodes a mature protein of 522 amino acids in addition to the hydrophobic secretory signal sequence (Fig. 1B). Structure modeling and protein folding recognition studies confirm the highly conserved SH3 structure in the N terminus present also in MIA and OTOR (which are both known to be secreted proteins).To analyze expression patterns of MIA2, RT-PCR studies of adult human and murine tissues and in situ hybridization of murine embryo sections were performed. In general, RT-PCR studies with primers specific for MIA2 reveal a consistent expression pattern for both human and murine tissues. In contrast to MIA, which is exclusively expressed in cartilage but not in any other non-neoplastic tissue, and OTOR, which shows a highly restricted expression pattern in cochlea, eye, and cartilage, the novel MIA related gene, MIA2, is expressed specifically in liver (Table I) and at very low levels in testis. The RT-PCR analysis was verified byin situ hybridization to mouse embryo sections of different embryonic stages between E12.5 and E14.5 using radiolabeled cRNA probes. Consistent with the RT-PCR, strong MIA2 expression was found in the developing liver (Fig. 2). Comparison between adult and fetal (gestational day 20) murine livers revealed ∼5-fold higher MIA2 mRNA expression levels in adult liver (data not shown).Table IExpression pattern of MIA and MIA2 analyzed by RT-PCR and Northern blottingTissueMIAMIA2HumanMurineHumanMurineLung−−−−Liver−−++++Kidney−−−−Colon−−−−Skin−−ND−Bone−−−−Cartilage++++−−Uterus−−−−Fat−−ND−Heart−−−−Brain−−−−Spleen−−−−Thymus−−−−Muscle−−−−Testis−−++Cochlea−−NDNDTrachea++ND−NDProstate−ND−NDSmall intestine−−−NDData of MIA summarize previously published results (N.D., not done; −, no expression; +, weak expression; ++, strong expression).

Identical results were obtained with murine hepatic cells (data not shown). To estimate MIA2 mRNA expression relative to several known acute phase proteins, semiquantitative PCR analysis was performed using first strand cDNA from primary human hepatocytes. MIA2 mRNA expression was revealed to be lower than α1-antichymotrypsin mRNA expression but similar to the mRNA expression of α1-antitrypsin, α2-macrogobulin, and α1-acid glycoprotein (data not shown). Furthermore, several tumor cell lines were studied, and expression was detected only in the hepatoma cell line HepG2 (Fig.3B).Figure 3Analysis of MIA2 expression by RT-PCR.A, RT-PCR specific for MIA2 revealed strong expression in primary human hepatocytes (ph Hepatocytes) of two different donors (I and II). B- (U266) or T-lymphocytes (Jurkat), quiescent (Q-HSC), and activated hepatic stellate cells (A-HSC) were MIA2-negative. Stimulation of HSC cells with TNF did not induce MIA2 expression.B, RT-PCR analysis for MIA2 expression in a panel of different human tumor cells showed strong expression in HepG2 cells but not in melanoma (Mel Ho, HTZ19d, Mel Juso, Mel Ju, SK Mel 28, SK Mel 3, Mel Im, Mel Wei, Mel Ei) or colon carcinoma cell lines (CaCo-2, HCT116, SW48, LoVo, SW480, HT29). Further human primary melanocytes (NHEM) were tested and revealed to be negative.MW, molecular weight; neg, negative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These data indicated highly specific expression of MIA2 in hepatocytes and prompted us to further analyze the underlying gene regulatory mechanism.Preliminary insight into putative cis-regulatory elements of theMIA2 promoter were obtained by data bank searches of the genomic 5′-flanking region. Analysis of 1500 bp indicated several consensus binding sites for transcription factors (Fig.4A). Most importantly, an HNF1 site was found at −253 to −240 (relative to the adenine of the start codon). Furthermore, STAT, SMAD, GATA-1, GATA-2, cAMP-response element-binding protein, and AP-1 binding sites were localized. GenBankTM search revealed EST clones identical toMIA2 with a 5′-untranslated region of −120 indicating that these sequences are indeed being transcribed. Consistently, a consensus TATA box sequence is located 29 bases further upstream suggesting that transcription initiation occurs at residue −120 or very close.Figure 4Regulation of MIA2 promoter activity.A, sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the MIA2gene. Consensus binding sites for GATA-1 and -2, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), AP1, C/EBP, STAT3, SMAD, CRE-BP, and HNF-1 are underlined by anarrow and printed in boldface. Furthermore, a TATA box is located 29 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site at −120 bp. The transcribed sequence is underlined, and the ATG translation start codon is shown in italics. B, 707 bp of the MIA2 promoter were cloned into pGL3-basic and conferred significant luciferase activity in HepG2 cells but not in melanoma cells (Mel Im) and primary fibroblasts (prim. fib.). In all cell types the promoter activity was induced by co-transfecting an HNF1 expression plasmid. Mutation of the HNF1 site in the MIA2 promoter (707mut) led to loss of promoter activity in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, deletion of the promoter to 218 bp without the HNF1-binding site also entirely inactivated promoter activity in HepG2 cells, and the construct was not activated by co-expression of HNF1. C, gel shift assays with the HNF1 site of the MIA2 promoter and HepG2 nuclear extracts. Binding was competed specifically by an HNF1 consensus binding site (HNF1_cons) and by the HNF1 site present in theMIA2 promoter (HNF1_MIA2) but not by an oligonucleotide with a mutated HNF1-binding site (HNF1_mut).D, supershift experiment with an anti-HNF1 antibody. The antibody supershifted an HNF1 bandshift in HepG2 nuclear extract but not in Mel Im extract.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)707 and 218 bp of the promoter region were subcloned into pGL3-basic, a promoterless luciferase reporter construct. Reporter gene assays revealed strong activity of the promoter construct −707 in HepG2 cells but not in primary human fibroblasts or melanoma cells (Mel Im) (Fig.4B). Activity of the promoter could be further enhanced in HepG2 by transfection of an HNF1 expression plasmid. Interestingly, transfection of HNF1 into Mel Im melanoma cells and into human fibroblasts was sufficient to significantly activate theMIA2 promoter. The 218-bp promoter construct (lacking the HNF1 site) was neither active in HepG2 cells nor inducible by HNF1 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, mutation of the HNF1 site in the 707 reporter construct by site-directed mutagenesis entirely inactivated promoter activity in HepG2 cells.To confirm site-specific binding of HNF1 to the putative binding site at −253 to −240 in the MIA2 promoter, gel shift assays were performed. Binding of HNF1 present in HepG2 nuclear extracts to a consensus HNF1 site was competed by an oligomeric binding site spanning the HNF1 site in the MIA2 promoter (Fig. 4C). Additionally, supershifting experiments using an anti-HNF1 antibody confirmed binding of HNF1 to the MIA2 promoter in HepG2 but not in Mel Im melanoma cells (Fig. 4D).We next investigated whether cytokines, known to be elevated during liver diseases (interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), alcohol, and phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA) were also involved in regulating hepatic MIA2 mRNA expression. Only IL-6 and TGF-β increased the MIA2-specific RT-PCR signal in isolated human hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells. As measured by quantitative RT-PCR analysis, both IL-6 and TGF-β induced MIA2-specific mRNA ∼8.5-fold. Combined treatment with both cytokines even further induced MIA2 mRNA expression by ∼12.3-fold (Fig.5A). Induction of MIA2 mRNA expression already occurred 6 h after stimulation, and maximal stimulation was observed after 16 h (data not shown).Figure 5Regulation of MIA2 expression by cytokines.A, real time RT-PCR measurements of MIA2 mRNA expression after stimulation with TNF-α, LPS, PMA, ethanol, IL-1, TGF-β1, IL-6, and the combination of both TGF-β1 and IL-6. **,p < 0.01. B, conditioned medium of activated hepatic stellate cells cultured in the absence or presence of endotoxin was used to stimulate HepG2 cells, revealing a strong induction of MIA2 mRNA expression as measured by real time RT-PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regulation of MIA2 mRNA expression by the cytokines IL-6 and TGF-β1 is in accordance with the STAT3 (IL-6 regulation) and SMAD (TGF-β regulation) consensus binding sites in the MIA2promoter. In chronic liver diseases both cytokines are mainly expressed by activated hepatic stellate cells or activated myofibroblasts. These cells play a major role in the pathophysiology of chronic liver disease. Therefore, we investigated the effect of serum-free medium conditioned by activated human HSC. MIA2 expression in HepG2 cells was strongly stimulated by cell culture supernatant of activated HSC pretreated with endotoxin and weakly, but still significantly, by the supernatant from unstimulated HSC. Quantitative RT-PCR results showed an 8.5-fold increase (2.2-fold, respectively) (Fig. 5B). Similarly as in cytokine experiments, maximum of MIA2mRNA expression was seen after 16 h, starting at 6 h after stimulation with conditioned medium (data not shown).Hepatic IL-6 and TGF-β levels are known to be elevated in chronic liver diseases. It is known that trans-differentiation of HSC into myofibroblastic cells is occurring in chronic liver diseases, leading to proliferation of the cells, to migration into the sites of liver damage, and increased expression of profibrotic and proinflammatory genes, including TGF-β and IL-6. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of MIA2 mRNA in liver tissue of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and various stages of fibrosis and grading of intrahepatic inflammation. Liver tissue without histological signs of fibrosis or inflammation from human donors without liver disease served as control. Intrahepatic MIA2 mRNA expression was found to be significantly elevated in hepatitis C patients compared with controls (0.14 ± 0.13 versus 1.62 ± 1.46, respectively;p = 0.043) (Fig. 6). Furthermore, hepatitis C patients with only mild, periportal fibrosis (staging 1; n = 6) had significantly lower intrahepatic MIA2 mRNA expression than patients with more advanced fibrosis (staging >1; n = 5) (0.85 ± 0.38versus 2.55 ± 1.78, respectively; p = 0.016), as summarized in Fig. 6A. MIA2-mRNA expression was also lower in hepatitis C patients with little intrahepatic inflammation (grading 1 or 2), compared with patients with severe inflammation (grading >2); however, these differences did not reach statistical significance (1.04 ± 0.62 versus 2.64 ± 2.04, respectively; p = 0.027) (Fig.6B).Figure 6Hepatic MIA2 mRNA expression in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.

Furthermore, we analyzed the expression pattern and gained first insight into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms during liver diseases.MIA2, together with MIA, OTOR, andTANGO, belongs to the novel MIA gene family sharing important structural features, significant homology at both the nucleotide and protein level, and similar genomic organization.MIA/OTOR and MIA2/TANGO are more closely related to each other than to the other MIAgene family members. Many residues important for structural folding are conserved between the four proteins (e.g. cysteine residues, amino acids in the hydrophobic core). Therefore, it can be speculated that all proteins belonging to the MIA gene family form an SH3 domain-like structure that was recently identified by NMR and x-ray crystallography of MIA (6Stoll R. Renner C. Zweckstetter M. Bruggert M. Ambrosius D. Palme S. Engh R.A. Golob M. Breibach I. Buettner R. Voelter W. Holak T.A. Bosserhoff A.K.

A. 2001; 98: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The N terminus coding for the signal sequence is quite divergent, but analysis by Kyte-Doolittle blots revealed conservation of the hydrophobic character that is functionally important.In contrast to MIA, which is exclusively expressed in cartilage but not in any other non-neoplastic tissue, and OTOR, which shows a highly restricted expression pattern in cochlea, eye, and cartilage, the novelMIA-related gene MIA2 is expressed specifically in hepatocytes. The RT-PCR analysis was verified by in situhybridization to mouse embryo sections of different embryonic stages between E12.5 and E14.5 using radiolabeled cRNA probes. Consistent with the RT-PCR data, MIA2 expression is restricted to hepatocytes also during development. Furthermore, no mRNA expression of MIA2 was detected in cartilage indicating that the four members of theMIA gene family differ entirely with respect to their expression patterns.To analyze transcriptional regulation, luciferase reporter gene constructs containing portions of the 5′-flanking region including an HNF1-binding site were transfected into HepG2 cells, melanoma cells, and primary fibroblasts. Our results clearly show the importance of the HNF-1-binding site for the exclusive expression of MIA2 mRNA in hepatocytes.HNF-1 is a transcription factor that is expressed in liver, digestive tract, pancreas, and kidney (21Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and is involved in the regulation of a large number of hepatic genes including albumin, fibrinogen, or α1-antitrypsin. It has been reported previously (22Ninomiya T. Hayashi Y. Saijoh K. Ohta K. Yoon S. Nakabayashi H. Tamaoki T. Kasuga M. Itoh H. J. Hepatol. 1996; 25: 445-453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Trauner M. Arrese M. Lee H. Boyer J.L. Karpen S.J. J. Clin.

It is further interesting to note that several genes that contain a functional HNF-1 binding sequence are down-regulated during host response to infection or inflammation (25Gabay C. Kushner I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 448-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5004) Google Scholar, 26Navasa M. Gordon D.A. Hariharan N. Jamil H. Shigenaga J.K. Moser A. Fiers W. Pollock A. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J.

Acta. 1999; 1440: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, hepatic MIA2 mRNA was found to be increased in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. Furthermore, MIA2 transcription was even further elevated in liver tissue with severe fibrosis or inflammation. Our findings indicate that HNF-1 expression is required for basal expression but may be less important for enhanced transcriptional regulation in liver diseases.Here, in accordance with STAT3 and SMAD consensus binding sites in theMIA2 promoter, IL-6 and TGF-β were identified as activators of MIA2 transcription, whereas other cytokines did not lead to enhancement of MIA2 expression.The cytokine IL-6 is required for liver regeneration and repair and up-regulates transcriptionally a vast array of genes during liver regeneration and repair (28Cressman D.E.

Biol. 2001; 47: 661-673PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 induces DNA binding of STAT transcription factors on regulatory elements of target genes. Although MIA2 is expressed constitutively in hepatocytes, its transcription was significantly increased during IL-6 stimulation.TGF-β has pleiotropic functions including fibrinogenic action leading to trans-differentiation of HSC and negative regulation of proliferation and induction of apoptosis (31Gressner A.M. Weiskirchen R. Breitkopf K. Dooley S. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d793-d807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, we found a synergistic effect of IL-6 and TGF-β stimulation on MIA expression in HepG2 cells. The cross-talk between IL-6 and TGF-β signaling pathways in a human hepatoma cell line was elucidated in a recent study (32Yamamoto T. Matsuda T. Muraguchi A. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), demonstrating that IL-6-induced activation of STAT3 activity and STAT3-mediated gene expression was augmented by TGF-β. These activities were due to physical interactions between STAT3 and SMAD- and MAD-related protein-3, bridged by p300. As the consensus binding sites for STAT3 and SMAD are in direct proximity in the MIA2 promoter, we speculate that a similar mechanism for induction of MIA2 expression may be involved.Our results indicate that different classes of transcription factors, tissue-specific (HNF-1) and growth- or stress-induced (STAT3 and SMAD), may interact during acute phase reaction or as an adaptive response to liver injury to amplify expression of the MIA2 gene, as demonstrated for other genes such as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (33Leu J.I. Crissey M.A. Leu J.P. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).STAT and SMAD pathways are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis and inflammation, and elevated systemic and intrahepatic levels of IL-6 and TGF-β were found in acute and chronic liver diseases (30Streetz K.L. Wustefeld T. Klein C. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 661-673PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gressner A.M. Weiskirchen R. Breitkopf K. Dooley S. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d793-d807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation process of HSC, causing trans-differentiation of the physiologically quiescent cells to an activated myofibroblast-like cell type, is one of the key events of hepatic fibrosis. In healthy liver or acute liver damage, Kupffer cells, the resident hepatic macrophages, are the main modulators of inflammation, secreting mainly TNF or IL-1. However, during liver disease activation of HSC occurs early, leading to participation in the regulation of the hepatic inflammatory response (31Gressner A.M. Weiskirchen R. Breitkopf K. Dooley S. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d793-d807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both cytokines, IL-6, and TGF-β are expressed by activated, but not quiescent, HSC. Consequently, we found strong induction of MIA2 expression in HepG2 cells incubated with conditioned medium"

J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The domain within the skeletal II-III loop peptide essential for RyR1 activity was further refined to the region between Arg681 and Leu690 termed peptide A (pA) (13El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J.P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Studies of how pA modifies single channel gating behavior revealed both activating and inhibitory properties on RyR1 depending on the concentration, the freecis Ca2+ concentration, and the holding potential (12Stange M.

Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 189-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These actions of pA were also found to extend to RyR2, suggesting a modulatory influence downstream of the skeletal α1s-DHPR/RyR1 interaction (12Stange M. Tripathy A. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, expression of α1s-DHPR chimeras in dysgenic myotubes has shown that the pA region of the II-III loop was not essential for engaging skeletal type EC coupling (16Proenza C. Wilkens C.M. Beam K.G. J. Biol.

Although the action of pA and related peptides may not be directly involved in mediating bidirectional signaling in skeletal EC coupling, they are very useful in defining basic properties of RyR gating. The mechanism by which pA alters RyR1 channel function has not yet been fully defined. Imperatoxin A (IpTxa), a 33-amino acid peptide isolated from the scorpion Pandinus imperator, was shown to be a high affinity agonist of RyR1 channels (20El-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arevalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Valdivia H.H. Kirby M.S. Lederer W.J. Coronado R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12185-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nanomolar IpTxa increased high affinity [3H]ryanodine-binding and induced rapid Ca2+ release from SR vesicles. More recent studies have shown that IpTxa prolonged the duration of Ca2+sparks in frog skeletal muscle (22Shtifman A. Ward C.W. Wang J.L. Valdivia H.H. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 814-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Gonzalez A. Kirsch W.G. Shirokova N. Pizarro G. Brum G. Pessah I.N. Stern M.D. Cheng H. Rios E. Proc. Natl.

Zhu X.S. Simeoni I. Sorrentino V. Valdivia H.H. Garcia J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1319-1328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In measurements of single channel currents, IpTxa stabilized long living subconductance states in skeletal and cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor channels having 43 and 28% of the native full transition at the holding potential of −40 and +40 mV, respectively (25Tripathy A. Resch W. Xu L. Valdivia H.H. Meissner G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). IpTxa was proposed to mimic the actions of pA based on their similar RyR1-activating properties, possibly through a common effector site (26Gurrola G.B. Arevalo C. Sreekumar R. Lokuta A.J. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7879-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mutations within IpTxa and peptide A have indicated that several basic amino acids followed by a hydroxyl-containing amino acid is the critical domain needed for the binding of both peptides to RyR1 (26Gurrola G.B. Arevalo C. Sreekumar R. Lokuta A.J. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7879-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, maurocalcine (MCa), a novel peptide isolated from the venom of the scorpion Scorpio maurus palmatus, has been found to possess 82% sequence identity with IpTxa (27Fajloun Z. Kharrat R. Chen L. Lecomte C. Di Luccio E. Bichet D. El Ayeb M. Rochat H. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 28Mosbah A. Kharrat R. Renisio J.G. Blanc E. Sabatier J.M. El Ayeb M. Darbon H. 6eme Rencontre en Toxinologie, August 1–4, 1998. Société français pour l'etude des toxines, Paris1998Google Scholar). MCa shares the highly basic structural domain identified in peptide A and IpTxa important for interactions with RyR1. Preliminary work has shown that synthetic MCa (sMCa) activates RyR1 channels by inducing long living subconductance states (27Fajloun Z. Kharrat R. Chen L. Lecomte C. Di Luccio E. Bichet D. El Ayeb M. Rochat H. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both IpTxa- and sMCa-modified channels can reversibly transit between subconductance states and fast gating states. The actions of these peptides were also found to be additive with those of ryanodine, resulting in additional substates from the ryanodine-locked half-conducting state. However, the predominant subconductance induced by sMCa differs from that of IpTxa. At a holding potential of +40 mV, the predominant substates induced by sMCa and IpTxa are 48 and 28% of the full conductance, respectively, suggesting that the structural difference in these peptides may induce slightly different channel conformations that stabilize different unitary conductances (25Tripathy A. Resch W. Xu L. Valdivia H.H. Meissner G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Fajloun Z. Kharrat R. Chen L. Lecomte C. Di Luccio E. Bichet D. El Ayeb M. Rochat H. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we define in detail the mechanism by which sMCa alters RyR1 function and its relationship to the actions of pA. We find that sMCa and pA stabilize distinct subconductance states through an interaction with the RyR1 channel complex that cannot be explained by simple competition at a common effector site. In combination, the peptides reveal that the sMCa-modified RyR1 channel gates in stable proportional conductances. Gating in proportional conductances was also observed in the presence of sMCa and ryanodine and of sMCa and channels deficient in FKBP12. These results reveal that RyR1 channels gate in stable proportional conductances in the presence of allosteric modulators that mediate actions through distinct effector sites and are consistent with an iris model regulating a single permeation pore. [3H]Ryanodine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences with specific activity of 57 Ci/mmol and purity of >90%. Unlabeled ryanodine was purchased from Calbiochem. Purified natural phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) or Northern Lipids (Vancouver, Canada). Peptide A was a generous gift from Dr. Noriaki Ikemoto (Boston Biomedical Research Institute, Boston, MA). sMCa was made by the solid phase peptide synthesis method (27Fajloun Z. Kharrat R. Chen L. Lecomte C. Di Luccio E. Bichet D. El Ayeb M. Rochat H. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), purified with HPLC and ion exchange chromatography, and verified with HPLC, amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry. The structural authenticity of pA utilized in the present investigation was confirmed by two methods, mass spectrometry and amino acid sequence analysis. The peptide was found to have a major peak at the anticipated molecular weight (M r = 2330) and have the amino acid sequence reported for the DHPR II-III loop (Thr671–Leu690). All other chemicals were commercially obtained at the highest purity available. Membrane vesicles enriched in RyR1·FKBP12 complex and SERCA pumps were prepared from rabbit fast twitch skeletal muscle based on the method of Saito et al. (29Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly ground muscle was homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 5 mmimidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Differential centrifugation was performed to obtain a heavy SR fraction, and junctional SR was collected from the 38–45% (w/w) interface of a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The junctional SR was then resuspended to 10–15 mg/ml (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until needed. Ca2+ transport across SR vesicles was measured with the membrane-impermeant Ca2+-sensitive dye, antipyrylazo III, using a diode array spectrophotometer (model 8452; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Skeletal SR vesicles (50 μg/ml) were added to 1.15 ml of ATP-regenerating buffer consisting of 95 mm KCl, 20 mm potassium MOPS, 7.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate (31Palade P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6142-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 250 μmantipyrylazo III, 12 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 5 μmphosphocreatine, and 1 mm MgATP, pH 7.0 (final volume of 1.2 ml). Transport assays were performed at 37 °C in temperature-controlled cuvettes with constant stirring. SR vesicles were loaded with sequential additions of CaCl2 that constituted ∼80% of their loading capacity. Net Ca2+fluxes across SR vesicles were measured by monitoring extravesicular changes in free Ca2+ by subtracting the absorbance of antipyrylazo III at 710 nm from absorbance at 790 nm at 2–4-s intervals. The loading capacity of the SR vesicles were determined by the sequential addition of 24 or 12 nmol of Ca2+ until the vesicles cannot uptake any Ca2+ or start calcium-induced calcium release. The maximum amount of Ca2+ accumulated by SR vesicles defines the loading capacity. At the end of each experiment, the total intravesicular Ca2+ was determined by the addition of 3 μm of the Ca2+ ionophoreA23187 and the absorbance signals were calibrated by the addition of 12 or 24 nmol of CaCl2 from a National Bureau of Standards stock solution. Test compounds were either added before loading (pretreatment) or after the last addition of Ca2+ was accumulated by the vesicles. The specific binding of [3H]ryanodine to 12 μg of SR protein was performed with two distinct assay protocols, each with a slight modification of the original method (32Pessah I.N. Stambuk R.A. Casida J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 232-238PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pessah I.N. Waterhouse A.L. Casida J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Protocol A used a buffer composed of 3 nm [3H]ryanodine, 200 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, ∼7 μm free Ca2+, pH 7.2, and incubation was performed at 36 °C for 1.5 h. Protocol B used a buffer composed of 1 nm[3H]ryanodine, 140 mm KCl, 15 mmNaCl, 50 μm free Ca2+, 20 mmPIPES, 10% sucrose, pH 7.4, and incubation was at 37 °C for 3 h. Additions of test compounds were made to the radiolabeled assay buffer, singly or in combination, prior to the addition of SR. To test whether sMCa and pA interacted in a classic competitive manner to modulate RyR1 conformation, the complete dose response for sMCa toward enhancing specific [3H]ryanodine binding was assessed in the absence and presence of pA (15 or 30 μm) under the buffer conditions described above. Separation of bound and free [3H]ryanodine was performed by filtration through a Whatman GF/B glass fiber filter using a Brandel (Gaithersburg, MD) cell harvester. Filters were washed two times with 3 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 50 μmCa2+, pH 7.1. Filters were then soaked overnight in 5 ml of scintillation mixture (Ready Safe; Beckman), and bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. Each experiment was performed in duplicate or triplicate and repeated at least two times. Real time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a BIAcore biosensor system 1000 at 25 °C. Biotinylated sMCa was immobilized on the sensor chip surface coated with streptavidin (sensor chip SA). Purified RyR1 was prepared from heavy SR vesicles solubilized in the presence of CHAPS (34Pessah I.N. Francini A.O. Scales D.J. Waterhouse A.L. Casida J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8643-8648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and isolated by sucrose density gradient of the solubilized SR proteins as previously described (35Lai F.A. Erikson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Before SPR experiments, purified RyR1 was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.005% polysorbate in order to reduce the sucrose and NaCl concentration. In these conditions, RyR1 has been characterized by an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 30 S that corresponds to a homotetramer of ∼565-kDa subunits (36Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Frank J. Saito A. Inui M. Fleisher S. Nature. 1989; 338: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). sMCa-RyR1 interaction was measured by injection of purified RyR1 at 2 μg/ml (∼1 nm in its tetrameric form) in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmCaCl2 (pCa 5), 0.005% polysorbate 20, pH 7.4. Nonspecific binding was measured by injecting RyR1 over a control surface saturated with biotin instead of biotinylated sMCa. To study the possible competition of sMCa and pA at a mutually exclusive site, RyR1 was preincubated for 30 min with 20 μm pA prior to injection onto the biosensor chip containing immobilized sMCa. Cs+ current through single RyR1 channels incorporated into planar bilayer lipid membranes was measured in an asymmetric CsCl (10:1 or 1:10cis/trans) solution. The bilayer lipid membrane was formed from a mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine (5:2, w/w) at 50 mg/ml in decane, across a 150–300-μm aperture in a 1.0-ml polystyrene cup. SR vesicles were added to the cis side of the chamber at a final concentration of 0.1–10 μg/ml. The cis solution contained 500 mm CsCl, 7 μm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the trans solution contained 50 mm CsCl, 7 μm free Ca2+, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. After a single fusion event, the vesicles are quickly removed by perfusion with 7 volumes of identical buffer without vesicles. Under conditions of a 10:1 (cis/trans) Cs+ gradient, a holding potential of +30 to +40 mV drives the current from thecis to the trans chamber. To drive the current from trans to cis, the CsCl in the cissolution was lowered to 50 mm by perfusion, and the CsCl in the trans side was raised to 500 mm by bolus addition from a 4 m CsCl stock. Measurements oftrans to cis current were made at a holding potential of −40 mV. Single channel current was measured under voltage clamp using a Dagan 3900A integrating patch clamp (Dagan Instruments, Minneapolis, MN). Holding potentials were with respect to thetrans (ground) chamber, and positive current was defined as current flowing from cis to trans. Current signals were captured at 10 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz using a four-pole Bessel filter. Data were digitized with a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) and stored on a computer for subsequent analysis. The experiments were performed at room temperature and were replicated at least three times. Unless otherwise stated, test chemicals were sequentially added to the cis solution after an initial period of recording control channel behavior. Single channel activity was analyzed with pCLAMP 6.0 (Axon Instruments). Open events for full conductance and subconductances were defined as intervals at which the currents exceeded 50% of maximum open level and the defined subconductance level, respectively. Open probability (P o) for unmodified channels (control channels) was calculated from 60–90 s of continuous record using the PStat program. For peptide A-modified channels, the overall open probability is calculated from the whole recording time, whereas the within group open probability is calculated only from the groups of time points when channels are at rapid gating states. Current levels were analyzed by mean-variance analysis, and peaks in the all points amplitude histogram were fitted with Gaussian functions. Dwell open and closed times for relatively fast gating events (duration of <50 ms) were calculated from least-square fits of biexponential function using the PStat software. Arithmetic average time is used for analyzing the long subconductance states induced by sMCa and the long closed time induced by pA, because there are not enough events to fit with a reasonable biexponential function. Fig. 1 compares the amino acid sequences of MCa, IpTxa, and pA, showing a common basic domain terminating with an amino acid possessing a hydroxyl-containing side chain that has been proposed to contribute essential structure for activating RyR1 (26Gurrola G.B. Arevalo C. Sreekumar R. Lokuta A.J. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7879-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that MCa shares many properties with IpTxa and pA in the manner in which it modulates RyR1. The present work therefore elucidates the mechanism(s) by which sMCa and pA alter the function of SR Ca2+ transport and RyR1 channel function. To assess how MCa alters Ca2+ fluxes across skeletal muscle SR vesicles, macroscopic Ca2+ transport measurements were performed under pyrophosphate-supported active loading conditions. After SR vesicles were sequentially loaded with Ca2+ to ∼80% of their capacity and extravesicular Ca2+ level returned to the base line (∼150 nm free Ca2+), sMCa (20 nm) quickly induced Ca2+ release (Fig.2 A). The addition of ryanodine receptor inhibitors, ruthenium red (5 μm), or ryanodine (500 μm) at the plateau of Ca2+ release, blocked RyR1 channels, and led to Ca2+ reuptake into vesicles, suggesting that sMCa induced Ca2+ release by selective activation of RyR1. The actions of sMCa on SR Ca2+ release were concentration-dependent, with an EC50 of 17.5 nm (Fig. 2, B andC). The loading capacity of SR vesicles has been shown to be determined by a balance between Ca2+ uptake through ATP-dependent SERCA pumps and Ca2+ release through ruthenium red-sensitive and -insensitive efflux pathways (38Pessah I.N. Molinski T.F. Meloy T.D. Wong P. Buck E.D. Allen P.D. Mohr F.C. Mack M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 41: C601-C614Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 2 D shows that sMCa (20 nm) significantly decreased the loading capacity of SR vesicles, and this effect was abolished by ruthenium red at a concentration previously shown to completely block RyR1 in this assay (39Mack M.M. Zimanyi I. Pessah I.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 1028-1037PubMed Google Scholar). This provides additional evidence that sMCa selectively activates RyR1 with no measurable effects on either leak channels or SERCA pumps. pA was initially reported to enhance the binding of [3H]ryanodine to RyR1 in the concentration range of 1–50 μm (13El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J.P. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here, an unexpected result was that pA (2–40 μm) failed to induce Ca2+ release from actively loaded SR membrane vesicles, but instead ≥5 μm caused the base line of the dye signal to gradually decline (Fig. 3 A,traces 3 and 4). This observation provided the impetus to examine the possible RyR1-inhibitory activity of pA. Indeed, pA (2–10 μm) introduced into the transport medium 2 min before bolus addition of 60 μmCa2+ dose-dependently inhibited Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 3 A). pA also inhibited caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 1.5 μm; Fig. 3 B). It is worth noting that 5 μm pA completely inhibited caffeine-induced Ca2+ release, in agreement with the recent report in which micromolar pA was shown to decrease P o of single channels reconstituted in bilayer lipid membranes (12Stange M. Tripathy A. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1419-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, unlike the reported activating effect of submicromolar pA on single channelP o, we did not observe that pA, from submicromolar to micromolar concentrations (0.1–40 μm), was able to induce Ca2+ efflux from actively loaded SR. Additional experiments with a combination of pA and thapsigargin were performed to determine whether pA enhances Ca2+ release under passive conditions (in the absence of SERCA-mediated reuptake of Ca2+). After active Ca2+ loading of the SR vesicles was complete, pA (0.1–10 μm) failed to enhance thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release (not shown). Consistent with an inhibitory action on RyR1, 5–20 μm pA increased the loading capacity of SR in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C), and in support of distinct mechanisms of action, pA (≤10 μm) was found to inhibit sMCa-induced Ca2+ release in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 D). Since it is generally agreed that the amount of high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding measured in radioligand receptor analysis reflects the degree of channel activity, we examined how sMCa (0.01–300 nm) (Fig.4 A) or peptide A (0.03–50 μm) (Fig. 4 B) influenced occupancy.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5344-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that unphosphorylated EIICBGlc formed upon glucose uptake can relieve the repression of Mlc regulon by sequestering Mlc through direct protein-protein interaction (13Lee S.J. Boos W. Bouche J.P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O.

Our group found that glucose-induced expression of ptsG is enhanced significantly under heat shock and thus proposed that this enhancement may counteract the highly increased mlcexpression, whereby normal glucose metabolism is maintained even at high growth temperature (16Shin D. Lim S. Seok Y.J. Ryu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25871-25875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to the regulations at the transcriptional level, expression of ptsG is regulated post-transcriptionally via modulation of ptsG mRNA stability in response to glycolytic flux in the cells (17Kimata K. Tanaka Y. Inada T. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the expression of ptsG is regulated in a highly complex and dynamic manner in response to various growth environments, as well as to the availability of glucose. Several types of small DNA-binding proteins, known as nucleoid-associated or histone-like proteins, exist in E. coli (18Pettijohn D.E. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 158-166Google Scholar), among which Fis is the most abundant in exponentially growing cells (19Azam T.A. Iwata A. Nishimura A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacterol. 1999; 181: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fis is known to be involved in site-specific DNA recombination and participates in the regulation of growth-related genes, including those for rRNA, tRNA, and DNA replications (20Finkel S.E. Johnson R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It also regulates genes related to the catabolism of sugars and nucleic acids (21González-Gil G. Bringmann P. Kahmann R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The expression of fis is dependent on the growth phase of cells; the expressed fis mRNA reaches maximum level at the early exponential phase and then decreases rapidly (22Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacterol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fis exists at maximum over 50,000 molecules per cell, bringing about the assumption that Fis binds to every 200 to 300 bp of E. coli chromosomal DNA (19Azam T.A. Iwata A. Nishimura A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacterol. 1999; 181: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacterol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found several Fis-like sites, which are homologous to the known degenerate-consensus binding sequence of Fis upstream ofptsG gene. ptsG P1 transcription is induced by glucose in the wild-type (wt) strain (6Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the opposite effect of glucose on the ptsG P1 activity in fis mutant compared with wt raises the possibility that either Fis is involved in Mlc-mediated repression or CRP·cAMP-dependent activation of the promoter. We report here that E. coli can regulate the expression of ptsG prior to the modulation of other Mlc regulon because of the selective enhancement of Mlc-dependent repression, as well as CRP-dependent activation of ptsG in the presence of Fis. Cyclic AMP was obtained from Sigma. RNA polymerase saturated with ς70, nucleotide triphosphates, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]UTP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The cycle sequencing kit was from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). All E. coli strains used in this study are MC4100 (araD139 ΔargF-lacU169 rpsL150 thiA relA1 flb5301 deoC1 ptsF25 rbsR) derivatives. To construct a fis mutant strain, SR507,fis::Km region of SA37 strain (23Weinstein-Fischer D. Elgrably-Weiss M. Altuvia S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1413-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (a gift from S. Altuvia) was transferred into MC4100 by P1 transduction. SR504 (MC4100 ΔptsG::Cm) was made by P1 transduction of the CmR region of ZSC112LΔG strain (24Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from B. Erni). fis::Km was transferred into SR505 (MC4100 mlc::Tc) (16Shin D. Lim S. Seok Y.J. Ryu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25871-25875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and SR504, through which SR575 (MC4100 fis−mlc−) and SR574 (MC4100fis−ptsG−), respectively, were constructed. All strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (25Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) aerobically at 37 °C. Basic cloning protocols described by Sambrook and Russell (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) were used. PCR cloning of the ptsGpromoter was carried out using primers that have unique restriction sites in their sequences. The clone was verified by DNA sequencing. The supercoiled plasmid pGX12, containing the entire ptsGpromoter region, and pGX10, carrying only ptsG P1 promoter, were made by inserting DNA fragments from base pairs −305 to +132 and −75 to +132 between EcoRI and PstI sites in front of the rpoC terminator in plasmid pSA600, respectively (27Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C overnight in LB. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 into fresh LB with or without 1% glucose. Total RNA was isolated fromE. coli cells grown to mid-exponential phase (A600 = 0.5–0.6) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). To study ptsG transcription, 50,000 cpm of 32P-labeled primer PG1 (5′-AATTGAGAGTGCTCCTGAGTATGGGTGC-3′, complementary to +74 to +102) was coprecipitated with 30 μg of total cell RNA. Primer extension reactions were performed as described by Ryu and Garges (27Ryu S. Garges S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4767-4772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single-round in vitro transcription reactions were performed in a 20-μl total volume containing 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm GTP, 0.2 mm CTP, 0.02 mm UTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 2 nmsupercoiled DNA template, 5–20 nm RNA polymerase, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. Regulator proteins such as CRP, Mlc, or Fis were added to the reaction as described under “Results.” All components except nucleotides were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Transcription was started by the addition of nucleotides containing 200 μg/ml of heparin and terminated after 10 min by adding 20 μl of formamide loading buffer. RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea. The amounts of transcripts were measured using a phosphorimage analyzer (BAS2500; Fuji Photo Film Co.). A DNA fragment covering ptsG P1 promoter region was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers, PG1 and PGR3 (complementary to −54 to −78). PCR products were purified from 6% polyacrylamide gel as described by Sambrook and Russel (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Purified protein(s), DNA probe, and 50 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) were mixed in the same buffer used for in vitro transcription at a 15-μl total volume. The binding mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. In the reaction containing RNA polymerase, heparin (200 μg/ml) was added and further incubated for 5 min. The reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gel. In the reaction containing CRP·cAMP complex, 200 μm of cAMP was also added into the gel and the running buffer in the upper reservoir. DNA fragment carryingptsG promoter region was amplified by PCR using either 5′-end-labeled PG1 or PGR2 (5′-ATAACTTCGCCCGTCTGTTTCACATCG-3′, −248 to −222). The PCR product was purified using polyacrylamide gel. Purified protein(s) and DNA fragment were incubated in 40 μl of in vitro transcription assay buffer. Five microliters of DNase I solution (10 ng of DNase I per reaction) was added to the binding mixture, which was then placed at room temperature for 1 min. DNase I reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of stop solution containing 0.4 m sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA. After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in a sequencing dye and resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (2 nm), 20 nm RNA polymerase, and regulator proteins were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 20 μl of transcription buffer containing 100 mm each of two initiating nucleotides, ATP and UTP. After the addition of 2 μl of 100 mm KMnO4, the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 s at room temperature. To terminate the reaction, 2 μl of 14 m β-mercaptoethanol was added. The reaction was precipitated, and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in water, which was used as a template for five cycles of PCR with end-labeled PG1 primer (28Dumitru I. McNeil J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The PCR products were resolved on 6% sequencing gel. Two nmsupercoiled plasmid DNA and proteins were incubated in 40 μl of the transcription buffer. DMS methylation was started by adding 2.5 μl of DMS (150 mm). After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by adding β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of sodium acetate and salmon sperm DNA. The pellet was resuspended in water, which was used as a template for five cycles of PCR as described for the potassium permanganate assay. The PCR products were analyzed on 6% sequencing gel. Role of Fis on ptsG expression was examined by analyzing the effects of fis mutation on ptsGtranscription with various genetic backgrounds using primer extension assay. When wt was grown in the absence of glucose, only the basal level of ptsG P1 expression was observed, whereas P1 promoter activity was highly induced in cells grown in the presence of glucose (Fig. 1A). However, the effect of glucose on ptsG P1 expression was reversed in the fis− strain. ptsG P1 expression in fis− strain grown in the absence of glucose was markedly increased compared with wt (Fig. 1A,lanes 1 and 2) and was reduced in the presence of glucose. These results suggest that Fis is required for both the repression of ptsG P1 by Mlc and the activation ofptsG P1 under limited concentration of CRP·cAMP (6Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the interaction between Mlc and EIICBGlc was not affected by Fis, because the P1 expression also increased in the absence of Fis, even in ptsG mutant that cannot produce EIICBGlc (Fig. 1B, lane 2). These observations imply that Fis is involved directly in the Mlc binding and/or repression of ptsG P1 promoter. It is possible that Fis also assists CRP-dependent activation of ptsG P1, because P1 promoter activity decreased markedly in the fis− strain when cells were grown in the presence of glucose (Fig. 1A,lanes 3 and 4). The effect was not dependent on Mlc, because the ptsG P1 promoter activity high inmlc mutant also decreased in mlc andfis double mutant regardless of the presence of glucose (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–8). We also determined the effect of exogenous cAMP on ptsG P1 expression in thefis−mlc− strain based on the report of González-Gil et al. (29González-Gil G. Kahmann R. Muskhelishvili G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) thatcrp expression is increased in fis−strain. However, cAMP addition to the medium did not restore the P1 promoter activity (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and8), and the level of mlc expression was not changed in the fis− strain compared with wt (data not shown). These results imply that reduction of the CRP-dependent P1 expression in the fis mutant cannot be explained by changes in the level of either Mlc or CRP·cAMP. Furthermore, the reduction of ptsG P1 transcription in the fis−mlc− strain grown without glucose was lower than that in the fis− strain grown in the presence of glucose (Fig. 1). Thus, Fis effect is more prominent in the CRP-dependent ptsG P1 transcription activation under limited intracellular concentration of CRP·cAMP. In the case of ptsG P2 expression, the P2 promoter activity was also induced by glucose (Fig. 1A) (7Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and increased in the fis mutant (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and4). These results suggest that ptsG P2 transcription is inhibited by Fis, as well as Mlc, in vivo. To examine whether Fis influencesptsG expression directly, we performed DNase I footprinting assay using ptsG promoter DNA region from −248 to +103 (all numberings in this study are based on the transcription start site of the ptsG P1 promoter as shown in Fig.2). At least five putative Fis-binding sites were found on the ptsG promoter DNA (see Figs. 2 and3), each of which showed high homology with the Fis-binding sequence (20Finkel S.E. Johnson R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3257-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 30Hengen P.N. Bartram S.L. Stewart L.E. Schneider T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fis sites I and II, centered at positions +3 and −19, respectively, were detected between +18 and −32 of the ptsG promoter region. Fis site II was positioned between the CRP and Mlc sites of the P1 promoter, and Fis site I partially overlapped the Mlc site, as well as the P1 transcription start site (Fig. 2B). Fis occupied from positions −65 to −90 (site III), which overlapped CRP site II centered at position −95. Fis also protected DNA from positions −105 to −130 (site IV), and Fis site V centered at −145 overlapped the P2 promoter (see Figs.2 and 3).Figure 3DNase I footprinting analysis. Effect of Fis on the binding of Mlc and CRP at the ptsG promoter is shown. The ptsG promoter DNA fragment, end-labeled on the lower strand, was incubated with individual regulator proteins or in combinations as shown at the bottom of the figure. The products were analyzed on 8% acrylamide gel containing 8 murea. Final concentrations of the proteins were 20, 60, and 10 nm CRP, Fis, and Mlc, respectively. The protection regions by the binding of proteins are indicated with vertical lineson the right side of the figure. The positions of the two hypersensitive cleavages by CRP binding are shown witharrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two CRP sites have been identified at the ptsG promoter. We observed two hypersensitive bands upon CRP·cAMP binding at CRP site I centered at −40.5, which is a typical pattern of CRP binding (Fig. 3,lane 4) (31Spassky A. Busby S. Buc H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is likely that both CRP·cAMP and Fis could bind to the ptsG P1, because the two bands, which appeared upon CRP·cAMP binding, remained, and DNA protection by Fis at sites I and II was maintained in the presence of both CRP·cAMP and Fis (Fig. 3). CRP·cAMP bound at CRP site II protected DNA from −85 to −105. In the presence of both CRP·cAMP and Fis, the hypersensitive cleavage site around −90 generated by Fis binding at site III disappeared, suggesting the possibility that these two proteins compete for the binding sites (Fig. 3, lane 3). However, the relevance of CRP binding at site II in ptsGexpression has not yet been fully elucidated (6Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fis sites I and II partially overlapped Mlc site I located at −8. Presence of Mlc protected DNA between +5 and −17 from DNase I attack (Fig. 3, lane 6). Fis and Mlc could bind simultaneously to the P1 promoter, even though their binding sites overlapped. The weak bands remaining around the Mlc binding site in the presence of Fis were further weakened by Mlc addition (Fig. 3B, comparelanes 2 and 5). At the same time, Fis binding at sites I and II was observed clearly in the presence of Mlc as shown by the protection of two bands around positions −32 and +18 (Fig. 3). When all three regulators, Fis, CRP, and Mlc, were present a similar DNase I cleavage pattern observed between Fis and CRP and between Fis and Mlc was reproduced (Fig. 3, lane 8). These findings suggest that all these proteins could bind to ptsG P1 promoter simultaneously, forming a highly ordered protein·DNA complex. We also examined the effect of Fis and CRP·cAMP on RNA polymerase binding toptsG P1 using DMS footprinting experiment. When Fis was incubated with supercoiled pGX12 carrying both P1 and P2 promoters ofptsG, Fis binding to site I protected guanine residues at −5 and +11 but increased DMS reactivity of −3 G. Fis binding at site II also generated characteristic changes in DMS reactivity atptsG P1 promoter, increasing reactivity at −25 G and near −20 G (Fig. 4). Binding of CRP·cAMP to site I completely protected G residues at −47, −45, and −38 (Fig. 4,lane 7). Consistent with our DNase I footprinting experiment, DMS reactivity patterns at the P1 promoter shown in the presence of either Fis or CRP·cAMP were retained in the presence of both Fis and CRP·cAMP (Fig. 4, lane 10). Addition of RNA polymerase alone did not change DMS reactivity at the ptsGP1 promoter, and the presence of Fis showed no effect on RNA polymerase binding to the P1 promoter (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 3,5, and 6). However, strong protection of G residues at −5 and −3 by RNA polymerase binding was detected in the presence CRP·cAMP (Fig. 4, lanes 8 and 9). When Fis, CRP·cAMP, and RNA polymerase were added at various combinations, complete protection of −5 G and significant reduction of DMS reactivity at −3 G was observed, whereas DMS reactivity at +11 G was restored (Fig. 4). However, the altered DMS reactivity by Fis binding to site II and CRP binding to site I was retained under the same condition. These results strongly suggest that ptsG P1 promoter can be occupied simultaneously by CRP·cAMP (at site I), Fis (at site II), and RNA polymerase, but Fis bound to site I is excluded by RNA polymerase in the presence of CRP·cAMP. Influence of Fis on the Mlc repression ofptsG P1 was studied through in vitrotranscription assay. Addition of Mlc reduced the CRP-activated P1 promoter activity to 50% of its full activity (Fig.5A). However, the P1 activity was repressed further to 32% when both Mlc and Fis were added to the reaction. The effect was specific to ptsG P1, because the repression of ptsH P0 promoter activity by Mlc was not affected by Fis (data not shown). These findings, together with the DNase I footprinting results, strongly suggest that more effective repression of the ptsG P1 activity could be accomplished through the formation of nucleoprotein complex containing Fis atptsG P1. We also investigated the effect of Fis on CRP-dependent transcription activation of ptsG using in vitrotranscription assay. ptsG P1 is known as a typical class II CRP-dependent promoter (6Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase alone could not initiate transcription from the P1 promoter, and the addition of Fis showed no effect on the P1 transcription (Fig. 5B). However, P1 transcription was activated in the presence of CRP·cAMP, and Fis further increased CRP-activated transcription of P1 (Fig.5B). However, Fis did not affect the activation ofptsH P0 by CRP·cAMP (data not shown). In the case of P2 promoter, 308-nucleotide transcripts were made from the P2 promoter regardless of the CRP·cAMP presence in the reactions (Fig. 5B). As expected from DNase I footprinting experiment, addition of Fis repressed transcription initiation at P2 promoter, which suggests that Fis binding at site V represses the P2 promoter activity. To analyze the effect of Fis on theptsG transcription, open complex formation at the promoter was probed with potassium permanganate. When RNA polymerase was incubated with supercoiled pGX12 carrying the entire ptsGpromoter region, open complex was not formed at ptsG P1 regardless of the presence of Fis in the reaction. Addition of CRP·cAMP increased the KMnO4 reactivity at positions +2, −2, and −6, and the KMnO4 reactivity of these bases were further increased in the presence of both CRP·cAMP and Fis (Fig.6A). These results show that Fis can enhance CRP-dependent open complex formation atptsG P1 promoter, resulting in the increased transcription initiation at the promoter. Fis sites I and II were sufficient to show the Fis effect on the open complex formation at P1 promoter. Fis could enhance CRP-dependent open complex formation at ptsG P1 promoter, even when DNA containing only Fis site I and site II (pGX10) was used as a template (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 7,8, and 9). Similar results were obtained through gel shift assay using DNA fragment ranging from −78 to +102 ofptsG promoter. Incubation of either Fis or CRP·cAMP with the DNA probe generated a single retarded band (Fig. 6B). When both Fis and CRP·cAMP were present in the reaction, Fis·DNA complex disappeared, whereas Fis·CRP·DNA complex was observed, an indication that Fis and CRP could bind simultaneously to the promoter region (Fig. 6B, lane 4). Incubation of the DNA probe with RNA polymerase only and subsequent heparin challenge did not generate any RNA polymerase·DNA complex as expected from KMnO4 reactivity assay (Fig. 6B, lane 5). When the same reaction was done in the presence of CRP·cAMP, a heparin-resistant complex was detected, which was further increased by the addition of Fis (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 7and 8). However, addition of Fis only showed no effect on the stable RNA polymerase·DNA complex formation. These results suggest that CRP binding to site I is sufficient for the effective open complex formation at ptsG P1 promoter, and Fis binding to sites I and II can coactivate ptsG P1 transcription with CRP·cAMP. In this report, we demonstrate that two different types of nucleoprotein complexes containing Fis are formed at ptsG P1 promoter in response to glucose in the growth medium for optimal regulation of ptsG transcription. Several lines of evidences suggest that Fis assists both repression by Mlc and activation by CRP·cAMP of the ptsG P1. Mlc site I is located between Fis sites I and II and partially overlaps both sites. Fis and Mlc could bind simultaneously to their binding sites of ptsG promoter (Fig. 3), and Mlc showed better repression of ptsG P1 in the presence of Fis (Fig. 5). It is possible that Mlc and Fis repress ptsG P1 independently; however, their effects are additive, because we could not detect cooperative binding between Fis and Mlc to their respective binding sites (data not shown). Corepression of ptsG P1 by Fis and Mlc is distinct from the mechanism described by Nasser et al. (32Nasser W. Schneider R. Travers A. Muskhelishvili G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17878-17886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that one of the two divergent promoters is repressed by either Fis or CRP. CRP·cAMP binding to site I centered at −40.5 is essential for the activation of ptsG P1 promoter, a typical class II CRP-dependent promoter (33Busby S. Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 34Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Fis further increased CRP-dependent transcription of ptsG P1 promoter (Fig. 5). However, Fis alone showed no effect on the transcription initiation at P1 promoter. Our KMnO4 reactivity assay demonstrated that the increased ptsG P1 transcription initiation by Fis results from enhanced open complex formation at the promoter in the presence of both CRP·cAMP and Fis (Fig. 6). Moreover, nucleoprotein complex formations on CRP site I and Fis site II are responsible for the increased open complex formation at ptsGP1 promoter, because Fis could increase the open complex formation, even when the shortened ptsG promoter without the Fis sites III, IV, and V was used as a DNA template (Fig. 6), and Fis binding to site I was excluded upon RNA polymerase binding to the P1 promoter in the presence of CRP·cAMP (Fig. 4). Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first case known in class II CRP-dependent promoter that Fis assists CRP-dependent transcription. This is different from the coactivation of proP P2 promoter by Fis and CRP·cAMP, where the CRP binding occurs at −121 (35McLeod S.M. Xu J. Johnson R.C. J. Bacterol. 2000; 182: 4180-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We are presently attempting to elucidate the mechanisms of how Fis assists CRP-dependent activation, because no evidence of cooperative binding could be found between Fis and CRP. What is the biological significance of these findings inptsG expression? As E. coli cells are grown in the presence of glucose, ptsG expression is highly induced, because Mlc action is relieved via direct interaction with unphosphorylated EIICBGlc during the glucose transport (13Lee S.J. Boos W. Bouche J.P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5344-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, transport of glucose into the cells results in the reduction of both CRP and cAMP (36Ishizuka H. Hnamura A. Kunimura T. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the level of ptsGexpression is a sum of the two effects, i.e. derepression of Mlc and catabolite repression upon glucose uptake. Plumbridge (7Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported that ptsG expression in wt grown with glucose was 42% compared with that in mlc− strain grown with glycerol, which indicates the degree of catabolite repression in this gene. The level of ptsG expression during E. coli growth on glucose appears to be sufficient to derepress Mlc action completely, considering that the level of ptsGexpression was almost equal in both mlc+ andmlc− cells grown in the presence of glucose (7Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Regulation of manXYZ, one of the Mlc regulon, is mediated also by CRP·cAMP and Mlc (10Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CRP binding to −40.5 ofmanX promoter, which has been categorized as a class II CRP-dependent promoter, is essential for its expression (10Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Other than ptsG, manX regulation is subject to more severe catabolite repression upon glucose uptake; the promoter activity in mlc+ cells grown with glucose was no less than 20% of mlc− cells grown with glycerol (10Plumbridge J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that Fis can alleviate catabolite repression on ptsG P1 through the formation of coactivating complex with CRP in cells grown with glucose. On the other hand, upon glucose depletion in the medium, the phosphorylated form of EIICBGlc begins to appear, after which Mlc is free from sequestration by EIICBGlc (14Nam T.W. Cho S.H. Shin D. Kim J.H. Jeong J.Y. Lee J.H. Roe J.H. Peterkofsky A. Kang S.O. Ryu S. Seok Y.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Under this circumstance, Mlc may bind more preferentially to ptsG P1 promoter than to other competing promoters through the interaction with Fis·CRP nucleoprotein complex already formed at the promoter region. Consequently, this selective shut-off of ptsG expression will lead to the efficient repression in other Mlc-regulated genes. Speculating that ptsG expression triggers cascades of gene expressions for glucose uptake, Fis facilitates rapid adaptation ofE. coli to different nutritional environment through the formation of nucleoprotein complex with either CRP·cAMP in the presence of glucose or Mlc in the absence of glucose. We are grateful to Drs. B. Erni and S. Altuvia for gifts of bacterial strains and to Dr. Y. H. Lee for providing purified Fis protein."

In a process termedtrans-translation, tmRNA acts first as a tRNA, being aminoacylated at its 3′ end with alanine by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) (4Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3392-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and adding an alanine to the stalled polypeptide chain. Resumption of translation ensues not on the mRNA on which the ribosomes were stalled but at an internal position in tmRNA. Translation termination occurs and permits ribosome recycling.trans-Translation plays at least two physiological roles in bacteria: removing ribosomes stalled upon mRNAs and tagging the resulting truncated proteins for degradation. Because tmRNA is unique to prokaryotes and is required for viability of some bacteria, it has attracted the attention of those interested in novel targets for antibiotic therapy. tmRNA has to be aminoacylated before directing the addition of a peptide tag to the problematic protein. Moreover, in Neisseria gonorrhoea, and probably also in other bacteria, tmRNA aminoacylation is essential for resolving stalled translation complexes and preventing depletion of free ribosomes (6Huang C. Wolfgang M.C. Withey J. Koomey M. Friedman D.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1098-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas tagging for proteolysis is dispensable. tmRNA aminoacylation is therefore an attractive target for blockingtrans-translation in the pathogenic bacteria responsible for infectious diseases. The interactions of aminoglycosides with RNAs represent a paradigm in the use of small molecules as effectors of RNA function. Aminoglycosides bind and modulate the function of a variety of therapeutically useful RNA targets (for a review, see Ref. 7Schroeder R. Waldsich C. Wank H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and show antimicrobial as well as antiviral activities. Aminoglycoside antibiotics disrupt the bacterial membrane and induce miscoding during prokaryotic protein synthesis by binding to the ribosomal A site (8Green R. Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 679-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). They also interfere with translational control (9Tok J.B. Cho J. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and with human immunodeficiency virus replication (10Zapp M.L. Stern S. Green M.R.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) evidence indicates that aminoglycosides can bind and inhibit the aminoacylation of two canonical tRNAs: Escherichia coli tRNAPhe and yeast tRNAAsp. The crystal structure of yeast tRNAPhe in complex with neomycin B reveals that the aminoglycoside binds in the deep groove below the d-loop. Inhibition of aminoacylation of tRNAs is proposed to be either because the aminoglycoside interferes with the interaction between the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and its cognate tRNA through its binding to major recognition elements (the phenylalanine system) (17Mikkelsen N.E. Johansson K. Virtanen A. Kirsebom L.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or via a conformational change of the RNA (the acid aspartic system) (18Walter F. Putz J. Giege R. Westhof E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For the alanine system, aminoacylation is determined by a single G3·U70 pair (19Francklyn C. Schimmel P. Nature. 1989; 337: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and also by minor identity elements including the discriminator base A73 and a G2·C71 pair. This limited set of nucleotides (see Fig. 1, A and B, circled nucleotides) is conserved in all of the 293 tmRNA genes that have been sequenced (20Williams K.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). tmRNA is a partial structural mimic of canonical tRNAs thanks to the presence of an acceptor stem, a T-stem loop, and a D-analog (21Felden B. Gillet R. Metzinger L. Ibba M. Francklyn C. Kusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, KY2003Google Scholar). tmRNA is, however, ∼5-fold bigger compared with canonical tRNAs, contains several pseudoknots and an internal open reading frame, probably lacks most of the key tertiary interactions present in tRNAs, and does not contain an anticodon stem-loop. Here, we report that several aminoglycosides interact with tmRNA with affinity and specificity, preventing its aminoacylation with alanine. The tRNA-like domain of tmRNA is altered upon aminoglycoside binding. Chemical footprints in solution have explored the structural basis of the interaction between tmRNA and several aminoglycosides. trans-Translation is therefore a novel target for aminoglycosides. Alkaline phosphatase and T4 polynucleotide kinase are from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). T4 RNA ligase was from Invitrogen. RNases S1, V1, U2, and T1 were from Amersham Biosciences. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol) and [α-32P]pCp (3000 mCi/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. E. coli tmRNA (22Felden B. Himeno H. Muto A. McCutcheon J.P. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F.

Feldon, unpublished results. were overexpressed in E. coli cells and purified as described. Appropriate bands were electroeluted, and pure RNAs were recovered by ethanol precipitation. Total tRNAs from E. coli are from Sigma-Aldrich. PurifiedE. coli tRNAAlaUGC was a gift from Dr. R. Gillet (Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK). Recombinant alanyl-tRNA synthetase was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), and purity was confirmed on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Five independent protein purifications were required. The final protein concentration ranged from 0.5 to 3.5 μm. The assays were performed at 20 or 37 °C in a medium containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP ([MgCl2]/[ATP] = 5), 0.05 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 42–59 μml-[14C]alanine (170 mCi/mmol), and 50–330 nm purified E. coli AlaRS. When varying the pH from 5.5 to 9.5, 50 mm MES was used for pH 5.5, and 50 mm Tris-HCl was used for pH levels from 6.5 to 9.5. Usually, 1 μm of tmRNA or tmRNA-TLD was denatured for 3 min at 75 °C followed by 10 min at room temperature. Then 1 μm of purified E. coli His6-tagged SmpB and/or His6-tagged EF-Tu·GDP and/or EF-Tu·GTP were added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. All of the proteins were at least 98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. EF-Tu·GDP was activated to EF-Tu·GTP immediately before use by incubation at 37 °C for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 7 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NH4Cl complemented with 100 μm GTP, 6 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, and 10 μg/ml of pyruvate kinase. After the incubation, the mixture was kept on ice before use. Various concentrations of aminoglycosides were added, followed by the aminoacylation buffer, the labeled alanine, and the AlaRS. The aliquots were spotted onto 3MM Whatman papers at different times, and precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) in the presence and absence of aminoglycosides were performed under steady-state conditions of enzyme (50–330 nm AlaRS) and substrate concentrations of tmRNA (0.5–3.4 μm) or tmRNA-TLD (0.5–6 μm) and determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. These experimental conditions were also applied for tmRNA aminoacylation in the presence of all tRNAs from E. coli. The progressive melting of tmRNA and tmRNA-TLD was monitored by following their UV absorbency at 258 nm as a function of temperature on a UVIKONXL (Bio-tek Instruments) equipped with a temperature regulator and with a six-cell holder. The temperature was increased gradually at 0.5 °C/min from 15 to 93 °C. The measurements were done in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 5.8), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2 for tmRNA-TLD and in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 5.8), 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 for tmRNA in the absence and presence of 500 μm neomycin B, 10 mm tobramycin, and 2 mm paromomycin. Labeling at the 5′ ends of tmRNA and tmRNA-TLD were performed with [γ-32P]ATP and phage T4 polynucleotide kinase on RNA dephosphorylated previously with alkaline phosphatase. Labeling at their 3′ ends was carried out by ligation of [γ-32P]pCp using T4 RNA ligase. After labeling, tmRNA was gel-purified (5% PAGE), eluted, and ethanol-precipitated. Labeled tmRNA was heated 2 min at 80 °C and slowly cooled down for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction mixtures (15 μl) contained 200,000 cpm of 32P-labeled tmRNA or tmRNA-TLD and increasing amounts of aminoglycosides (50–500 μm of neomycin B, 0–1000 μm of paromomycin, and 0–6 mm of tobramycin) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. After an incubation of 10 min at room temperature, ENU, lead-acetate, or iron-EDTA were added: 6.25 μl of a solution of ENU saturated in 100% EtOH supplemented with 1 μg of total tRNA; 0.3 mm of lead acetate supplemented with 2.5 μg of total tRNA and 1 mg/ml of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 5 mm EDTA, and 12.5 mm dithiothreitol; and 0.25% H2O2 supplemented with 2 μg of total tRNA for iron-EDTA mapping (a quick centrifuge spin mixed all four chemicals deposited at four locations inside the Eppendorf tube). The incubation times were 4 h at 37 °C for ENU, 7 min at 37 °C for lead acetate, and 10 min at 0 °C for iron-EDTA footprints. RNAs are ethanol-precipitated, and the pellets are washed twice with 80% EtOH, dried, and counted. Then the RNA fragments are submitted to 8 or 12% PAGE. The results were analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). During lead mapping of tmRNA in the presence of either tobramycin or paromomycin, we noticed that gradually increasing the concentration of the aminoglycosides increases the ratio of the uncleaved versus the cleaved RNA. Modifying the lead concentration, the incubation times, or the amount of total RNA added during the reaction could solve the issue. Because the overall conformation of tmRNA changes in the presence of both aminoglycosides, the conformation of tmRNA in the presence of the aminoglycosides might be less sensitive to the action of the structural probe. Aminoacylation experiments with purifiedE. coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase were performed on two RNAs purified in vivo: tmRNA from E. coli (363 nucleotides; Fig. 1A) and tmRNA-TLD (61 nucleotides; Fig. 1B), a shorter RNA recapitulating the tRNA-like domain of tmRNA. tmRNA-TLD is capable of being aminoacylated with alanine in vitro.2 The structures of the six aminoglycosides tested are shown in Fig. 1C. Aminoglycosides are subdivided into three major families (23Walter F. Vincens Q. Westhof E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and representatives of each family were tested. Paromomycin and neomycin B belong to the neomycin family; amikacin, tobramycin, and kanamycin A are members of the kanamycin family; and gentamicin represents the gentamicin family. All six aminoglycosides inhibit aminoacylation of tmRNA with alanine, in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2). In the presence of each aminoglycoside, the decrease of aminoacylation is not a consequence of tmRNA or tmRNA-TLD degradation (not shown). Neomycin B is the most efficient inhibitor, with apparent inhibition constants (Ki) of ∼35 μm for tmRNA-TLD and ∼70 μm for tmRNA (Fig. 2 and TableI). Neomycin B inhibits the aminoacylation of tmRNA-TLD with alanine at a ∼30-fold lower concentration than that required to inhibit tRNAAlaaminoacylation (Table I). Paromomycin, gentamicin, and amikacin are also potent inhibitors, whereas kanamycin A and tobramycin are modest ones, with a substantial difference in activity between the two RNAs (kanamycin A and tobramycin have no measurable Ki on tmRNA-TLD alanylation). Compared with tmRNA, aminoacylation of tmRNA-TLD is half-inhibited at ∼2-fold higher concentrations of paromomycin, gentamicin, and amikacin (the opposite effect is observed for neomycin B). Aminoacylation with alanine of a tRNAAlatranscript can also be altered by these aminoglycosides, but the inhibition constants are 3–15-fold higher than that of tmRNA. Amikacin, kanamycin A, and tobramycin have related structures (Fig.1C), although different inhibition constants (Table I), especially between amikacin and the two others. Between amikacin and tobramycin, the only differences are at positions R1 and R2 (Fig.1C). Therefore, the chemical groups substituted at positions R1 and/or R2 of amikacin are responsible for its lowerKi. Replacing a hydroxyl group (paromomycin) by an amino group (neomycin B) decreases the Ki for tmRNA 3-fold (Table I), indicating that a minor modification on the chemical structure of an aminoglycoside can significantly increase its inhibitory activity on tmRNA aminoacylation. All of the subsequent functional and structural investigations were conducted using three representatives, neomycin B, and paromomycin as potent inhibitors and tobramycin as a modest inhibitor of tmRNA aminoacylation.Table IKi values of the inhibition of aminoacylation of tmRNA, tmRNA-TLD, and tRNAAlaUGC by six aminoglycosidesRNAstmRNAtmRNA-TLDtRNAAlaUGCNeomycin B70 ± 2035 ± 151000 ± 200Paromomycin225 ± 75500 ± 1001000 ± 100Gentamicin400 ± 100700 ± 1001500 ± 100Amikacin450 ± 200900 ± 1001500 ± 100Kanamycin A1400 ± 500NMNMTobramycin1600 ± 500NM2000 ± 100Ki (μm) is defined as the concentration resulting in half inhibition of aminoacylation.

Each value reported is the average of three to six independent experiments, and was calculated from plots as shown in Fig. 2. NM, nonmeasurable. Purified tRNAAla transcript is the isoacceptor with a UGC anticodon. The number of charged amino groups is important for inhibition of RNA function by aminoglycosides. Neomycin B has six protonatable amino groups; their corresponding pKa values are indicated in Fig. 1C. In most cases, inhibition of RNA function by aminoglycosides depends on the number of charged amino groups (24Vicens Q. Westhof E. Structure. 2001; 9: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). tmRNA-TLD inhibition by neomycin B (at its Ki of 50 μm) was monitored at five different pH levels (5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5), centered on pH 7.5, which was used in our assays (not shown). At pH 7.5, neomycin B inhibits 50% of aminoacylation; when pH increases up to 9.5, neomycin B has no inhibitory effect on aminoacylation (the amino groups are mostly deprotonated). At pH 8.5, 70% of aminoacylation is detected; when pH decreases to 6.5 and 5.5, inhibition of aminoacylation by neomycin B is more efficient, leaving only 35 and 20% residual aminoacylation, respectively. Therefore, inhibition of tmRNA aminoacylation by neomycin B depends on the number of charged amino groups and suggests that complex formation between tmRNA and neomycin B is mainly driven by electrostatic interactions. ATP is required during the first step of all the aminoacylation reactions to form the activated aminoacyl-adenylate (in our case an alanyl-adenylate). Therefore, aminoglycosides could bind specifically to the catalytic site of E. coli AlaRS as structural analogs of ATP. To test this hypothesis, increasing concentrations of ATP from 1 to 64 mm were added in the aminoacylation reaction of tmRNA-TLD with and without 500 μm paromomycin and in the aminoacylation reaction of tmRNA with or without 2 mm of tobramycin ([MgCl2] is kept constant at 20 mm). Increasing the concentration of ATP does not relieve the inhibitory effect caused by the two aminoglycosides on the aminoacylation of both RNAs (not shown). Thus, neither paromomycin nor tobramycin function as structural analogs of ATP in the aminoacylation reaction of tmRNA-TLD and tmRNA with alanine, respectively. The Michaelis-Menten parameters of tmRNA-TLD and tmRNA aminoacylation with alanine in the absence and presence of neomycin B, paromomycin, or tobramycin have been determined (TableII). In the absence of aminoglycosides, the Km for tmRNA-TLD and tmRNA are essentially the same (5–6 μm), but theVmax for tmRNA aminoacylation is 1 order of magnitude lower than that of tmRNA-TLD (Table II). Compared with tmRNA, the smaller size of tmRNA-TLD may allow a faster turnover of the substrate during the aminoacylation reaction. For both RNAs, gradually increasing the concentration of either neomycin B (from 15 to 60 μm for tmRNA-TLD), paromomycin (from 50 to 500 μm for tmRNA and from 100 to 1000 μm for tmRNA-TLD), or tobramycin (from 1 to 3 mm for tmRNA and from 3 to 10 mm for tmRNA-TLD) increases the Km up to 30-fold (TableII), but the Vmax also increases (not shown). Alanylation is not completely inhibited at saturating antibiotic concentration; there is significant residual aminoacylation level at antibiotic saturation with tmRNA-TLD and in the presence of amikacin and kanamycin A with tmRNA (Fig. 2). Thus, the inhibition of tmRNA aminoacylation by aminoglycosides is neither competitive nor non competitive; therefore the Ki values could not be measured.Table IIKinetic parameters of tmRNA-TLD and tmRNA aminoacylation with alanine in the presence of aminoglycosidesRNAsKmVmaxμmnms−1tmRNA-TLD Alone5.5 ± 33 ± 2 With + neomycin B180 ± 206 ± 3 With + paromomycin23 ± 54 ± 3 With + tobramycin26 ± 53 ± 2tmRNA Alone6 ± 30.3 ± 0.15 With paromomycin13 ± 30.3 ± 0.1 With tobramycin30 ± 50.4 ± 0.1Kinetic parameters represent the averages of several experiments using independent enzyme purifications.

For this experiment, we selected paromomycin at a concentration corresponding to its apparent inhibition constant for tmRNA alanylation (Table I). Native tRNAAla isoacceptors represent ∼6% of the total tRNA population in E. coli (25Dong H. Nilsson L. Kurland C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In all of the tRNAs fromE. coli, up to 60% of the tRNAAla isoacceptors are able to charge alanine (100% of charging is not observed probably because our calculated number of tRNAAla present in the mixture is overestimated; alternatively, a fraction of tRNAAla might be degraded). In the presence of all tRNAs from E. coli, there is no inhibition on the aminoacylation of the tRNA alanine isoacceptors (Table III). This result is consistent with the fact that purified tRNAAla UGC transcript has a ∼4-fold higher Ki for paromomycin, compared with tmRNA (Table I). When tmRNA is mixed with all of the tRNAs fromE. coli, paromomycin decreases the aminoacylation level, even in the presence of a 10-fold excess of total tRNAs (Table III). Because paromomycin at that concentration has no effect on the alanylation of the tRNAs, the decrease in tmRNA aminoacylation with alanine is responsible for the overall decrease in the charging levels of the RNA mixture containing both tRNAs and tmRNA. Thus, paromomycin can inhibit tmRNA alanylation in the presence of all of the tRNAs from E. coli.Table IIIInhibition of tmRNA aminoacylation with alanine by an aminoglycoside in the presence of all E. coli tRNAsAminoacylation3-aCharging levels were obtained for 30 min of incubation in the presence of equivalent amounts of purified AlaRS; when both tmRNA and tRNAs were present, charging is calculated as the percentage of all RNAs aminoacylatable with alanine, without considering mischarging.Without paromomycinWith 250 μm paromomycin%100 pmol of tmRNA37 ± 121 ± 0.9100 pmol ofE. coli tRNAs3-bE. coli tRNAs are all the 46 isoacceptors; the numbers in parentheses correspond to the number of isoacceptors tRNAAla in the mixture (25) that can be aminoacylated with alanine.

Open table in a new tab Positively charged ammonium groups of aminoglycosides match negatively charged metal ion-binding pockets in RNA three-dimensional structures, displacing divalent metal ions (26Hermann T. Westhof E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recent structural (17Mikkelsen N.E. Johansson K. Virtanen A. Kirsebom L.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and functional (18Walter F. Putz J. Giege R. Westhof E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) data indicate that the rule also applies for specific interactions between canonical tRNAs and aminoglycosides. If true for tmRNA, inhibition of tmRNA aminoacylation by aminoglycosides might be overcome by increasing the magnesium concentration. The [Mg2+]/[ATP] ratio was kept constant at 5, as in the previous aminoacylation assays, because it affects the specificity and efficiency of the aminoacylation reaction (27Giegé R. Kern D. Ebel J.P. Taglang R. FEBS Lett. 1971; 15: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The magnesium ion concentration was gradually increased, and the aminoacylation of tmRNA-TLD and tmRNA, with and without paromomycin and tobramycin, respectively, was measured (Fig. 3, A andB). In the presence of paromomycin, aminoacylation of tmRNA-TLD slightly increases up to 20 mm[Mg2+], whereas in the presence of tobramycin, aminoacylation of tmRNA show almost no difference up to 10 mm [Mg2+]. At higher magnesium concentrations, the aminoacylation plateau decreases for both RNAs with and without aminoglycosides, probably because elevated magnesium concentrations start degrading the RNAs (not shown). Therefore, for both RNA-aminoglycoside interactions, increasing the magnesium concentration during the aminoacylation reaction cannot rescue the inhibitory effect caused by the aminoglycosides on aminoacylation. Using lead acetate as a probe, we performed a footprinting experiment between 500 μm neomycin B and labeled tmRNA-TLD at various magnesium concentrations (1, 2, 5, and 10 mm; not shown). The result is that the footprints do not depend on magnesium concentration and therefore strengthen our claim that magnesium does not rescue aminoglycoside inhibition. SmpB (smallprotein B) and EF-Tu·GTP both enhance alanine accepting activity of tmRNA, and SmpB protects the 3′ end of Ala-tmRNA against enzymatic degradation (28Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Takagi M. Inokuchi H. Himeno H. Muto A.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 1 μm of tmRNA with post-transcriptional modifications charges alanine to 26% on average, but there is a half-increase in charging when either 1 μm of purified SmpB or 1 μm of purified EF-Tu·GTP is present (Fig.4, inset). A 2-fold increase is observed when both proteins are present at 1 μm. This indicates that in our aminoacylation assays, both SmpB and EF-Tu·GTP bind tmRNA and enhance its aminoacylation with alanine. With EF-Tu·GDP, the charging level of tmRNA is not significantly affected, but when in the presence of SmpB, the aminoacylation plateau also increases 2-fold (Fig. 4, inset). We verified by native gel shift assays that SmpB, EF-Tu·GTP, and EF-Tu·GDP bind deacylated tmRNA (not shown). In the presence of an equimolar ratio of SmpB, neomycin B can still inhibit aminoacylation, but theKi increases 1.5-fold, compared with tmRNA alone. In the presence of EF-Tu·GTP, the Kiincreases 5-fold; in the presence of both proteins, theKi increases 10-fold, compared with tmRNA alone (F"

In contrast to V38R-Ras, N43R-Ras did not alter the kinetics of the Tg- and CCK8-induced Ca2+ rises. The present findings are compatible with the idea that V38R-Ras expression increases the passive leak of Ca2+ of the store leading to a decrease in Ca2+ content of this store, which, in turn, leads to a decrease in frequency of the CCK8-induced cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations. The effect of V38R-Ras on the Ca2+ content of the intracellular Ca2+ store closely resembles that of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 observed earlier. Together with reports on the role of dynamic Ca2+changes in integrin-mediated adhesion, this leads us to propose that the reduction in endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content may underlie the antiapoptotic effect of R-Ras, whereas the decrease in frequency of stimulus-induced Ca2+ oscillations may play a role in the inhibitory effect of R-Ras on stimulus-induced cell detachment and migration.

Several studies have shown that Ras and R-Ras have opposing effects on apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in that R-Ras stimulates this process under conditions where Ras is protective (1Rebollo A. Martinez-A C. Blood. 1999; 94: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wang H.G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J.

Early studies employing the yeast two hybrid system suggested a physical interaction between R-Ras and the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 (14Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus far, however, this interaction could not be demonstrated in a mammalian cell system (15Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. Strasser A. Cory S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4628-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that under certain experimental conditions activated mutants of R-Ras can act through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway to inhibit cell death (16Suzuki J. Kaziro Y. Koide H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Broadway N.M. Engel P.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Finally, constitutively active V38R-Ras has been shown to keep cellular integrins in an active state thus allowing attachment to surfaces coated with integrin ligands (7Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslathi E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated the Ca2+-dependent enzyme calpain in cell detachment during cell migration (18Bhatt A. Kaverina I. Otey C. Huttenlocher A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3415-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibition of integrin-induced stress fiber assembly and cell spreading (19Kulkarni S. Goll D.E. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24435-24441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These findings explain previously reported effects of alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration on integrin-mediated adhesion (20Leitinger B. McDowall A. Stanley P. Hogg N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A role for Ca2+ in apoptosis became apparent when it was shown that a modest reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ content prevented cell death (21Foyouzi-Youssefi R. Arnaudeau S. Borner C. Kelley W.L. Tschopp J. Lew D.P. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar,22Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E. Di Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The involvement of R-Ras and intracellular Ca2+ in both programmed cell death and integrin-mediated adhesion prompted us to investigate the possibility that R-Ras might exert its actions through an effect on cellular Ca2+ handling. Here we show that constitutively active V38R-Ras decreases the ER Ca2+content in a manner similar to the proapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and slows down the frequency of stimulus-induced periodic Ca2+ rises. We propose that the reduction in ER Ca2+ content may underlie the antiapoptotic effect of R-Ras described by Suzuki and co-workers (16Suzuki J. Kaziro Y. Koide H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and Broadway and Engel (17Broadway N.M. Engel P.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we propose that the decrease in frequency of the stimulus-induced cytosolic Ca2+ rises may inhibit stimulus-induced activation of calpain, thus causing inhibition of cell detachment and migration and favoring integrin-mediated cell attachment and spreading. The development of a CHO cell line stably expressing the CCKAreceptor (CHO-CCKA) has been described in detail elsewhere (23Smeets R.L.L. Fouraux M.A. Pouwels W. van Emst-de Vries S.E. Ronken E. De Pont J.H.H.M.M. Willems P.H.G.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). CHO-CCKA cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For transfection, cells were trypsinized (5 × 106cells/300 μl) and electroporated (280 V, 975 microfarads) in the presence of 2 μg of plasmid pGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and 18 μg of either pMT2-HA-V38R-Ras or pMT2-HA-N43R-Ras (24Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were seeded on a glass coverslip (15,000 cells/30 μl) and allowed to attach for 30 min. Culture medium was added, and the cells were grown for 48 h. GFP-positive (GFP+) and GFP− cells were separated by means of fluorescence- activated cell sorting (FACS) at 24 h after electroporation. The cells were cultured for another 24 h, homogenized, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred overnight to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). For detection of HA-V38R-Ras and HA-N43R-Ras, blots were incubated overnight with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12ca5. Immunoreactive bands were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Cells were loaded with indo-1 for 30 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 3 μm indo-1/AM, and 0.025% (w/v) pluronic F-127. Excess indo-1 was removed by washing twice with calcium-free HEPES/Tris medium containing 133 mmNaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5.8 mm glucose, an amino acid mixture according to Eagle, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm HEPES, adjusted with Tris to pH 7.4. 22-mm cover slips were subsequently mounted in a Leiden chamber (25Ince C. van Dissel J.T. Diesselhoff M.C. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1985; 403: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon, Diaphot), attached to a videorate confocal microscope (Noran instruments, Middleton, WI). A water immersion objective (×40, NA 1.2) was used, allowing a field of view of about 15 cells. Within each field (165 × 155 μm), cells of comparable size were selected. GFP+ cells were identified by recording their green emission at 525 ± 25 nm after 488 nm excitation delivered by an argon ion laser (Omnichrome Inc., Chino, CA). Specific excitation of indo-1 (351 nm) was provided by a high power argon ion laser (Coherent Enterprise, Santa Clara, CA). Indo-1 fluorescence emission was monitored at 405 ± 45 nm and 485 ± 45 nm at 30 Hz by using a 455 nm dichroic mirror. The OZ hardware set-up and acquisition were controlled with Intervision software (version 1.6, Noran Instruments) running under IRIX 6.2 on an Indy work station (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mountain View, CA) equipped with 128 Mb of RAM. Fluorescence signals were collected in real time (30 Hz, 5–10 min total recording time) from eight rectangular regions of interest (including a cell-free area for background correction) drawn on full-frame images (512 × 480 pixels). The zoom factor was 0.6, and the pixel size was 0.323 μm as calibrated with a graticule (26Koopman W.J.H. Scheenen W.J. Errington R.J. Willems P.H.G.M. Bindels R.J. Roubos E.W. Jenks B.G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 57-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To reduce noise and to ensure that each cell was fully within the confocal volume, no slit was applied (optical section thickness of 10.53 μm). Between recordings, hardware settings (i.e.brightness, contrast, and laser power) were kept constant. The laser power used (28 μW at the back of the objective lens) was minimal to prevent cytotoxic and/or heating artifacts. The cells were incubated for 2 min in calcium-free HEPES/Tris medium containing 0.5 mm EGTA prior to the start of the recording. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated with either 0.1 nm or 100 nm CCK8 or 1 μm thapsigargin(Tg). The fluorescence emission ratio at 405 and 485 nm was monitored as a measure of [Ca2+]iafter excitation at 351 nm. For long term recordings, cells were loaded with fura-2 in the presence of 3 μm fura-2/AM and 0.025% (w/v) pluronic F-127 as described above. Coverslips were mounted in a thermostatic (37 °C) perfusion chamber placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon, Diaphot). Dynamic video imaging was carried out as described previously (27Willems P.H.G.M. van Emst-de Vries S.E. van Os C.H. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using the MagiCal hardware and TARDIS software provided by Joyce Loebl (Dukesway, Team Valley, Gateshead, UK). By using an epifluorescent ×40 oil immersion objective we were able to monitor simultaneously the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in close to 50 individual cells. GFP+ cells were identified by their green emission (525 ± 20 nm) at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm. Fura-2 emission was monitored at 492 nm during alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm. The fluorescence emission ratio at 492 nm was monitored as a measure of [Ca2+]i after excitation at 340 and 380 nm. 0.1 nm CCK8 was added by means of a custom-made superfusion system. At 24 h after transfection, GFP− and GFP+ cells were separated by means of FACS and plated out in 12-well plates (100,000 cells/well). After another 24 h of culturing, cells were washed in HEPES/Tris medium containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and stimulated by the addition of 125 μl of HEPES/Tris medium containing the indicated concentration of CCK8. After 20 s, 31 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction. The cells were scraped off and transferred to an Eppendorf test tube. The samples were centrifuged for 4 min at 10,000 × g, and a 120-μl aliquot of the supernatant was removed. This aliquot was extracted three times with 2 ml of water-saturated diethyl ether. Subsequently, 75 μl was taken to which 2 μl of 50% KHCO3 was added to increase the pH above 7.5. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) content of the extract was determined by isotope dilution assay as described previously (28Willems P.H.G.M. van de Put F.H.M.M. Engbersen R.

Data were analyzed using Origin Pro 6.1 (Microcal, Northampton, MA) and Image Pro Plus 4.1 image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The results presented are the mean ± S.E. Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In the case of significance, individual groups were compared according to Fischer, and pvalues < 0.05 were considered significant. For linear fits the least squares algorithm was applied using both Pearson's rand p values as a measure for the quality of the fit. In all graphs, indo-1 ratio signals were normalized to the basal (prestimulatory) level. CCK8 was obtained from Sigma, Tg from LC Services (Woburn, MA), and tissue culture medium with additives from Invitrogen. Indo-1/AM, fura-2/AM, and pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Leiden, The Netherlands).d-myo-[3H]Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (51.4 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. CHO cells expressing the rat CCKA receptor (CHO-CCKAcells) were cotransfected with GFP and either constitutively active HA-V38R-Ras or dominant negative HA-N43R-Ras. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator indo-1 and visualized by confocal microscopy. Fig. 1A shows a representative example of a cluster of GFP+ cells cotransfected with V38R-Ras. When identical hardware settings were used during acquisition, no significant differences in GFP intensity between V38R-Ras- and N43R-Ras-transfected cells were observed (TableI). The corresponding indo-1 image (Fig. 1B) shows a second cluster of GFP− cells. Importantly, these GFP− cells, present on the same coverslip as the GFP+ cells, were used as a control for the effect of R-Ras expression on cellular Ca2+ handling. Under the experimental conditions used, no cross-talk between GFP and indo-1 fluorescence signals was observed.Table ICell morphology in control and R-Ras-expressing cellsGFP intensityArea of cellFormfactorF1-aFormfactor F is defined as the ((perimeter)2/4·π·area) and has a minimal value of one for a perfect circular shape.gray levelμm2A.U.1-bA.U., arbitrary units.Control (GFP−)Not detectable331 ± 134.30 ± 0.35V38R-Ras (GFP+)130 ± 11429 ± 462.51 ± 0.201-cCompared with control, p < 0.01.N43R-Ras (GFP+)157 ± 10475 ± 251-cCompared with control, p < 0.01.,1-dCompared with V38R-Ras cells, p < 0.05.1.83 ± 0.061-cCompared with control, p < 0.01.1-a Formfactor F is defined as the ((perimeter)2/4·π·area) and has a minimal value of one for a perfect circular shape.1-b A.U., arbitrary units.1-c Compared with control, p < 0.01.1-d Compared with V38R-Ras cells, p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab To demonstrate that GFP expression reports expression of R-Ras, GFP+ and GFP− cells were separated by FACS at 24 h post-transfection and cultured for another 24 h. After this second culturing period, total cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using the monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12ca5. Fig. 1C shows that both R-Ras mutants were highly expressed in the GFP+ cells. To demonstrate alterations in cellular morphology induced by R-Ras, we compared both the cross-sectional area and morphology between GFP− and GFP+ cells. Table I shows that the cross-sectional area was increased significantly in N43R-Ras-expressing cells (p< 0.01). To detect more subtle morphological alterations we calculated the formfactor F (perimeter2/4·π·area). For a round cell, the numerical value of F is 1. The data presented show that F was decreased significantly in the R-Ras-expressing cells (Table I, p < 0.01). Importantly, however, F was significantly smaller in N43R-Ras-expressing cells compared with V38R-Ras-expressing cells (p < 0.05). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CHO cells that express N43R-Ras and, to a lesser extent, V38R-Ras, are larger and rounder than GFP− cells. To assess possible effects of R-Ras on cellular Ca2+ handling, CHO-CCKA cells transiently expressing either N43R-Ras or V38R-Ras were treated with Tg, a specific inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic and ER Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). The cells were loaded with indo-1, and the Tg-induced changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration were monitored by means of high speed confocal microscopy. Tg increases the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by preventing the active reuptake of the Ca2+ ions that continuously leak out of the ER Ca2+ store. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, these Ca2+ ions are removed from the cytosol by the action of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA). Fig. 2A shows the effect of 1 μm Tg on the average cytosolic Ca2+concentration of four V38R-Ras expressing cells (filled circles) and four GFP− cells (open circles) present on the same coverslip. The experiment was performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Under these conditions, Tg transiently increased the cytosolic Ca2+concentration in both V38R-Ras-expressing cells and the GFP− cells. This observation shows that the rate of Ca2+ leak from the ER is considerably faster than the rate of cytosolic Ca2+ removal via the PMCA. The duration of the Tg-induced Ca2+ transient was shortened significantly from 190 ± 12 s (n = 38 cells) in GFP− cells to 121 ± 13 s (n= 24 cells; p < 0.001) in V38R-Ras-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). The effect was specific for V38R-Ras because the duration of the Tg-induced transient was not altered significantly in N43R-Ras-expressing cells (173 ± 6 s;n = 10). The amplitude of the transient (Fig. 2A) seemed to be decreased in V38R-Ras-expressing cells (2.63 ± 0.12;n = 24 cells) compared with GFP− cells (2.86 ± 0.10; n = 38 cells) and N43R-Ras expressing cells (3.10 ± 0.19; n = 10 cells), but this effect was not statistically significant. The rising phase of the Tg-induced Ca2+ transient continues as long as the rate of Ca2+ leak from the ER exceeds that of active cytosolic Ca2+ removal by the PMCA. The kinetics of this phase was described adequately by a sigmoid (Boltzmann) equation (y = A2 + (A1 − A2)/(1 + exp((x − x0)/τ))) (Fig.2B). The time constant τ, which is inversely proportional to the rate of Ca2+ rise, was smaller in V38R-Ras-expressing cells (4.42 ± 0.09 s;r2 = 0.99; n = 4) compared with the corresponding GFP− cells (7.54 ± 0.012 s;r2 = 0.99; n = 4) present on the same coverslip. This shows that the rate of Ca2+ rise is 1.7-fold increased in V38R-Ras-expressing cells. The decay phase of the Tg-induced Ca2+ transient starts when the rate of Ca2+ leak from the ER becomes smaller than the rate of PMCA-mediated Ca2+ removal from the cytosol. The kinetics of this phase was adequately described by a monoexponential equation (y = y0+ A·e−t/μ) (Fig.2C). The time constant μ, which is inversely proportional to the rate of Ca2+ decay, was markedly smaller in V38R-Ras-expressing cells (49.7 ± 0.4 s;r2 = 0.93; n = 4) compared with GFP− cells (200.3 ± 15.0 s;r2 = 0.98; n = 4). This shows that the rate of Ca2+ decay is increased 4-fold in V38R-Ras-expressing cells. Calculation of the integrated area underneath the Ca2+transient, as a measure of the amount of Ca2+ released into the cytosol, revealed a significant decrease from 162 ± 10 arbitrary units (n = 38) and 169 ± 15 arbitrary units (n = 10) in GFP− cells and N43R-ras-expressing cells, respectively, to 93 ± 8 arbitrary units (n = 24) in V38R-Ras-expressing cells (TableII).Table IICalcium dynamics in control and R-Ras-expressing cellsSurface area of transientWidth of transientAmplitude of transient2-aThe amplitude was defined asRmax/R0 withR0 and Rmax being the prestimulatory and maximal indo-1 ratio.No. of transients/oscillationsA.U.2-bA.U., arbitrary units.sControl (GFP−) 0.1 nm CCK8(oscillations)ND2-cND, not determined.19 ± 22-dCompared with control cells treated with 100 nmCCK8, p < 0.001.2.48 ± 0.08162-eOnly first transient. 100 nmCCK8187 ± 17110 ± 63.02 ± 0.1058 1 μmTg162 ± 10190 ± 122.86 ± 0.1038V38R-Ras (GFP+) 0.1 nmCCK8(oscillations)ND2-cND, not determined.18 ± 12-dCompared with control cells treated with 100 nmCCK8, p < 0.001.2.43 ± 0.11162-eOnly first transient. 100 nmCCK8133 ± 72-fCompared with control, p < 0.001.,2-gCompared with N43R-Ras cells, p < 0.001.75.42-fCompared with control, p < 0.001.,2-gCompared with N43R-Ras cells, p < 0.001.2.80 ± 0.1144 1 μmTg93 ± 82-fCompared with control, p < 0.001.,2-gCompared with N43R-Ras cells, p < 0.001.121 ± 13f2-gCompared with N43R-Ras cells, p < 0.001.2.63 ± 0.1224N43R-Ras (GFP+) 100 nmCCK8177 ± 13112 ± 73.08 ± 0.1519 1 μmTg169 ± 15173 ± 63.10 ± 0.19102-a The amplitude was defined asRmax/R0 withR0 and Rmax being the prestimulatory and maximal indo-1 ratio.2-b A.U., arbitrary units.2-c ND, not determined.2-d Compared with control cells treated with 100 nmCCK8, p < 0.001.2-e Only first transient.2-f Compared with control, p < 0.001.2-g Compared with N43R-Ras cells, p < 0.001.

To investigate whether R-Ras affects stimulus-induced Ca2+ release from the ER, cells were stimulated with 100 nm CCK8 in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. At this concentration, CCK8 evokes a single Ca2+ transient that is not followed by repetitive Ca2+ transients (Ca2+oscillations). Fig. 2 (D and F) shows that both GFP+ and GFP− cells displayed a single Ca2+ transient that consisted of a rapid increase followed by a first phase of slow decay and a second phase of fast decay to basal levels. V38R-Ras-expressing cells displayed a Ca2+ transient that was less wide (Fig. 2D) and rose more slowly (Fig.2E) than that in the corresponding GFP− cells. The amplitude was only slightly decreased from 3.02 ± 0.10 (n = 58) in GFP− cells to 2.80 ± 0.11 (n = 44) in V38R-Ras-expressing cells or 3.08 ± 0.15 (n = 19) in N43R-Ras-expressing cells (Table II). However, this decrease was not statistically significant. Detailed analysis of the rate of Ca2+ rise revealed a τ value that was increased for V38R-Ras-expressing cells (τ = 0.12 ± 0.01 s; r2 = 0.99;n = 4) compared with the corresponding GFP− cells (τ = 0.07 ± 0.01 s;r2 = 0.99; n = 4) present on the same coverslip (Fig. 2E). This demonstrates that the rate of Ca2+ rise is reduced in V38R-Ras-expressing cells. In N43R-Ras-transfected cells, the kinetics of the decline (Fig.2F) and rising phase (Fig. 2G) of the Ca2+ transient were identical between the GFP+ and GFP− cells. This shows that GFP expression in itself had no effect on the shape of the CCK8-induced Ca2+ transient. Importantly, 100 nm CCK8 completely released the Tg-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store (Fig.2H). Analysis of the second (fast) phase of Ca2+ decay revealed a μ value that was of the same order of magnitude for N43R-Ras-expressing cells (27.8 ± 0.2 s;r2 = 0.79; n = 4) and the corresponding GFP− cells (63.3 ± 0.8 s;r2 = 0.96; n = 4) and for V38R-Ras-expressing cells (25.2 ± 0.4 s;r2 = 0.98; n = 4) and the corresponding GFP− cells (31.2 ± 1.2;r2 = 0.98; n = 4). Of note, these μ values were similar to that obtained with V38R-Ras-expressing cells after Tg treatment (49.7 ± 0.4 s;r2 = 0.93; n = 4) but markedly lower than those obtained with GFP− cells after Tg treatment (200.3 ± 15.0 s; r2 = 0.98;n = 4).

https://openalex.org/W2087453235,"Abstract An EID-1 (E1A-likeinhibitor of differentiation-1) inhibits differentiation by blocking the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300. Here we report a novel inhibitor of differentiation exhibiting homology to EID-1, termed EID-2 (EID-1-likeinhibitor of differentiation-2). EID-2 inhibited MyoD-dependent transcription and muscle differentiation. Unlike EID-1, EID-2 did not block p300 activity. Interestingly, EID-2 associated with class I histone deacetylases (HDACs). The N-terminal portion of EID-2 was required for the binding to HDACs. This region was also involved in the transcriptional repression and nuclear localization, suggesting the importance of the involvement of HDACs in the EID-2 function. These results indicate a new family of differentiation inhibitors, although there are several differences in the biochemical mechanisms between EID-2 and EID-1."

Studies of prokaryotic systems centered mainly on Escherichia coli, and its extrachromosomal elements have identified the following three key stages involved in DNA replication initiation: first, the recognition of the DNA replication origin and initial melting of the DNA strands; second, the recruitment of the replication machinery to the origin; and third, the remodeling of a replication complex to trigger the transition from a stable origin-bound complex to a mobile replication machine (1Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Initiation of DNA replication in E. coli proceeds via a sequence of events involving a replicon-specific recognition oforiC by DnaA and the loading of the replicative helicase DnaB by DnaC following the local melting of the DNA in an A + T-rich region (1Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 2Marians K.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Initiation of θ-type DNA replication in many different extrachromosomal elements follows a similar central scheme but can differ in the requirements for host-encoded components and their remodeling (see Ref. 3Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The most well characterized example of initiation of DNA replication within a Gram-positive bacterial environment is that of the Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1. Initiation of SPP1 replication requires the phage-encoded products of genes 38, 39, and 40(G38P,1G39P, and G40P) in addition to the host DNA polymerase III and DnaG primase (4Pedré X. Weise F. Chai S. Lüder G. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1324-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). G38P (a monomer with a predicted molecular mass of 29,997 Da) acts as a close functional equivalent to DnaA (although the proteins share no sequence similarity) and is the replisome organizer of the SPP1 system. The G38P protein specifically interacts with its cognate site present in multiple copies at the phage replication origins (oriL andoriR). This interaction occurs in the absence of ATP and is thought to induce the local unwinding of the adjacent A + T-rich sequence present within oriL to initiate θ-type DNA replication (5Missich R. Weise F. Chai S. Pedré X. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol.

G40P is a DnaB-like helicase and as such is a ring-shaped hexamer, capable of unwinding duplex DNA with a 5′ to 3′ polarity in a reaction fueled by nucleotide 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis (6Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Bárcena M. San Martin C. Weise F. Ayora S. Alonso J.C. Carazo J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). G39P is predominantly a monomer (molecular mass 14,610 Da) when free in solution and forms a specific interaction with ATP-activated G40P that inactivates the ssDNA binding, ATPase, and unwinding activities of the helicase. Targeting of G40P by G39P to the G38P-bound oriL then functions to activate G40P upon delivery (6Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is believed that G40P, in the form of the G39P-G40P-ATP complex, is delivered to G38P-bound oriL via the specific protein-protein interaction of the helicase-bound G39P with the G38P bound at oriL. These interactions result in the formation of an unstable nucleoproteinoril-G38P·G39P·G40P-ATP intermediate, with subsequent release of G38P/G39P heterodimers that leaves the ATP-activated G40P complex to bind the melted origin region (6Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Uncomplexed G38P remains bound to oriL, and the G40P helicase is free to interact with DnaG and the τ subunit of both DNA polymerases and begin DNA unwinding (6Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Ayora S. Langer U. Alonso J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Martinez-Jimenez M.I.

The action of G39P protein is similar to that of the bacteriophage λ gene P helicase-loading protein, but P requires an elaborate remodeling for freeing the helicase from the helicase/helicase-loader complex (1Baker T.A.

Furthermore, the action of G39P protein is quite distinct from that of the bacteriophage T4 gene 59 helicase-loading protein whose functions combine those of G38P and G39P as well as having a role in both replication and recombination (11Jones C.E.

As the G39P protein exists in a variety of oligomeric forms including monomers, hetero-oligomers with G40P (probably in a 6:6 ratio of G39P:G40P-ATP), and heterodimers with G38P, the protein must possess a fold capable of allowing it to form a variety of specific interactions depending upon its local environment and the exact stage of the DNA replication process (4Pedré X.

We have carried out a structural investigation of G39P to get a better understanding of the way in which G39P can interact specifically with both G38P and G40P and thus act as a key component of the system. Thus we present the first crystal structure and a preliminary NMR analysis of G39P alongside functional analyses of deletion mutants. It is the first structure of a prokaryotic helicase loader protein involved in θ-type DNA replication that also functions as an inhibitor of helicase function. The details of wt G39P and G39P112 variant constructs, their overexpression, purification, and crystallization are described elsewhere. 2S. Bailey, S. E. Sedelnikova, P. Mesa, S. Ayora, J. C. Alonso, and J. B. Rafferty, submitted for publication. Following purification, the wt protein was crystallized from ammonium phosphate, and preliminary x-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature on home laboratory x-ray sources. These data suggested that the crystals belong to space group P6122 (or P6522) with cell dimensions a =b = 105.3 Å, c = 47.4 Å, and diffract to ∼3.5 Å. However, the reproducibility of these crystals was very poor, and an analysis by mass spectrometry of freshly purified protein and the crystals themselves revealed multiple fragments derived from proteolytic cleavage at the C terminus of the protein. The proteolysis terminated markedly after the final 14 residues of G39P had been removed, and thus gene 39 was engineered to produce a mutant construct that coded for a truncated protein comprising only the first 112 of 126 residues of G39P. The G39P112 protein and selenomethionine incorporated form were prepared in a similar manner to wild type protein but crystallized from ammonium sulfate in space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 85.6 Å, b = 89.7 Å, c = 47.6 Å. The crystals have three monomers in the asymmetric unit and an assumed solvent content of 47% based on aVM (Matthews coefficient) of 2.3 Å3Da−1. The SeMet G39P112 crystals were used in a subsequent multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment in which data were collected using a Mar Research 345 imaging plate scanner at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on station BM30 using inverse beam geometry to collect Friedel pairs. The data for each wavelength were processed individually and scaled in such a way as to preserve anomalous signal using the HKL Suite of programs (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

An electron density map was calculated at 3.0 Å and subsequently improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching with the program DM (17Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). This map was of good quality with readily identifiable regions of secondary structure. Following a preliminary trace of the secondary structure, non-crystallographic symmetry operators were determined for the three monomers found in the asymmetric unit, and the map was averaged and phase-extended to 2.4 Å using DM. The model fitted to the resultant map was submitted to refinement using the program REFMAC (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13909) Google Scholar). Iterative cycles of phase combination of the partial structure phases and those from the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiment, model building, and refinement, which in the latter stages was performed using individual isotropic B-factors, translation, libration, and screw tensor parameterization (19Winn M.D. Isupov M. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar), and loose non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used to construct a model with good stereochemistry that accounted for residues 1–67 in each subunit. Maps that had not been solvent-flattened nor had non-crystallographic symmetry operators applied were examined to check for possible errors in the assignment of solvent boundary and accidental protein density flattening or for use of inappropriate restraints, but there was no indication that this had happened. The positions of the six selenium atoms correlated with the locations of the methionine residues in the N-terminal portions of each monomer. The refinement statistics are presented in Table I. Protein samples at concentrations of 1–2 mm in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and temperatures ranging from 25 to 55 °C were used. Both one- and two-dimensional 1H1H experiments were recorded as described previously (20Martin J.R. Jerala R. Kroonzitko L. Zerovnik E. Turk V. Waltho J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer. Data were processed using FELIX (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The G39P protein used in the gel filtration experiments was prepared and analyzed as described elsewhere (6Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For protein cross-linking, pure G39P (6 μm) was prepared in a phosphate buffer (PO4H2Na/PO4HNa2, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl and then incubated in the presence or absence of glutaraldehyde (0–0.1%) for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by addition of stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm glycine, 3% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) and loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. In the analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity analysis, 0.42-ml samples of protein at 1 mg ml−1 were centrifuged in 1.20-cm path length, two-sector aluminum centerpiece cells with sapphire windows in a four-place An-60 Ti analytical rotor running in a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge at 50,000 rpm at 16 °C. Changes in solute concentration were detected by Rayleigh interference and 280 nm absorbance scans. Results were analyzed by g(s*) analysis (21Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) using the program DCDT+ version 1.13 (22Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). For proteolytic studies, pure wtG39P or N-terminal His-tagged variants (6 μm) were prepared in phosphate buffer (PO4H2Na/PO4HNa2, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then incubated with proteinase K (62 ng/reaction) for increasing time intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min) at 37 °C. An aliquot of the mixture was then removed, and the reaction was stopped by addition of stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mmglycine, 3% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol), before the products were loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The signal was quantified using a PhosphorImager. The 1-min proteinase K incubation reaction mixture was dialyzed against water and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry. The N-terminal His-tagged G39P variant was incubated with proteinase K (62 ng/reaction) for 1 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column, and the column was washed in phosphate buffer containing 5 mm imidazole before elution with phosphate buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and subsequent analysis of the eluant on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The B. subtilis SPP1 wt phage was routinely propagated in B. subtilis strain YB886 (supo) and the conditional lethal mutants SPP1sus53 and SPP1sus22 in BG295 (sup3) strain. Phage stocks had titers of 1.0–5.0 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml when plated under permissive conditions. Reversion frequencies were not higher than 10−5. SPP1 wt, SPP1sus53, and SPP1sus22 were used to infect B. subtilis YB886 cells bearing plasmid-borne gene 39 or gene 39-112, and manipulations followed the standard procedures described for SPP1 (23Chai S. Szepan U. Lüder G. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For the affinity chromatography assay, gene 39 mutants were constructed that encoded for His-tagged, truncated variants of the wt protein. In separate experiments, each protein variant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA-agarose column (2 μg of protein per 20 μl matrix). G40P (2 μg) was then loaded onto the column, and the binding ability of the G39P variant was confirmed by elution using imidazole (250 mm) followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The x-ray crystallographic analysis of G39P has revealed a completely unexpected bipartite structure for the protein that is made even more striking given its comparatively small size (126 residues in the wt protein). In the final model fitted to a map at 2.4-Å resolution, residues 1–67 for each of the three copies of the protein in the a.u. were present, and there was a total of 41 solvent molecules. There was no interpretable electron density for residues 68–112 at the C terminus of each subunit, and the N-terminal domain was sufficient to make all the necessary crystal packing contacts. The final model R-factor is 0.20 with a corresponding value for Rfree of 0.23 and strongly supports the proposal that all of the ordered scattering matter has been reasonably modeled at this resolution. Thus the non-complexed G39P protein in vitrowould appear to consist of two distinct domains as follows: a fully folded 67-residue N-terminal domain, and a C-terminal domain that has only limited fold (see NMR analysis below). Each of the three copies of the G39P monomer in the a.u. has essentially the same fold for the N-terminal domain that is composed of four helices. There are three α-helices as follows: αA (residues 3–16); αB (residues 26–39); αC (residues 42–55), plus there is a very short 310 helix D (residues 62–65) comprising little more than one turn. The helices can be described as two approximately parallel pairs (αA/αC and αB/D) that cross at an angle of about 70° (Fig. 1). The structure of the bacteriophage T4 gene 59 helicase-loading protein also has two α-helical domains, but its N-terminal domain shows a strong structural similarity to the high mobility group family proteins (11Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Nossal N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8312-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which is not seen in the N-terminal domain of G39P. The G39P112 protein crystallized with three independent monomers in the a.u., but they adopted an arrangement around a non-crystallographic 61 screw axis parallel to the crystallographic c axis (Fig.2). When viewed along the direction of the c axis, the disordered C-terminal domains are located on the exterior of the helical arrays of monomers formed by the screw axes. The cavities in the crystal lattice are clearly sufficient to accommodate the C-terminal domains of the G39P112 variant as supported by mass spectrometric analysis of the crystal used in the structure determination that confirmed the presence of intact variant (data not shown). However, it would seem that the extra bulk provided by the 14 C-terminal residues of the intact wt protein necessitates an alternative crystal packing arrangement that appears to be less stable as judged by the noticeably poorer crystal reproducibility and diffraction quality. The inter-monomer contacts are made predominantly between residues immediately following helices αA and αC and those preceding helices αB and D. The residues involved are both polar and hydrophobic, and the interface includes two completely buried water molecules. Pairwise superposition of the α-carbon positions of each of the monomers gives root mean square deviation values of 0.2 to 0.3 Å. Approximately 1200 Å2 or 30% of the surface area of each monomer is buried in the interfaces with other monomers in the non-crystallographic 61 helix and a further ∼10% on average in contacts with other subunits in the crystal lattice. The missing polypeptide chain in the electron density map, extending from residue Lys-67, is directed toward a large cavity in the crystalline lattice (Fig. 2) where it adopts a flexible, mainly unfolded state (see NMR analysis below). Thus at least in the crystal lattice, the G39P112 protein appears to exist as a monomer. Calculations of the electrostatic surface potential of the folded N-terminal domain of G39P reveals a somewhat negatively charged surface overall. However, there is a notable localized, highly negative patch on the surface formed by residues at the N terminus of helix αA and the N terminus and loop preceding helix αC that also lies adjacent to the last observed residue in the map, Lys-67. The distribution of charge is even more striking when one examines the helical packing of the G39P monomers in the crystal that reveals the helical array to have a very predominantly negatively charged outer surface with the uncharged or positive surface mostly buried in inter-monomer contacts or close to the helical axis (Fig. 2). The unobserved, flexible C-terminal domain may modify the apparent surface charge, but the calculated pI is 4.9 for the C-terminal 59 residues of G39P (the calculated pI for the N-terminal 67 residues is 5.2) and thus might suggest a generally negatively charged surface. Apart from the slight imbalance in positively and negatively charged residues that leads to the acidic pI, the C-terminal domain of G39P does not show a particularly abnormal distribution of residue type. Molecular replacement attempts to determine the structure of the wt G39P protein using the lower resolution data collected to 3.5 Å from the seemingly related P6122/P6522 crystal form are ongoing but have so far been unsuccessful. In order to determine to what extent the disorder observed for the C-terminal half of the molecule reflected conformational heterogeneity in solution rather than disorder within the crystal, the 1H-NMR behavior of G39P was investigated. One- and two-dimensional1H1H-TOCSY experiments were recorded on samples of both wt G39P and G39P112 mutant protein forms (Fig. 3). Spectra recorded at room temperature for both forms of the protein revealed two domains with very different degrees of motion, as revealed by differential NMR relaxation rates. For the C-terminal ∼50 residues, i.e.about half the size of G39P, NMR relaxation rates are slow and are thus dominated by internal mobility far in excess of the overall rotation of the protein. Resonances from these residues show little chemical shift dispersion away from their random coil values, indicative of conformational averaging, and high intensity cross-peaks in TOCSY spectra, as illustrated by the correlations between the aromatic ring protons of Phe-76 and Tyr-80 in Fig. 3B. The intensity of the primary amide cross-peaks of glutamines 84, 90, 104, and 107 and asparagines 99 and 110 is also apparent in Fig.3B. Backbone amide proton resonances from the mobile C-terminal domain, upon heating the sample, are severely attenuated in intensity by solvent exchange, following saturation of the water resonance (Fig. 3A). This demonstrates that there is weak or no hydrogen bonding involving this part of the protein backbone other than to solvent molecules. The resonances from the N-terminal residues, at room temperature, have far lower intensity than would be expected for a protein of around 13–15 kDa, indicative of a self-association process under the conditions of the NMR experiments. Upon heating, resonances from this region sharpen markedly, indicating the thermal dissociation of the aggregate (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the resonances corresponding to the mobile region, these resonances display the chemical shift dispersion of a normally folded domain and include, for example, the easily identifiable indole NH of Trp-33 located at the N terminus of helix αB and found within the hydrophobic core of the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain. The NMR experiments indicate that in solution the protein behaves as a two-domain entity. One domain, corresponding to approximately the 67 N-terminal residues observed in the electron density map from the x-ray experiment, exists in the fold determined above, although at room temperature it is involved in a thermally labile, self-association process. The second domain, corresponding to the remaining 60 C-terminal residues that are not observed in the electron density map, has rapid internal motion and no well defined and stable fold involving immobilized side chains. A detailed comparison of the spectra from the intact wt and truncated forms of G39P revealed no major difference between the two forms. Our findings strongly support the idea that the disorder observed in the crystal structure for the C-terminal region was not a result of the truncation of the protein nor was it merely some form of crystal artifact but reflected an underlying flexibility that may be closely related to the function of the protein. In order to examine further the apparent difference between the oligomeric state of G39P as observed in the crystal and that reported previously in solution (6Ayora S. Stasiak A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the wt protein and the G39P112 mutant were subjected both to gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses. The gel filtration studies suggested that under the conditions tested (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl at 4 and 25 °C) both the wt G39P and the G39P112 mutant apparently exist largely as a dimer when in the micromolar concentration range (Fig.4) and as an equilibrium between dimer and monomer when in the nanomolar concentration range (data not shown). However, the NMR data above reveals a rapid equilibrium in sol"

Its specificity for these substrates is modulated through interactions at regions remote from the active site of the thrombin molecule, designated exosites. Exosite interactions can be with the substrate, cofactors such as thrombomodulin, or fragments from prothrombin. The relative activity of α-thrombin for fibrinogen is 10 times greater than that for protein C. However, the relative activity of meizothrombin for protein C is 14 times greater than that for fibrinogen.

Recombinant prothrombins that yield recombinant meizothrombin (rMT) and rMT des-fragment 1 (rMT(desF1)) enable comparisons of the effects of mutations at the Na+-binding residue (Asp554) and deletion of loop-2 (Glu466–Thr469) on the relative activity of meizothrombin for several substrates. Hydrolysis of t-butoxycarbonyl-VPR-p-nitroanilide by α-thrombin, recombinant α-thrombin, or rMT(desF1) was almost identical, but that by rMT was only 40% of that by α-thrombin. Clotting of fibrinogen by rMT and rMT(desF1) was 12–16% of that by α-thrombin, as already known. Strikingly, however, although meizothrombins modified by substitution of Asp554 with either Ala or Leu or by deletion of loop-2 had 6–8 and <1%, respectively, of the clotting activity of α-thrombin, the activity of these meizothrombins for protein C was increased to >10 times that of α-thrombin.

No systematic examination of the role of the Na+-binding region and autolytic loop-2 in meizothrombin has been made. If mutations in these regions are constructed in meizothrombin, investigation of the relative activities of the mutants will enable the relationships between Na+ binding and the functional differences between α-thrombin and meizothrombin to be determined. Determination of the specificity differences between α-thrombin and meizothrombin is made difficult by the autolytic cleavages that occur in prothrombin and meizothrombin. We have constructed recombinant prothrombin molecules with substitutions of Ala for Arg at the sites of autolysis to eliminate the confounding cleavages, as reported previously (18Côté H.C. Bajzar L. Stevens W.K. Samis J.A. Morser J. MacGillivray R.T. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6194-6200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), that permit definitive testing of their specificity for two substrates, protein C and fibrinogen. We then constructed novel meizothrombin mutants with alterations in the Na+-binding site or with a deletion of autolytic loop-2. We report here that these loop-2- and Na+-binding site-modified recombinant meizothrombin derivatives show moderate to large reductions in fibrinogen-clotting activity, but large enhancement of protein C activator activity. Human prothrombin was purified following a published method (25Miletich J.P. Broze G.J. Majerus P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Human protein C was purified using the following modifications of the prothrombin purification method. The Ba2+-protein precipitate, after (NH4)2SO4 precipitation (25Miletich J.P. Broze G.J. Majerus P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Fractions that contained factors IX and X and protein C were applied to heparin-Sepharose and eluted with 0.25m NaCl. The protein C-containing fractions were applied to a Mono Q column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl. The purification of human protein C was analyzed by SDS-PAGE at each step. The prothrombin activator ecarin, fromEchis carinatus venom, was purified as reported previously (26Morita T. Iwanaga S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 303-311Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Yamada D. Sekiya F. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Human recombinant thrombomodulin (rTM)2 was a kind gift from Dr. Yasuo Sasaki (Asahi Kasei Corp., Shizuoka, Japan). The chromogenic substrate for thrombin,t-butoxycarbonyl-Val-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Boc-VPR-pNA), and the substrate for activated protein C, Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Boc-LSTR-MCA), were from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) and Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. A full-length human prothrombin cDNA was isolated from a human liver cDNA library using two oligonucleotide primers from human prothrombin to which restriction enzyme sites (underlined in the following sequences) were added. The 5′-primer sequence was 5′-TTTGAATTCACCATGGCGCACGTCCGAGGC-3′, and the 3′-primer sequence was 5′-CATTGATCAGTTTGGAGAGCGGCCGCGGTT-3′. An amplified cDNA of 1.9 kb was cloned into pUC19, and the resulting pUC/hPT was sequenced using a DSQ-2000L DNA sequencer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). pUC/hPT was digested with EcoRI and NotI, and the 1.9-kb cDNA fragment was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using a QIAquick DNA purification kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). This fragment was cloned into a mammalian expression vector (pSecTag, Invitrogen) that contains Myc and His tags at the C-terminal end. The protein product of this construct, i.e. human prothrombin produced with pSecTag/hPT, is designated PT-tag. Prothrombin mutants were constructed from pUC/hPT by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method (28Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The sequences of all prothrombin mutants were determined by DNA sequencing. In the mutant PT-RA155, Arg155 is replaced by Ala (the site between fragments 1 and 2) (see Fig. 1); and in the mutant PT-RA271/284, Arg271 and Arg284 are replaced by Ala (see Fig. 1). In the mutant PT-RA155/271/284, Arg155, Arg271, and Arg284 are replaced by Ala (29Côté H.C. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Na+-binding site mutants PT-DA554 and PT-DL554 have Asp554 replaced by Ala or Leu, respectively. In PTΔ466–469, Glu466–Thr469 was deleted from PT-RA155/271/284. All PT constructs contain Myc and His tag sequences at their C-terminal ends, adding 3.4 kDa to these proteins compared with their hypothetical plasma prothrombin-derived homologs. The Myc tag was used to detect the cloned products by anti-Myc immunoblotting. Expression constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Two cultures were grown: one with 10 μg/ml vitamin K and one without. The transfected cells were subsequently transferred to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, again either with or without 10 μg/ml vitamin K, and further incubated for 48 h. Expressed PT-tag secreted into the cultured medium was recovered after centrifugation at 2000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C to remove the cells. The supernatant culture medium was applied to an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid SF column (8-ml volume; QIAGEN GmbH) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5m NaCl to capture the His-tagged protein. The effluent was directly connected to ÄKTA Explorer 10S. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of the equilibrating buffer and eluted by a two-step gradient (0–40 and 40–250 mm imidazole in the equilibrating buffer; flow rate of 2 ml/min). One-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were dialyzed overnight against Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2), and the protein concentrations of all fractions were determined with a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of the fractions were diluted in 2× SDS buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (for disulfide reduction where noted)). Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Finetrap NT-32, Nihon Eido, Tokyo, Japan) and incubated with anti-Myc (Invitrogen) and anti-human PT antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were visualized with a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and a POD immunostain set (Wako, Osaka, Japan). All prothrombin mutants were expressed and purified by the same method as PT-tag. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the recombinant prothrombins were determined in Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified fractions. Aliquots of the column fractions were diluted in 2× SDS buffer, subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlottTM, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and stained with 0.1% Amido Black 10B in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Protein bands to be sequenced were cut out and washed with deionized water (MilliQ, Millipore Corp). The amino acid sequences were determined with an Applied Biosystems Model 477A-120A amino acid sequencer. All prothrombin mutants were activated by ecarin, from E. carinatus venom (26Morita T. Iwanaga S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 303-311Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Yamada D. Sekiya F. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In a typical assay, the plasma-derived or recombinant prothrombins (50 nm final concentration) were incubated with ecarin (0.5 nm final concentration) in TBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C in a 96-well microtiter plate. After 15 min, 0.1 volume of 2.5 mm Boc-VPR-pNA was added to the activation mixture, and the initial rate ofp-nitroaniline formation was monitored at 405 nm with a kinetic plate reader (Wellreader, Seikagaku Corp.). Products of prothrombin activation (after a 30-min incubation) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. Plasma and recombinant prothrombins were adjusted to yield protein concentrations with equal rates of hydrolysis of Boc-VPR-pNA (∼0.5 absorbance unit/min) after complete activation with ecarin. Prothrombin samples adjusted to these protein concentrations were incubated with ecarin (0.5 nmfinal concentration) in TBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C in a coagulometer cup (Amelung KC4A, Baxter). After 30 min, 0.1 volume of 20 mg/ml fibrinogen was added to the activation mixture, and the clotting time was measured. The clotting times were converted to units of thrombin activity using a standard curve constructed from various concentrations of α-thrombin from plasma prothrombin. Plasma or recombinant prothrombin (2 nm final concentration) was activated by ecarin (0.2 nm final concentration) in TBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C in a 96-well microtiter plate. After 30 min, equal volumes of human protein C (80 nm final concentration), rTM (either 40 nm final or varying concentrations), and 3:1 (mol/mol) phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles (100 μmfinal or various concentrations) in TBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C to activate protein C. Activated protein C was determined from the initial rate of hydrolysis of Boc-LSTR-MCA (1 mm final concentration), measured by 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin liberation (λex = 380 nm, λem = 465 nm) with a GENios fluorometer (Tecan). Platelet aggregation was measured by determining the changes in light transmission of platelet suspensions with an optical aggregometer (Niko Bioscience Hema Tracer 601). Maximal aggregation induced by 100 nm r-α-thrombin was defined as 100%. Washed platelets were prepared from blood from healthy volunteers with informed consent. All volunteers denied taking any medications that would alter the response of platelets to thrombin. Blood was collected into 0.1 volume of 3.8% sodium citrate by venipuncture and centrifuged at 150 × g for 20 min at room temperature to prepare platelet-rich plasma. Washed platelets were prepared by further centrifugation (300 × g, 3 min) of platelet-rich plasma to separate the platelets, which were then washed twice with 15% acid/citrate/dextrose and 100 nmprostacyclin. Platelet pellets were suspended in HEPES/Tyrode's buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 138 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mmCaCl2, and 1 mg/ml glucose). Resuspended platelets were incubated for 2 min at 37 °C, after which r-α-thrombin, rMT, rMT-DL554, or rMTΔ466–469 (0.1–100 nm final concentrations) was added to initiate aggregation. To compare the specificity of meizothrombin and meizothrombin des-fragment 1 with that of α-thrombin, recombinant prothrombin molecules with a substitution of Ala for Arg at the sites of autolysis were constructed. Fig. 1 shows the cleavage sites and the sites of the mutations; the substitutions and deletions are defined in Table I. PT-tag is an recombinant prothrombin with Myc and His tags at the C terminus, but without other mutations. PT-tag thus serves as the control for recombinant prothrombin and r-α-thrombin. PT-RA155, with Arg155 substituted with Ala, is not cleaved to form fragments 1 and 2, but produces r-α-thrombin that is structurally identical to that derived from PT-tag. PT-RA271/284 and PT-RA155/271/284 produce rMT(desF1) and rMT, respectively, and have been reported previously (29Côté H.C. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three mutants PT-DA554, PT-DL554, and PTΔ466–469 are new constructs designed to produce rMT-DA554, rMT-DL554, and rMTΔ466–469, respectively. These products permit the evaluation of the contributions of the Na+-binding site Asp residue and autolytic loop-2 to the specificity of meizothrombins for fibrinogen and protein C.Table IMutation sites of human prothrombin and activated mutant proteinsPrecursorThrombin/FXa1-aFactor Xa. cleavage sitesLoop-21-bAutolytic loop-2 (Glu146–Lys149E, chymotrypsin numbering).Na+-binding siteActivated formsArg155Arg271Arg284Glu466–Thr469Asp554 1-cAsp222 (chymotrypsin numbering).Plasma prothrombinArgArgArgGlu466–Thr469Aspα-ThrombinPT-tagArgArgArgGlu466–Thr469Aspr-α-thrombinPT-RA155AlaArgArgGlu466–Thr469Aspr-α-thrombinPT-RA271/284ArgAlaAlaGlu466–Thr469AsprMT(desF1)PT-RA155/271/284AlaAlaAlaGlu466–Thr469AsprMTPT-DA554AlaAlaAlaGlu466–Thr469AlarMT-DA554PT-DL554AlaAlaAlaGlu466–Thr469LeurMT-DL554PTΔ466–469AlaAlaAlaDeletedAsprMTΔ466–4691-a Factor Xa.1-b Autolytic loop-2 (Glu146–Lys149E, chymotrypsin numbering).1-c Asp222 (chymotrypsin numbering). Open table in a new tab The seven recombinant prothrombin constructs were transfected into COS cells. All prothrombin mutants were efficiently expressed (Fig. 2A). The importance of γ-carboxylation for prothrombin secretion by COS cells was also demonstrated. γ-Carboxylation, which modifies a glutamate in the γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain, depends on vitamin K as a cofactor. Recombinant prothrombin derivatives in COS cells were efficiently secreted into the culture medium only in the presence of vitamin K (Fig. 2B). Thus, prothrombin secretion in this cell system depends on γ-carboxylation. The mutants PT-tag and PT-RA271/284 had the molecular masses expected for wild-type prothrombin plus the mass of the tag (Fig. 2, A and B). For recombinant prothrombins with the Arg155-to-Ala mutation, the molecular masses appeared higher upon SDS-PAGE by ∼3–4 kDa (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of all expressed recombinant prothrombins were identical to that of wild-type prothrombin (Ala-Asn-Thr-Phe-Leu-). All mutants bound to an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Ni2+-chelating bead), implying that the His tag at the C terminus was correctly constructed and intact. Because both the N and C termini appeared to be correct, the mobility shift of the Arg155 mutants was not investigated further. The prothrombin precursor mutants with Myc and His tag sequences at their C termini were purified using metal-chelating column chromatography and detected by anti-Myc antibody. The purity of the PT-tag-containing fractions eluted from the column was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and by immunoblot analysis (Fig.3). No autolysis products could be detected in the PT-tag-containing fractions. All mutants were purified by identical metal-chelating column chromatographic procedures (data not shown). As anticipated, PT-tag and PT-RA155 were readily converted to r-α-thrombin by the prothrombin activator ecarin, whereas PT-RA271/284 and PT-RA155/271/284 were activated to rMT(desF1) and rMT, respectively (Fig.4). PTΔ466–469, PT-DA554, and PT-DL554 were similarly converted to the mutant meizothrombin derivatives. All recombinant prothrombins were rapidly activated to their cleaved forms by ecarin, implying that the structure around the relevant scissile bond, Arg320, was not grossly perturbed. We assessed the activity of each recombinant thrombin and meizothrombin derivative by measuring Boc-VPR-pNA hydrolysis rates and by fibrinogen clotting (Table II). PT-RA155 and r-α-thrombin produced from PT-tag had activities for both substrates experimentally indistinguishable from those of α-thrombin derived from native prothrombin. The Boc-VPR-pNA hydrolytic activity of rMT(desF1) was 94% of that of r-α-thrombin, but rMT activity was decreased to 38%. This is consistent with a published report that the prothrombin fragments, which remain covalently linked in rMT, reduce α-thrombin hydrolysis of peptide pNA (30Shi F. Hogg P.J. Winzor D.J. Jackson C.M. Biophys. Chem. 1998; 75: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). rMT-DA554, rMT-DL554, and rMTΔ466–469 had ∼20% Boc-VPR-pNA hydrolytic activity compared with r-α-thrombin (Table II). These reductions in activity are similar to those cited in Ref. 31Di Cera E. Dang Q.D. Ayala Y.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 701-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar for different Na+-binding site mutants of α-thrombin. Fig. 5 shows the fibrinogen-clotting activities of various activated forms of recombinant prothrombin derivatives. α-Thrombin and r-α-thrombin derived from PT-tag had essentially the same clotting activity, but the activity of rMT(desF1) derived from PT-RA271/284 decreased to 16% and that of rMT derived from PT-RA155/271/284 decreased to 12% of the r-α-thrombin activity. rMT-DA554 and rMT-DL554 had 8 and 6% of the r-α-thrombin activity, respectively. rMTΔ466–469 had no significant fibrinogen-clotting activity (<1%). Thus, deletion of autolytic loop-2 abolishes meizothrombin activity for fibrinogen, and mutation of the Na+-binding residue reduces this activity.Table IIEnzymatic properties of the activated forms of prothrombin and its derivativesActivated formsChromogenic activityFibrinogen-clotting activity (F)Protein C activator activity (P)RAP2-aRelative anticoagulant potency of a mutant,P/F, where P and F are the rates for protein C activator and fibrinogen-clotting activities, respectively.

Open table in a new tab We examined each of the forms of thrombin and meizothrombin for their ability to activate protein C in the presence of phospholipids and thrombomodulin (Fig.6A). The significance of γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain-containing fragment 1 can be assessed by comparing the activity of rMT(desF1), which lacks fragment 1, with that of the fragment 1-containing rMT derivatives (Fig. 6A,black bars). The activities of rMT and its derivatives were dramatically higher for protein C than those of both rMT(desF1) and r-α-thrombin, in contrast to the lower activities of rMT and its derivatives for fibrinogen. In the absence of covalently attached fragment 1, no enhancement of protein C activation was observed,i.e. with rMT(desF1) or r-α-thrombin (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6 (B and C) shows the effects of rTM and phospholipid concentration on protein C activation by r-α-thrombin, rMT, and rMT derivatives and verifies that the observations are not unique to a limited set of reactant concentrations. α-Thrombin is a potent physiological platelet activator. The effects of r-α-thrombin and rMT derivatives on platelet aggregation are shown in Fig.7. Whereas r-α-thrombin at 3 nm induced 95% platelet aggregation, rMT at 100 nm induced only ∼60% aggregation. Both rMT-DL554 and rMTΔ466–469 had poor platelet aggregation-inducing activity (<5%), even at the highest concentration tested (100 nm). This result shows that both meizothrombin derivatives rMT-DL554 and rMTΔ466–469 lack significant platelet aggregation-inducing activity. Ecarin, the snake venom-derived prothrombin activator present in these reaction mixtures, did not initiate platelet aggregation (data not shown). Meizothrombin is known to have enhanced protein C activator activity and diminished fibrinogen-clotting activity compared with α-thrombin (11Rosing J. Zwaal R.F. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4224-4228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Côté H.C. Bajzar L. Stevens W.K. Samis J.A. Morser J. MacGillivray R.T. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

In fibrinogen clotting, prothrombin fragment 2 in meizothrombin and meizothrombin(desF1) inhibits interaction with fibrinogen (32Doule M.G. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10693-10701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The marked stimulation of meizothrombin protein C activator activity by phospholipids clearly indicates the importance of fragment 1, which includes the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding γ-carboxyglutamic acid domain (33Gitel S.N. Owen II, W.G. Esmon C.T. Jackson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1344-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 34Dombrose F.A. Gitel S.N. Zawalich K. Jackson C.M. J. Biol.

One plausible explanation for this difference is the contribution that binding to phospholipid membranes makes to the reaction rates by promoting the formation of thrombin- or meizothrombin-thrombomodulin complexes. More complex alterations in the conformation of meizothrombin can also be speculated to occur, e.g. as a result of an intramolecular interaction involving the fragment 1 region and a thrombin exosite. Such conformational changes might be similar to the conformational changes that are caused by thrombomodulin in α-thrombin that convert it from a fibrinogen-preferring to a protein C-preferring proteinase. In α-thrombin, deletion of autolytic loop-2 (Glu146–Lys149E, chymotrypsin numbering; Glu466–Lys474 of prothrombin) or the substitution of the Na+-binding site residues (Asp221–Tyr225, chymotrypsin numbering; Asp552–Tyr557 of prothrombin) decreases its fibrinogen-clotting activity, but affects only slightly its protein C activator activity in the presence of thrombomodulin and phospholipids (20Di Cera E.

A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In particular, deletion of the entire loop-2 of α-thrombin nearly eliminates clotting activity, but protein C activator activity is reduced by only 2-fold (23Dang Q.D. Sabetta M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19649-19651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Most of the effect must originate from direct perturbation of fibrinogen binding due to the loss of critical interactions between loop-2 and fibrinogen in the autolytic loop-2 deletion mutant. In this study, Ala or Leu substitution at the Na+-binding site (Asp554) or deletion of autolytic loop-2 residues (Glu466–Thr469) (Fig. 1) in meizothrombin was used to test the importance of the Na+-binding site and autolytic loop-2, known “specificity determinants” for α-thrombin, in meizothrombins. The results demonstrate that these regions are also specificity determinants for meizothrombin, but with opposite effects in meizothrombin and α-thrombin. Whereas autolytic loop-2 and the Na+-binding residue Asp554 are crucial for α-thrombin action on fibrinogen, mutation of the Na+-binding site in meizothrombin causes only a modest decrease in action on fibrinogen. The differences in the relative specific activity of the activated meizothrombin mutants for fibrinogen and protein C are more dramatic; in fact, they change from reduced to enhanced relative activity for these two substrates. Specifically, in fibrinogen clotting, rMT is substantially decreased to 12% and rMT(desF1) to 16% relative to r-α-thrombin (Fig. 5 and Table II). rMT-DA554 (8%) and rMT-DL554 (6%) had even lower clotting activity; rMTΔ466–469 had <1% of the r-α-thrombin clotting activity. Because these rMT derivatives (rMT-DA554, rMT-DA554, and rMTΔ466–469) have no Na+-binding site, their conformation is possibly similar to the non-Na+-binding form of thrombin (35Dang Q.D. Vindigni A.

The control mutants (r-α-thrombin from PT-tag and rMT(desF1)) were indistinguishable from native α-thrombin in their ability to catalyze protein C activation in the presence of thrombomodulin and phospholipid vesicles (Fig. 6A). The protein C activator activities of both rMT and its derivatives were increased by 10-fold or more compared with those of α-thrombin (Fig. 6A). These four highly active proteins are distinguished by having the fragment 1 region attached, whereas α-thrombin, r-α-thrombin, and rMT(desF1) do not. Both rTM and phospholipids increased the protein C activator activities of the meizothrombin mutants with fragment 1 (Fig. 6, B andC). Interestingly, even in the absence of thrombomodulin, the fragment 1-containing proteins showed enhanced protein C activator activity compared with α-thrombin (Fig. 6A). Table IIsummarizes the relative chromogenic, fibrinogen-clotting, and protein C activator activities of the activated forms of recombinant prothrombins. Most significant is the fact that, although rMT-DA554, rMT-DL554, and rMTΔ466–469 lack an Na+-binding function, these activated recombinant meizothrombins have very high protein C activator activities, indicating that the Na+-binding site has an insignificant role (if any) in protein C activation by meizothrombin. The other procoagulant process recognized as a key function of α-thrombin is activation of platelets. In this process, similar to the action of these various forms of thrombin on fibrinogen, the mutations resulted in reduction in relative activity. Fig. 7 shows the effects of r-α-thrombin, rMT, and meizothrombin derivatives on the aggregation of washed platelets. Both rMT-DL554 and rMTΔ466–469 had essentially no platelet aggregation activity. These results imply that rMTΔ466–469 has little or no protease activities for fibrinogen or a physiological substrate such as PAR-1 (protease-activated receptor-1), the thrombin receptor on platelets. Further studies are required to determine whether this is due to decreased binding or decreased ability to catalyze proteolytic cleavage. It is useful to attempt to relate these observations to the crystal structure of thrombin, although it must be noted that surface residues can be subject to crystal packing variations that prevent detailed interpretations from being made. Fig.8A shows a model of α-thrombin derived from one of the thrombin crystal structures (36Richardson J.L. Kroger B. Hoeffken W. Sadler J.E. Pereira P. Huber R. Bode W. Fuentes-Prior P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5650-5660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Active-site residues are shown in red. The Na+-binding site (Asp552–Asp554) and the autolytic loop-2 region (Glu466–Thr469) are yellow andorange, respectively. Other side chains of amino acids in dark green are the interaction sites of fibrinogen, which are located throughout the areas surrounding both the Na+-binding site and the loop-2 region of thrombin (24Gibbs C.S.

Moreover, rMTΔ466–469, which is defective in autolytic loop-2, is missing Glu466 (Glu146, chymotrypsin numbering), which ion pairs with Arg553(Arg221A, chymotrypsin numbering) of the Na+-binding site (31Di Cera E.

The mutation of Asp554(Asp222, chymotrypsin numbering), adjacent to the salt-bridging Arg553 (Arg221A, chymotrypsin numbering), could similarly be related to the conformational changes that are responsible for the differences between fibrinogen and protein C cleavage by the mutant meizothrombins. In conclusion, it is proposed that interactions within thrombin that involve autolytic loop-2 and the Na+-binding site primarily enhance thrombin action on fibrinogen, but impair thrombin action on protein C.
