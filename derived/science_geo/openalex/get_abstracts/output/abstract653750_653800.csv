https://openalex.org/W3032134512,"The ability of superhydrophobic surfaces to stay dry, self-clean and avoid biofouling is attractive for applications in biotechnology, medicine and heat transfer1–10. Water droplets that contact these surfaces must have large apparent contact angles (greater than 150 degrees) and small roll-off angles (less than 10 degrees). This can be realized for surfaces that have low-surface-energy chemistry and micro- or nanoscale surface roughness, minimizing contact between the liquid and the solid surface11–17. However, rough surfaces—for which only a small fraction of the overall area is in contact with the liquid—experience high local pressures under mechanical load, making them fragile and highly susceptible to abrasion18. Additionally, abrasion exposes underlying materials and may change the local nature of the surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic19, resulting in the pinning of water droplets to the surface. It has therefore been assumed that mechanical robustness and water repellency are mutually exclusive surface properties. Here we show that robust superhydrophobicity can be realized by structuring surfaces at two different length scales, with a nanostructure design to provide water repellency and a microstructure design to provide durability. The microstructure is an interconnected surface frame containing ‘pockets’ that house highly water-repellent and mechanically fragile nanostructures. This surface frame acts as ‘armour’, preventing the removal of the nanostructures by abradants that are larger than the frame size. We apply this strategy to various substrates—including silicon, ceramic, metal and transparent glass—and show that the water repellency of the resulting superhydrophobic surfaces is preserved even after abrasion by sandpaper and by a sharp steel blade. We suggest that this transparent, mechanically robust, self-cleaning glass could help to negate the dust-contamination issue that leads to a loss of efficiency in solar cells. Our design strategy could also guide the development of other materials that need to retain effective self-cleaning, anti-fouling or heat-transfer abilities in harsh operating environments. Water-repellent nanostructures are housed within an interconnected microstructure frame to yield mechanically robust superhydrophobic surfaces."

Reconstructing appendage-bearing skin in cultures and in bioengineered grafts is a biomedical challenge that has yet to be met3-9. Here we report an organoid culture system that generates complex skin from human pluripotent stem cells. We use stepwise modulation of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling pathways to co-induce cranial epithelial cells and neural crest cells within a spherical cell aggregate. During an incubation period of 4-5 months, we observe the emergence of a cyst-like skin organoid composed of stratified epidermis, fat-rich dermis and pigmented hair follicles that are equipped with sebaceous glands. A network of sensory neurons and Schwann cells form nerve-like bundles that target Merkel cells in organoid hair follicles, mimicking the neural circuitry associated with human touch. Single-cell RNA sequencing and direct comparison to fetal specimens suggest that the skin organoids are equivalent to the facial skin of human fetuses in the second trimester of development. Moreover, we show that skin organoids form planar hair-bearing skin when grafted onto nude mice. Together, our results demonstrate that nearly complete skin can self-assemble in vitro and be used to reconstitute skin in vivo. We anticipate that our skin organoids will provide a foundation for future studies of human skin development, disease modelling and reconstructive surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3028901078,"Molecular glue compounds induce protein-protein interactions that, in the context of a ubiquitin ligase, lead to protein degradation1. Unlike traditional enzyme inhibitors, these molecular glue degraders act substoichiometrically to catalyse the rapid depletion of previously inaccessible targets2. They are clinically effective and highly sought-after, but have thus far only been discovered serendipitously. Here, through systematically mining databases for correlations between the cytotoxicity of 4,518 clinical and preclinical small molecules and the expression levels of E3 ligase components across hundreds of human cancer cell lines3-5, we identify CR8-a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor6-as a compound that acts as a molecular glue degrader. The CDK-bound form of CR8 has a solvent-exposed pyridyl moiety that induces the formation of a complex between CDK12-cyclin K and the CUL4 adaptor protein DDB1, bypassing the requirement for a substrate receptor and presenting cyclin K for ubiquitination and degradation. Our studies demonstrate that chemical alteration of surface-exposed moieties can confer gain-of-function glue properties to an inhibitor, and we propose this as a broader strategy through which target-binding molecules could be converted into molecular glues."
https://openalex.org/W3029307787,"The inferotemporal (IT) cortex is responsible for object recognition, but it is unclear how the representation of visual objects is organized in this part of the brain. Areas that are selective for categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found1–5, but large parts of IT cortex lack any known specialization, raising the question of what general principle governs IT organization. Here we used functional MRI, microstimulation, electrophysiology, and deep networks to investigate the organization of macaque IT cortex. We built a low-dimensional object space to describe general objects using a feedforward deep neural network trained on object classification6. Responses of IT cells to a large set of objects revealed that single IT cells project incoming objects onto specific axes of this space. Anatomically, cells were clustered into four networks according to the first two components of their preferred axes, forming a map of object space. This map was repeated across three hierarchical stages of increasing view invariance, and cells that comprised these maps collectively harboured sufficient coding capacity to approximately reconstruct objects. These results provide a unified picture of IT organization in which category-selective regions are part of a coarse map of object space whose dimensions can be extracted from a deep network. Primate inferotemporal cortex contains a coarse map of object space consisting of four networks, identified using functional imaging, electrophysiology and deep networks."
https://openalex.org/W3028673234,"Deregulation of metabolism and disruption of genome integrity are hallmarks of cancer1. Increased levels of the metabolites 2-hydroxyglutarate, succinate and fumarate occur in human malignancies owing to somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 or -2 (IDH1 or IDH2) genes, or germline mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase genes (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC and SDHD), respectively2-4. Recent work has made an unexpected connection between these metabolites and DNA repair by showing that they suppress the pathway of homology-dependent repair (HDR)5,6 and confer an exquisite sensitivity to inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) that are being tested in clinical trials. However, the mechanism by which these oncometabolites inhibit HDR remains poorly understood. Here we determine the pathway by which these metabolites disrupt DNA repair. We show that oncometabolite-induced inhibition of the lysine demethylase KDM4B results in aberrant hypermethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) at loci surrounding DNA breaks, masking a local H3K9 trimethylation signal that is essential for the proper execution of HDR. Consequently, recruitment of TIP60 and ATM, two key proximal HDR factors, is substantially impaired at DNA breaks, with reduced end resection and diminished recruitment of downstream repair factors. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for oncometabolite-induced HDR suppression and may guide effective strategies to exploit these defects for therapeutic gain."
https://openalex.org/W3026314418,"Mitochondria take up Ca2+ through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex to regulate energy production, cytosolic Ca2+ signalling and cell death1,2. In mammals, the uniporter complex (uniplex) contains four core components: the pore-forming MCU protein, the gatekeepers MICU1 and MICU2, and an auxiliary subunit, EMRE, essential for Ca2+ transport3-8. To prevent detrimental Ca2+ overload, the activity of MCU must be tightly regulated by MICUs, which sense changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations to switch MCU on and off9,10. Here we report cryo-electron microscopic structures of the human mitochondrial calcium uniporter holocomplex in inhibited and Ca2+-activated states. These structures define the architecture of this multicomponent Ca2+-uptake machinery and reveal the gating mechanism by which MICUs control uniporter activity. Our work provides a framework for understanding regulated Ca2+ uptake in mitochondria, and could suggest ways of modulating uniporter activity to treat diseases related to mitochondrial Ca2+ overload."
https://openalex.org/W3031640482,"Advances in the research of interactions between ultrafast free electrons and light have introduced a previously unknown kind of quantum matter, quantum free-electron wavepackets1–5. So far, studies of the interactions of cavity-confined light with quantum matter have focused on bound electron systems, such as atoms, quantum dots and quantum circuits, which are considerably limited by their fixed energy states, spectral range and selection rules. By contrast, quantum free-electron wavepackets have no such limits, but so far no experiment has shown the influence of a photonic cavity on quantum free-electron wavepackets. Here we develop a platform for multidimensional nanoscale imaging and spectroscopy of free-electron interactions with photonic cavities. We directly measure the cavity-photon lifetime via a coherent free-electron probe and observe an enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in the interaction strength relative to previous experiments of electron–photon interactions. Our free-electron probe resolves the spatiotemporal and energy–momentum information of the interaction. The quantum nature of the electrons is verified by spatially mapping Rabi oscillations of the electron spectrum. The interactions between free electrons and cavity photons could enable low-dose, ultrafast electron microscopy of soft matter or other beam-sensitive materials. Such interactions may also open paths towards using free electrons for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Future studies could achieve free-electron strong coupling6,7, photon quantum state synthesis8 and quantum nonlinear phenomena such as cavity electro-optomechanics9. The strong interaction of coherent free electrons with a photonic-crystal cavity enables the measurement of the lifetimes of the cavity modes and provides a technique for multidimensional near-field imaging and spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W3030733294,"Free-electron beams are versatile probes of microscopic structure and composition1,2, and have revolutionized atomic-scale imaging in several fields, from solid-state physics to structural biology3. Over the past decade, the manipulation and interaction of electrons with optical fields have enabled considerable progress in imaging methods4, near-field electron acceleration5,6, and four-dimensional microscopy techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution7. However, electron beams typically couple only weakly to optical excitations, and emerging applications in electron control and sensing8–11 require large enhancements using tailored fields and interactions. Here we couple a free-electron beam to a travelling-wave resonant cavity mode. The enhanced interaction with the optical whispering-gallery modes of dielectric microresonators induces a strong phase modulation on co-propagating electrons, which leads to a spectral broadening of 700 electronvolts, corresponding to the absorption and emission of hundreds of photons. By mapping the near-field interaction with ultrashort electron pulses in space and time, we trace the lifetime of the the microresonator following a femtosecond excitation and observe the spectral response of the cavity. The natural matching of free electrons to these quintessential optical modes could enable the application of integrated photonics technology in electron microscopy, with broad implications for attosecond structuring, probing quantum emitters and possible electron–light entanglement. The coupling between light and relativistic free electrons is enhanced through phase matching of electrons with optical whispering-gallery modes in dielectric microspheres and through extended modal lifetimes."
https://openalex.org/W3033499384,"Abstract High blood cholesterol is typically considered a feature of wealthy western countries 1,2 . However, dietary and behavioural determinants of blood cholesterol are changing rapidly throughout the world 3 and countries are using lipid-lowering medications at varying rates. These changes can have distinct effects on the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol, which have different effects on human health 4,5 . However, the trends of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol levels over time have not been previously reported in a global analysis. Here we pooled 1,127 population-based studies that measured blood lipids in 102.6 million individuals aged 18 years and older to estimate trends from 1980 to 2018 in mean total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol levels for 200 countries. Globally, there was little change in total or non-HDL cholesterol from 1980 to 2018. This was a net effect of increases in low- and middle-income countries, especially in east and southeast Asia, and decreases in high-income western countries, especially those in northwestern Europe, and in central and eastern Europe. As a result, countries with the highest level of non-HDL cholesterol—which is a marker of cardiovascular risk—changed from those in western Europe such as Belgium, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Malta in 1980 to those in Asia and the Pacific, such as Tokelau, Malaysia, The Philippines and Thailand. In 2017, high non-HDL cholesterol was responsible for an estimated 3.9 million (95% credible interval 3.7 million–4.2 million) worldwide deaths, half of which occurred in east, southeast and south Asia. The global repositioning of lipid-related risk, with non-optimal cholesterol shifting from a distinct feature of high-income countries in northwestern Europe, north America and Australasia to one that affects countries in east and southeast Asia and Oceania should motivate the use of population-based policies and personal interventions to improve nutrition and enhance access to treatment throughout the world."
https://openalex.org/W3032333420,"Pannexin 1 (PANX1) is an ATP-permeable channel with critical roles in a variety of physiological functions such as blood pressure regulation1, apoptotic cell clearance2 and human oocyte development3. Here we present several structures of human PANX1 in a heptameric assembly at resolutions of up to 2.8 angström, including an apo state, a caspase-7-cleaved state and a carbenoxolone-bound state. We reveal a gating mechanism that involves two ion-conducting pathways. Under normal cellular conditions, the intracellular entry of the wide main pore is physically plugged by the C-terminal tail. Small anions are conducted through narrow tunnels in the intracellular domain. These tunnels connect to the main pore and are gated by a long linker between the N-terminal helix and the first transmembrane helix. During apoptosis, the C-terminal tail is cleaved by caspase, allowing the release of ATP through the main pore. We identified a carbenoxolone-binding site embraced by W74 in the extracellular entrance and a role for carbenoxolone as a channel blocker. We identified a gap-junction-like structure using a glycosylation-deficient mutant, N255A. Our studies provide a solid foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the channel gating and inhibition of PANX1 and related large-pore channels."
https://openalex.org/W3028715630,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane complex (EMC) cooperates with the Sec61 translocon to co-translationally insert a transmembrane helix (TMH) of many multi-pass integral membrane proteins into the ER membrane, and it is also responsible for inserting the TMH of some tail-anchored proteins1-3. How EMC accomplishes this feat has been unclear. Here we report the first, to our knowledge, cryo-electron microscopy structure of the eukaryotic EMC. We found that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae EMC contains eight subunits (Emc1-6, Emc7 and Emc10), has a large lumenal region and a smaller cytosolic region, and has a transmembrane region formed by Emc4, Emc5 and Emc6 plus the transmembrane domains of Emc1 and Emc3. We identified a five-TMH fold centred around Emc3 that resembles the prokaryotic YidC insertase and that delineates a largely hydrophilic client protein pocket. The transmembrane domain of Emc4 tilts away from the main transmembrane region of EMC and is partially mobile. Mutational studies demonstrated that the flexibility of Emc4 and the hydrophilicity of the client pocket are required for EMC function. The EMC structure reveals notable evolutionary conservation with the prokaryotic insertases4,5, suggests that eukaryotic TMH insertion involves a similar mechanism, and provides a framework for detailed understanding of membrane insertion for numerous eukaryotic integral membrane proteins and tail-anchored proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3029443600,"The nature of the first genetic polymer is the subject of major debate1. Although the ‘RNA world’ theory suggests that RNA was the first replicable information carrier of the prebiotic era—that is, prior to the dawn of life2,3—other evidence implies that life may have started with a heterogeneous nucleic acid genetic system that included both RNA and DNA4. Such a theory streamlines the eventual ‘genetic takeover’ of homogeneous DNA from RNA as the principal information-storage molecule, but requires a selective abiotic synthesis of both RNA and DNA building blocks in the same local primordial geochemical scenario. Here we demonstrate a high-yielding, completely stereo-, regio- and furanosyl-selective prebiotic synthesis of the purine deoxyribonucleosides: deoxyadenosine and deoxyinosine. Our synthesis uses key intermediates in the prebiotic synthesis of the canonical pyrimidine ribonucleosides (cytidine and uridine), and we show that, once generated, the pyrimidines persist throughout the synthesis of the purine deoxyribonucleosides, leading to a mixture of deoxyadenosine, deoxyinosine, cytidine and uridine. These results support the notion that purine deoxyribonucleosides and pyrimidine ribonucleosides may have coexisted before the emergence of life5. A prebiotic synthesis of the purine DNA nucleosides (deoxyadenosine and deoxyinosine) in which the pyrimidine RNA nucleosides (cytidine and uridine) persist has implications for the coexistence of DNA and RNA at the dawn of life."
https://openalex.org/W3023017507,"During cell division, remodelling of the nuclear envelope enables chromosome segregation by the mitotic spindle1. The reformation of sealed nuclei requires ESCRTs (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) and LEM2, a transmembrane ESCRT adaptor2-4. Here we show how the ability of LEM2 to condense on microtubules governs the activation of ESCRTs and coordinated spindle disassembly. The LEM motif of LEM2 binds BAF, conferring on LEM2 an affinity for chromatin5,6, while an adjacent low-complexity domain (LCD) promotes LEM2 phase separation. A proline-arginine-rich sequence within the LCD binds to microtubules and targets condensation of LEM2 to spindle microtubules that traverse the nascent nuclear envelope. Furthermore, the winged-helix domain of LEM2 activates the ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein CHMP7 to form co-oligomeric rings. Disruption of these events in human cells prevented the recruitment of downstream ESCRTs, compromised spindle disassembly, and led to defects in nuclear integrity and DNA damage. We propose that during nuclear reassembly LEM2 condenses into a liquid-like phase and coassembles with CHMP7 to form a macromolecular O-ring seal at the confluence between membranes, chromatin and the spindle. The properties of LEM2 described here, and the homologous architectures of related inner nuclear membrane proteins7,8, suggest that phase separation may contribute to other critical envelope functions, including interphase repair8-13 and chromatin organization14-17."

https://openalex.org/W3018353191,"Advances in genetics and sequencing have identified a plethora of disease-associated and disease-causing genetic alterations. To determine causality between genetics and disease, accurate models for molecular dissection are required; however, the rapid expansion of transcriptional populations identified through single-cell analyses presents a major challenge for accurate comparisons between mutant and wild-type cells. Here we generate mouse models of human severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) using patient-derived mutations in the GFI1 transcription factor. To determine the effects of SCN mutations, we generated single-cell references for granulopoietic genomic states with linked epitopes1, aligned mutant cells to their wild-type equivalents and identified differentially expressed genes and epigenetic loci. We find that GFI1-target genes are altered sequentially, as cells go through successive states of differentiation. These insights facilitated the genetic rescue of granulocytic specification but not post-commitment defects in innate immune effector function, and underscore the importance of evaluating the effects of mutations and therapy within each relevant cell state. Mouse models of severe congenital neutropenia using patient-derived mutations in the GFI1 locus are used to determine the mechanisms by which the disease progresses."
https://openalex.org/W3030801603,"Meiosis, although essential for reproduction, is also variable and error-prone: rates of chromosome crossover vary among gametes, between the sexes, and among humans of the same sex, and chromosome missegregation leads to abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy)1-8. To study diverse meiotic outcomes and how they covary across chromosomes, gametes and humans, we developed Sperm-seq, a way of simultaneously analysing the genomes of thousands of individual sperm. Here we analyse the genomes of 31,228 human gametes from 20 sperm donors, identifying 813,122 crossovers and 787 aneuploid chromosomes. Sperm donors had aneuploidy rates ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 aneuploidies per gamete; crossovers partially protected chromosomes from nondisjunction at the meiosis I cell division. Some chromosomes and donors underwent more-frequent nondisjunction during meiosis I, and others showed more meiosis II segregation failures. Sperm genomes also manifested many genomic anomalies that could not be explained by simple nondisjunction. Diverse recombination phenotypes-from crossover rates to crossover location and separation, a measure of crossover interference-covaried strongly across individuals and cells. Our results can be incorporated with earlier observations into a unified model in which a core mechanism, the variable physical compaction of meiotic chromosomes, generates interindividual and cell-to-cell variation in diverse meiotic phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W3031360434,"The U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) has an essential role in the selection of the precursor mRNA branch-site adenosine, the nucleophile for the first step of splicing1. Stable addition of U2 during early spliceosome formation requires the DEAD-box ATPase PRP52-7. Yeast U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) nucleotides that form base pairs with the branch site are initially sequestered in a branchpoint-interacting stem-loop (BSL)8, but whether the human U2 snRNA folds in a similar manner is unknown. The U2 SF3B1 protein, a common mutational target in haematopoietic cancers9, contains a HEAT domain (SF3B1HEAT) with an open conformation in isolated SF3b10, but a closed conformation in spliceosomes11, which is required for stable interaction between U2 and the branch site. Here we report a 3D cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human 17S U2 snRNP at a core resolution of 4.1 Å and combine it with protein crosslinking data to determine the molecular architecture of this snRNP. Our structure reveals that SF3B1HEAT interacts with PRP5 and TAT-SF1, and maintains its open conformation in U2 snRNP, and that U2 snRNA forms a BSL that is sandwiched between PRP5, TAT-SF1 and SF3B1HEAT. Thus, substantial remodelling of the BSL and displacement of BSL-interacting proteins must occur to allow formation of the U2-branch-site helix. Our studies provide a structural explanation of why TAT-SF1 must be displaced before the stable addition of U2 to the spliceosome, and identify RNP rearrangements facilitated by PRP5 that are required for stable interaction between U2 and the branch site."
https://openalex.org/W3022715769,"In most species, homologous chromosomes must recombine in order to segregate accurately during meiosis1. Because small chromosomes would be at risk of missegregation if recombination were randomly distributed, the double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination are not located arbitrarily2. How the nonrandomness of DSB distributions is controlled is not understood, although several pathways are known to regulate the timing, location and number of DSBs. Meiotic DSBs are generated by Spo11 and accessory DSB proteins, including Rec114 and Mer2, which assemble on chromosomes3–7 and are nearly universal in eukaryotes8–11. Here we demonstrate how Saccharomyces cerevisiae integrates multiple temporally distinct pathways to regulate the binding of Rec114 and Mer2 to chromosomes, thereby controlling the duration of a DSB-competent state. The engagement of homologous chromosomes with each other regulates the dissociation of Rec114 and Mer2 later in prophase I, whereas the timing of replication and the proximity to centromeres or telomeres influence the accumulation of Rec114 and Mer2 early in prophase I. Another early mechanism enhances the binding of Rec114 and Mer2 specifically on the shortest chromosomes, and is subject to selection pressure to maintain the hyperrecombinogenic properties of these chromosomes. Thus, the karyotype of an organism and its risk of meiotic missegregation influence the shape and evolution of its recombination landscape. Our results provide a cohesive view of a multifaceted and evolutionarily constrained system that allocates DSBs to all pairs of homologous chromosomes. Several mechanisms regulate the distribution of double-strand breaks during meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ensuring that the shortest chromosomes are able to successfully recombine."
https://openalex.org/W3022807137,"The three-dimensional architecture of the genome governs its maintenance, expression and transmission. The cohesin protein complex organizes the genome by topologically linking distant loci, and is highly enriched in specialized chromosomal domains surrounding centromeres, called pericentromeres1-6. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of pericentromeres in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and establish the relationship between genome organization and function. We find that convergent genes mark pericentromere borders and, together with core centromeres, define their structure and function by positioning cohesin. Centromeres load cohesin, and convergent genes at pericentromere borders trap it. Each side of the pericentromere is organized into a looped conformation, with border convergent genes at the base. Microtubule attachment extends a single pericentromere loop, size-limited by convergent genes at its borders. Reorienting genes at borders into a tandem configuration repositions cohesin, enlarges the pericentromere and impairs chromosome biorientation during mitosis. Thus, the linear arrangement of transcriptional units together with targeted cohesin loading shapes pericentromeres into a structure that is competent for chromosome segregation. Our results reveal the architecture of the chromosomal region within which kinetochores are embedded, as well as the restructuring caused by microtubule attachment. Furthermore, we establish a direct, causal relationship between the three-dimensional genome organization of a specific chromosomal domain and cellular function."
https://openalex.org/W3029168653,"ATP11C, a member of the P4-ATPase flippase, translocates phosphatidylserine from the outer to the inner plasma membrane leaflet, and maintains the asymmetric distribution of phosphatidylserine in the living cell. We present the crystal structures of a human plasma membrane flippase, ATP11C–CDC50A complex, in a stabilized E2P conformation. The structure revealed a deep longitudinal crevice along transmembrane helices continuing from the cell surface to the phospholipid occlusion site in the middle of the membrane. We observed that the extension of the crevice on the exoplasmic side is open, and the complex is therefore in an outward-open E2P state, similar to a recently reported cryo-EM structure of yeast flippase Drs2p–Cdc50p complex. We noted extra densities, most likely bound phosphatidylserines, in the crevice and in its extension to the extracellular side. One was close to the phosphatidylserine occlusion site as previously reported for the human ATP8A1–CDC50A complex, and the other in a cavity at the surface of the exoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer. Substitutions in either of the binding sites or along the path between them impaired specific ATPase and transport activities. These results provide evidence that the observed crevice is the conduit along that phosphatidylserine traverses from the outer leaflet to its occlusion site in the membrane and suggest that the exoplasmic cavity is important for phospholipid recognition. They also yield insights into how phosphatidylserine is incorporated from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane into the transmembrane."

https://openalex.org/W3033201736,"Nester abundance is a key measure of the performance of the world's largest green turtle rookery at Raine Island, Australia, and has been estimated by mark-resight counts since 1984. Nesters are first marked by painting their carapace with a longitudinal white stripe. Painted and unpainted turtles are then counted by a surface observer on a small boat in waters adjacent to the reef. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and underwater video may provide more cost-effective and less biased alternatives to this approach, but estimates must be comparable with historical estimates. Here we compare and evaluate the three methods. We found comparatively little variation in resighting probabilities between consecutive days of sampling or time of day, which supports an underlying assumption of the method (i.e. demographic closure during sampling). This lack of bias in the location availability for detection of painted versus unpainted turtles and further supported by a parallel satellite tracking study of 40 turtles at Raine Island. Our results demonstrated that surface observers consistently reported higher proportions of marked turtles than either the UAV or underwater video method. This in turn yielded higher population estimates with UAV or underwater video compared to the historical surface observer method, which suggested correction factors of 1.53 and 1.73 respectively. We attributed this to observer search error because a white marked turtle is easier to spot than the non-marked turtle. In contrast, the UAV and underwater video methods allowed subsequent frame-by-frame review, thus reducing observer search error. UAVs were the most efficient in terms of survey time, personnel commitment and weather tolerance compared to the other methods. However, underwater video may also be a useful alternative for in-water mark-resight surveys of turtles."
https://openalex.org/W3033122705,"Distinct zonation of community assemblages among habitats is a ubiquitous feature of coral reefs. The distribution of roving herbivorous fishes (parrotfishes, surgeonfishes and rabbitfishes) is a particularly clear example, with the abundance of these fishes generally peaking in shallow-water, high-energy habitats, regardless of the biogeographic realm. Yet, our understanding of the factors which structure this habitat partitioning, especially with regards to different facets of structural complexity and nutritional resource availability, is limited. To address this issue, we used three-dimensional photogrammetry and structure-from-motion technologies to describe five components of structural complexity (rugosity, coral cover, verticality, refuge density and field-of-view) and nutritional resource availability (grazing surface area) among habitats and considered how these factors are related to herbivorous fish distributions. All complexity metrics (including coral cover) were highest on the slope and crest. Nutritional resource availability differed from this general pattern and peaked on the outer-flat. Unexpectedly, when compared to the distribution of herbivorous fishes, none of the complexity metrics had a marked influence in the models. However, grazing surface area was a strong predictor of both the abundance and biomass of herbivorous fishes. The strong relationship between grazing surface area and herbivorous fish distributions indicates that nutritional resource availability may be one of the primary factors driving the distribution of roving herbivorous fishes. The lack of a relationship between complexity and herbivorous fishes, and a strong affinity of herbivorous fishes for low-complexity, algal turf-dominated outer-flat habitats, offers some cautious optimism that herbivory may be sustained on future, low-complexity, algal turf-dominated reef configurations."
https://openalex.org/W3031151891,"Feeding of rapeseed (canola) oil with a high erucic acid concentration is known to cause hepatic steatosis in animals. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation plays a central role in liver lipid homeostasis, so it is possible that hepatic metabolism of erucic acid might decrease mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. However, the precise mechanistic relationship between erucic acid levels and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is unclear. Using male Sprague–Dawley rats, along with biochemical and molecular biology approaches, we report here that peroxisomal β-oxidation of erucic acid stimulates malonyl-CoA formation in the liver and thereby suppresses mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Excessive hepatic uptake and peroxisomal β-oxidation of erucic acid resulted in appreciable peroxisomal release of free acetate, which was then used in the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA. Peroxisomal metabolism of erucic acid also remarkably increased the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio, suppressed sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activity, and thereby activated acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which stimulated malonyl-CoA biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA. Chronic feeding of a diet including high-erucic-acid rapeseed oil diminished mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and caused hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in the rats. Of note, administration of a specific peroxisomal β-oxidation inhibitor attenuated these effects. Our findings establish a cross-talk between peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. They suggest that peroxisomal oxidation of long-chain fatty acids suppresses mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by stimulating malonyl-CoA formation, which might play a role in fatty acid–induced hepatic steatosis and related metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3033634457,"The implementation of hospital-wide Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is still an unsolved quest for many hospital managers. EMRs have long been considered a key factor for improving healthcare quality and safety, reducing adverse events for patients, decreasing costs, optimizing processes, improving clinical research and obtaining best clinical performances. However, hospitals continue to experience resistance from professionals to accepting EMRs. This study combines institutional and individual factors to explain which determinants can trigger or inhibit the EMRs implementation in hospitals, and which variables managers can exploit to guide professionals’ behaviours. Data have been collected through a survey administered to physicians and nurses in an Italian University Hospital in Rome. A total of 114 high-quality responses had been received. Results show that both, physicians and nurses, expect many benefits from the use of EMRs. In particular, it is believed that the EMRs will have a positive impact on quality, efficiency and effectiveness of care; handover communication between healthcare workers; teaching, tutoring and research activities; greater control of your own business. Moreover, data show an interplay between individual and institutional determinants: normative factors directly affect perceived usefulness (C = 0.30 **), perceived ease of use (C = 0.26 **) and intention to use EMRs (C = 0.33 **), regulative factors affect the intention to use EMRs (C = -0.21 **), and perceived usefulness directly affect the intention to use EMRs (C = 0.33 **). The analysis carried out shows that the key determinants of the intention to use EMRs are the normative ones (peer influence) and the individual ones (perceived usefulness), and that perceived usefulness works also as a mediator between normative factors and intention to use EMRs. Therefore, Management can leverage on power users to motivate, generate and manage change."
https://openalex.org/W3031459901,"Soluble oligomers of aggregated tau accompany the accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils, a histological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and two dozen related neurodegenerative diseases. Both oligomers and fibrils seed the spread of Tau pathology, and by virtue of their low molecular weight and relative solubility, oligomers may be particularly pernicious seeds. Here, we report the formation of in vitro tau oligomers formed by an ionic liquid (IL15). Using IL15-induced recombinant tau oligomers and a dot blot assay, we discovered a mAb (M204) that binds oligomeric tau, but not tau monomers or fibrils. M204 and an engineered single-chain variable fragment (scFv) inhibited seeding by IL15-induced tau oligomers and pathological extracts from donors with AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This finding suggests that M204-scFv targets pathological structures that are formed by tau in neurodegenerative diseases. We found that M204-scFv itself partitions into oligomeric forms that inhibit seeding differently, and crystal structures of the M204-scFv monomer, dimer, and trimer revealed conformational differences that explain differences among these forms in binding and inhibition. The efficiency of M204-scFv antibodies to inhibit the seeding by brain tissue extracts from different donors with tauopathies varied among individuals, indicating the possible existence of distinct amyloid polymorphs. We propose that by binding to oligomers, which are hypothesized to be the earliest seeding-competent species, M204-scFv may have potential as an early-stage diagnostic for AD and tauopathies, and also could guide the development of promising therapeutic antibodies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting nearly 50 million individuals worldwide, with no effective treatment or therapy even to slow disease progression (1Cova I. Markova A. Campini I. Grande G. Mariani C. Pomati S. Worldwide trends in the prevalence of dementia.J. Neurol.

AD is associated with the accumulation of extracellular plaques composed of Aβ peptides, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (2Goedert M. Wischik C.M. Crowther R.A. Walker J.E. Klug A. Cloning and sequencing of the cDNA encoding a core protein of the paired helical filament of Alzheimer disease: identification as the microtubule-associated protein tau.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although the cascade of molecular events that leads to AD is not fully understood, the spreading of tau pathology through the brain tracks with cognitive decline (3Brier M.R. Gordon B.

Besides AD, numerous other neurodegenerative disorders are associated with the deposition of aggregated tau in the brain. Referred to as tauopathies, these include chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 (FTDP-17), progressive supranuclear palsy, and Pick's disease among others (5Ghetti B.

Tauopathies are distinguished from AD by an absence of fibrillar inclusions of β-amyloid, although tau pathology is thought to progress in both by the seeded spreading of aggregated tau from cell to cell in a prion-like manner (7Brundin P.

Oligomeric inclusions of soluble tau could form prior to the deposition of larger neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, and soluble oligomers have been shown to provoke neuronal toxicity and accumulation of fibrillar tau inclusions (8Cárdenas-Aguayo M.D C.

Our laboratory has previously used a structure-based approach to design inhibitors targeting three amyloidogenic segments of tau, SVQIVY, VQIVYK, and VQIINK. These inhibitors are capable of blocking tau aggregation, and underscore the important role of these segments in driving tau aggregation and seeding (19Seidler P.M. Boyer D.R. Rodriguez J.A.

Taking a different approach to inhibitor design, others have exploited tau antibodies that bind various epitopes and inhibit seeding. Passive immunization with anti-tau oligomer antibodies called “tau oligomer mAb” (TOMA) reduced levels of tau oligomers and reversed locomotor and memory deficits in tau P301L mice, suggesting that antibodies that target tau oligomers may be effective therapeutics for AD and various tauopathies (24Castillo-Carranza D.L.

Here we report that a novel inducer of tau aggregation: ionic liquid 15 (IL15), promotes the formation of prefibrillar tau oligomers that can be isolated for biochemical studies. Using IL15-induced oligomers of tau-K18, we discovered that a monoclonal rabbit antibody (M204) that was purified from A11 polyclonal serum binds to oligomeric tau, but not to recombinant monomers or fibrils (25Kayed R. Canto I. Breydo L. Rasool S. Lukacsovich T. Wu J. Albay 3rd, R. Pensalfini A. Yeung S. Head E. Marsh J.L. Glabe C. Conformation dependent monoclonal antibodies distinguish different replicating strains or conformers of prefibrillar Aβ oligomers.Mol. Neurodegener. 2010; 5 (21144050): 5710.1186/1750-1326-5-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We engineered a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) construct of M204 and found that it too forms oligomers of different molecular weights, and that M204-scFv inhibits seeding by isolates from the autopsied brains of human donors with AD and CTE. Structures of the scFv M204 monomer, dimer, and trimer reveal differences in the antigen-binding loops, suggesting a structural basis for the enhanced inhibition of tau seeding by oligomeric forms of the scFv antibody. To produce prefibrillar, seeding-competent oligomers of tau, we sought new inducers of aggregation. Because classic aggregation inducers, heparin and arachidonic acid, yield fibrillar aggregates too rapidly to permit isolation of oligomeric intermediates of aggregated tau, we surveyed a panel of 24 ionic liquids to find slower inducers of aggregation using a thioflavin T (ThT) assay (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1). We turned to ionic liquids (IL) because many aggregation catalysts of tau are charged molecules, and ILs are reported to alter the solubility of other amyloid proteins and fibrils (26Takekiyo T. Yoshimura Y. Suppression and dissolution of amyloid aggregates using ionic liquids.Biophys.

Phys. 2012; 14 (22089924): 790-80110.1039/c1cp22965fCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial work was on the 129-residue microtubule-binding domain of tau, known as tau-K18 (29Barghorn S. Mandelkow E. Toward a unified scheme for the aggregation of tau into Alzheimer paired helical filaments.Biochemistry. 2002; 41 (12475237): 14885-1489610.1021/bi026469jCrossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Of the 24 ionic liquids screened, two induced tau-K18 aggregation: 50% (w/v) 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium n-octylsulfate (IL15) and 50% (w/v) triisobutylmethylphosphonium tosylate (IL23). IL15 catalyzed aggregation of tau-K18 more robustly than IL23, but with a lag time that was about 5 times longer than heparin-induced aggregation. The slower kinetics of IL15-induced aggregation allowed us to isolate oligomers during a short kinetic window, referred to as the oligomer extraction window, which corresponds to the early appearance of the ThT signal (Fig. 1A). Reducing the rate of aggregation seems to be an effective way of forming tau oligomers because it was also shown that oligomers of tau can be isolated and chemically stabilized by aggregation at 4 °C (30Karikari T.K. Nagel D.A. Grainger A. Clarke-Bland C. Hill E.J. Moffat K.G. Preparation of stable tau oligomers for cellular and biochemical studies.Anal. Biochem. 2019; 566 (30315761): 67-7410.1016/j.ab.2018.10.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). IL15-induced oligomers of tau-K18 isolated during the oligomer extraction window were purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 1B) and tested for immunoreactivity and seeding. As shown in Fig. 1C, the tau-K18 oligomer peak reacted with the polyclonal antisera A11, previously shown to be conformation-specific for amyloid oligomers (31Kayed R. Head E. Sarsoza F. Saing T. Cotman C.W. Necula M. Margol L. Wu J. Breydo L. Thompson J.L. Rasool S. Gurlo T. Butler P. Glabe C.G.

These results agree with other studies that show the A11 antibody binds to a common structural motif in amyloid oligomers (31Kayed R. Head E. Sarsoza F. Saing T. Cotman C.W. Necula M. Margol L. Wu J.

Electron micrographs of the oligomer peak fraction revealed a mixture of protofilaments, spherical or disk aggregates that were 10-20 nm in diameter, and apparent mixtures of the two, which as shown in inset 1 of Fig. 1E, resemble spherical aggregates with emerging protofilaments. By contrast, the monomer fraction was mostly devoid of apparent aggregates (Fig. 1D). When incubated with IL15 for longer times, ThT fluorescence signal plateaued and electron micrographs revealed fibrillar aggregates that display cross-β diffraction (Fig. 1, F and G), suggesting that the end point aggregates that are formed by IL15 are fibrils. Seeding by tau-K18 oligomers was measured in HEK293 tau biosensor cells that express YFP-tagged tau-K18 (33). As shown in Fig. 1, H–K, tau-K18 oligomers purified by SEC robustly seed aggregation in tau biosensor cells, whereas tau-K18 from the monomer peak shows no seeding activity. End point tau-K18 fibrils induced by IL15 also seeded biosensor cells at a level similar to the purified tau-K18 oligomers (Fig. S2). As an alternative to A11 polyclonal antisera, we sought a mAb that would be more amenable to protein engineering, because antibody variants can exhibit different in vivo and therapeutic efficacies (33d'Abramo C. Acker C.M. Jimenez H. Davies P. Passive immunization in JNPL3 transgenic mice using an array of phospho-Tau specific antibodies.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 (26270821): e013577410.1371/journal.pone.0135774PubMed Google Scholar). Using purified preparations of IL15-induced tau-K18 oligomers, we screened a panel of monoclonal antibodies to find one that specifically recognized the oligomer, and could thus be used to engineer single-chain antibodies. We previously discovered a rabbit mAb derived from A11-producing rabbits called M204 that, like A11, recognizes oligomeric but not fibrillar conformations of amyloidogenic proteins (25Kayed R. Canto I. Breydo L. Rasool S. Lukacsovich T. Wu J. Albay 3rd, R. Pensalfini A. Yeung S. Head E. Marsh J.L. Glabe C. Conformation dependent monoclonal antibodies distinguish different replicating strains or conformers of prefibrillar Aβ oligomers.Mol. Neurodegener. 2010; 5 (21144050): 5710.1186/1750-1326-5-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Dot blots immunostained with M204 reveal strong immunoreactivity to SEC fractions containing the IL15-induced tau-K18 oligomer, but no immunoreactivity to SEC fractions containing the tau-K18 monomer (Fig. 2, B and C, and Fig. S3). In addition, neither recombinant fibrils of full-length tau (tau40) nor purified tau40 had any immunoreactivity with M204 on the same immunoblot (Fig. 2C). Next, we analyzed binding of M204 to recombinant oligomers of tau-K18 and tau40 by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, D–F, M204 reacted with fractions containing both tau-K18 and tau40 oligomers, but not fractions containing monomers of either tau construct. To determine which tau sequences are recognized by the M204 antibody, we performed epitope mapping using an array of overlapping tau peptides. As shown in Fig. 3A, M204 bound the aggregation-driving segments VQIINK and SVQIVY more strongly than neighboring regions. These results suggest M204-tau oligomer recognition is mediated by the steric-zipper forming segments that drive tau aggregation, and suggest that these segments are presented differently in the oligomer conformation compared with the conformations of the monomer and recombinant fibril. Because M204 recognizes epitopes of prefibrillar structures that are important for tau aggregation, we asked if antibody binding inhibits seeding by IL15-induced tau oligomers. To test this, we measured seeding and inhibition in HEK293 tau biosensor cells (34Kaufman S.K. Sanders D.W. Thomas T.L. Ruchinskas A.J. Vaquer-Alicea J. Sharma A.M. Miller T.M. Diamond M.I. Tau prion strains dictate patterns of cell pathology, progression rate, and regional vulnerability in vivo.Neuron. 2016; 92 (27974162): 796-81210.1016/j.neuron.2016.09.055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, B–D, IL15-induced tau-K18 oligomers strongly seeded aggregation in tau biosensor cells, and seeding was inhibited by the addition of purified 10 μm M204. Next, we sought to determine whether AD brain-derived tau was immunoreactive to M204. We found M204 immunoreactivity in both the crude and Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of an extract from the brain of a donor with AD, however, the immunoreactivity was markedly stronger in the crude and Sarkosyl-soluble fractions compared with the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction (Fig. 3E and Fig. S4). Consistent with previous data showing that A11 does not stain large fibrils from AD tissue (31Kayed R. Head E. Sarsoza F. Saing T. Cotman C.W. Necula M. Margol L. Wu J. Breydo L. Thompson J.L. Rasool S. Gurlo T. Butler P. Glabe C.G. Fibril specific, conformation dependent antibodies recognize a generic epitope common to amyloid fibrils and fibrillar oligomers that is absent in prefibrillar oligomers.Mol. Neurodegener. 2007; 2 (17897471): 1810.1186/1750-1326-2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), no immunoreactivity was found in the same tissue probed with A11. Because A11 is polyclonal, the amount of M204-like antibody in the A11 antiserum may be too low to detect low levels oligomers that could be present in the AD tissue. These data suggest that small concentrations of oligomer in AD tissue that are not detected by A11 may be detected using M204. Because M204 is an inhibitor of tau seeding and shows immunoreactivity with AD brain extract, we aimed to engineer a single-chain (scFv) version of the antibody, which because of its smaller size, may possess greater tissue penetration than the full-length antibody (35Nelson A.L.

As shown in Fig. 4, the scFv construct is a small antibody of 247 residues generated by connecting the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) of Igs using a flexible linker (36Bird R.E.

To overcome this limitation, we fused the M204-scFv to a PelB leader sequence to shuttle the protein to the bacterial periplasm. Using this expression system, we achieved 1-2 mg yields of purified protein per liter of bacteria. SEC of purified M204-scFv revealed different oligomer forms: monomer, dimer, and trimer (Fig. 4C). It has been reported that scFv antibodies may form dimers depending on the sequence of the antibody and/or the flexible linker (39Arndt K.M. Muller K.M. Pluckthun A. Factors influencing the dimer to monomer transition of an antibody single-chain Fv fragment.Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (9737871): 12918-1292610.1021/bi9810407Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 40Griffiths A.D.

We tested the possibility that M204-scFv forms intermolecular disulfide bonds that stabilize the oligomer by comparing the mobility of purified M204-scFv by reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4D). Under reducing conditions, the M204-scFv proteins that eluted from the SEC as monomers, dimers, and trimers all migrated with similar mobility by SDS-PAGE. However, nonreducing conditions revealed distinct high molecular weight bands for the dimer and trimer SEC fractions, suggesting that the dimer and trimer species are disulfide linked. Notably the dimer species is the stronger band in both the dimer and trimer lanes, suggesting the dimer is the more stable of the oligomeric scFv species. That, and the appearance of monomer in the dimer and trimer lanes (Fig. 4D, seventh and 11th lanes), along with the appearance of some potential dimer in the monomer fraction (lane 3) suggests that there exists some degree of interconversion among scFv oligomers, potentially complicating biochemical analyzes of the different M204-scFv oligomer species. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that different oligomeric forms of M204-scFv can be enriched. We compared the tau immunoreactivity of the different M204-scFv oligomers by ELISA. All three M204-scFv species recognized tau-K18 oligomer, and none recognized the tau-K18 monomer, indicating that the engineered scFv has the same specificity as the mAb for tau oligomers (Fig. 5, A–D, and Fig. S5). M204-scFv dimer and trimer showed higher binding signals for tau oligomers compared with the monomer, suggesting that the M204-scFv dimer and trimer might have better potential to bind and inhibit tau oligomers. To test the ability of M204-scFv to inhibit the primary aggregation of tau, we added different ratios of M204-scFv monomer, dimer, and trimer to tau-K18 monomer, and measured aggregation using an in vitro ThT assay. All of the M204-scFv antibodies delayed fibril formation at ratios of 1:1 and 1:0.5 (tau-K18:scFv) (Fig. 5, E–G). However, the M204-scFv dimer exhibited the most pronounced delay in lag time, whereas the M204-scFv monomer showed the smallest effect. The delay in tau fibril formation was somewhat unexpected as neither monoclonal M204 nor the M204-scFvs showed binding to either recombinant tau fibrils or monomers. These results suggest that tau oligomers may be formed transiently during the fibrillization, and we speculate that these prefibrillar tau-K18 oligomers could thus become the target of M204 inhibition. To determine whether our M204-scFv antibodies are inhibitors of seeding by tau fibrils from pathological tissues, we tested the seeding and inhibition of fibrils that were extracted from AD brain tissue. Electron micrographs of extracted fibrils from one representative AD donor confirms that the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction contains an abundance of fibrils, but without apparent oligomers (Fig. 6A). Nevertheless as shown in Fig. 6, B–F, dimers and trimers of M204-scFv block seeding by extracts from three different AD donors. M204-scFv monomer on the other hand is a poor inhibitor of seeding, and in one case, even stimulates seeding (Fig. 6C). Because we hypoth"

In this context, there are no restrictions on arbitrary editing, copying, modification, and dissemination of digital images, music, etc., which leads to various social problems such as information security, copyright disputes, and piracy. With the advancement of networks and multimedia, digital watermarking technology has received worldwide attention as an effective method of copyright protection. Improving the anti-geometric attack ability of digital watermarking algorithms using image feature-based algorithms have received extensive attention. This paper proposes a novel robust watermarking algorithm based on SURF-DCT perceptual hashing (Speeded Up Robust Features and Discrete Cosine Transform), namely blind watermarking. The algorithm firstly uses the affine transformation with a feature matrix and chaotic encryption technology to preprocess the watermark image, enhance the confidentiality of the watermark, and perform block and DCT coefficients extraction on the carrier image, and then uses the positive and negative quantization rules to modify the DCT coefficients. The embedding of the watermark is completed, and the blind extraction of the watermark realized. Experiments show that the algorithm has good invisibility and strong robustness against conventional and geometric attacks and can effectively protect the security of images with NC value more than 90%."

Functionally important AGP glycans are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus, but the relationships among their glycosylation levels, processing, and functionalities are poorly understood. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of two Golgi-localized exo-β-1,3-galactosidases from the glycosyl hydrolase 43 (GH43) family in Arabidopsis thaliana. GH43 loss-of-function mutants exhibited root cell expansion defects in sugar-containing growth media. This root phenotype was associated with an increase in the extent of AGP cell wall association, as demonstrated by Yariv phenylglycoside dye quantification and comprehensive microarray polymer profiling of sequentially extracted cell walls. Characterization of recombinant GH43 variants revealed that the exo-β-1,3-galactosidase activity of GH43 enzymes is hindered by β-1,6 branches on β-1,3-galactans. In line with this steric hindrance, the recombinant GH43 variants did not release galactose from cell wall–extracted glycoproteins or AGP-rich gum arabic. These results indicate that the lack of exo-β-1,3-galactosidase activity alters cell wall extensibility in roots, a phenotype that could be explained by the involvement of galactosidases in AGP glycan biosynthesis.

Several GH43 enzymes from prokaryotes and eukaryotes have recently been characterized because of their potential in biomass degradation and other biotechnological applications (32Jordan D.B.

Based on their diverse identified enzymatic activities and amino acid motifs, the GH43s have been further subdivided into 37 subclades (30Mewis K. Lenfant N. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Dividing the large glycoside hydrolase family 43 into subfamilies: a motivation for detailed enzyme characterization.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2016; 82 (26729713): 1686-169210.1128/AEM.03453-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, no GH43 family enzyme from plants has yet been characterized. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains two genes encoding amino acid sequences with similarity to GH43 enzymes belonging to GH43 subfamily 24, named GH43A and GH43B (30Mewis K. Lenfant N. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Dividing the large glycoside hydrolase family 43 into subfamilies: a motivation for detailed enzyme characterization.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2016; 82 (26729713): 1686-169210.1128/AEM.03453-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize these GH43 enzymes and describe their role in cell expansion and root growth in A. thaliana. The A. thaliana genome encodes two putative glycosyl hydrolase 43 family enzymes according to the latest version of the Arabidopsis Information Resource database (TAIR; RRID:SCR_004618). Based on publicly available expression data, both genes are expressed in the cell elongation zone above the root meristem. To investigate the functional role of these GH43 enzymes, we first obtained mutants carrying exon T-DNA insertions in GH43A and GH43B (Fig. 1A). Initial analysis of the single gh43 mutants and the double gh43a-1/gh43b-1 mutant (gh43null henceforth) revealed no obvious visual phenotypes in seedlings (Fig. 1B). Several classic cell wall mutants in Arabidopsis show enhanced or conditional root growth defects on medium containing 4.5% exogenous sugar (34Hauser M.T. Morikami A. Benfey P.N. Conditional root expansion mutants of Arabidopsis.Development. 1995; 121 (7743935): 1237-1252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Benfey P.N. Linstead P.J. Roberts K. Schiefelbein J.W. Hauser M.T. Aeschbacher R.A. Root development in Arabidopsis: four mutants with dramatically altered root morphogenesis.Development. 1993; 119 (8275864): 57-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore grew the gh43 mutants on nutrient media without sugar for 4 days and then moved them to media containing 4.5% glucose for 6 days. During the 6 days on glucose media, the gh43a, gh43b, and WT roots elongated at similar rates, but in gh43null root growth was severely inhibited (Fig. 1, C and D). No change in growth rate was observed in controls moved to media without sugar (Fig. 1E). On sugar-containing media, the gh43null root epidermal cells exhibited clear swelling and loss of anisotropic growth (Fig. 1F). A time course experiment comparing WT and gh43null lines expressing the plasma membrane marker LTi6a-GFP revealed that the swelling was detectable in the cell elongation zone already after 6 h and became obvious after 10 h (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1). This cell expansion defect is not observed on media containing 4.5% sorbitol or 100 mm NaCl, showing that the phenotype cannot be caused by an osmotic effect alone or salt stress (Fig. S2). To confirm the causal gene defect responsible for the sugar-inducible loss of anisotropic growth, we performed complementation experiments by introducing either GH43A-YFP or GH43B-YFP under the control of their native promoters into gh43null background. Both constructs rescued the root growth phenotype on sugar, albeit GH43B-YFP only partially (Fig. 1D). The GH43B-YFP construct contained a 1-kb promoter sequence, whereas in the GH43A-YFP the promoter length was 1.9 kb, possibly explaining the difference in complementation efficiency. The GH43-YFP constructs may not fully replicate the native GH43 expression, but in line with the root swelling phenotype a strong YFP signal was observed in the elongation zone of the GH43-YFP expressing roots (Fig. 2B). Based on these results we conclude that the GH43 proteins are functionally redundant in the elongation zone of young roots. We also observed a clear GH43-YFP signal in the root cap cells suggesting a function for GH43s also in these cells (Fig. 2B). The pGH43A:GH43A-YFP and pGH43B:GH43B-YFP lines were used to investigate the subcellular location of the GH43s. In the expanding root cells of 4-day–old seedlings, both GH43A-YFP and GH43B-YFP appeared to localize to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3A). To confirm the Golgi localization, the lines were crossed with lines carrying the cis-Golgi marker SYP32-mCherry or the trans-Golgi network marker SYP43-mCherry (Fig. 3A) (36Uemura T. Ueda T.

Both GH43 proteins co-localized with the Golgi markers. However, the overlap with SYP32-mCherry was higher than with SYP43-mCherry, indicating an enrichment on the incoming transport vesicle side of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3, B and C). In further support of the Golgi localization, both Arabidopsis GH43s were identified in Golgi-enriched cell extracts in global proteomics experiments (38Parsons H.T. Stevens T.J. McFarlane H.E.

The predicted hydrolase domains of the two Arabidopsis GH43 proteins exhibit over 90% similarity at the amino acid sequence level, suggesting similar enzyme activity (Fig. S3).

To test for this activity, we expressed GH43A and GH43B in Escherichia coli and purified the recombinant proteins using nickel ion affinity chromatography (Fig. S4A). The activity of the recombinant GH43s was assayed against various of β-1,3-galactan di- and trisaccharides (Fig. 4). Both GH43 proteins hydrolyzed β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-GalpOMe, but not β-d-Galp-(1→6)-β-d-GalpOMe. To confirm that the observed β-1,3-galactosidase activity was because of the GH43 enzymes, we generated GH43 enzymes with mutations in the predicted active site. The mutation sites were selected based on sequence similarity with the active site of a Clostridium thermocellum GH43 protein whose structure was solved by crystallography (Fig. S4B) (42Jiang D. Fan J. Wang X. Zhao Y. Huang B. Liu J. Zhang X.C. Crystal structure of 1,3Gal43A, an exo-β-1,3-galactanase from Clostridium thermocellum.J. Struct.

Of the mutated versions, the GH43BE224Q had minor activity toward β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-GalpOMe, whereas GH43BE224Q,E338Q and GH43B337-339DEL were inactive toward β-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-GalpOMe (Fig. S4C). These assays confirmed that the Arabidopsis GH43s are β-1,3-galactosidases and support the conservation of active sites between bacteria and plants. β-1,3-Galactan in plant cell walls is mainly found on AGPs (43Du H. Clarke A.E. Bacic A. Arabinogalactan-proteins: a class of extracellular matrix proteoglycans involved in plant growth and development.Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6 (15157509): 411-41410.1016/S0962-8924(96)20036-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the presence of possible GH43 substrates in Arabidopsis cell walls, we sequentially extracted cell wall glycoproteins from Arabidopsis leaves using 0.2 m CaCl2, 50 mm CDTA, 0.5 m NaCO3, and 4 m NaOH, and analyzed the extracts by TLC before and after treatment with the GH43 proteins (Fig. S5A). Interestingly, the recombinant GH43s did not release galactose from any of the cell wall fractions, suggesting that the β-1,3-linkages were inaccessible. The recombinant GH43s also failed to release galactose from gum arabic, which is rich in AGPs (Fig. S5B) (44Akiyama Y. Eda S. Kato K. Gum arabic is a kind of arabinogalactan protein.Agr. Biol. Chem. Tokyo. 1984; 48: 235-23710.1271/bbb1961.48.235Google Scholar). Even partial deglycosylation of the AGPs was insufficient to allow the GH43 proteins access to the β-1,3-linkages (Fig. S5B). These observations suggested that the β-1,3-linkages of mature AGPs may be protected against GH43 activity. To investigate the enzymatic mechanism of the Arabidopsis GH43 proteins in more depth, we synthesized β-1,3-galactan"
https://openalex.org/W3034147067,"Introduction Intimate partner violence during pregnancy can contribute to maternal mortality and morbidity by limiting women’s ability to receive maternal health services including antenatal care and skilled delivery care. In Ethiopia, evidence regarding intimate partner violence during pregnancy is limited, and no previous studies have been conducted in the Harari region. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of intimate partner violence during pregnancy among women who had given birth in public hospitals in Harari regional state, eastern Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2018 to April 2019 among women who had given birth in public hospitals in Harari regional state, East Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling method was employed to select 648 participants. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered standardized questionnaire based on the World Health Organization Multi-Country Study on Women’s Health and Domestic Violence against Women survey. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with respective confidence intervals were computed. Variables with a p-value of ≤0.05 were considered to have a significant association with intimate partner violence during pregnancy. Results The prevalence of intimate partner violence during the most recent pregnancy was found to be 39.81%. Furthermore, the prevalence of physical, emotional and sexual violence were found to be 25.93%, 25.62% and 3.7%, respectively. Longer duration of marriage (adjusted odds ratio = 1.68, 95% confidence interval = 1.01–2.79), most recent pregnancy being unplanned (adjusted odds ratio = 1.55, 95% confidence interval = 1.03–2.34), experiencing controlling behaviour by a partner, (adjusted odds ratio = 2.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.46–3.40) and having an attitude that justifies intimate partner violence (adjusted odds ratio = 1.60, 95% confidence interval = 1.09–2.36) were associated with experiencing intimate partner violence. Conclusion The prevalence of intimate partner violence during pregnancy was found to be high. Pregnancy monitoring programs, which can detect and intervene with regard to partner’s controlling behaviors and women’s perception regarding justification of intimate partner violence, especially in those women with an unplanned pregnancy, could help to reduce intimate partner violence during pregnancy. Further, changing social norms that condone violence through advocacy and awareness creation might help in preventing partner violence."
https://openalex.org/W3033580243,"Nutritional Programming (NP) has been studied as a means of mitigating the negative effects of dietary plant protein (PP), but the optimal timing and mechanism behind NP are still unknown. The objectives of this study were: 1) To determine whether zebrafish (Danio rerio) can be programmed to soybean meal (SBM) through early feeding and broodstock exposure to improve SBM utilization; 2) To determine if NP in zebrafish affects expression of genes associated with intestinal nutrient uptake; 3) To determine if early stage NP and/or broodstock affects gene expression associated with intestinal inflammation or any morphological changes in the intestinal tract that might improve dietary SBM utilization. Two broodstocks were used to form the six experimental groups. One broodstock group received fishmeal (FM) diet (FMBS), while the other was fed (“programmed with”) SBM diet (PPBS). The first ((+) Control) and the second group ((-) Control) received FM and SBM diet for the entire study, respectively, and were progeny of FMBS. The last four groups consisted of a non-programmed (FMBS-X-PP and PPBS-X-PP) and a programmed group (FMBS-NP-PP and PPBS-NP-PP) from each of the broodstocks. The programming occurred through feeding with SBM diet during 13–23 dph. The non-control groups underwent a PP-Challenge, receiving SBM diet during 36–60 dph. During the PP-Challenge, both PPBS groups experienced significantly lower weight gains than the (+) Control group. NP in early life stages significantly increased the expression of PepT1 in PPBS-NP-PP, compared to PPBS-X-PP. NP also tended to increase the expression of fabp2 in the programmed vs. non-programmed groups of both broodstocks. The highest distal villus length-to-width ratio was observed in the dual-programmed group, suggesting an increase in surface area for nutrient absorption within the intestine. The results of this study suggest that NP during early life stages may increase intestinal absorption of nutrients from PP-based feeds."
https://openalex.org/W3033508732,"Background Bacteria that have acquired antimicrobial resistance, in particular ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, are an important healthcare concern. Therefore, transmission routes and risk factors are of interest, especially for the carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli. Since there is an enhanced risk for pig slaughterhouse employees to carry ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, associated with animal contact as potential risk factor, the present study investigated the occurrence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in poultry slaughterhouse employees. Due to the higher level of resistant Enterobacteriaceae in primary poultry production than in pig production, a higher risk of intestinal colonization of poultry slaughterhouse employees was expected. Results ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 5.1% (5 of 99) of the fecal samples of slaughterhouse workers. The species of these isolates was confirmed as E. coli. PCR assays revealed the presence of the genes blaCTX-M-15 (n = 2) and blaSHV-12 (n = 3) in these isolates, partly in combination with the β-lactamase gene blaTEM-135. Participants were divided into two groups according to their occupational exposure and results indicated an increased probability of colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae for the group of ‘higher exposure’ (OR 3.7, exact 95% CI 0.6–23.5; p = 0.4). For intestinal colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, a prevalence of 10% (3/30) was observed in the group of ‘higher exposure’ versus 2.9% (2/69) in the group of ‘lower exposure’. Employees in working steps such as ‘hanging’ poultry in the process of slaughter and ‘evisceration’ seemed to have a higher risk for intestinal colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae compared to the group of ‘lower exposure’. Conclusion This study is the first of its kind to collect data on the occupational exposure of slaughterhouse workers to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Europe. The results suggested that colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is associated with occupational exposure in poultry slaughterhouses. However, the presence of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in only 5.1% (5/99) of the tested employees in poultry slaughterhouses suggests a lower transmission risk than in pig slaughterhouses."
https://openalex.org/W3032175982,"Mov10 is a processing body (P-body) protein and an interferon-stimulated gene that can affect replication of retroviruses, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The mechanism of HCV inhibition by Mov10 is unknown. Here, we investigate the effect of Mov10 on HCV infection and determine the virus life cycle steps affected by changes in Mov10 overexpression. Mov10 overexpression suppresses HCV RNA in both infectious virus and subgenomic replicon systems. Additionally, Mov10 overexpression decreases the infectivity of released virus, unlike control P-body protein DCP1a that has no effect on HCV RNA production or infectivity of progeny virus. Confocal imaging of uninfected cells shows endogenous Mov10 localized at P-bodies. However, in HCV-infected cells, Mov10 localizes in circular structures surrounding cytoplasmic lipid droplets with NS5A and core protein. Mutagenesis experiments show that the RNA binding activity of Mov10 is required for HCV inhibition, while its P-body localization, helicase, and ATP-binding functions are not required. Unexpectedly, endogenous Mov10 promotes HCV replication, as CRISPR-Cas9-based Mov10 depletion decreases HCV replication and infection levels. Our data reveal an important and complex role for Mov10 in HCV replication, which can be perturbed by excess or insufficient Mov10."

Here, using an array of biochemical approaches, including immunoprecipitation and fluorescence, calcium imaging, phosphate radiolabeling, and a β-arrestin–dependent luciferase assay, we characterize a GPCR–TRP channel pair, angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), and transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), in primary murine choroid plexus epithelial cells and immortalized cell lines. We found that AT1R and TRPV4 are binding partners and that activation of AT1R by angiotensin II (ANGII) elicits β-arrestin–dependent inhibition and internalization of TRPV4. Activating TRPV4 with endogenous and synthetic agonists inhibited angiotensin II–mediated G-protein–associated second messenger accumulation, AT1R receptor phosphorylation, and β-arrestin recruitment. We also noted that TRPV4 inhibits AT1R phosphorylation by activating the calcium-activated phosphatase calcineurin in a Ca2+/calmodulin–dependent manner, preventing β-arrestin recruitment and receptor internalization.

Tripping out on TRPV4.J. Mol. Med. 2015; 93 (26498124): 1283-128510.1007/s00109-015-1347-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Because of their ubiquity, TRP channels are regulated by a wide array of GPCRs. For example, AT1R activation induces catecholamine secretion from chromaffin cells by recruiting and activating transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) (8Liu C.-H. Gong Z. Liang Z.-L.

A less well-explored aspect of the GPCR–TRP channel interaction is the ability of TRP channels to reciprocally regulate GPCRs. We recently reported that transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) can bind MOR1, inhibit MOR1 phosphorylation, and block β-arrestin recruitment (11Scherer P.C. Zaccor N.W. Neumann N.M.

TRPV1 activity inhibits ligand-induced phosphorylation of MOR1 by GRK5 and can induce β-arrestin nuclear translocation preventing recruitment to MOR1 (11Scherer P.C. Zaccor N.W. Neumann N.M.

We hypothesize that diverse GPCR–TRP channel-binding partners exhibit regulatory relationships. In particular, GPCRs and TRP channels that physically bind and have antagonistic signaling consequences, such as AT1R and TRPV4, may act as reciprocal regulators. AT1R and TRPV4 are each ubiquitously expressed, but are both particularly abundant in vascular endothelial/smooth muscle cells and the choroid plexus (5Shukla A.K. Kim J. Ahn S. Xiao K. Shenoy S.K.

In the vasculature, AT1R activation stimulates vasoconstriction, whereas TRPV4 activity induces vasodilation (13Filosa J.A. Yao X. Rath G. TRPV4 and the regulation of vascular tone.J. Cardiovasc.

In the choroid plexus, AT1R and TRPV4 have similarly oppositional signaling consequences. AT1R activation stimulates the secretion of vasopressin from choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs), leading to diminished blood flow to the choroid plexus and decreased secretion of CSF. In contrast, TRPV4 activity increases blood flow to the choroid and increases the flux of Cl− and K+ ions into the cerebral ventricles increasing CSF production. Thus, TRPV4 and AT1R are ideally suited to regulate CSF homeostasis by regulating one another’s activity. In this study we examine whether TRPV4 and AT1R exhibit a similar regulatory relationship as TRPV1 and MOR1. We explore the ability of TRPV4 to regulate AT1R activity, phosphorylation, and β-arrestin recruitment in the choroid plexus and immortalized cells and investigate how this regulatory relationship generalizes to other pairs of GPCR and TRP channels. TRPV4 and AT1R are co-expressed in a variety of cells types including vascular endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and CPECs (5Shukla A.K. Kim J. Ahn S. Xiao K. Shenoy S.K. Liedtke W.

Despite their co-expression in multiple tissues, TRPV4 and AT1R have only been shown to interact physically in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (5Shukla A.K. Kim J. Ahn S. Xiao K. Shenoy S.K.

In HEK293 cells, overexpressed HA–AT1R co-immunoprecipitates (co-IP) with FLAG–TRPV4 (Fig. 1A). Treating cells with the potent TRPV4 agonist GSK101 does not affect the binding of TRPV4 to AT1R (Fig. 1A). Cultured primary murine CPECs derived from WT mice at postnatal day 21 express endogenous TRPV4 and AT1R protein (Fig. 1B). Knockout of TRPV4 in CPECs cultured from TRPV4 null (TRPV4-KO) mice does not significantly alter AT1R expression in CPECs in vitro (Fig. 1B). TRPV4-KO eliminates the response of CPECs in vitro to 10 μm GSK101 by calcium imaging (Fig. S1A). WT CPECs express mRNA for both TRPV4 (probe Trpv4) and AT1R (probe Agt1ra) (Fig. 1C). IP AT1R from whole choroid plexus of WT and TRPV4-KO mice suggests that TRPV4 and AT1R bind in primary cells at endogenous expression levels (Fig. S1B). AT1R is predominantly a Gαq-coupled GPCR. Ligand binding to AT1R increases phospholipase C activity, which cleaves membranous phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate into the second messengers diacylglycerol and IP3 (8Liu C.-H. Gong Z.

To monitor IP3 production, HEK293 cells overexpressing HA–AT1R and FLAG–TRPV4 were labeled with tritiated myo-inositol, and HPLC was used to separate the different phosphoinositol isoforms. ANGII stimulation of AT1R results in robust IP3 production, whereas pretreatment with 10 nm GSK101 for 5 min significantly inhibits IP3 production (Fig. 1D). HPLC analysis of the major phosphorylated inositol subtypes indicates that TRPV4 activation does not significantly alter levels of other phosphoinositol isoforms (Fig. S1C). Additionally, we did not find evidence that TRPV4 activation by GSK101 disrupts Gαq binding to AT1R (Fig. S1D). We next examined whether TRPV4 activity impacts ligand-induced phosphorylation of a GPCR-binding partner. AT1R phosphorylation, the most proximal signaling event that we can monitor, is required for AT1R-mediated inhibition of TRPV4 (5Shukla A.K. Kim J. Ahn S. Xiao K. Shenoy S.K. Liedtke W. Lefkowitz R.J. Arresting a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel.J. Biol.

HEK293 cells overexpressing HA–AT1R and FLAG–TRPV4 were incubated in [32P]orthophosphate and treated with combinations of 10 nm GSK101 and 100 nm ANGII. ANGII stimulates the phosphorylation of AT1R, but TRPV4 activation prior to ANGII treatment significantly inhibits the AT1R phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Compared with baseline, there is also a nonsignificant decrease in phosphorylation of AT1R when cells are treated with GSK101 alone (Fig. 2A). We did not measure AT1R phosphorylation changes in response to GSK101 when no TRPV4 was expressed. After a GPCR is phosphorylated, β-arrestin is recruited to bind the GPCR C terminus. IP of AT1R from HEK293 cells expressing FLAG–TRPV4, HA–AT1R, and YFP–β-arrestin after treatment with ANGII pulls down β-arrestin, which is blocked by pretreatment with GSK101 (Fig. 2B). We employed the luciferase-based TANGO system to explore details of β-arrestin recruitment to AT1R. The TANGO system leverages an engineered HEK293 cell line (HTLA) that produces the luciferase enzyme following β-arrestin translocation to the cell membrane and binding to a GPCR (19Kroeze W.K. Sassano M.F. Huang X.-P. Lansu K. McCorvy J.D. Giguère P.M. Sciaky N. Roth B.L. PRESTO-Tango as an open-source resource for interrogation of the druggable human GPCRome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (25895059): 362-36910.1038/nsmb.3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Activation of AT1R with 100 nm and 1 μm ANGII significantly increases β-arrestin recruitment to AT1R, which is blocked by TRPV4 activation with 10 nm GSK101 (Fig. 2C). The endogenous TRPV4 agonist 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid also inhibits β-arrestin recruitment to AT1R (Fig. S2A) (20Bihzad S.M. Yousif M.H.M. 11,12-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid induces vasodilator response in the rat perfused mesenteric vasculature.Auton. Autacoid Pharmacol. 2017; 37 (28332266): 3-1210.1111/aap.12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 10 nm GSK101 alone is sufficient to significantly decrease β-arrestin recruitment and luciferase production compared with baseline, which could indicate a reduction in ligand-independent phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). To determine whether our assay was measuring a reduction in ligand-independent phosphorylation, we treated HTLA cells with olmesartan, an inverse agonist of AT1R. Applying 5 nm olmesartan to HLTA cells expressing AT1R is sufficient to block β-arrestin recruitment but does not lower baseline luciferase production (Fig. S2B). Stimulating TRPV4 with increasing concentrations of GSK101 causes a dose-responsive decrease in the amount of β-arrestin recruitment to AT1R with an approximate IC50 between 0.5 and 1 nm (Fig. 2D). GSK101 has no effect when TRPV4 is not expressed (Fig. S2C). Preincubation of cells with the TRPV4 antagonist HC067 (Fig. 2E) and ruthenium red, another TRP channel antagonist, dose-dependently rescues ANGII-stimulated β-arrestin recruitment to AT1R (Fig. S2, D and E). Taken together, these data indicate that TRPV4 activation is necessary to block ligand-induced binding of β-arrestin to AT1R. Protein phosphorylation can be regulated by two mechanisms: the initial phosphorylation by a protein kinase and the dephosphorylation by a protein phosphatase. TRPV1 inhibits MOR1 phosphorylation by stimulating the nuclear translocation of GRK5 (11Scherer P.C. Zaccor N.W. Neumann N.M. Vasavda C. Barrow R. Ewald A.J. Rao F. Sumner C.J. Snyder S.H. TRPV1 is a physiological regulator of μ-opioid receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (29203659): 13561-1356610.1073/pnas.1717005114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TRPV4 activation can also induce the translocation of GRK5 out of the plasma membrane (Fig. S3A). We performed an order-of-addition experiment to determine whether TRPV4 regulates AT1R phosphorylation by inhibiting a protein kinase, such as GRK5, or activates a protein phosphatase. If TRPV4 inhibits a kinase, then reversing the order in which TRPV4 and AT1R are activated will produce different results, because once a kinase has completed phosphorylation of a substrate, it does not matter if it is inhibited. Conversely, if TRPV4 activates a phosphatase, the order in which TRPV4 and AT1R are activated is irrelevant, because the phosphatase will immediately dephosphorylate its substrate. The order in which TRPV4 and AT1R are activated has no significant effect on TRPV4-mediated inhibition of β-arrestin recruitment (Fig. 3A). This suggests that TRPV4 inhibits AT1R phosphorylation by activating a protein phosphatase. Calcineurin is a Ca2+/calmodulin–activated protein phosphatase that can be activated by TRPV4 (21Zhao L.

Furthermore, calcineurin can inhibit the desensitization of 5-HT1c receptors, a GPCR expressed in the choroid plexus (23Boddeke H.W. Hoffman B.J. Palacios J.M. Hoyer D.

Incubating HTLA cells transiently transfected with TRPV4 and AT1R in 30 μm of a cell-permeable calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (CAP) blocks TRPV4 inhibition of β-arrestin recruitment (Fig. 3B). CAP rescues β-arrestin binding in a dose-responsive manner with an approximate EC50 of ∼1.2 μm (Fig. 3C). Phosphorylated nuclear factor of activated T-cells (p-NFAT) is the canonical target of calcineurin dephosphorylation (25Crabtree G.R. Calcium, calcineurin, and the control of transcription.J. Biol.

Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates p-NFAT and initiates NFAT translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (25Crabtree G.R. Calcium, calcineurin, and the control of transcription.J. Biol.

Activating TRPV4 in HEK293 cells with 10 nm GSK101 is sufficient to significantly dephosphorylate p-NFAT and reduce NFATC1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3D and Fig. S3B). There is no significant change of NFATC1 in the nucleus (Fig. 3D). Incubating HEK293 cells expressing TRPV4 in 30 μm CAP blocks TRPV4-mediated p-NFAT dephosphorylation (Fig. 3D). We found inhibiting calcineurin completely blocks the effects of TRPV4 on β-arrestin recruitment. We wondered whether other phosphatases are activated by TRPV4. Incubation of cells in 100 nm okadaic acid, a broad phosphatase inhibitor that does not block calcineurin, does not recapitulate the effects of inhibiting calcineurin (Fig. 3E) (26Swingle M. Ni L. Honkanen R.E. Small-molecule inhibitors of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases: specificity, use and common forms of abuse.Methods Mol.

Calcium, calcineurin, and the control of transcription.J. Biol.

Consequently, culturing HTLA cells in calmidazolium, a calmodulin inhibitor, similarly prevents TRPV4 from blocking β-arrestin recruitment to AT1R in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of ∼3 μm (Fig. 3F). Taken together, the results demonstrate that TRPV4 specifically activates calcineurin in a Ca2+/calmodulin–dependent manner calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide is sufficient to dephosphorylate AT1R and block β-arrestin recruitment. TRPV4 and TRPV1 both can inhibit phosphorylation of GPCRs that are in close proximity in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner. It is likely that many other TRP channels similarly regulate nearby GPCRs. Co-expressing and activating TRPV1 by capsaicin (Fig. 3G) and TRPA1 by iodoacetamide (Fig. S3C) with AT1R both block ANGII-stimulated β-arrestin recruitment. Similarly, when TRPV4 is co-expressed with another GPCR, mas-related G-protein–coupled receptor membrane A1 (MRGA1), GSK101 stimulation blocks β-arrestin recruitment to MRGA1 stimulated with Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide (Fig. S3D). Previous work demonstrated that TRPV1 inhibits phosphorylation of MOR1 by inhibiting a kinase (11Scherer P.C. Zaccor N.W. Neumann N.M. Vasavda C. Barrow R. Ewald A.J. Rao F. Sumner C.J. Snyder S.H. TRPV1 is a physiological regulator of μ-opioid receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (29203659): 13561-1356610.1073/pnas.1717005114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Incubating TRPV1- and AT1R-expressing cells with CAP does not rescue TRPV1-mediated inhibition of β-arrestin recruitment (Fig. 3H). Taken together, our findings reveal that diverse TRP channels inhibit GPCR phosphorylation but may do so via distinct molecular pathways for different TRP channels. The choroid plexus is a tissue in which TRPV4 and AT1R are likely to regulate each other’s activity. TRPV4 and AT1R have opposite roles in regulating blood flow to the choroid plexus and in the production of CSF (13Filosa J.A. Yao X. Rath G. TRPV4 and the regulation of vascular tone.J. Cardiovasc.

Primary murine CPECs exposed to 100 nm ANGII in vitro have significantly reduced calcium inflows in response to GSK101 treatment (Fig. 4A). Calcium influx in CPECs induced by GSK101 is specific to TRPV4 activation and is completely blocked when CPECs are incubated in GSK205, a TRPV4-specific antagonist (Fig. 4A). AT1R inhibits TRPV4 by recruiting β-arrestin (5Shukla A.K. Kim J. Ahn S. Xiao K. Shenoy S.K. Liedtke W. Lefkowitz R.J. Arresting a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel.J. Biol.

We found that activating TRPV4 before AT1R blocks recruitment of β-arrestin to AT1R. Therefore, TRPV4 can prevent its own inhibition. Accordingly, calcium imaging of CPECs that were incubated in GSK101 before treating the cells with ANGII partially rescues TRPV4-mediated calcium influx in response to further GSK101 treatment (Fig. 4B).

To identify discriminatory practices in the workplace, job advertisement analysis was used by previous studies. However, most of those studies adopted content analysis by manually coding the text from a limited number of samples since working with a large scale of job advertisements consisting of unstructured text data is very challenging. Encountering those limitations, the present study involves text mining techniques to identify multiple types of direct discrimination on a large scale of online job advertisements by designing a method called Direct Discrimination Detection (DDD). The DDD is constructed using a combination of N-grams and regular expressions (regex) with the exact match principle of a Boolean retrieval model. A total of 8,969 online job advertisements in English and Bahasa Indonesia, published from May 2005 to December 2017 were collected from bursakerja-jateng.com as the data. The results reveal that the practices of direct discrimination still exist during the job-hunting process including gender, marital status, physical appearances, and religion. The most recurrent type of discrimination which occurs in job advertisements is based on age (66.27%), followed by gender (38.76%), and physical appearances (18.42%). Additionally, female job seekers are found as the most vulnerable party to experience direct discrimination during recruitment. The results exhibit female job seekers face complex jeopardy in particular job positions comparing to their male counterparts. Not only excluded because of their gender, but female job seekers also had to fulfil more requirements for getting an opportunity to apply for the jobs such as being single, still at a young age, complying specific physical appearances and particular religious preferences. This study illustrates the power and potential of optimizing computational methods on a large scale of unstructured text data to analyze phenomena in the social field."
https://openalex.org/W3033713240,"We collected 130 short semi-structured interviews following treatment sessions from 30 participants with ADHD receiving NF using slow cortical potential training (SCP). The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes where evaluated for changes over-time and between participants with high/low treatment compliance. Interviews from 14 participants who had undergone at least five completed interviews were examined in more depths, aiming to establish typical strategy/training profiles.We identified 16 strategies covering four domains: cognitive, physiological, emotional and unspecified. Typical of most strategies were that they served as a vehicle to regulate mental arousal. Overall, no clear patterns of changes over time were found. Highly compliant participants reported to use the strategies from the emotional domain and the strategy focus more frequently than neutral compliant participants did, while neutral compliant participants reported the use of the strategies muscular activity and passivity more often than participants did with high compliance. Across participants, three strategy profiles were derived, those who handled the task by manipulating their state of mind in relation to the NF task, those who were mainly manifest and concrete towards the task, and those who were mostly unaware of what they were doing. These profiles differed in self-regulatory performance, and only participants showing the state of mind profile experienced a decrease of ADHD symptoms accompanied by objectively measured improvements in self-regulation. In addition, compliance affected both how and what strategies were used.A heterogeneous array of cognitive and other strategies is used at varying levels of training compliance by participants with ADHD during SCP that could be condensed to three prototypical profiles. Future research should take compliance and strategy/training profiles into account when evaluating NF. The latter may help to clarify which and how brain activity regulating mechanisms drive training, individual response to NF, and how they are influenced by motivational factors. Our findings might also help to facilitate more effective instructions in how to approach SCP in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3033611746,"Immigrants from low- and middle-income countries who have settled in high-income countries show higher risks of depression in comparison with host populations. The risks are associated with adverse social conditions. Indecisive results have been reported on the depression risks of the offspring of immigrant populations.To assess the prevalence of depressed mood in immigrant offspring relative to the host population and to analyse whether that risk is explained by social conditions.Cross-sectional data from the Dutch HELIUS study were analysed, involving 19,904 men and women of Dutch, South-Asian Surinamese, African Surinamese, Turkish or Moroccan ethnic descent aged 18 to 70. Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Indicators of social conditions were socioeconomic position (educational level, occupational level, employment status), perceived ethnic discrimination and sociocultural integration (ethnic identity, cultural orientation, social network). We used logistic regression to assess the risk of depressed mood (PHQ-9 sum score ≥10) in immigrants' offspring, as well as in first generation immigrants, relative to the risk in the host population. Social indicators were stepwise added to the model.The prevalence of depressed mood was 13% to 20% among immigrant offspring, with the lowest level for those of African Surinamese descent; prevalence in the Dutch origin population was 7%. Relative risk of depressed mood, expressed as average marginal effects (AMEs), decreased substantially in all offspring groups after adjustment for socioeconomic indicators and discrimination. E.g. the AME of Turkish vs. Dutch decreased from 0.11 (0.08-0.13) to 0.05 (0.03-0.08). Patterns resembled those in first generation immigrants.Results suggest that the observed higher prevalence of depressed mood in immigrants' offspring will decline to the level of the host population as the various populations grow closer in terms of socioeconomic position and as immigrant offspring cease to experience discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W3034050048,"Despite appreciable advances in carnivore ecology, studies on small cats remain limited with carnivore research in India being skewed towards large cats. Small cats are more specialized than their larger cousins in terms of resource selection. Studies on small cat population and habitat preference are critical to evaluate their status to ensure better management and conservation. We estimated abundance of two widespread small cats, the jungle cat, and the rusty-spotted cat, and investigated their habitat associations based on camera trap captures from a central Indian tiger reserve. We predicted fine-scale habitat segregation between these sympatric species as a driver of coexistence. We used an extension of the spatial count model in a Bayesian framework approach to estimate the population density of jungle cat and rusty-spotted cat and used generalized linear models to explore their habitat associations. Densities of rusty-spotted cat and jungle cat were estimated as 6.67 (95% CI 4.07-10.74) and 4.01 (95% CI 2.65-6.12) individuals/100 km2 respectively. Forest cover and evapotranspiration were positively associated with rusty-spotted cat occurrence whereas both factors had a significant negative relation with jungle cat occurrence. The results directed habitat segregation between these small cats with affinities of rusty-spotted cat and jungle cat towards well-forested and open scrubland areas respectively. Our estimates highlight the widespread applicability of this model for density estimation of species with no individual identification. Moreover, the study outcomes can aid in targeted management decisions and serve as the baseline for species conservation as these models allow robust population estimation of elusive species along with predicting their habitat preferences."
https://openalex.org/W3033713209,"Objective The present study aims to explore the role of smoking factors in the risk of lung cancer and screen the feature risk pathways of smoking-induced lung cancer. Methods The expression profiles of the patient data from GEO database were standardized, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by limma algorithm. Samples and genes were analyzed by Unsupervised hierarchical clustering method, while GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed on DEGs. The data of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were downloaded from the BioGrid and HPRD databases, and the DEGs were mapped into the PPI network to identify the interaction relationship. The enriched significant pathways were used to calculate the anomaly score and RFE method was used to optimize the feature sets. The model was trained using the support vector machine (SVM) and the predicted results were plotted into ROC curves. The AUC value was calculated to evaluate the predictive performance of the SVM model. Results A total of 1923 DEGs were obtained, of which 826 were down-regulated and 1097 were up-regulated. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the diagnosis accuracy of lung cancer smokers was 74%, and that of non-lung cancer smokers was 75%. Five optimal feature pathway sets were obtained by screening, the clinical diagnostic ability of which was detected by SVM model with the accuracy improved to 84%. The diagnostic accuracy was 90% after combining clinical information. Conclusion We verified that five signaling pathways combined with clinical information could be used as a feature risk pathway for identifying lung cancer smokers and non-lung cancer smokers and increased the diagnostic accuracy."

In this paper, we aim to produce new and unique decorated shapes by stylizing ordinary shapes with machine learning. Specifically, we combined parametric and non-parametric neural style transfer algorithms to transfer both local and global features. Furthermore, we introduced a distance-based guiding to the neural style transfer process, so that only the foreground shape will be decorated. Lastly, qualitative evaluation and ablation studies are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method."

https://openalex.org/W3033167097,"Many receptors elicit signal transduction by activating multiple intracellular pathways. This transduction can be triggered by a non-specific ligand, which simultaneously activates all the signaling pathways of the receptors. However, the binding of one biased ligand preferentially trigger one pathway over another, in a process called biased signaling. The identification the functional motions related to each of these distinct pathways has a direct impact on the development of new effective and specific drugs. We show here how to detect specific functional motions by considering the case of the NGF/TrkA-Ig2 complex. NGF-mediated TrkA receptor activation is dependent on specific structural motions that trigger the neuronal growth, development, and survival of neurons in nervous system. The R221W mutation in the ngf gene impairs nociceptive signaling. We discuss how the large-scale structural effects of this mutation lead to the suppression of collective motions necessary to induce TrkA activation of nociceptive signaling. Our results suggest that subtle changes in the NGF interaction network due to the point mutation are sufficient to inhibit the motions of TrkA receptors putatively linked to nociception. The methodological approach presented in this article, based jointly on the normal mode analysis and the experimentally observed functional alterations due to point mutations provides an essential tool to reveal the structural changes and motions linked to the disease, which in turn could be necessary for a drug design study."
https://openalex.org/W3034120785,"Activation of the steroidogenic enzyme CYP11A1 was shown to be necessary for the development of peanut-induced intestinal anaphylaxis and IL-13 production in allergic mice. We determined if levels of CYP11A1 in peripheral blood T cells from peanut-allergic (PA) children compared to non-allergic controls were increased and if levels correlated to IL-13 production and oral challenge outcomes to peanut. CYP11A1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in activated CD4+ T cells from PA patients. In parallel, IL-13 production was significantly increased; IFNγ levels were not different between groups. There were significant correlations between expression levels of CYP11A1 mRNA and levels of IL13 mRNA and protein, levels of serum IgE anti-Ara h 2 and to outcomes of peanut challenge. The importance of CYP11A1 on cytokine production was tested using a CYP11A1 CRISPR/Cas9 KO plasmid or an inhibitor of enzymatic CYP11A1 activity. Inhibition of CYP11A1 activation in patient cells treated with the inhibitor, aminoglutethimide, or CD4+ T cell line transfected with the CYP11A1 KO plasmid resulted in reduced IL-13 production. These data suggest that the CYP11A1-CD4+Tcell-IL-13 axis in activated CD4+ T cells from PA children is associated with development of PA reactions. CYP11A1 may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention in PA children."
https://openalex.org/W3029824902,"Retinal degeneration-3 (RD3) protein protects photoreceptors from degeneration by preventing retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) activation via calcium-sensing guanylyl cyclase–activating proteins (GCAP), and RD3 truncation causes severe congenital blindness in humans and other animals. The three-dimensional structure of RD3 has recently been established, but the molecular mechanisms of its inhibitory binding to RetGC remain unclear. Here, we report the results of probing 133 surface-exposed residues in RD3 by single substitutions and deletions to identify side chains that are critical for the inhibitory binding of RD3 to RetGC. We tested the effects of these substitutions and deletions <i>in vitro</i> by reconstituting purified RD3 variants with GCAP1-activated human RetGC1. Although the vast majority of the surface-exposed residues tolerated substitutions without loss of RD3's inhibitory activity, substitutions in two distinct narrow clusters located on the opposite sides of the molecule effectively suppressed RD3 binding to the cyclase. The first surface-exposed cluster included residues adjacent to Leu<sup>63</sup> in the loop connecting helices 1 and 2. The second cluster surrounded Arg<sup>101</sup> on a surface of helix 3. Single substitutions in those two clusters drastically, <i>i.e.</i> up to 245-fold, reduced the IC<sub>50</sub> for the cyclase inhibition. Inactivation of the two binding sites completely disabled binding of RD3 to RetGC1 in living HEK293 cells. In contrast, deletion of 49 C-terminal residues did not affect the apparent affinity of RD3 for RetGC. Our findings identify the functional interface on RD3 required for its inhibitory binding to RetGC, a process essential for protecting photoreceptors from degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3033349950,"Recent discussions in the literature, along with the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) (American Psychiatric Association 2013), suggest aetiological commonalities between the highly comorbid Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Addressing this discussion requires studying these disorders together by comparing constructs typical to each of them. In the present study, we investigate global processing, known to be difficult for participants with ASD, and Intra-Subject Variability (ISV), known to be consistently increased in participants with ADHD, in groups, aged 10–13 years, with ADHD (n = 25), ASD without comorbid ADHD (ASD-) (n = 13) and ASD with ADHD (ASD+) (n = 18) in comparison with a typically developing group (n = 22). A Copying task, typically requiring global processing and in this case particularly designed using equally complex stimuli to also measure ISV across trials, was selected. Oculomotor measures in this task proved to be particularly sensitive to group differences. While increased ISV was not observed in the present task in participants with ADHD, both ASD groups looked longer on the figure to be drawn, indicating that global processing takes longer in ASD. However, the ASD+ group fixated on the figure only between drawing movements, whereas the ASD- group did this throughout the drawing process. The present study provides evidence towards ASD and ADHD being separate, not-overlapping, disorders. Since the pure ASD- group was affected more by central coherence problems than the ASD+ group, it may suggest that neuropsychological constructs interact differently in different clinical groups and sub-groups."

They were randomly selected from schools situated below an altitude of 300 meters, where schistosomiasis is endemic. A retrospective costing study was conducted using the provider's perspective to cost. Cost data were collected by reviewing existing records including financial statements, invoices, receipts, transport log books, equipment inventories, and information from personnel payroll, existing budget, and the staff diaries.A total of 15571 children were treated in 2012, resulting in a total cost of the MDA programme of ZAR 2 137 143 and a unit cost of ZAR 137. The three main cost components were Medication Costs (37%), Human Resources Cost (36%) and Capital items (16%). The total cost for treating all eligible pupils in KwaZulu-Natal will be ZAR 149 031 888. However, should the capital cost be excluded, then the unit cost will be ZAR 112 per patient and this will translate to a total cost of ZAR 121 836 288.Low coverage exacerbates the cost of the programme and makes a decision to support such a programme difficult. However, a normative costing study based on the integration of the programme within the Department of Health should be conducted."
https://openalex.org/W3030651318,"Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are not only responsible for the digestion and absorption of dietary substrates but also function as a first line of host defense against commensal and pathogenic luminal bacteria. Disruption of the epithelial layer causes malnutrition and enteritis. Rab6 is a small GTPase localized to the Golgi, where it regulates anterograde and retrograde transport by interacting with various effector proteins. Here, we generated mice with IEC-specific deletion of Rab6a (Rab6a∆IEC mice). While Rab6aΔIEC mice were born at the Mendelian ratio, they started to show IEC death, inflammation, and bleeding in the small intestine shortly after birth, and these changes culminated in early postnatal death. We further found massive lipid accumulation in the IECs of Rab6a∆IEC neonates. In contrast to Rab6a∆IEC neonates, knockout embryos did not show any of these abnormalities. Lipid accumulation and IEC death became evident when Rab6a∆IEC embryos were nursed by a foster mother, suggesting that dietary milk-derived lipids accumulated in Rab6a-deficient IECs and triggered IEC death. These results indicate that Rab6a plays a crucial role in regulating the lipid transport and maintaining tissue integrity."
