To establish a system in which raft-dependent processes could be studied genetically, we have analyzed the protein and lipid composition of these microdomains in Drosophila melanogaster. Using mass spectrometry, we identified the phospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols present inDrosophila membranes. Despite chemical differences betweenDrosophila and mammalian lipids, their structure suggests that the biophysical properties that allow raft formation have been preserved. Consistent with this, we have identified a detergent-insoluble fraction of Drosophila membranes that, like mammalian rafts, is rich in sterol, sphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins. We show that the sterol-linked Hedgehog N-terminal fragment associates specifically with this detergent-insoluble membrane fraction. Our findings demonstrate that raft formation is preserved across widely separated phyla in organisms with different lipid structures. They further suggest sterol modification as a novel mechanism for targeting proteins to raft membranes and raise the possibility that signaling and polarized intracellular transport of Hedgehog are based on raft association.

In mammals, the association of membrane proteins with raft lipid microdomains has emerged as an important regulator of polarized intracellular sorting and signal transduction (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.A. London E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Raft formation is based on the tendency of cholesterol to organize the bilayer into cholesterol-rich liquid ordered and cholesterol-poor liquid disordered domains (3Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8686-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), a process that is enhanced by the preferential interaction of cholesterol with sphingolipids and the fact that sphingolipids have higher melting temperatures than phospholipids (Ref. 4Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10670-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 5Rietveld A.G. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Rafts form when the sphingolipid/cholesterol-rich phase separates from the phospholipid-rich phase that constitutes the rest of the membrane. In model membranes, the formation of the liquid ordered phase correlates with the acquisition of insolubility in the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (6Ahmed S.N. Brown D. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Insolubility in Triton X-100 or in Triton X-114, a related detergent, has been used as a criterion for isolation of rafts from cellular membranes (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 8Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We decided to establish a system to study rafts in a genetic model organism with well characterized development: Drosophila melanogaster. Genetics would provide a powerful tool with which to identify molecules involved in raft formation, trafficking, and function. Furthermore, since raft formation is thought to play important roles in cell polarization and signal transduction, examining their functions in Drosophila may provide insights into the control of important developmental processes. We began by asking whether Drosophila membranes contained membrane domains similar to mammalian rafts. Drosophilacannot synthesize sterols and require a dietary source. Furthermore, their membranes must remain fluid at lower temperatures than those of mammals; thus, the biophysical properties of their lipids might be expected to differ. We wondered whether raft formation would occur under these conditions and, if so, to what extentDrosophila rafts would resemble their mammalian counterparts. Our data show that, despite differences in the chemical structure of their lipids, Drosophila membranes contain rafts with a similar protein and lipid composition. We then examined membrane-associated proteins of well characterized developmental pathways to establish which of them might constitute a suitable system in which to study raft function. In particular, we wished to examine whether the N-terminal fragment of the Hedgehog protein might be raft-associated. Hedgehog protein undergoes autocatalytic cleavage that results in covalent linkage of its N-terminal fragment to cholesterol (9Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Since cholesterol is enriched in raft membranes, it seemed possible that cholesterol linkage might be a raft-targeting signal. Drosophila were reared on yeast-based medium, and adults in population cages (10Shaffer C.D. Wuller J.M. Elgin S.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were fed fresh yeast on apple juice/molasses agar plates twice/day. Flies were allowed to lay eggs for 14 h overnight, and embryos from eight population cages were collected onto stacked coarse, medium, and fine wire mesh screens with a paint brush. The embryos were washed in water and with 0.9% NaCl + 0.1% Triton X-100 (embryo wash) to remove debris and yeast and then dechorionated in 250 ml of 20% bleach and 80% embryo wash for 3 min. After decanting onto the fine wire mesh, the embryos were sprayed vigorously with water to remove residual chorion and collected into 50-ml Falcon tubes (∼25 ml of packed embryos/tube). The embryos were then washed twice in embryo wash, three times in 0.9% NaCl, twice in TNE buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EGTA) + 0.3 m sucrose, and resuspended in 40 ml/tube TNE buffer + 0.3 m sucrose + 0.001 volume of CLAP (10 mg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin in Me2SO). Embryos were broken in a Potter-Elvehjam and then in a Dounce homogenizer with a loose pestle followed by a tight pestle until the pestle moved smoothly (approximately five times). The embryo homogenate was spun at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei, and the post-nuclear supernatant was removed, adjusted to 1.4 m sucrose, and distributed into SW 27 centrifuge tubes. Post-nuclear supernatants were overlaid with 10 ml of 1.22 m sucrose in TNE buffer and 10 ml of 0.1 m sucrose in TNE buffer and then spun for 18 h at 25,000 rpm at 4 °C. Membranes with a white, flocculent appearance were observed floating above the 1.22/0.1 minterface, and membranes with a more yellowish homogeneous appearance were observed at the 1.4/1.22 m interface and occasionally at the 1.22/0.1 m interface. The heavier membranes at the 1.4/1.22 m interface were enriched in endoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome c reductase, whereas the lighter membranes above the 1.22/0.1 m interface were enriched in plasma membrane proteins. The Golgi enzymes galactosyltransferase and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase were found in both fractions (data not shown). Membranes floating above the 1.22/0.1 m interface were collected, diluted three times in TNE buffer, and spun onto a 62% sucrose cushion in an SW 27 rotor for 20 min at 25,000 rpm. The membranes were then resuspended in TNE buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. These membranes contained ∼33% of the total membrane protein. Membranes were thawed and washed in 3 volumes of TNE buffer to remove residual sucrose. They were then resuspended in 350 μl of ice-cold TNE buffer to a phospholipid concentration of 880 nmol/ml. An equal volume of prechilled 2% Triton X-114 or Triton X-100 was added, and the membranes were solubilized at 0 °C for 30 min in SW 60 tubes. After solubilization, the membranes were brought to a final concentration of 24% OptiprepTM (Nycomed Pharma AS); overlaid with 1 ml of 21, 15, and 6% Optiprep in TNE buffer; and then spun for 5 h at 36,000 rpm at 2 °C. Insoluble membranes could be observed between the 6% and the 15% layers. After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 4 °C in 40 mm Tris/glycine (pH 8.8) + 20% methanol for 2 h at 0.7 mA. Nitrocellulose blots were blocked with 5% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 20 min and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The dilutions of antibodies used were as follows: anti-Hedgehog, 1:2000; anti-Notch, 1:1000; anti-fasciclin-1, 1:2000; and anti-Drac1, 1:2000. Blots were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min each and then bound to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-rat, and goat anti-mouse; Bio-Rad) at a 1:1000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min each, the signal was detected with an ECLTM kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phospholipids and sterols were prepared from membranes by Bligh and Dyer extraction (11Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were quantified according to Rouser et al.(12Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids were prepared by a Folch total lipid extraction (13Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by mild alkaline hydrolysis of the glycerophospholipids for 2 h at 30 °C in methanolic 0.1 m NaOH. The base-resistant sphingolipids were desalted on an RP18 reversed-phase column. Lipid samples in chloroform (phospholipids) or chloroform/methanol (1:2; glycolipids) were applied to activated high performance TLC plates (Merck) and developed in chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8; phospholipids) or chloroform/methanol/water (60:40:10; glycolipids) in a Whatman lined tank. The plates were dried at room temperature and stained with iodine vapor for detection of phospholipids and sterol or with ninhydrin spray reagent (Sigma) to detect amino phospholipids. Glycolipids were stained with orcinol/sulfuric acid reagent (14Schnaar R.L. Needham L.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 371-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids were extracted and purified as described above and stored as a dried lipid film. Just prior to analysis, the lipids were dissolved in methanol containing 5 mm ammonium acetate and centrifuged for 15 min in a tabletop centrifuge at full speed. Sterols were identified and quantified after sulfation in the presence of [3,4-13C2]cholesterol as an internal standard. After addition of standard to membranes and subsequent extraction in 1,4-dioxane, sulfation was performed by adding sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex in absolute pyridine to the dried lipid samples. The reaction was quenched with barium acetate, and the lipids were diluted with methanol prior to measurement. 1Sandhoff, R., Brügger, B., Jeckel, D., Lehman, W. D., and Wieland, F. T. (1999) J. Lipid Res. 40, 126–132. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed with a triple quadrupole instrument equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization interface and a Dynolyte TM detector system (Micromass Quattro II). The first and third quadrupoles are used as independent analyzers, whereas the second serves as a hexapole collision cell. Ceramides and glycosphingolipids were detected in the positive ion mode, and phospholipid-derived fatty acids as well as the sulfated sterols were detected in the negative ion mode. The spray was induced with a capillary voltage of ±0.8–1.2 kV. The tandem mass spectrometric precursor scans were performed with argon as a collision gas at a nominal pressure of 2 millitorrs. Spectra were obtained by averaging 30–100 repetitive scans of 4 s. Floating, detergent-insoluble membranes were washed once in PIPES (pH 6.8), 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl and resuspended in 300 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) + 0.5 mm CaCl2 + 0.001 volume of CLAP. Half of each sample was treated with 0.75 units of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Sigma) for 3 h at 30 °C. The other half was mock-treated for the same length of time under the same conditions. Samples were then subjected to Triton X-114 phase separation (16Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and proteins in the pellet, detergent, and aqueous fractions were precipitated by adding 4 volumes of methanol + 1 volume of chloroform, mixing, adding 3 volumes of H2O, spinning for 2 min at 14,000 rpm, removing the upper phase, adding 3 of volumes methanol, spinning as before, and removing the supernatant from the protein pellet. Proteins were then analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (8Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and gels were stained with a SilverXpressTM kit (Novex). To identify the lipids present in Drosophila embryonic membranes, we used TLC analysis with standards (data not shown) and mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 A). These data are summarized in Fig. 1 (B–D). We found that both the sphingolipids and phospholipids were shorter than those found in mammals. The sphingolipids were based on a tetradeca-4-sphingenine backbone (C14) rather than the C18 backbone found in mammals. The amide-linked fatty acids present in the sphingolipids were also shorter; the most abundant fatty acid was arachidic acid (C20:0) (Fig. 1, A andB), shorter than the lignoceric acid (C24:0) often found in mammalian sphingolipids. Consistent with this, the free ceramide precursors of the sphingolipids contained the same fatty acids (Fig. 1, A, B, and D). The fatty acids in Drosophila sphingolipids were completely saturated (Fig.1, B and D). The most abundant glycosphingolipids were glucosylceramide and mannosylglucosylceramide. The only phosphosphingolipid in mammalian membranes, sphingomyelin, was not present in Drosophila; instead, like other insects (17Wiegandt H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar),Drosophila membranes contained phosphoethanolamine ceramide (PECer). Drosophila membranes contained phosphoglycerolipids with the same head groups as those of mammalian cells (phosphocholine, phosphoethanolamine, phosphoserine, and phosphoinositol); however, they differed in having shorter fatty acyl chains. Whereas the longest fatty acid found in Drosophila phosphoglycerolipids was C18 (Fig. 1 C), mammalian phosphoglycerolipids contain up to C24 (18Klenk H.D. Choppin P.W. Virology. 1969; 38: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Klenk H.D. Choppin P.W. Virology. 1970; 40: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Approximately 60% of the fatty acids were unsaturated (Fig. 1 C), similar to ratios found in several mammalian cells (19Klenk H.D. Choppin P.W. Virology. 1970; 40: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In summary, both the sphingolipids and phosphoglycerolipids are shorter than those found in mammals and would therefore be predicted to have lower melting temperatures, consistent with the requirement thatDrosophila membranes remain fluid at lower temperatures. Despite these differences, sphingolipids are still longer and more saturated than phosphoglycerolipids, as they are in mammals, and would therefore be predicted to have higher melting temperatures than phosphoglycerolipids. Thus, the structural properties ofDrosophila sphingolipids and phosphoglycerolipids are consistent with the ability to separate into liquid ordered and disordered phases. In model membranes, cholesterol must be present at between 7 and 30 mol % to induce the formation of the liquid ordered phase (3Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8686-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 4Sankaram M.B. Thompson T.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10670-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, cholesterol is essential for raft formation in vertebrate cells (20Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 21Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). To determine the levels and types of sterols in Drosophila membranes, we performed mass spectrometry on lipid extracts and quantified sterols after sulfation in the presence of an internal 13C-labeled standard.1 The relative percentages of the different types of sterols observed are shown in Table I. Ergosterol is the most abundant sterol (69% of the total). Ergosterol, along with campesterol and sitosterol, could be absorbed directly from the diet in population cages (wet yeast on apple juice/beet syrup/agar plates). 24-Methylenecholesterol and fucosterol are intermediates in the conversion of campesterol and sitosterol, respectively, to cholesterol. Although the position of the double bond in dehydrocholesterol cannot be determined from this analysis, this sterol may be Δ7-dehydrocholesterol, an intermediate in the conversion of ergosterol to cholesterol (22Svoboda J.A. Ross S.A. Nes W.D. Lipids. 1995; 30: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cholesterol itself represents only 3% of the total membrane sterol. Taken together, sterols represent 18 mol % relative to phospholipids, similar to levels of cholesterol found in vertebrates. Because ergosterol, campesterol, and sitosterol are even more efficient than cholesterol at ordering acyl chains (23Schuler I. Duportail G. Glasser N. Benveniste P. Hartmann M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1028: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Urbina J.A. Pekerar S. Le H.B. Patterson J. Montez B. Oldfield E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1238: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), these levels should be sufficient to induce formation of the liquid ordered phase.Table ISterol composition of Drosophila embryonic membranesSterolm/zmol %Dehydrocholesterol46311Cholesterol4653[13C2]Cholesterol standard467Brassicasterol473<1Ergosterol4756924-Methylene cholesterol4776Campesterol4797Fucosterol491<1Sitosterol4932The sterols in Drosophila embryonic membranes were identified and quantified after sulfation in the presence of 200 pmol of [13C2]cholesterol.

Mammalian raft membranes, rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, can be isolated on the basis of their insolubility in the detergents Triton X-100 and Triton X-114 at low temperature (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 8Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To determine whether similar membrane domains form in Drosophila, we isolated detergent-insoluble membranes and analyzed their lipid composition. Drosophila embryonic membranes were treated with 1% Triton X-114 or Triton X-100 for 30 min at 0 °C, and insoluble membranes were purified from solubilized material by their ability to float through a density gradient. We separated lipids derived from the insoluble fraction or from membranes that had not been solubilized by TLC and stained them with iodine vapor (Fig. 2 A). This showed that sterols were clearly enriched relative to the phospholipids (PI, PC, and PE) in detergent-insoluble membranes. The mole percent sterol relative to phospholipids in the Triton X-114-insoluble membranes (30.5%) is similar to what has been reported for cholesterol in mammalian rafts (31%) (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). The relative enrichment over the amount in unsolubilized membranes was less than that observed when solubilization is performed on whole Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, however. We began with a membrane fraction that was already enriched in plasma membrane with respect to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (see “Experimental Procedures”). TLC analysis showed that this fraction already contains proportionally more sterol than the total membrane fraction (data not shown) and would be expected to contain more sphingolipid as well (25Van Helvoort A. Van Meer G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 18-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Simons K. Van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Therefore, the final levels of enrichment of both sterol and sphingolipid should be lower than if rafts were isolated from whole cells. PECer, like its mammalian counterpart, sphingomyelin, also appeared to be enriched in insoluble membranes (Fig. 2 A). To determine the mole percent of PECer relative to other phospholipids, we determined the number of moles of PECer, PE, and PC present in the TLC spots shown in Fig. 2 A. PECer was present at 14.7 mol % in insoluble membranes, comparable to the level of sphingomyelin found in mammalian rafts (14.2%) (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). PECer was 2.8-fold more abundant in the Triton X-114-insoluble membranes than in unsolubilized material (Fig.2 B). Next, we investigated whether glycosphingolipids were enriched in the insoluble fraction. We performed TLC on mild base-resistant lipids prepared from either total membranes or Triton X-114-insoluble membranes and stained them with orcinol (Fig. 2 C). The intensity of the glucosylceramide and mannosylglucosylceramide bands before and after solubilization was quantified, and the percent that remained insoluble was compared with the percent of phospholipid that remained insoluble. By this estimate, these glycosphingolipids are enriched by ∼3-fold relative to phospholipids in detergent-insoluble membranes. The orcinol-stained bands migrating closer to the origin represent more complex glycolipids (27Sugita M. Itonori S. Inagaki F. Hori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15028-15033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which have not been further identified by mass spectrometry. These glycolipids also appear to be enriched in the detergent-insoluble fraction. These experiments show that detergent solubilization can be used to isolate aDrosophila membrane fraction that is rich in sterol and sphingolipids, like mammalian rafts. In mammals, linkage to GPI targets proteins to raft membranes, and GPI-linked proteins are an abundant component of mammalian rafts (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 28Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Drosophiladetergent-insoluble membrane fraction was similar to mammalian raft membranes in this regard, we analyzed its content of GPI-linked proteins. The Triton X-100 detergent-insoluble membrane fraction was isolated by solubilization in 1% Triton X-100 at 0 °C and flotation through a density gradient. These membranes were treated with PI-specific phospholipase C to release the lipid moiety from GPI-linked proteins. As a control, Triton X-100-insoluble membranes were mock-treated under the same conditions in the absence of PI-specific phospholipase C. Membranes were then dissolved in 1% Triton X-114 first at 4 °C and then at 29 °C. At 29 °C, solutions of Triton X-114 separate into detergent and aqueous phases; lipid-linked proteins and transmembrane proteins partition into the detergent phase, and other proteins partition into the aqueous phase (16Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed the proteins present in the detergent and aqueous phases, as well as those that remained insoluble in Triton X-114 at 29 °C, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Treatment of Triton X-100-insoluble membranes with PI-specific phospholipase C caused most major protein constituents to shift from the detergent to the aqueous phase of Triton X-114, indicating that a lipid anchor had been removed (Fig.3, compare A and Bwith C and D). Because GPI-linked proteins are so abundant in Drosophila rafts, we conclude that, as in mammals, GPI linkage constitutes a specific targeting signal for these membrane domains in Drosophila. We were surprised at how few raft proteins were left in the Triton X-114 detergent phase (and by implication, associated with raft membranes) after PI-specific phospholipase C treatment. Taken at face value, this would indicate that almost all of the non-peripherally associated membrane proteins in Drosophila rafts were either GPI-linked or linked to insoluble cortex. It has been reported that a fraction of raft membrane lipid remains insoluble in Triton X-100 at temperatures between 13 and 37 °C (28Melkonian K.A. Chu T. Tortorella L.B. Brown D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16161-16170Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This led us to wonder whether some raft membranes might have remained insoluble in Triton X-114 even at the higher temperature required for phase separation of the detergent and thus constitute part of the “pellet” fractions shown in Fig. 3 (E and F). To address this possibility, we subjected membranes solubilized in Triton X-114 at the higher temperature to flotation through a density gradient. Floating insoluble membranes were observed just as when solubilization was performed at 0 °C. When we examined their lipid composition by TLC, we found that it was similar to that of raft membranes isolated at 0 °C (Fig. 2). This shows that a subfraction of raft membranes are resistant to Triton X-114 solubilization even at 29 °C. The protein and lipid composition of Triton X-100- and Triton X-114-insoluble membranes indicates that these detergents can be used to isolateDrosophila membranes that resemble mammalian rafts. To determine whether the Hedgehog N-terminal fragment associated with Drosophila rafts, we solubilized embryonic membranes in 1% Triton X-114 at 0 °C for 30 min, floated the material though a density gradient, and investigated whether Hedgehog was found in the floating insoluble membranes. Western blotting of gradient fractions showed that a significant amount of the N-terminal fragment of Hedgehog remained associated with insoluble membranes (Fig. 4 A). Although no lipid modification has yet been found on the Hedgehog C-terminal fragment, it copurifies with embryonic membranes, and it partitions almost exclusively into the detergent phase of Triton X-114 when the temperature is raised to 29 °C, suggesting that it is significantly hydrophobic (data not shown). Nevertheless, unlike the N-terminal fragment, it is completely solubilized by Triton X-114 at 0 °C (Fig.4 A). To show that insoluble Hedgehog was found in the same fractions as raft-associated GPI-linked proteins, we probed the gradient fractions with an antibody to fascicli"

https://openalex.org/W2044883494,"NEDD8 is a ubiquitin-like molecule that can be covalently conjugated to a limited number of cellular proteins, such as Cdc53/cullin. We have previously reported that the C terminus of NEDD8 is efficiently processed to expose Gly-76, which is required for conjugation to target proteins. A combination of data base searches and polymerase chain reaction cloning was used to identify a cDNA encoding human UBA3, which is 38% identical to the yeast homologue, 22% identical to human UBA2, and 19% identical to the C-terminal region of human UBE1. The human UBA3 gene is located on chromosome 3p13 and gave rise to a 2.2-kilobase pair transcript that was detected in all tissues. Human UBA3 could be precipitated with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NEDD8, but not with GST-ubiquitin or GST-sentrin-1. Moreover, human UBA3 could form a β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive conjugate with NEDD8 in the presence of APP-BP1, a protein with sequence homology to the N-terminal half of ubiquitin-activating enzyme. We have also cloned human UBC12 and demonstrated that it could form a thiol ester linkage with NEDD8 in the presence of the activating enzyme complex. Identification of the activating and conjugating enzymes of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway should allow for a more detailed study of the role of NEDD8 modification in health and disease. NEDD8 is a ubiquitin-like molecule that can be covalently conjugated to a limited number of cellular proteins, such as Cdc53/cullin.

Yoshida Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1993; 195: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Antiserum specific for NEDD8 detected a 6-kDa NEDD8 monomer and a series of NEDD8 multimers or NEDD8-conjugated proteins (2Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, in all cell lines tested, the conjugation pattern of NEDD8 is entirely different from that of ubiquitin (2Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis showed that NEDD8-conjugated proteins were highly enriched in the nucleus. In contrast, ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were detected equally well in the nucleus and cytosol. Mutational analysis showed that the C terminus of NEDD8 was efficiently cleaved and that Gly-76 was required for conjugation of NEDD8 to other proteins. The yeast homologue of NEDD8, Rub1, can also be conjugated to a limited number of cellular proteins, including Cdc53/cullin, a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase (a complex composed of Cdc53, Skp1, and an F-box protein) that plays a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle progression (3Lammer D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A prominent 90-kDa NEDD8-modified protein was detected in all mammalian cells, which was consistent with the molecular mass of the NEDD8-cullin-1 conjugate (2Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of NEDD8 conjugation appears to be strictly regulated because NEDD8 cannot conjugate to PML and RanGAP1, two substrates of the sentrin family of ubiquitin-like proteins (2Kamitani T.

Yeast mutants defective in Rub1 are viable, but sensitive to alterations in the levels of Cdc4, Cdc34, and Cdc53 (3Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It is not known whether NEDD8 conjugation is also involved in targeting proteins to the proteasome. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is an important pathway of non-lysosomal protein degradation. This pathway involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions (6Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). The first step is the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1),1 leading to the formation of a thiol ester linkage between Gly-76 of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue of E1. In the second step, activated ubiquitin is transferred to a cysteine residue in one of several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) to form another thiol ester conjugate. In the last step, an isopeptide bond is formed between Gly-76 of ubiquitin and a lysyl ε-amino group within a substrate protein, a reaction catalyzed either directly by the E2 enzyme or via a third enzyme designated ubiquitin-protein ligase. A single E1 enzyme has been characterized from human, mouse, wheat, andSaccharomyces cerevisiae (7Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, Uba1 is essential for viability and encodes a 114-kDa activating enzyme required for ubiquitin conjugation (8McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Another E1-like protein, Uba2, which encodes a 71-kDa protein that is similar to the C terminus of E1 proteins and bears a cysteine residue at a position similar to the active-site cysteine of Uba1, has been identified (9Dohmen R.J.

Johnson et al.(10Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Uba2 cooperates with another 40-kDa protein, termed Aos1 (activation of Smt3), the yeast homologue of the sentrin family of ubiquitin-like proteins (11Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.K. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both human and yeast Aos1 and Uba2 share extensive homology with the N- and C-terminal halves of yeast ubiquitin-activating enzyme, Uba1. 2L. Gong and E. T. H. Yeh, manuscript in preparation. 2L. Gong and E. T. H. Yeh, manuscript in preparation. In this paper, we report the molecular cloning of a human cDNA encoding a protein homologous to yeast Uba3, which has recently been shown to be involved in the activation of Rub1 (3Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We show that UBA3 is homologous to the C-terminal half of E1 and can form a thiol ester conjugate with NEDD8 in the presence of APP-BP1, which is homologous to the N-terminal half of E1. Furthermore, we have cloned human UBC12 and demonstrate that it could form a thiol ester linkage with NEDD8 in the presence of APP-BP1 and UBA3. The identification of the specific E1 complex and E2 for NEDD8 should provide further stimuli to study the role of NEDD8 modifications in health and disease. All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. DNA restriction endonucleases and T4 ligase were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA) or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Human and mouse cDNA libraries, multiple-tissue Northern blots, and the PCR amplification kit were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The TNT®T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). ATP, [α-32P]dCTP,l-[35S]methionine, Hyperfilm MP, and the GST protein purification kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Prestained molecular mass markers and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotides were synthesized with a Beckman DNA synthesizer (Model olig1000M). The sequences of the primers used in this study are as follows: olig1, CTGGATCCAAATGGCTGTTGATGGTGGG; olig2, GGAATTCTTATGCATATTGGCCTCTATGG; olig3, CTGGAGAGATTCAGTGCTCGGTTCGA; olig4, TATCTATTCGATGATGAAGATACC; olig5, CAGACTGTACTATTCAAACTTCATTTT; olig6, TGCACAGTTAAGTGAACTTGCGG; olig7, AGGATGATCAAGCTGTTCTCGCTGAAG; and olig8, GCAGTAACATTCCCCTTTAGTTAGCC. Escherichia colistrains XL1-Blue and BL21 were used for cDNA cloning and expression of GST fusion proteins, respectively. All plasmid constructs were made using standard techniques. Each construct was sequenced to verify the correct frame as well as the proper sequence of any linker introduced during the cloning procedure. The plasmids used as templates for in vitro translation were constructed based on the vector pcDNA3. A 1.3-kb cDNA containing the entire coding sequence of UBA3 was amplified from a human placenta cDNA library by PCR using an oligonucleotide forward primer (5′-GCGAAGCTTAAATGGCTGTTGATGGTGGG-3′) containing aHindIII site (underlined) and a reverse primer (5′-GCGGGTACCAAGAAGTAAAATGAAGTTTG-3′) containing aKpnI site (underlined). The PCR product was digested withHindIII and KpnI and ligated with the 5.4-kbHindIII-KpnI fragment from a derivative of pcDNA3 to construct pcDNA3-UBA3. pcDNA3-APP-BP1 and pcDNA3-UBC12 were constructed in a similar way, except that the 1.6-kb HindIII-KpnI fragment ofAPP-BP1 and the 0.55-kb HindIII-KpnI fragment of UBC12 were used. For the generation of the GST fusion plasmid, a DNA segment encoding the first 76 amino acids of NEDD8 was amplified by PCR using a 5′-primer (5′-GGCGAATTCATGCTGATTAAAGTGAAGACGCTG-3′) containing anEcoRI site (underlined) and a 3′-primer (5′-ATTGTCGACTCATCCTCCTCTCAGAGCCAAC-3′) containing anXhoI site (underlined). The PCR product was cut withEcoRI and XhoI and ligated with pGEX-5X1 previously linearized with EcoRI and XhoI to construct pGEX-NEDD8. pGEX-UB and pGEX-sentrin-1 were constructed in a similar way, except that the 0.23-kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment of ubiquitin and the 0.30-kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment of sentrin-1 covering the first 97 residues were used. To clone the activating enzyme of NEDD8, we first performed a TBLASTN search of the Tentative Human Consensus Sequence data base generated by the Institute for Genomic Research using the partial amino acid sequence of human UBE1 (amino acids 450–500) that contains the ATP-binding region. This identified 17 positive THC fragments. After further analysis, two THC fragments (THC197270 and THC206278) were found to have highly conserved ATP-binding regions, but different from each other. THC206278 was found to be more closely related to yeast Uba2, which resulted in the discovery of an activating enzyme for sentrin. An extensive search of the TIGR Tentative Human Consensus Sequence data base using the nucleotide sequence of THC197270 revealed another THC fragment (THC142086) that partially overlaps with THC197270. We designed and synthesized two oligonucleotides (olig1 and olig2) according to the information from both clones. Using the oligonucleotides as primers, we obtained a 1.3-kb PCR fragment from both human placenta and liver cDNA libraries. Sequence data of the PCR products from two different cDNA libraries showed that they are identical. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed to extend the cDNA sequence toward the 5′- and 3′-directions. Olig3 from the internal sequence of the 1.3-kb PCR product (nucleotides 88–113) was used as the antisense primer in combination with a sense primer of olig4. The PCR product obtained spanned a region from the vector flanking the 5′-end of the 1.3-kb fragment. The PCR product of 0.18 kb was sequenced. To identify the 3′-end of the cDNA, a second PCR was performed using olig5 as the sense primer together with olig6. The product (0.8 kb) was sequenced. Using a pair of redesigned 5′- and 3′-primers compatible with the sequence revealed in the 5′- and 3′-anchored PCRs, we then amplified a 2.1-kb cDNA fragment from the human placenta cDNA library by PCR. For identification of mouse UBA3, the amino acid sequence of human UBA3 was used to search the mouse data base of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). For identification of UBC12, the partial amino acid sequence from human UBC9, YPssPPkckfepplfHPNvypsGtvCL, was used to search the TIGR Tentative Human Consensus Sequence data base. One positive THC fragment (THC210627) was identified and used for the PCR-based cloning. Unless otherwise specified, PCR was carried out in a volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 100 ng of each primer, and 25 units of Pfupolymerase (CLONTECH), which possesses proof reading activity on a PTC-200 programmable thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc.). The reaction mixture was denatured at 94 °C for 4 min, and the amplification reaction consisted of 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (55 °C, 50 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min) with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. For rapid amplification of cDNA ends, nested primers specific to human UBA3 cDNA and nested adaptor primers were used in the primary and secondary PCRs. A thermal cycling profile of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s (25 cycles) and human placenta or liver cDNA as a template were used in the primary PCR. A cycling profile of 94 °C for 50 s and 70 °C for 3 min (30 cycles) and 1 μl of the primary PCR product as a template were used in the secondary PCR. The DNA sequences of the identified clones were determined on both strands using Applied Biosystems Prism dye termination DNA sequencing reagents and an Applied Biosystems automated ABI 377 sequencer. To determine the copy of the human UBA3 gene, human genomic DNA was completely digested with either BamHI orBglII and hybridized with a probe for UBA3. To study the expression pattern of the UBA3 gene, a commercial Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing RNA from eight different tissues was used. The full-length coding human placenta cDNA for UBA3 was amplified by PCR and gel-purified and concentrated using a Geneclean kit (Bio 101, Inc., La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A human α-actin probe was used as a control to determine equal RNA loading. The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using the Random Primers DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.), and unincorporated nucleotide was removed by chromatography on a NucTrap column (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The filter was prewashed for 1 h at 42 °C in 0.5× SSPE (1× SSPE = 0.16 m NaCl, 20 mm NaPO4, and 1 mmNa4EDTA, pH 7.2), 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA and prehybridized for 16 h at 42 °C in 30% formamide. Hybridization was performed with the 32P-labeled probe overnight. The nylon sheet was washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min and with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 10 min. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing the blot to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 2 days. The plasmids pGEX-UB, pGEX-NEDD8, and pGEX-sentrin-1 were used for expression of GST fusion proteins. The pGEX expression vectors were introduced into competent BL21 bacteria, and expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified as described previously (12Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For in vitro translation of UBA3, APP-BP1, and UBC12 proteins, pcDNA3-APP-BP1, pcDNA3-UBA3, and pcDNA3-UBC12 were used as templates for in vitro transcription and translation using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) under conditions recommended by the supplier. Translation reactions were performed in TNT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysates in a final volume of 50 μl. Reaction mixtures contained 25 μl of lysate, 40 μCi of [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol), 15 units of RNasin (Promega), 50 μm amino acid mixture (minus methionine), and 1 μg of DNA. The reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of 3 volumes of Laemmli buffer. Translation products were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed, treated in Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and processed for autoradiography. For in vitro binding between NEDD8 and UBA3, 10 μl of in vitro translated UBA3 with or without 20 μl of translated APP-BP1 were incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads containing ∼1 μg of GST-ubiquitin, GST-NEDD8, or GST-sentrin-1 for 30 min at 25 °C. For thiol ester bond formation between NEDD8 and UBC12, 5 μl of in vitrotranslated unlabeled UBA3 and APP-BP1 and 10 μl of translated35S-labeled UBC12 were incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST fusion protein for 12 h at 4 °C. A full-length cDNA sequence encoding a protein with significant homology to the human E1 protein was identified by a combination of data base searches and PCR amplification described under “Experimental Procedures.” The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of one of the cloned human cDNAs are shown in Fig. 1. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned human cDNA is most similar to yeast Uba3 (38.3% identity) and less similar to yeast Uba2 (20.8% identity) and the C-terminal half of the E1 enzyme (19.2% identity). We named this protein UBA3 because of its close similarity to yeast Uba3 (Fig. 2) and its ability to form a thiol ester bond with NEDD8 (see below). The UBA3cDNA contains an open reading frame initiating with an ATG codon (nucleotides 85–87) and terminating with a TAA codon (nucleotides 1411–1413). The ATG triplet is preceded by an in-frame stop codon at nucleotides 13;15, and therefore, it is the most likely candidate for the initiation codon. Another ATG codon is located at nucleotides 322–325, but the functional UBA3 was found to initiate from the first ATG codon (see below). The 84 -base pair 5′-noncoding region has a high AG content (72%). At the 3′-end of the cDNA, two potential polyadenylation signals are observed: AAAATAAA is present at nucleotide 1779, and AATAAAA is located at nucleotide 2101. This open reading frame encodes a protein (UBA3) of 442 amino acids residues. The calculated molecular mass and pI, based on the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of human UBA3, are 49.3 kDa and 5.13, respectively. Compared with the amino acid sequence for yeast Uba3, human UBA3 has an extra 46 amino acids at its N terminus and an additional 90 amino acids at its C terminus (Fig. 2).Figure 2Sequence alignment of human, yeast, and mouse UBA3. Amino acids that are identical to the corresponding position in yeast (Y), human (H), and mouse (M) are shaded. The numbers correspond to the sequence of UBA3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two important motifs are present in the known E1 enzymes: one is the consensus sequence for a nucleotide-binding site, GXGXXGCE (amino acids 475–482 in human UBE1); and the other is the consensus sequence PZCTXXXXP surrounding the essential cysteine in E1 enzymes (amino acids 630–639 in human UBE1), which becomes linked to ubiquitin in an E1-ubiquitin thiol ester linkage. As shown in Fig. 3, both UBA2 2 and UBA3 have an almost identical ATP-binding region and a significantly conserved active-site motif. The last amino acid residue in the active-site motif of yeast and human E1 is asparagine. In contrast, the last amino acid residue in the active-site motif of yeast and human UBA2 is serine, whereas it is arginine for yeast and human UBA3. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments will be required to determine whether this substitution contributes to the substrate preference for different activating enzymes. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA completely digested with either BamHI orBglII using a probe for UBA3 revealed the presence of a single hybridization signal (data not shown). This observation indicates the existence of one copy of the UBA3gene per chromosome. Northern blot analysis revealed a single 2.2-kb band in all tissue samples, but the message level of UBA3was highest in the heart and skeletal muscle and lowest in the liver (Fig. 4). When the human UBA3 cDNA sequence was used to search the GenBankTM EST data base using the BLASTN program, 63 positive EST clones were identified. All of these EST clones were used to check the Human Gene Map data base. Three of them,W73812 (nucleotides 1601–2120), N71576 (nucleotides 1810–2120), andT17227 (nucleotides 1815–2120), have been mapped to chromosome 3 between D3S125 and D3S131 microsatellite markers at 91–97 centimorgans (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Thus, theUBA3 gene is located on chromosome 3p13. The E1-like gene,UBE1L, is also located on chromosome 3 (3p21), whereasUBE1 is located on chromosome X, and UBA2 is located on chromosome 19.2 We also searched the mouse EST data base to identify mouse UBA3. A number of positive ESTs, such as W62229 (amino acids 1–118), AA231430 (amino acids 17–170), AA204189 (amino acids 161–283), AA670660 (amino acids 213–382), and AA073106 (amino acids 323–441) have been identified. Next, an attempt was made to isolate the mouse Uba3 gene by using PCR. Two primers were designed from W62229 and AA073106. This led to the isolation of a 1.8-kb cDNA from a mouse liver cDNA library. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 441 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 49,314 Da and a pI of 5.24. When compared with the human UBA3 sequence, the predicted mouse UBA3 sequence is one amino acid shorter at the C terminus. Nucleotide sequence comparison between mouse and human UBA3, using BestFit with default parameters, showed 94% identity between the two sequences. The level of conservation between the two proteins is even greater (98.7% identical) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, both human and mouse UBA3 contain almost identical N- and C-terminal amino acids, which are absent from yeast Uba3. The structure/function relationship of these N- and C-terminal extensions awaits further investigation. Since UBA3 has a conserved ATP-binding site and an active site of E1, we tested whether UBA3 would be able to form a thiol ester linkage with either ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins. As shown in Fig. 5 A (lane 1), in vitro translated UBA3 resulted in two major bands (40 and 49 kDa). This is most likely due to differential usage of the two ATG codons (nucleotides 13–14 and 322–325) in theUBA3 sequence. The in vitro translated UBA3 was incubated with GST-ubiquitin (lane 2), GST-NEDD8 (lane 4), or GST-sentrin-1 (lane 6) at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of ATP. The GST beads were extensively washed, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown, two bands (40 and 49 kDa) could be precipitated by GST-NEDD8, but not by GST-ubiquitin or GST-sentrin-1. Thus, UBA3 appears to bind preferentially to NEDD8. However, a higher molecular mass UBA3-NEDD8 conjugate could not be detected (lane 4). Since UBA3 is homologous to the C-terminal half of E1, it is likely that another protein homologous to the N-terminal half of E1 is required for the formation of a UBA3-NEDD8 conjugate. Initially, we tested whether human AOS1 would be able to complement UBA3 in the formation of the UBA3-NEDD8 conjugate. However, human AOS1 could not complement UBA3 and appeared to be specific for the sentrinization pathway.2 Thus, we tested an AOS1 homologue, APP-BP1, for its ability to complement UBA3 in the formation of the UBA3-NEDD8 conjugate. APP-BP1 was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid cloning experiment as a binding protein for the amyloid precursor protein (13Chow N. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Neve R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11339-11346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In vitro translated APP-BP1 resulted in a predicted single band of 51 kDa (lane 7). In vitro translated UBA3 and APP-BP1 were co-incubated with GST-ubiquitin (lane 3), GST-NEDD8 (lane 5), and GST-sentrin-1 (lane 8); washed; and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A high molecular mass band of 82 kDa, consistent with the molecular mass of GST-NEDD8-UBA3 conjugates, was observed in the GST-NEDD8 precipitate (lane 5). This 82-kDa band cannot be a APP-BP1-NEDD8 conjugate because APP-BP1 does not contain the active-site cysteine. Furthermore, the UBA3 C216S mutant, which contains a substitution in the active site, could not form a 82-kDa conjugate (Fig. 5 B). The thiol ester bond formation between UBA3 and NEDD8 was dependent on the presence of ATP (Fig. 5 C). Next, we showed that the 82-kDa band was sensitive to 5% β-mercaptoethanol treatment, suggesting that it behaved like a thiol ester conjugate (Fig.6). These results suggest that formation of a UBA3-NEDD8 conjugate is dependent on the presence of APP-BP1. Our results are also consistent with recent reports that Rub1, the yeast homologue of NEDD8, can form a thiol ester bond with yeast Uba3 (3Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ula1/Enr2, the yeast homologue of APP-BP1, is also required for the activation of Rub1(3, 4). Taken together, there is a remarkable conservation in the enzymology in the activation of NEDD8 and Rub1.Figure 6The UBA3-NEDD8 conjugate is sensitive to β-mercaptoethanol treatment. The position of the GST-NEDD8-UBA3 conjugate (82 kDa) formed in the presence of APP-BP1 is indicated.

Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). While testing the specificity of the conjugating enzymes in the sentrinization pathway, we used NEDD8 as a control and failed to observe a thiol ester bond formation between NEDD8 and eight known human E2 proteins, including UBCH5B, UBCH6, HIP2, HHR6A, HHR6B, E2-EPF, UBCH-ben, and UBC9 (data not shown). Thus, we sought to identify additional human E2 proteins that could conjugate to NEDD8. We used the amino acid sequence from the conjugation site of human UBC9 (YPssPPkckfepplfHPNvypsGtvCL) as a query to search the TIGR Tentative Human Consensus Sequence data base. 18 positive THC fragments were identified. After further analysis, one THC fragment (THC210627) was found to have a conserved sequence different from known E2 proteins. We designed two primers, oligo7 and oligo8, according to the information from THC210627. PCR amplification from a human placenta cDNA library resulted in the isolation of a 750-base pair cDNA. The nucleotide sequences and predicted amino acids are shown in Fig.7 A. The cloned cDNA contains an open reading frame initiating with an ATG codon (nucleotides 4–6) and terminating with a TAG codon (nucleotides 553–555). The cloned cDNA (human UBC12) encodes a protein of 183 amino acid residues that is 40.4% identical and 61.2% similar to the yeast Ubc12 protein (Fig. 7 B). Both human and yeast Ubc12 proteins have an almost identical motif, HPNIDLXGNVCLNILREDW, around the cysteine residue (a site needed for the formation of a thiol ester bond), which strongly suggests that the cloned human cDNA is UBC12, not another E2. This motif was also found in mouse (AA881308) and Drosophila melanogaster (AA952265) by analysis of EST clones from EST data bases. Next, the ability of human UBC12 to form thiol ester conjugates with ubiquitin, NEDD8, or sentrin-1 was determined. As shown in Fig. 8 (lanes 2–4), only GST-NEDD8, but not GST-ubiquitin or GST-sentrin-1, could specifically precipitate in vitro translated UBC12. However, we could not observe an NEDD8 and UBC12 conjugate in the absence of E1 (lane 3). When APP-BP1 and UBA3 were added to the reaction mixture, a 55-kDa conjugate could be detected (lane 5). This band most likely represents GST-NEDD8 conjugated to UBC12 via a thiol ester linkage because it disappeared when the sample was reduced with 5% β-mercaptoethanol (lane 6). Thus, UBC12 is the only E2 tested that was able to form a conjugate with NEDD8. This observation is also consistent with the recent report of the critical role of yeast Ubc12 in the conjugation of Rub1 (4Liakopoulos D. Doenges G. Matuschewski K. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination has proven to be one of the major protein modification pathways and plays a critical role in many cellular processes (14Haas A.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1053-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar, 16Wilkinson K.D. Ann. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The complexity of the ubiquitination system is further compounded by the identification of other ubiquitin-like molecules, such as UCRP (ubiquitincross-reactive protein), sentrin, and NEDD8. UCRP is a type 1 interferon-inducible protein that contains two ubiquitin domains (17Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UCRP has been shown to conjugate to a large number of intracellular proteins (18Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins modified by UCRP have not yet been identified. Recent results from the Haas laboratory (19Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) suggest that UCRP conjugation proceeds through an enzyme pathway distinct from that of ubiquitin, at least with respect to the activation step. However, the true identity of the activating enzyme for UCRP is not known. The sentrin family of ubiquitin-like proteins consists of three family members that have similar substrate specificity. We have shown that sentrin-1, sentrin-2, and sentrin-3 are able to conjugate to RanGAP1 and PML (5Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The yeast homologue of sentrin is Smt-3, which utilizes an activating enzyme complex consisting of Uba2 and Aos1 (10Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). A similar complex is also required for the activation of the sentrin family members.2Interestingly, both sentrin and Smt-3 utilize UBC9 as the conjugating enzyme (10Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 12Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that NEDD8 can be covalently conjugated to a limited number of cellular proteins (2Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In this report, we cloned and characterized both the activating and conjugating enzyme complexes for NEDD8. Our results are consistent with reports from the yeast system (3Lammer D. Mathias N.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Taken together, the enzymatic machinery responsible for the activation and conjugation of ubiquitin-like proteins diverged from the ubiquitination system early in evolution (Fig. 9). We thank Dr. T. Kamitani for scientific discussions and B. Li and L. S. Caskey for technical assistance."

We have recently found that GPX is induced by etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and a p53 activator. In a search for a cis-element that confers potential p53 regulation of GPX, we identified a p53 binding site in the promoter of the GPX gene. This site bound to purified p53 as well as p53 in nuclear extract activated by etoposide. A luciferase reporter driven by a 262-base pair GPX promoter fragment was transcriptionally activated by wild type p53 in a p53 binding site-dependent manner. The same reporter was also activated in a p53 binding site-independent manner by several p53 mutants. The p53 binding and transactivation of the GPX promoter were enhanced by etoposide in p53-positive U2-OS cells. Etoposide-induced transactivation was blocked by a dominant negative p53 mutant, indicating that endogenous wild type p53, upon activation by etoposide, transactivated the GPX promoter. Furthermore, expression of endogenous GPX was induced significantly at both mRNA and enzyme activity levels by etoposide in U2-OS cells but not in p53-negative Saos-2 cells.

Structurally, the p53 molecule consists of three major domains: an oligomerization domain in its carboxyl terminus which mediates homotetramer formation; a DNA binding domain in the center portion of the molecule which specifically binds to its consensus binding site; and a transactivation domain in the amino terminus which mediates transactivation of many downstream target genes (1Lane D.P.

As a typical tumor suppressor, p53 has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth and suppress transformation through induction of G1arrest or apoptosis (4Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R.

As a “genome guard,” p53 prevents gene amplification, thus maintaining genome stability (7Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar, 8Livingstone L.R. White A.

Most of the functions of p53 involve its activity as a transcription factor. p53 binds to its consensus binding sequence (two copies of the 10-bp1 motif 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(T/A)GPyPyPy-3′, separated by 0–13 bp) (13El-Deiry W.S. Kern S. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) and transactivates expression of target genes. Several biologically significant genes were found to contain this consensus sequence and to be subjected to p53 regulation. Among those commonly studied areWaf-1/p21 (14el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

The p53 mutations found in many human cancers were clustered in the specific DNA binding domain of the p53 molecule (24Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to an inactivation of p53 function through abolishing p53-specific DNA binding and transactivation. Cellular glutathione peroxidase, GPX (EC 1.11.1.9), is one of the primary antioxidant enzymes that scavenges hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides with glutathione as the hydrogen donor (25Spallhoz J.E. Boylan L.M. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidase in Chemistry and Biology. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 259-291Google Scholar). The enzyme was first described in 1957 and is found mainly in cytoplasm (26Mills G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPX is a selenium-dependent enzyme that exists as a homotetramer with each 22-kDa subunit containing a selenium atom incorporated within a catalytically active selenocysteine residue (27Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar,28Mullenbach G.T. Tabrizi A. Irvine B.D. Bell G.I. Tainer J.A. Halliwell R.A. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There are three other members of the selenium-dependent GPX family, although cytosolic GPX (GPX1) is the predominant form (29Chu F.F. Doroshow J.H. Esworthy R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2571-2576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding GPX was mapped on chromosome 3q11–13 (30Chada S. Le-Beau M.M. Casey L. Newburger P.E. Genomics. 1990; 6: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because GPX decomposes hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides produced during normal metabolism and after oxidative insults, GPX prevents peroxide-induced DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein degradation (31Sun Y. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 583-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Using DNA chip technology, we have found recently that GPX is inducible by etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, an apoptosis inducer, and a p53 activator. (32Wang Y. Rea T. Bian J. Gray S. Sun Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We report here the characterization ofGPX as a novel p53 target gene, determined by assays for DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and endogenous gene induction. This finding links p53 to an antioxidant enzyme for the first time and may shed light on a better understanding of p53 signaling pathways and redox regulation. Two human osteogenic sarcoma cell lines, U2-OS and Saos-2, were grown in 10% McCory or 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively. U2-OS cells harbor a wild type p53 (23Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), whereas Saos-2 cells have the p53 gene deletion (33Masuda H. Miller C. Koeffler H.P. Battifora H. Cline M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7716-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The doubling time is about 24 h for U2-OS and 40 h for Saos-2 under these culture conditions. For drug treatment, U2-OS and Saos-2 cells were exposed to etoposide (25 μm, Sigma) for various periods of time up to 48 h. The assay was performed as described previously (34Bian J. Jacobs C. Wang Y. Sun Y. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2559-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Sun Y. Bian J. Wang Y. Jacobs C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 20-bp synthetic oligonucleotide, GPX01 (5′-GGGCCAGACCAGACATGCCT-3′), which consists of the putative p53 binding site found in the GPX promoter and its complementary strand, were annealed and labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. A DNA-binding reaction mixture of 20 μl contained 20 mm Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, 4% Ficoll-400, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 μg of poly(dI·dC), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (20,000 cpm), and 3 μg of partially purified recombinant p53 or nuclear extract from U2-OS cells after etoposide treatment (34Bian J. Jacobs C. Wang Y. Sun Y. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2559-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Sun Y. Bian J. Wang Y. Jacobs C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The recombinant p53 protein used was produced in insect cells infected with a baculovirus vector carrying human p53 cDNA and partially purified through DNA affinity chromatography (34Bian J. Jacobs C. Wang Y. Sun Y. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2559-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In certain cases, 0.2 μg of anti-p53 antibody pAb421 and a 100-fold excess of unlabeled specific or nonspecific oligonucleotide were also included. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 45 min and loaded onto a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run in 0.5 × TBE buffer at 60 V, dried, and exposed to Kodak film. The luciferase reporter constructs driven by the GPXpromoter were made as follows. A 262-bp DNA fragment of the GPXpromoter containing a p53 binding site was generated by PCR amplification of human placenta DNA (Oncor) with primers GPX01 and GPX04 (5′-GGCGCAATTGTCCAAGAAGC-3′). A 242-bp DNA fragment of the GPXpromoter without a p53 binding site was generated with primers GPX03 (5′-GCTGCTCCTTCCGGCTTAGG-3′) and GPX04. The PCR fragments were gel purified, subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and seven independent clones were sequenced by an automatic DNA sequenator to verify the orientation and freedom of mutations. The recombinant clones were digested with HindIII and XhoI and ligated into a predigested pGL-Basic luciferase reporter-3 (Promega). Dispersed cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a cell concentration of 105/well (for Saos-2) or 2 × 105/well (for U2-OS) 16–24 h before transfection. The calcium phosphate method was used for transient transfection of Saos-2 cells as described previously (35Sun Y. Bian J. Wang Y. Jacobs C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for U2-OS transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase reporters described above, along with the control plasmid, were cotransfected with a β-galactosidase construct in the presence or absence of constructs expressing wild type or mutant p53 proteins. The ratio of the DNA amounts for p53-expressing vector versus luciferase reporter was 1:1 or 1:2. 38 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase/β-galactosidase activities as detailed previously (35Sun Y. Bian J. Wang Y. Jacobs C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The results are presented as the fold activation of the empty reporter after normalization with β-galactosidase activity. U2-OS and Saos-2 cells were treated with 25 μmetoposide, a known p53 activator, for various time periods up to 48 h. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol solution (Tel-Test), and 15 μg of total RNA was subjected to Northern analysis as described previously (36Sun Y. Hegamyer G. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1139-1144PubMed Google Scholar). The probe used was an 800-bp human GPX cDNA fragment (37Sukenaga Y. Ishida K. Takeda T. Takagi K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The human housekeeping gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH; Ambion) was used as loading controls for densitometric quantitation. Subconfluent human Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with GPX W/p53BS construct and various constructs expressing wild type or mutant p53 proteins along with the vector control by the calcium phosphate method as described (35Sun Y. Bian J. Wang Y. Jacobs C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 38 h post-transfection and lysed on ice for 30 min in a lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.3% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 unit/ml aprotinin. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. Equal amounts of proteins (60 μg) in supernatant were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and run at 100 V for 2 h. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellular membrane and probed with p53 antibodies pAb421 and pAb240 (1:500 dilution). The p53 proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody coupled with Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subconfluent U2-OS and Saos-2 cells were treated with 25 μm etoposide for 24 h. Cells were then cultured in drug-free medium for another 24 h. All media contained 30 nm selenium to stimulate GPX activity. The cells were harvested, sonicated three times for 10 s each using a Vibra Cell Sonicator (Sonics and Materials, Inc.) at full power and 40% duty cycle, and then assayed for GPX activity using the method of Paglia and Valentine (38Paglia P.E. Valentine W.N. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1967; 70: 158-169PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GPX were measured in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing glutathione, glutathione reductase, and NADPH with hydrogen peroxide as substrate. 1 unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of cell lysate that oxidized 1 μmol of NADPH/min. Protein concentrations were measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Statistical differences between etoposide-treated and untreated cells were analyzed by Student's t test. Groups were considered statistically different if p < 0.05. In an attempt to identify genes responsible for etoposide-induced apoptosis, we utilized DNA chip technology and identified 62 genes responsive to etoposide. One of the etoposide-inducible genes was GPX (32Wang Y. Rea T. Bian J. Gray S. Sun Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because we have shown previously that etoposide activates p53 (23Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), we wondered whether etoposide-induced GPX expression is mediated by p53. After searching the promoter sequence of the GPX gene deposited in GenBank (Accession No. M83094) for a p53 consensus sequence (5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPyPuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′), we identified a putative p53 binding site, 5′-GGGCCAGACCAGACATGCCT-3′, located at −257 bp upstream from the translation initiation site. Like the p53 binding site found in most of the known p53 target genes (2Selivanova G. Wiman K.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 143-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this site contains two mismatches (underlined) but no space between the two 10-bp motifs. We next examined whether p53 binds to this putative p53 binding site. We used both purified p53 protein (34Bian J. Jacobs C. Wang Y. Sun Y. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2559-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and nuclear extract from p53-positive U2-OS cells treated with 25 μm etoposide for 6 or 24 h. As shown in Fig.1, a 20-bp oligonucleotide, consisting of the p53 binding site found in the GPX promoter, binds to both purified p53 (lane 2) and endogenous p53 in nuclear extract treated with etoposide for 6 and 24 h, respectively (lanes 8 and 10) only in the presence of p53 antibody, pAb421. It is well known that pAb421 enhances and stabilizes p53 DNA binding (39Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In nuclear extract from untreated cells, p53 binding was hardly detectable (lane 6) but was significantly enhanced by etoposide (lanes 8 and 10), consistent with our previous observation (23Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The binding is sequence-specific because it can be largely competed away by 100-fold excess of cold oligonucleotide (lanes 3 and 11) but not by a sequence nonspecific competitor (lanes 4 and12). The results indicate that p53 did bind to the putative p53 binding site found in the GPX promoter. To examine whether p53 would transactivate the GPX promoter, we cloned a 262-bp promoter fragment containing the p53 binding site and a 242-bp fragment with the p53 binding site deleted, by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from human placenta (Oncor). The DNA sequence from seven independent PCR clones revealed three disagreements with the published sequence (40; Accession No. M83094). As shown in Fig.2, in the PCR-cloned GPXpromoter, there is a C insertion at nucleotides 2401 and 2421, respectively, and a 3-nucleotide (CCG) insertion at 2470. The disagreement could be derived from the sequencing errors in the GC-rich region in the published data. Computer analysis of this 262-bp fragment revealed that in addition to a p53 binding site, there are sites for SP-1, AP-2, PEA-3, c-Myc, among others (data not shown). To examine potential p53-dependent transactivation of the GPX promoter, we transfected luciferase reporters driven by the GPX promoter sequence with (GPX W/p53BS) or without (GPX-W/O p53BS) the p53 binding site into p53-negative Saos-2 cells along with p53 expression plasmid or an empty vector as the control. As shown in Fig.3, in the absence of p53 (vector control) the PCR-cloned promoter fragment contains a strong promoter activity. An 80-fold higher luciferase activity was observed compared with the empty vector, pGL-Basic-3. The luciferase activity was similar in both p53 binding site-containing (GPX W/p53BS) or -deleted (GPX W/O p53BS) constructs. Cotransfection of wild type p53 with GPX W/p53BS construct induced a 4-fold activation of the luciferase activity compared to that with GPX W/O p53BS, indicating a p53 binding site-dependent activation of the promoter. Cotransfection of p53 also induced a slight repression of the promoter activity that lacks a p53 binding site (GPX W/O p53BS), a phenomenon also being observed in p53 regulation of the matrix metalloproteinases-2 gene promoter (23Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) but not in that of the S100A2 promoter (41Tan M. Heizmann C.W. Guan J. Schafer B.W. Sun Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The results indicated that a 262-bp fragment immediately upstream of the translation initiation site of theGPX gene confers a strong promoter activity and that p53 can transactivate the GPX promoter, and transactivation is p53 binding site-dependent. We next examined whether the GPX promoter was also regulated by p53 mutants. Plasmid DNAs encoding p53 mutant proteins were individually cotransfected with luciferase reporters into Saos-2 cells. They are the p53-143A, p53-175H, p53-248W, p53-273H, p53-281G, five of the most commonly found p53 mutants in human cancers (23Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar), and p53-280T, a dominant negative p53 mutant found in nasopharyngeal carcinomas (42Sun Y. Nakamura K. Wendel E. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Sun Y. Dong Z. Nakamura K. Colburn N.H.

Biol. 1997; 7: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, top panel, compared with the vector control, some p53 mutants, such as 248W, 273H, and 281G induced a 6–9-fold activation of the GPX promoter. Mutant 143A conferred a 3-fold activation, comparable to wild type p53. Other mutants (175H and 280T) had little effect. Moreover, activation by these p53 mutants was p53 binding site-independent because it can be detected at a comparable level in both p53 site-containing or -deleted luciferase constructs. It is noteworthy that there is no significant difference in β-galactosidase activity when cotransfected with either wild type p53 or various p53 mutants, indicating a similar transfection efficiency (not shown). The results demonstrated that some p53 mutants can also transactivate the GPX promoter and that transactivation was mediated by a downstream sequence from the p53 binding site. To determine the protein levels of wild type p53 and p53 mutants after transient transfection into Saos-2 cells, Western blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 4, bottom panel, all constructs, except the vector control, expressed p53 protein. The protein level was, however, higher in mutants p53-143A, 273H, and 281G than that of wild type, mutants p53-175H, 248W, and 280T. The actual level of the fold activation may therefore vary among the mutants. Etoposide has been shown previously to activate p53 in U2-OS cells (23Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether etoposide would induce p53-dependent transactivation of the GPX promoter. As shown in Fig.5, transactivation of the luciferase reporter driven by the p53 site-containing promoter (GPX W/p53BS) was induced by etoposide, and a 9-fold induction was achieved at 24 or 48 h. Slight induction (3-fold) of luciferase activity was also seen in the p53-siteless promoter (GPX W/O p53BS), which appeared to be p53-independent. To confirm that etoposide-induced transactivation is largely p53-dependent, we transfected p53-280T, a known dominant negative p53 mutant (42Sun Y. Nakamura K. Wendel E. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Sun Y. Dong Z. Nakamura K. Colburn N.H.

Biol. 1997; 7: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), into U2-OS cells followed by etoposide treatment and luciferase assay. As a control, the empty vector was used. As shown in Fig. 5, etoposide-induced, p53-dependent activation is abolished by p53-280T (GPX W/p53BS+p53-280T) to a level comparable with that of GPX W/O p53BS, but it is only slightly inhibited by the vector control (GPX-W/p53BS+vector). The results demonstrated that transactivation of the GPX promoter by etoposide is largely p53-dependent. To determine whether etoposide causes p53 accumulation or p53 activation (either mechanism would lead to increased DNA binding and transactivation), we performed Western blot analysis with U2-OS cells after exposure to etoposide for 0, 6, or 24 h. p53 protein can only be detected in the sample after a 24-h etoposide treatment, indicating that the drug modifies the synthesis of endogenous p53 protein that leads to p53 accumulation (data not shown). We have also examined whether etoposide affects the activity of wild type or p53 mutants in transactivating GPX promoter when transfected into the Saos-2 cells that lack endogenous p53. p53-281G, a mutant that induces a p53 binding site-independent transactivation of theGPX promoter, was selected to be a representative of p53 mutants, and empty vector was used as the control. After transfection, Saos-2 cells were treated with 25 μm etoposide for 0, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h followed by luciferase assay. No induction of transactivation activity by etoposide can be observed in either wild type p53 or p53-281G mutant (data not shown). The result indicates that etoposide has no effect on preexisting p53, regardless of the status of p53. Thus, etoposide, as a topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA-damaging reagent, induces p53 accumulation rather than p53 activation. To examine whether endogenous GPX is subjected to p53 regulation, we treated p53-positive U2-OS cells and p53-negative Saos-2 cells with etoposide. As shown in Fig.6, both cells express a detectable basal level of GPX mRNA with a higher level in U2-OS cells (first and seventh lanes from left). In U2-OS cells, expression of GPX started to increase 6 h after etoposide treatment, gradually being induced thereafter, and reached a peak at 12–24 h (first five lanes). A bigger induction (2.7-fold, sixth lane) was seen at 48 h which, however, might be error-prone because of the decline in mRNA synthesis resulting from cell death. No significant induction of GPX expression was observed in Saos-2 cells up to 24 h (sevenththrough ninth lanes). This is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 5 and clearly demonstrates that expression of the endogenous GPX is regulated by p53. Lastly, we examined GPX enzymatic activity after etoposide treatment in U2-OS and Saos-2 cells. As shown in Table I, etoposide caused a 78% increase in GPX activity in U2-OS cells at 24 h after etoposide removal. The groups were statistically different at thep < 0.05 level. In contrast, no increase was measured in the Saos-2 cells. This suggests that GPX protein be increased in p53-positive but not p53-negative cells after exposure to etoposide.Table IEffect of etoposide on GPX activityCell lineGPX activityWithout etoposideWith etoposidemilliunits/mg proteinU2-OS6.7 ± 0.911.9 ± 2.4aStatistically different at the p < 0.05 level according to Student's t test.

Open table in a new tab The finding reported here indicates that GPX, an antioxidant enzyme, is subjected to p53 regulation and is a novel p53 target gene. This is evident for several reasons. First, p53 binds to the p53 binding site in the promoter of the GPX gene. Second, p53 transactivates the GPX promoter in a p53 binding site-dependent manner. Third, p53 binding and transactivation of the GPX promoter were enhanced by etoposide, a p53 activator. Fourth, etoposide/p53-induced transactivation of the GPX promoter can be blocked by a dominant negative p53 mutant. Fifth, expression of endogenous GPX was induced significantly by etoposide only in p53-positive U2-OS cells but not in p53-negative Saos-2 cells. In addition, some of the"

In response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the AHR·ARNT complex binds to “dioxin responsive enhancers” (DREs) and activates genes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics,e.g. cytochrome P4501A1 (Cyp1a1). The HIF1α·ARNT complex binds to “hypoxia responsive enhancers” and activates the transcription of genes that regulate adaptation to low oxygen, e.g. erythropoietin (Epo). We postulated that activation of one pathway would inhibit the other due to competition for ARNT or other limiting cellular factors. Using pathway specific reporters in transient transfection assays, we observed that DRE driven transcription was markedly inhibited by hypoxia and that hypoxia responsive enhancer driven transcription was inhibited by AHR agonists. When we attempted to support this cross-talk model using endogenous loci, we observed that activation of the hypoxia pathway inhibited Cyp1a1 up-regulation, but that activation of the AHR actually enhanced the induction of Epo by hypoxia. To explain this unexpected additivity, we examined theEpo gene and found that its promoter harbors DREs immediately upstream of its transcriptional start site. These experiments outline conditions where inhibitory and additive cross-talk occur between the hypoxia and dioxin signal transduction pathways and identify Epo as an AHR-regulated gene.

Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In what can be defined as an adaptive pathway, the AHR up-regulates a battery of XMEs that often metabolize many of these agonists to more soluble and excretable products. A classic example of this pathway is observed upon exposure to benzo[a]pyrene. This chemical binds to the AHR leading to the up-regulation of a battery of genes includingCyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 (3Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The enzymes encoded by these loci have metabolic activity toward benzo[a]pyrene and thus play an important role in its elimination (4Nebert D.W. Atlas S.A. Guenthner T.M. Kouri R.E. Ts'o P.O.P. Gelboin H.V. Polycyclic Hydrocarbons and Cancer: Chemistry, Molecular Biology and Environment. 2. Academic Press, New York1978: 345Google Scholar). At present, we understand many of the molecular events in what appears to be an adaptive response to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure. In brief, the up-regulation of genes likeCyp1a1 are regulated by an agonist-induced heterodimerization between two bHLH-PAS proteins, the AHR and ARNT (5Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar,6Hankinson O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This heterodimeric pair interacts with DREs upstream of the regulated promoters leading to an increase in their transcription rate and a resultant increase in XME activity (7Whitlock Jr., J.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar).Although we have developed models to describe how the AHR regulates the expression of XMEs, we still have very little knowledge about how this protein mediates the toxicity of potent agonists like dioxin. The molecular mechanisms of dioxin-induced effects like lymphoid involution, epithelial hyperplasia, tumor promotion, teratogenesis, or even death remain unclear. Moreover, although genetic studies indicate the involvement of the AHR in these toxic end points, we have essentially no information that can allow us to conclude that the AHR-mediated mechanisms underlying these effects are similar to the regulation of XMEs. In fact, pharmacological evidence suggests that the mechanisms may be unique (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar, 8Knutson J.C. Poland A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken in sum, these observations have led us to postulate the existence of a toxic response pathway that may be mechanistically distinct from the adaptive one.In an effort to provide evidence for the existence of alternative methods of dioxin signaling, we have explored the possibility that activation of the AHR may inhibit homologous pathways by sequestering limiting cellular factors (2Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). This idea has its roots in the observation that most bHLH proteins function in highly complex signaling networks that involve multiple combinations of bHLH partners, with each pair having a unique effect on gene expression and the cellular environment (9Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 10Hurlin P.J. Ayer D.E. Grandori C. Eisenman R.N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

In its simplest form, this model predicts that the activation of the AHR may sequester ARNT, preventing this protein from fully participating in other ARNT-dependent pathways. The recent discovery that HIF1α·ARNT complexes bind to HREs and activate the transcription of a battery of hypoxia responsive genes provided a system to test the model of dioxin toxicity described above (12Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the cross-talk between the dioxin and hypoxia signal transduction pathways in both an in vitroand cell culture model system. Our experiments outline conditions where reciprocal inhibitory cross-talk between the hypoxia and dioxin signal transduction pathways occurs and describe a compensatory mechanism that explains the unexpected effects of dioxin on Epo expression in cell culture.DISCUSSIONAh receptor agonists can initiate pathways that mediate metabolic adaptation to environmental pollutants in addition to a number of toxic responses (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In the well characterized “adaptive pathway,” the ligand-induced AHR-ARNT heterodimers bind to DREs resulting in the transcriptional activation of genes encoding a variety of XMEs. Unfortunately, an understanding of the molecular details that underlie dioxin's “toxic pathway” have yet to be developed. We postulate that the high binding affinity of dioxins may translate into a high fractional activation of the receptor, and a corresponding depletion of limiting factors within a cell that are required not only for AHR signaling, but also for parallel signal transduction pathways. The discovery that ARNT was also a heterodimeric partner of HIF1α and that this complex bound to HREs to activate transcriptional responses to hypoxia, CoCl2, and certain iron chelators provided a system to test this idea. In its simplest form, this model predicts that a reciprocal relationship would exist between the dioxin and hypoxia signaling pathways. For example, if ARNT was the putative limiting factor, agonists like dioxin would up-regulate DRE driven genes through the formation of AHR-ARNT heterodimers, while at the same time inhibiting the hypoxia response due to the decreased availability of ARNT for HIF1α dimerization. In a similar manner, this model also predicts that activation of HIF1α would up-regulate the levels of hypoxia responsive genes, while at the same time decreasing the availability of ARNT and inhibiting the dioxin response.In an effort to test this model, we first examined a number of simple systems to see if we could find evidence that the AHR and HIF1α were in competition for limiting cellular factors in vitro. In gel shift experiments we observed that the AHR inhibited HIF1α-ARNT interactions with an HRE and that HIF1α inhibited AHR-ARNT interactions with a DRE (Fig. 1). These experiments were performed in a preliminary phase of our investigation and led us to perform additional tests of the cross-talk model. The observation that the AHR was capable of inhibiting HIF1α-ARNT interactions in the absence of agonist is consistent with a high level of constitutive activity of the human AHRin vitro. 2W. K. Chan, G. Yao, Y-Z. Gu, and C. A. Bradfield, unpublished observations. The human AHR was chosen for these studies so that only human proteins would be used. The high level of constitutive human AHR would also explain why the addition of βNF to these reactions only modestly increased the inhibition of the HIF1α·ARNT complex. Given that thein vitro constitutive activity of the human AHR is a peripheral issue to this report, it has not been pursued further by using a more tightly controlled AHR form (e.g. murine b-1 allele) or by optimizing incubation conditions. We can only note that the reciprocal nature of the inhibition is reproducible, and that these observations led us to test this model in vivo, where compelling evidence was also obtained.Transient transfection assays using a luciferase reporter that was linked to either the HRE derived from the Epo gene or the multiple DREs derived from the Cyp1A1 gene also supported this model. That is, dioxin inhibited the CoCl2 induction of an HRE driven promoter and CoCl2 inhibited the dioxin-induction of a DRE driven promoter (Figs. 2 and 3). Finally, experiments where we monitored the impact of CoCl2 on dioxin's induction of the endogenous CYP1A1 gene provided additional evidence that hypoxia signaling inhibited the dioxin pathway (Fig. 4). These experiments also indicated that this effect was occurring at the level of Cyp1A1 transcription and via DRE enhancer elements.Given the supportive data generated in early experiments, we were surprised when we observed that dioxin exposure did not inhibit the induction of EPO mRNA by CoCl2 in Hep3B cells (Fig. 5). Fortunately a clue was found in the observations that dioxin alone up-regulated EPO mRNA and that co-administration of CoCl2 and dioxin displayed an additive effect in this system. This led us to investigate the possibility that theEpo gene may be a dioxin inducible gene and harbor DREs within its regulatory regions. The identification of five sequences within the proximal Epo promoter that closely matched the functional consensus sequence found in bona fide DREs, supported this idea (Fig. 6 A) (26Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To support the functional identity of this region as a composite dioxin response enhancer, we performed a pharmacological comparison with dioxin and βNF. We found that theEpo promoter and the CYP1A1 enhancer region displayed the same relative transcriptional responses to βNF and dioxin (Fig. 8). Two important conclusions arise from these observations. First, thatEpo is a dioxin responsive gene. Second, that the DREs within the promoter region of the Epo gene can compensate for the inhibitory effects that dioxin has on HRE mediated transcription at this locus. The net result of these multiple elements is a dampening of the inhibitory/reciprocal cross-talk between these two pathways. At the present time, it is not known whether this phenomenon extends to other HRE driven genes like Vegf (27Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3165) Google Scholar),Pgk (28Li H. Ko H.P. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21262-21267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), or if this scenario is specific to Epoexpression.Our experiments also support the idea that the hypoxia and dioxin response pathways can compete for limiting cellular factor(s) and that reciprocal cross-talk is probably occurring at certain loci within mammalian cells. Although we have used ARNT as an example of this limiting factor in model development, it is important to point out that we have not proven this to be the case. Although our attempts have been limited, our preliminary experiments to reduce this cross-talk by transfection of ARNT, yielded ambiguous results. Although we observed some degree of reduction, we also observed that the basal activities of each promoter increased, thus clouding any potential conclusions. An argument for the importance of limiting factors other than ARNT can be found in the recent observation that demonstrates that dioxin can also inhibit progesterone receptor signaling (29Kuil C.W. Brouwer A. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This may be an indication that the limiting factor(s) may also be shared with nuclear receptor signal transduction pathways. Although the candidates are many, it is tempting to speculate that competition for shared coactivators like SRC-1 may be important (30Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Finally, this “limiting cellular factor” may not be a single protein, but rather may be a composite of limiting levels of multiple factors.Interestingly, data from other investigators has demonstrated that dioxin signaling can be inhibited by activation of HIF1α even though inhibition of hypoxia signaling was not observed by dioxin (31Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar,32Gassmann M. Kvietikova I. Rolfs A. Wenger R.H. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Data from these earlier papers suggested that this unidirectional cross-talk might be related to the fact that HIF1α has a greater affinity for ARNT than the AHR. At first inspection, our gel shift experiments are in agreement with the idea that HIF1α has a greater affinity for ARNT than does the AHR. Nevertheless, it may be premature to compare the relative affinities of these two proteins since we do not know the fraction of the AHR that is activated in gel shift assays (or in any in vitro assays), nor do we know how long this species remains active. Thus, the increased binding of HIF1α for ARNT may be simply due to the fact that more HIF1α per unit time is in a receptive form to bind to ARNT, as compared with AHR in in vitro assays. Moreover, these earlier studies did not reveal that dioxin up-regulated EPO mRNA. This may be due to the use of a weaker agonist than dioxin, or to the fact that readily metabolized agonists do not exhibit their activity for the prolonged time periods as compared with dioxin (33Chen Y.H.

Harper P.A. Okey A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12118-12128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the differences in EPO response may simply be due to the different time points examined in these studies.In summary, we have shown that reciprocal cross-talk between the AHR and HIF-1α signaling pathways can occur in vitro andin vivo and that this cross-talk occurs at their cognate response elements. These experiments also support the idea that a limiting cellular factor is shared by these two pathways, the obvious candidate being ARNT. Our data also point to the complexity of cross-talk. Although the activation of the hypoxia pathway inhibited the up-regulation of the Cyp1a1 gene, the effect of dioxin on the up-regulation of the Epo gene is more complex. Most importantly, we examined the Epo gene and found that its promoter functions as a dioxin responsive enhancer and thus,Epo transcription can be up-regulated by both hypoxia and dioxin. Studies are now in progress to determine the importance of these novel responses and whether they are essential steps in the toxic pathway of dioxins. The AHR1 regulates a variety of biological responses to environmentally ubiquitous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxins (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In what can be defined as an adaptive pathway, the AHR up-regulates a battery of XMEs that often metabolize many of these agonists to more soluble and excretable products. A classic example of this pathway is observed upon exposure to benzo[a]pyrene. This chemical binds to the AHR leading to the up-regulation of a battery of genes includingCyp1a1, Cyp1a2, and Cyp1b1 (3Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The enzymes encoded by these loci have metabolic activity toward benzo[a]pyrene and thus play an important role in its elimination (4Nebert D.W. Atlas S.A. Guenthner T.M. Kouri R.E. Ts'o P.O.P. Gelboin H.V. Polycyclic Hydrocarbons and Cancer: Chemistry, Molecular Biology and Environment. 2. Academic Press, New York1978: 345Google Scholar). At present, we understand many of the molecular events in what appears to be an adaptive response to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure. In brief, the up-regulation of genes likeCyp1a1 are regulated by an agonist-induced heterodimerization between two bHLH-PAS proteins, the AHR and ARNT (5Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar,6Hankinson O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This heterodimeric pair interacts with DREs upstream of the regulated promoters leading to an increase in their transcription rate and a resultant increase in XME activity (7Whitlock Jr., J.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Although we have developed models to describe how the AHR regulates the expression of XMEs, we still have very little knowledge about how this protein mediates the toxicity of potent agonists like dioxin. The molecular mechanisms of dioxin-induced effects like lymphoid involution, epithelial hyperplasia, tumor promotion, teratogenesis, or even death remain unclear. Moreover, although genetic studies indicate the involvement of the AHR in these toxic end points, we have essentially no information that can allow us to conclude that the AHR-mediated mechanisms underlying these effects are similar to the regulation of XMEs. In fact, pharmacological evidence suggests that the mechanisms may be unique (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar, 8Knutson J.C. Poland A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken in sum, these observations have led us to postulate the existence of a toxic response pathway that may be mechanistically distinct from the adaptive one. In an effort to provide evidence for the existence of alternative methods of dioxin signaling, we have explored the possibility that activation of the AHR may inhibit homologous pathways by sequestering limiting cellular factors (2Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). This idea has its roots in the observation that most bHLH proteins function in highly complex signaling networks that involve multiple combinations of bHLH partners, with each pair having a unique effect on gene expression and the cellular environment (9Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 10Hurlin P.J. Ayer D.E. Grandori C. Eisenman R.N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Skeath J.B. Carroll S.B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In its simplest form, this model predicts that the activation of the AHR may sequester ARNT, preventing this protein from fully participating in other ARNT-dependent pathways. The recent discovery that HIF1α·ARNT complexes bind to HREs and activate the transcription of a battery of hypoxia responsive genes provided a system to test the model of dioxin toxicity described above (12Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the cross-talk between the dioxin and hypoxia signal transduction pathways in both an in vitroand cell culture model system. Our experiments outline conditions where reciprocal inhibitory cross-talk between the hypoxia and dioxin signal transduction pathways occurs and describe a compensatory mechanism that explains the unexpected effects of dioxin on Epo expression in cell culture. DISCUSSIONAh receptor agonists can initiate pathways that mediate metabolic adaptation to environmental pollutants in addition to a number of toxic responses (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 3Denison M.S. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In the well characterized “adaptive pathway,” the ligand-induced AHR-ARNT heterodimers bind to DREs resulting in the transcriptional activation of genes encoding a variety of XMEs. Unfortunately, an understanding of the molecular details that underlie dioxin's “toxic pathway” have yet to be developed. We postulate that the high binding affinity of dioxins may translate into a high fractional activation of the receptor, and a corresponding depletion of limiting factors within a cell that are required not only for AHR signaling, but also for parallel signal transduction pathways. The discovery that ARNT was also a heterodimeric partner of HIF1α and that this complex bound to HREs to activate transcriptional responses to hypoxia, CoCl2, and certain iron chelators provided a system to test this idea. In its simplest form, this model predicts that a reciprocal relationship would exist between the dioxin and hypoxia signaling pathways. For example, if ARNT was the putative limiting factor, agonists like dioxin would up-regulate DRE driven genes through the formation of AHR-ARNT heterodimers, while at the same time inhibiting the hypoxia response due to the decreased availability of ARNT for HIF1α dimerization. In a similar manner, this model also predicts that activation of HIF1α would up-regulate the levels of hypoxia responsive genes, while at the same time decreasing the availability of ARNT and inhibiting the dioxin response.In an effort to test this model, we first examined a number of simple systems to see if we could find evidence that the AHR and HIF1α were in competition for limiting cellular factors in vitro. In gel shift experiments we observed that the AHR inhibited HIF1α-ARNT interactions with an HRE and that HIF1α inhibited AHR-ARNT interactions with a DRE (Fig. 1). These experiments were performed in a preliminary phase of our investigation and led us to perform additional tests of the cross-talk model. The observation that the AHR was capable of inhibiting HIF1α-ARNT interactions in the absence of agonist is consistent with a high level of constitutive activity of the human AHRin vitro. 2W. K. Chan, G. Yao, Y-Z. Gu, and C. A. Bradfield, unpublished observations. The human AHR was chosen for these studies so that only human proteins would be used. The high level of constitutive human AHR would also explain why the addition of βNF to these reactions only modestly increased the inhibition of the HIF1α·ARNT complex. Given that thein vitro constitutive activity of the human AHR is a peripheral issue to this report, it has not been pursued further by using a more tightly controlled AHR form (e.g. murine b-1 allele) or by optimizing incubation conditions. We can only note that the reciprocal nature of the inhibition is reproducible, and that these observations led us to test this model in vivo, where compelling evidence was also obtained.Transient transfection assays using a luciferase reporter that was linked to either the HRE derived from the Epo gene or the multiple DREs derived from the Cyp1A1 gene also supported this model. That is, dioxin inhibited the CoCl2 induction of an HRE driven promoter and CoCl2 inhibited the dioxin-induction of a DRE driven promoter (Figs. 2 and 3). Finally, experiments where we monitored the impact of CoCl2 on dioxin's induction of the endogenous CYP1A1 gene provided additional evidence that hypoxia signaling inhibited the dioxin pathway (Fig. 4). These experiments also indicated that this effect was occurring at the level of Cyp1A1 transcription and via DRE enhancer elements.Given the supportive data generated in early experiments, we were surprised when we observed that dioxin exposure did not inhibit the induction of EPO mRNA by CoCl2 in Hep3B cells (Fig. 5). Fortunately a clue was found in the observations that dioxin alone up-regulated EPO mRNA and that co-administration of CoCl2 and dioxin displayed an additive effect in this system. This led us to investigate the possibility that theEpo gene may be a dioxin inducible gene and harbor DREs within its regulatory regions. The identification of five sequences within the proximal Epo promoter that closely matched the functional consensus sequence found in bona fide DREs, supported this idea (Fig. 6 A) (26Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To support the functional identity of this region as a composite dioxin response enhancer, we performed a pharmacological comparison with dioxin and βNF. We found that theEpo promoter and the CYP1A1 enhancer region displayed the same relative transcriptional responses to βNF and dioxin (Fig. 8). Two important conclusions arise from these observations. First, thatEpo is a dioxin responsive gene. Second, that the DREs within the promoter region of the Epo gene can compensate for the inhibitory effects that dioxin has on HRE mediated transcription at this locus. The net result of these multiple elements is a dampening of the inhibitory/reciprocal cross-talk between these two pathways. At the present time, it is not known whether this phenomenon extends to other HRE driven genes like Vegf (27Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3165) Google Scholar),Pgk (28Li H. Ko H.P. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21262-21267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), or if this scenario is specific to Epoexpression.Our experiments also support the idea that the hypoxia and dioxin response pathways can compete for limiting cellular factor(s) and that reciprocal cross-talk is probably occurring at certain loci within mammalian cells. Although we have used ARNT as an example of this limiting factor in model development, it is important to point out that we have not proven this to be the case. Although our attempts have been limited, our preliminary experiments to reduce this cross-talk by transfection of ARNT, yielded ambiguous results. Although we observed some degree of reduction, we also observed that the basal activities of each promoter increased, thus clouding any potential conclusions. An argument for the importance of limiting factors other than ARNT can be found in the recent observation that demonstrates that dioxin can also inhibit progesterone receptor signaling (29Kuil C.W. Brouwer A. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This may be an indication that the limiting factor(s) may also be shared with nuclear receptor signal transduction pathways. Although the candidates are many, it is tempting to speculate that competition for shared coactivators like SRC-1 may be important (30Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Finally, this “limiting cellular factor” may not be a single protein, but rather may be a composite of limiting levels of multiple factors.Interestingly, data from other investigators has demonstrated that dioxin signaling can be inhibited by activation of HIF1α even though inhibition of hypoxia signaling was not observed by dioxin (31Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. whitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5221-5231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar,32Gassmann M. Kvietikova I. Rolfs A. Wenger R.H. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Data from these earlier papers suggested that this unidirectional cross-talk might be related to the fact that HIF1α has a greater affinity for ARNT than the AHR. At first inspection, our gel shift experiments are in agreement with the idea that HIF1α has a greater affinity for ARNT than does the AHR. Nevertheless, it may be premature to compare the relative affinities of these two proteins since we do not know the fraction of the AHR that is activated in gel shift assays (or in any in vitro assays), nor do we know how long this species remains active. Thus, the increased binding of HIF1α for ARNT may be simply due to the fact that more HIF1α per unit time is in a receptive form to bind to ARNT, as compared with AHR in in vitro assays. Moreover, these earlier studies did not reveal that dioxin up-regulated EPO mRNA. This may be due to the use of a weaker agonist than dioxin, or to the fact that readily metabolized agonists do not exhibit their activity for the prolonged time periods as compared with dioxin (33Chen Y.H.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1α, or interleukin-1β caused a time-dependent increase in the steady-state MT1-MMP mRNA levels within 4 h of exposure, peaking about 4-fold by 6 h, and remaining elevated for 12 h. Increased MT1-MMP mRNA correlated with a 2.5-fold increase in MT1-MMP protein in EC membranes. Ox-LDL also increased MT1-MMP mRNA levels that varied with the duration of exposure and degree of LDL oxidation. The increase in MT1-MMP mRNA occurred within 6 h of exposure to Ox-LDL and peaked over 3-fold by 6 h. Ox-LDL, but not native LDL, increased MT1-MMP protein by 2-fold in EC membranes. A combination of TNF-α and Ox-LDL was additive in increasing MT1-MMP expression. Nuclear run-on assays showed that TNF-α or Ox-LDL augmented steady-state mRNA levels by increased transcription of the MT1-MMP gene.

Indeed, accumulating evidence indicates that matrix degradation mediated by locally produced MMPs may contribute to the genesis and progression of atherosclerotic lesions (4Henney A.M. Wakeley P.R.

Matrix metalloproteinases require activation from a latent zymogen form to attain their enzymatic activity. Cultured EC constitutively secrete precursor MMP-2 (8Hanemaajer R. Koolwijk P. Le Clercq L. De Vree W.J.A. Van Hinsberg V.W.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which when activated can participate in the degradation of interstitial collagen, an important constituent of the vascular extracellular matrix. Collagenolysis by endothelial cells may contribute to infiltration of inflammatory cells and angiogenesis during evolution of the atherosclerotic plaque. Importantly, MMP-2 (also known as collagenase IV) can degrade type IV collagen, an important component of the basement membrane to which endothelial cells attach. The mechanism underlying the activation of MMP-2 remains uncertain. The recently discovered MT1-MMP (9Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 37: 61-65Crossref Scopus (2373) Google Scholar) seems an important candidate because it can activate latent MMP-2 in vitro. In addition, as a membrane-bound rather than -soluble molecule, MT1-MMP might participate in activation of precursor MMP-2 in a localized manner. EC covering atherosclerotic lesions are exposed to both inflammatory cytokines and oxidized low density lipoproteins (10Tipping P.G. Hancock W.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1721-1728PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yla-Hertualla S. Palinski W. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthsarsthy S. Carew T.E. Butler S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the nature and regulation of the factor(s) that promote activation of MMP-2 from its precursor, this study investigated whether cytokines and Ox-LDL regulate expression of MT1-MMP by cultured vascular EC and whether they endow EC with the capacity to activate pro-MMP-2. All tissue culture medium and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Human cytokines TNF-α and interleukin-1α or interleukin-1β were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) or provided by Hoffmann-La Roche. Purified human native and oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) were kindly provided by Dr. Judith Berliner (UCLA). The endothelial cell marker von Willebrand factor antibody was purchased from Dako (Carpenteria, CA). Nylon transfer membranes were purchased from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD). Radioisotopes were purchased either from NEN Life Science Products or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Purified mouse monoclonal antibodies to human MT1-MMP were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). The peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Goat IgG used to block unspecific binding in the flow cytometric analysis was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse goat IgG was purchased from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Human EC (HSVEC) were harvested enzymatically from saphenous vein using type II collagenase as described (12Libby P. Ordovas J. Auger K. Robbins A. Birinyi L. Dinarello C. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 124: 179-185PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Medium 199 containing 20 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor, 5 mm glutamine, 5% fetal calf serum, and an antibiotic mixture of penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (1.25 μg/ml). Primary cultures of human aortic EC were kindly provided to us by Dr. Mahamad Navab (Division of Cardiology, UCLA). The isolation and characterization of human aortic EC were previously described (13Navab M. Hough G.P. Stevenson L.W. Drinkwater D.C. Laks H. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). EC were routinely characterized by phase contrast microscopy (Zeiss ICM 405, × 40 objective) and expression of von Willebrand factor antigen (12Libby P. Ordovas J. Auger K. Robbins A. Birinyi L. Dinarello C. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 124: 179-185PubMed Google Scholar). EC within three passages were used throughout the experiments. Cells were studied at confluence in all treatment conditions. Cellular viability was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion. Treatment of EC with cytokines was performed essentially as described (14Peng H.-B. Rajavashisth T.B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Preparation and treatment of Ox-LDL were performed essentially as described (14Peng H.-B.

The amount of Ox-LDL to which EC were exposed in certain experiments was reduced from 100 to 50 μg/ml when treating EC for 24 h to avoid toxicity to the cells. All reagents in our tissue culture studies were verified for the absence of endotoxin by a commercially available assay kit (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) that has a sensitivity detection level of 1 pg/ml. The final concentration of endotoxin in lipoprotein preparations was less than 20 pg/ml of the culture medium used. Two primers (MT-2, TCGATGGTGAGGGCGGCTTCCTGGCCCATGC (nucleotides 686–716); MT-3, GCTCGAGCCCCAGGGCATGGCCCAGCTCGTG (nucleotides 826–856)), each 31 nucleotides long, were synthesized corresponding to the published cDNA sequence of human MT1-MMP (9Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 37: 61-65Crossref Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify a 171-nucleotide-long cDNA sequence using total RNA prepared from EC as substrate (16Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Application. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar). A diagnostic restriction enzyme digestion was performed. The amplified product was subcloned in pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced by following standard sequencing protocol (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total cellular RNA was isolated by lysis of EC in guanidinium isothiocyanate, phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (18Chomzynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each RNA preparation (20 μg) was denatured and electrophoresed through a 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel followed by blotting onto nylon filters and ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking. Filters were hybridized with isolated and radiolabeled MT1-MMP-specific cDNA probe (19Rajavashisth T.B. Eng R. Shadduck R.K. Waheed A. Ben-Avram C.M. Shively J.E. Lusis A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). The blots were washed, autoradiographed, and then rehybridized with either tubulin or actin cDNA probe as an internal control. Quantitative results of the assays were obtained by densitometry of autoradiograms. The linearized plasmids containing human MT1-MMP or β-actin cDNA (0.5 μg, 0.2 pm) were used as template to synthesize radiolabeled antisense MT1-MMP and β-actin sequences using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, template DNA was incubated in a total volume of 10 μl containing 1× transcription buffer. Radiolabeled probes corresponding to MT1-MMP and β-actin were gel-purified and used in the ribonuclease protection assays. Hybridization of probes to 10 μg of total RNA, prepared from unstimulated EC or EC stimulated with cytokines or Ox-LDL, was performed essentially as described in the ribonuclease protection manual of Ambion, Inc. RNase digestion of hybridized probe was carried out using a mixture of RNase A and RNase T1. Protected fragments were ethanol-precipitated and recovered by centrifugation. Pellets were dissolved in gel loading buffer and electrophoresed through a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Quantitative results of the assays were obtained by densitometry of autoradiograms. The nuclear run-on transcription assays were performed according to a published procedure (21Marzluff W.F. Huang R.C.C. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 89-129Google Scholar). Nuclei from untreated and cytokine or Ox-LDL-treated cells were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 0.15 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 units RNAsin (Promega, Madison, WI) supplemented with 0.5 mm each of CTP, ATP, and GTP and 0.250 mCi of α-[32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products). Radiolabeled nuclear RNA was purified by DNase I and proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Relative amounts of incorporation of label into specific RNAs were estimated by DNA-excess filter hybridization. Linearized and denatured plasmids carrying human MT1-MMP and β-tubulin DNAs and their corresponding vectors were slot-blotted onto nylon filters. Filters were probed with an equal amount of radiolabeled RNA probes as described (15Berliner J.A. Territo M.C. Sevanian A. Ramin J. Kim J.A. Bombshad B. Esterson M. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 19Rajavashisth T.B. Eng R. Shadduck R.K. Waheed A. Ben-Avram C.M. Shively J.E. Lusis A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The blots were washed and autoradiographed. Quantitative results of the assays were obtained both by counting of individual hybridized slots and densitometry of autoradiograms. Extracts of partially purified plasma membrane fractions of EC treated with TNF-α and/or Ox-LDL were isolated as described (22Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Proteins of EC membranes (50 μg) and known molecular weight markers were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto Western polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated overnight at 4 °C with blocking solution (5% skimmed milk in PBS). Affinity-purified mouse monoclonal antibodies (10 μg of IgG/ml) to human MT1-MMP were incubated with the blots overnight at 4 °C in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). The blots were washed twice with PBS buffer and then treated with rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:4000 dilution) coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Immunodetection was accomplished using the Enhance Chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) HSVEC grown in absence or presence of TNF-α and/or Ox-LDL were harvested by treating the culture with Hanks' solution containing 3 mm EDTA for 30 min on ice and then scraping the cells from the wells. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and incubated with 20 μg of goat IgG in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide on ice for 15 min. Primary mouse monoclonal antibodies to human MT1-MMP were added to cells, 0.5 μg/sample, to a total volume of 50 μl and incubated on ice for 30 min. After two washes with PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.1% sodium azide, cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min on ice. After two more washes, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Analysis was performed using FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cell populations were gated according to forward and side scattering. The immunoprecipitation of the MT1-MMP was performed in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a standard protocol as described previously (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). Equal amounts of extracts of partially purified plasma membrane fractions of EC untreated or treated with TNF-α, interleukin-1β, or Ox-LDL were incubated with the purified monoclonal antibodies to either human MT1-MMP or membrane associated human c-FMS protein. Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with protein G- and protein A-coupled agarose beads (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) by centrifugation. Equal amounts of the supernatants were added to culture media harvested from human smooth muscle cells containing pro-MMP-2 and assayed for gelatinolytic activity essentially as described by Galiset al. (24Galis Z.S. Muszynski M. Sukhova G.K. Simon-Morrissey E. Unemori E.N. Lark M.W. Amento E. Libby P. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoresed in the presence of SDS in discontinuous 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (Novex, San Diego, CA). Gels were processed to renature the protein by exchanging SDS to Triton X-100 (two changes of 2.5% Triton X-100 for a total of 30 min). Gels were subsequently incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.05% Brij 3 and stained with Colloidal Brilliant Blue G (Sigma) followed by destaining in 5% methanol and 7% acetic acid. Intensities of experimental bands from the RNA and protein assays were measured by computer-assisted densitometry. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test to determine the significance of change in the densitometric measurements. A significance difference was considered for p values equal to or less than 0.05. To assess whether EC express MT1-MMP mRNA or a related sequence, we performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on total RNA prepared from cultured but unstimulated EC using a primer set designed on the basis of the human MT1-MMP sequence published by Sato et al.(9Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 37: 61-65Crossref Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction product of the expected size (171 base pairs) was identified and cloned into the pCRII vector. The DNA sequence of the amplified fragment revealed a complete identity to the human MT1-MMP cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession numberD26512) and showed homologies to other published MT-MMP cDNA sequences (25Takino T.

Northern blotting assays using this cloned cDNA fragment as a probe showed that EC contain a single mRNA species of 4.5 kb (Figs. 1 and2), a size similar to that of MT1-MMP mRNA observed in normal lung tissue and tumor cells.Figure 2A, RNase protection assays showing the time-dependent effects of TNF-α on the induction of MT1-MMP mRNA.

Results represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate RNase protection assays. *, p < 0.05 compared with untreated control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Northern analyses and RNase protection assays revealed that exposure of cultured EC to TNF-α, interleukin-1, or Ox-LDL results in the accumulation of MT1-MMP mRNA (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Both cytokines and Ox-LDL caused a time-dependent progressive increase in the steady state levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in stimulated EC (Figs. 2 and 4). MT1-MMP mRNA levels increased within 4 h of exposure to TNF-α, reached a peak level of about 4-fold above control by 6 h, and remained elevated for at least 12 h (Fig. 2, A and B). The effect of Ox-LDL on the levels of MT1-MMP mRNA depended on the degree of LDL oxidation as measured by presence of the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Ox-LDL with TBARS ranging from 2.6 to 13.4 nmol/mg of LDL protein caused increase in steady-state MT1-MMP mRNA levels as compared with native LDL (TBARS = 0.2 nmol/mg). Ox-LDL with higher TBARS up to 24.2 nmol/mg LDL protein also increased the levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in EC, although to a lesser extent than Ox-LDL with 7.3 TBARS (Fig. 3 B). The time course for the induction of MT1-MMP mRNA in response to Ox-LDL appeared similar to TNF-α. MT1-MMP mRNA levels increased and peaked at 6 h of exposure and remained elevated for at least 24 h (Fig. 4, A andB). Treatment of EC for 8 h with a combination of TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and Ox-LDL (100 μg/ml) increased the levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in an additive manner (data not shown).Figure 4A, RNase protection assays showing the time-dependent effects of Ox-LDL on the induction of MT1-MMP mRNA.

Results represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate RNase protection assays. *, p < 0.05 compared with untreated control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Increased levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in TNF-α or Ox-LDL-stimulated EC could result from enhanced transcription and RNA processing or reduced degradation. To examine whether an increase in steady state levels of MT1-MMP mRNA in response to TNF-α or Ox-LDL was associated with the increased rate of MT1-MMP gene transcription, we performed run-on assays on isolated nuclei. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the basal level of MT1-MMP gene transcription in EC increased about 2–3-fold when cells were stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml). Ox-LDL (100 μg/ml, TBARS = 7.3 nmol/mg) also caused about similar increase in the rate of MT1-MMP gene transcription (Fig. 5 B). The transcription of β-tubulin, a constitutively expressed cytoskeletal protein gene, remained unchanged in response to either TNF-α or Ox-LDL. To determine whether the mRNA levels corresponded to the amount of translated MT1-MMP protein and to assess whether this protein was membrane-bound, we performed immunoblot analysis on the protein lysates of the plasma membrane extracts of EC stimulated with TNF-α and/or Ox-LDL. TNF-α-mediated increase in MT1-MMP mRNA correlated with a 2.5-fold increase in MT1-MMP protein levels in EC membranes (Fig.6 A). Treatment of cells with Ox-LDL also increased (2.0-fold) the levels of MT1-MMP proteins in EC membranes. The levels of MT1-MMP immunoreactive protein were increased about 3.1-fold in EC treated with a combination of TNF-α and Ox-LDL (Fig. 6 A). To establish that HSVEC expressed membrane-anchored immunoreactive MT1-MMP protein, we performed flow cytometric analysis on the HSVEC grown in the absence and presence of TNF-α and/or Ox-LDL. HSVEC expressed constitutively a membrane-associated protein that reacted with human MT1-MMP-specific antibody. In untreated cells, 60% of the population showed binding of the primary MT1-MMP antibody (data not shown). The background level, as determined when no primary antibody was included, had 2% of cells positive. Stimulation of EC with TNF-α and/or Ox-LDL for 24 h increased the number of MT1-MMP-bearing cells to about 1.8-fold (Ox-LDL), 1.7-fold (TNF-α), or 2.5-fold (TNF-α and Ox-LDL together) as compared with unstimulated cells (Fig.6 B). To examine whether increased levels of MT1-MMP mRNA and immunoreactive protein correspond to augmented enzymatic activity, we analyzed plasma membrane extracts of EC stimulated with TNF-α, interleukin-1β, or Ox-LDL by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gelatin zymography. Incubation of medium conditioned by human smooth muscle cells that contained pro-MMP-2, with plasma membrane extracts prepared from EC treated with TNF-α, interleukin-1β, or Ox-LDL, increased the proteolytic conversion of 72-kDa pro-MMP-2 to new gelatinolytic bands of 70- and 68-kDa corresponding to the processed active MMP-2 (Fig.7 A). Purified mouse monoclonal antibody to human MT1-MMP immunoprecipitated a 64-kDa protein of the size of MT1-MMP (not shown). Proteolytic processing of pro-MMP-2 was reduced in membrane extracts incubated with anti-MT1-MMP antibody (Fig.7 A and B). This study showed that cultured human EC constitutively express MT1-MMP, a membrane-anchored MMP that activates the zymogen form of MMP-2. We found that exposure of EC to Ox-LDL appreciably increases the steady-state levels of MT1-MMP mRNA.

Our reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction fragment corresponds to MT1-MMP, and the affinity-purified anti-MT1-MMP antibody specifically blocked a substantial portion of the membrane-associated proteolytic activity that catalyzed the conversion of 72-kDa pro-MMP-2 to MMP-2. Since MT1-MMP belongs to a family of enzymes containing at least four members, the residual activity that partially converts pro-MMP-2 to MMP-2 after immunodepletion of MT1-MMP in our assays may derive from other members of the family or from related enzymes present in endothelial membrane extracts.

Thus, increased expression of MT1-MMP can favor digestion of native interstitial collagens by MMP-13, continued degradation of partially degraded collagens due to gelatinase activity of MMP-2, and proteolysis of basement membrane collagen (type IV) and elastin by active MMP-2. The ability of endothelial cells to produce MT1-MMP, and hence activate the spectrum of proteases described above may have several important functional consequences in vascular pathophysiology, including angiogenesis, leukocyte transmigration, and plaque disruptions that cause thrombosis, the dreaded complication of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. Proteolysis plays an important role in migration of EC inside tissues during vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (40Hiraoka N. Allen E. Apel I.J. Gyetko M.R. Weiss S.J. Cell. 1998; 95: 365-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 41Sang Q.X. Cell. Res. 1998; 8: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Transmigration of leukocytes through the endothelium and subjacent basement membrane is a key process in normal host defenses, in inflammatory conditions, and in many vascular diseases including atherosclerosis (1Rajavashisth T.B. Loussararian A. Encycl. Hum. Biol. 1997; 1: 565-574Google Scholar, 2Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9989) Google Scholar, 42Springer T.A. Cybulsky M.I. Fuster V. Ross R. Topol E.J. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. 1. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 511Google Scholar). Activation of MMP-2 by endothelial MT1-MMP may promote these processes, since MMP-2 degrades basement membrane collagen type IV (29Libby P. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar, 39Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). In addition, active MMP-2 may promote local endothelial desquamation by lysing contacts with the basement membrane, causing superficial erosion of atherosclerotic plaques, now thought often to provoke coronary thrombosis and sudden death, particularly in women and diabetics (3Farb A. Burke A.P. Tang A.L. Liang Y. Mannan P. Smialek J. Virmani R. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar,43Kolodgie F.D. Luna R.E. Farb A. Burke A.P. Horiba K. Ferrans V.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Virmani R. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 31 (Abstr. 419): 1166-1168Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, areas of such superficial erosion of atheroma exhibit augmented expression of MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, which combine with MT1-MMP to form the active ternary complex (4Henney A.M. Wakeley P.R. Davies M.J. Foster K. Hembry T. Murphy G. Humphries S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Another common pathway of atherosclerotic plaque disruption and thrombosis involves rupture of the atheroma's cap which depends on interstitial collagen for its tensile strength (44Falk E. Shah P.K. Fuster V. Circulation. 1995; 92: 657-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). Activation of pro-MMP-13 by endothelial MT1-MMP may contribute to this mechanism of plaque disruption and consequent thrombosis. In conclusion, the ability of endothelial cells to express MT1-MMP and its augmented expression in response to pathobiologically relevant stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines and Ox-LDL highlight a novel proteolytic pathway. This mechanism may contribute to normal host defenses and to important pathological conditions including atherosclerosis. We thank Drs.

We have examined the mechanism and functional consequences of dual Gs/Gi protein coupling of the β3-adrenergic receptor (β3AR) in 3T3-F442A adipocytes. The β3AR selective agonist disodium (R,R)-5-[2[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]propyl]-1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate (CL316,243) stimulated a dose-dependent increase in cAMP production in adipocyte plasma membrane preparations, and pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin resulted in a further 2-fold increase in cAMP production by CL316,243. CL316,243 (5 μm) stimulated the incorporation of 8-azido-[32P]GTP into Gαs (1.57 ± 0.12; n = 3) and Gαi (1.68 ± 0.13;n = 4) in adipocyte plasma membranes, directly demonstrating that β3AR stimulation results in Gi-GTP exchange. The β3AR-stimulated increase in 8-azido-[32P]GTP labeling of Gαi was equivalent to that obtained with the A1-adenosine receptor agonist N 6-cyclopentyladenosine (1.56 ± 0.07; n = 4), whereas inclusion of unlabeled GTP (100 μm) eliminated all binding. Stimulation of the β3AR in 3T3-F442A adipocytes led to a 2–3-fold activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, as measured by extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (PTX) eliminated MAP kinase activation by β3AR, demonstrating that this response required receptor coupling to Gi. Expression of the human β3AR in HEK-293 cells reconstituted the PTX-sensitive stimulation of MAP kinase, demonstrating that this phenomenon is not exclusive to adipocytes or to the rodent β3AR. ERK1/2 activation by the β3AR was insensitive to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H-89 but was abolished by genistein and AG1478. These data indicate that constitutive β3AR coupling to Gi proteins serves both to restrain Gs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase and to initiate additional signal transduction pathways, including the ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade.

Schlegel W. Lin M. Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8927-8931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) made the observation that there was an unusual, biphasic stimulation of cAMP production in adipocytes in response to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Depending upon the concentration of GTP in the assay, isoproterenol could either stimulate or inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in adipocyte plasma membranes. Murayama and Ui (2Murayama T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3319-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that this inhibitory phase could be relieved by pretreatment of adipocytes with pertussis toxin (PTX).1This curious observation lay fallow until studied later in greater detail by Bégin-Heick (3Bégin-Heick N.

However, it was not until the cloning and characterization of the β3AR gene and the development of selective β3AR agonists (6Arch J.R.S. Ainsworth A.T. Cawthorne M.A. Piercy V. Sennitt M.V. Thody V.E. Wilson C. Wilson S. Nature. 1984; 309: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 7Bloom J.D. Dutia M.D. Johnson B.D. Wissner A. Burns M.G. Largis E.E. Dolan J.A. Claus T.H. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3081-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) that it was postulated that this novel adipocyte-specific βAR may be responsible for the biphasic adenylyl cyclase response in adipocytes (8Begin-Heick N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have previously noted that despite the relatively high level of expression of the β3AR in adipocytes, the efficiency of coupling of the β3AR to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase is low (9Collins S. Daniel K.W. Rohlfs E.M. Ramkumar V. Taylor I.L. Gettys T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 518-527PubMed Google Scholar). However, there has been no clear biochemical demonstration of physical coupling of the β3AR to Gi, other than comparative functional experiments in the presence or absence of PTX (10Chaudhry A. MacKenzie R.G. Georgic L.M. Granneman J.G. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), nor has there been any indication of what additional second messenger pathway may be activated as a consequence of this putative coupling of β3AR to Gi. Recently, many G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to mediate cellular growth or differentiation responses through the activation of MAP kinase cascades (11Van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Receptors signaling via PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins, as well as PTX-insensitive Gq/11proteins may activate the ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade through a mechanism involving tyrosine protein phosphorylation and the activation of the low molecular weight G protein p21 ras (12Koch W. Hawes B. Allen L. Lefkowitz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 13van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Kreuger K.M. Touhara K.

Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Little is known about the potential role of βARs in the regulation of the MAP kinase pathway. Recently, we have found that in fibroblasts the β2AR mediates Ras-dependent ERK1/2 activation through its ability to couple to a PTX-sensitive Gi protein (15Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). β2AR coupling to Gi occurs as a result of PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor, which effectively “switches” receptor coupling from Gs to Gi proteins. In contrast, β2AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation in S49 lymphoma cells is an entirely Gs-dependent process (16Wan Y. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14533-14537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this system, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the low molecular weight GTPase, Rap1, promotes Ras-independent ERK1/2 activation; this process was shown to be independent of β2AR interaction with Gi/oproteins. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether there is a common mechanism by which βARs activate MAP kinase. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of the β3AR in adipocytes induces the direct activation of both Gs and Gi. In these cells, Gi activation results in both the attenuation of β3AR-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and the activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway. Unlike the β2AR signal in fibroblasts, β3AR activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is independent of cAMP and PKA. These data suggest that the promiscuous coupling of the β3AR in adipocytes permits the simultaneous transduction of two independent signaling pathways. This property of the β3AR may be responsible, in part, for the unique physiological effects of selective β3AR agonists in vivo, such as their potency for stimulating lipolysis (17Hollenga C.

HEK-293 cells were grown in six-well dishes and transfected with 1.2 μg of pBCβ3 or pBCβ2 DNA (24Liggett S. Freedman N.J. Schwinn D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ten h later, cells were washed in 1 mm EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in growth medium for 24 h. The cells were then serum-starved for 24 h and treated with PTX (100 ng/ml), propranolol (10 μm), SR59230A (25 μm), CL316,243 (10 μm), or isoproterenol (100 μm), and MAP kinase assays were performed as described below. Cells that were pretreated with PTX were incubated with the toxin for 16–20 h at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Plasma membranes were prepared from 3T3-F442A adipocytes or Sprague-Dawley epididymal white adipose tissue as follows. For cultured cells, the monolayers were gently rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Lysis buffer (5 mm Tris/2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, containing 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added, and the cells were released from the dish with a rubber policeman. Following gentle disruption with a glass/Teflon homogenizer, nuclei were removed by centrifuging for 5 min at 800 × g. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in fresh lysis buffer with a Teflon pestle, centrifuged again, and then resuspended in a small volume of lysis buffer. For rat adipocytes obtained from epididymal adipose tissue, the same procedure was followed except that first the tissue was finely minced, and adipocytes were isolated by incubating the tissue pieces with collagenase (Worthington) (26Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity in plasma membranes was measured as described previously (9Collins S. Daniel K.W. Rohlfs E.M. Ramkumar V. Taylor I.L. Gettys T.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 518-527PubMed Google Scholar). Control incubations in the absence or presence of isobutylmethylxanthine (0.25 mm) found no evidence of particulate cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity in these plasma membranes. In some experiments, cAMP production was measured in intact 3T3-F442A adipocytes. For these whole cell assays, growth media was replaced with serum-free medium 3 h prior to stimulation. The serum-free medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 g/liter fraction V bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Then cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of β-agonist in fresh serum-free medium for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.25 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. Reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and particulate material was removed by centrifugation. The cAMP concentrations from both assay methods were determined by radioimmunoassay using a polyclonal antiserum to iodinated cAMP (27Harper J.F. Brooker G. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 1: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed with antibodies specific for individual Gα subunits. Adipocyte membranes (30 μg of protein) were solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and resolved on 4–20% Novex gradient gels (San Diego, CA). A recombinant G protein standard mix containing Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαo was included as a positive control (gift of Dr. Pat Casey). The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with rabbit anti-Gαi1+2, anti-Gαi3, or anti-Gαs, 1:1000 dilution, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antisera (1:10,000 dilution, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Synthesis and purification of the 8-azido-[32P]GTP was performed as described (29Pfeuffer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7224-7234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schafer R. Christian A.L. Schulz I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6877-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For some experiments, 8-azido-[32P]GTP was purchased from Andotek Life Sciences. The photoaffinity labeling procedure of Offermanns (32Offermanns S. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was followed with modifications (31Fields T.A. Linder M.E. Casey P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6877-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For labeling of the Gαi subunits, adipocyte membranes (50 μg of protein) were incubated with 8-azido-[32P]GTP (0.5 μCi) for 10 min at 30 °C in a volume of 60 μl containing 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 500 μm MgCl2, 50 μm GDP, 100 μm ATP, and 1 μg/ml adenosine deaminase in the presence or absence of the adenosine A1 receptor agonistN 6-cyclopentyladenosine or the β3AR-selective agonist CL316,243. Labeling of the Gαs subunit was performed as above at a free Mg2+ concentration of 2–5 mm. The binding reactions were stopped by placing tubes on ice, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The membranes were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 500 μmMgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Following irradiation of the samples with a UV lamp (4 watts, 254 nm) at a distance of 3 cm for 5 min, the samples were collected by centrifugation as before and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins labeled with 8-azido-[32P]GTP were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Activation of MAP kinase was determined by measuring the phosphorylation state of ERK 1 and ERK 2 (33Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). For this assay, 3T3-F442A cells were grown and differentiated in six-well culture plates and serum-starved for 24 h prior to stimulation with β-adrenergic agonists or growth factors. The serum-free medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 g/liter fraction V bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Five min after the addition of β-agonists or growth factors, the medium was removed, and the cells were solubilized by the direct addition of Laemmli sample buffer (34Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). These cell lysates were sonicated for 5 s, and aliquots (30 μg protein/lane) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected by protein immunoblotting using a 1:3000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal phospho-MAP kinase-specific antisera (NEBiolabs) with a 1:10,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antisera (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as secondary antibody. Quantitation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was performed using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). After quantitation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped of immunoglobulin and reprobed using rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK 2 IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) to confirm equal amounts of ERK 2 protein. Stimulation of 3T3-F442A adipocyte plasma membranes with the selective β3AR agonist CL316,243 resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in adenylyl cyclase activity Fig.1 A). Membranes prepared from cells pretreated with PTX exhibited a more robust increase in cAMP production, which was at least 2-fold above that observed in membranes from naive cells. Whereas basal levels of cAMP generation were elevated following PTX treatment, the effect of PTX on the -fold activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin was minimal (Fig. 1 B). We obtained similar results from Chinese hamster ovary cells, which heterologously express the mouse β3AR (data not shown) (35Nahmias C. Blin N. Elalouf J.-M. Mattei M.G. Strosberg A.D. Emorine L.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3721-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the β3AR is constitutively coupled to both Gs and Gi, because inhibition of Gi function leads to increased tonic production of cAMP. Rat white adipocytes have been shown to contain the two splice variants of Gαs and the three isoforms of Gαi(αi1, αi2, αi3) (5Begin-Heick N. Biochem.

As shown in Fig. 2, 3T3-F442A adipocytes express the same repertoire of G proteins as found in rat white adipocytes: two splice variants of Gαs, Gαi3, and Gαi1/Gαi2.

To determine whether the PTX effects on cAMP production resulted from constitutive coupling of the β3AR to both Gs and Gi, the photolabile GTP analog 8-azido-[32P]GTP was used to measure β3AR agonist-dependent GTP loading of Gαs and Gαi. This method has been used by several investigators to demonstrate physical coupling between G protein-coupled receptors and individual G protein α subunits, based upon several well defined criteria for receptor-G protein interaction (40Wange R.L.

Because the binding of GTP analogs to Gα subunits is highly dependent upon free magnesium concentrations (31Fields T.A. Linder M.E. Casey P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6877-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we conducted our experiments in adipocyte plasma membranes under separate conditions favorable for 8-azido-[32P]GTP labeling of each Gα family. Because the β3AR is coupled to Gαsand activation of adenylyl cyclase, Fig.3 A shows that under high magnesium conditions, which favor receptor-stimulated GTP loading of Gαs, CL316,243 could stimulate specific 8-azido-[32P]GTP labeling of Gαs (1.57 ± 0.12; n = 3; p < 0.001). Under low magnesium conditions, which are optimal for determining receptor-stimulated GTP loading to Gαi, there was a similar 1.68 ± 0.13-fold increase (n = 4;p < 0.001) in specific 8-azido-[32P]GT G protein labeling of the 40–42-kDa Gαi species (Fig.3 B). We obtained similar data from 3T3-F442A membranes (not shown). Fig. 3 B also shows that the ability of CL316,243 to stimulate Gi-GTP exchange in adipocyte membranes was equivalent to that obtained with the A1-adenosine receptor agonist N 6-cyclopentyladenosine (1.56 ± 0.07; n = 4; p < 0.001).N 6-Cyclopentyladenosine served as a positive control because the A1-adenosine receptor is expressed in both primary adipocytes (43Vannucci S.J.

Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Recently, Daaka and colleagues (15Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) reported that the β2AR could couple to both Gαs and Gαi, with consequent activation of MAP kinase. We therefore determined whether one of the functional consequences of the coupling of the β3AR to Gαi in 3T3-F442A adipocytes was the stimulation of MAP kinase. Intact 3T3-F442A adipocytes treated with CL316,243 (5 μm) exhibited approximately a 2.5-fold stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Activation of the endogenous β2AR in 3T3-F442A adipocytes with the β2AR-selective agonist salbutamol also yielded a similar 2-fold stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Both βAR responses were less robust than that observed following activation of endogenous receptors for EGF, consistent with previous findings (13van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Kreuger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Also shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of 3T3-F442A adipocytes with PTX completely blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to either β2AR or β3AR stimulation, but it did not affect stimulation by EGF. The addition of propranolol (0.1 μm) eliminated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to salbutamol but had no effect on the activation of MAP kinase induced by CL316,243 (not shown), consistent with a CL-mediated effect exclusively through the β3AR (7Bloom J.D. Dutia M.D. Johnson B.D. Wissner A. Burns M.G. Largis E.E. Dolan J.A. Claus T.H. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3081-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The relative sensitivity of the β3AR to activate MAP kinase versus cAMP accumulation in adipocytes was assessed by treating intact cells with increasing concentrations of CL316,243 (Fig. 5). Because the MAP kinase assays involve the stimulation of intact cells, we included cAMP dose-response data also from intact cells. The EC50 for cAMP production in these experiments was 12 nm, whereas parallel measurements of MAP kinase activation (EC50 = 280 nm) indicated that the PTX-sensitive coupling of the β3AR to MAP kinase activation is less potent under these conditions. Nevertheless, the dose-response curves for both measurements yielded a unit slope, indicative of the high selectivity of CL316,243 for the β3AR (7Bloom J.D. Dutia M.D. Johnson B.D. Wissner A. Burns M.G. Largis E.E. Dolan J.A. Claus T.H. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3081-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 48Rohlfs E.M. Daniel K.W. Premont R.T. Kozak L.P. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10723-10732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Note that the EC50 for cAMP production in these whole cell experiments is significantly less than that found in plasma membranes (Fig. 1). However, it is generally recognized that dose-response curves as well as ligand binding data from intact cells are shifted “to the left,” when compared with data obtained using isolated membrane preparations (49Pittman R.N. Molinoff P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 398-408PubMed Google Scholar, 50Clark R.B. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1986; 20: 151-209PubMed Google Scholar). These comparative studies shown in Fig. 5 suggest that cAMP production is the favored pathway in response to activation of the β3AR in adipocytes. It must be remembered, however, that the catalytic activity of the subsequent kinases and their juxtaposition to substrate targets will ultimately determine the relative importance of these two pathways. Future studies will address these issues. To determine whether the dual Gs/Gi coupling of the β3AR and activation of MAP kinase was an adipocyte-specific event or a unique feature of the rodent β3AR, we attempted to reconstruct these effects by transiently transfecting the human β3AR into HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, transient transfection of the hβ3AR resulted in a low basal level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (lane 2), and stimulation with the β3AR agonist increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation ∼4-fold above basal level (lane 3), as compared with the 7–8-fold activation achieved by EGF (lane 7). There was no effect of the β3AR agonist on mock-transfected cells (lane 1). This activation of MAP kinase by the hβ3AR was completely blocked by the selective β3AR antagonist, SR59230A (lane 4) (51Manara L. Badone D. Baroni M. Boccardi G. Cecchi R. Croci T. Giudice A. Guzzi U. Landi M. Le Fur G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, the nonselective βAR agonist isoproterenol at a concentration capable of activating the β3AR (100 μm), in the presence of propranolol, also led to an ∼4-fold stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (lane 5). Finally, PTX completely eliminated MAP kinase activation (lane 6), as observed in 3T3-F442A adipocytes (Fig. 4). Together these data suggest that the dual coupling of the β3AR to Gs/Gi, along with its activation of MAP kinase, is a general property of this receptor. Mechanistically, β2AR-mediated MAP kinase activation in fibroblasts requires sequential receptor coupling to Gs and Gi, because cAMP-dependent, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR is a prerequisite for receptor-Gi coupling (15Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). To compare the role of cAMP and PKA in βAR-mediated MAP kinase activation in adipocytes, we compared the effects of the PKA inhibitor H-89 on β2AR- and β3AR-stimulated MAP kinase activation. As shown in Fig.6 B, H-89 blocked β2AR-stimulated MAP kinase activation (lane 8), consistent with the results of Daaka et al. (15Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). In contrast, the β3AR signal was insensitive to H-89 (lane 3). Fig. 6 B also shows that MAP kinase activation by the β3AR was sensitive to low micromolar concentrations of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (lane 4) and to the EGR receptor tyrphostin AG1478 (lane 5). These results indicate that, like other Gαi-coupled receptors, the β3AR employs a tyrosine kinase receptor in its mechanism of recruiting MAP kinase (52Gutkind J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 53Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In other experiments, treatment with dibutyryl cAMP enhanced β2AR-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation by ∼70%, consistent with the model of PKA-dependent β2AR-Gi coupling. However, stimulation of MAP kinase by the β3AR was unaffected by dibutyryl cAMP (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that MAP kinase activation via the β3AR, unlike the β2AR, is insensitive to modulation of the PKA pathway. Thus β3AR-mediated MAP kinase activation can be distinguished in several ways from the β2AR pathway. First, the β3AR is not a substrate for PKA (24Liggett S. Freedman N.J. Schwinn D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Second, the β3AR appears to be constitutively coupled to both Gs and Gi. Third, β3AR-stimulated activation of cAMP is not required for activation of the MAP kinase cascade in adipocytes. In contrast to the finding of PKA-dependent β2AR-mediated MAP kinase activation in S49 lymphoma cells (16Wan Y. Huang X.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14533-14537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the β3AR pathway in adipocytes is completely PTX-sensitive. One of the remarkable features of the β3AR is that treatment with β3AR-selective agonists in vivocan prevent or reverse obesity due to either congenital or diet-induced etiology (6Arch J.R.S.

These agents are also efficacious over prolonged periods of administration (21Collins S. Daniel K.W. Petro A.E. Surwit R.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), which is quite distinct from the rapid desensitization and down-regulation that is characteristic of chronic treatment with β1- and, particularly, β2AR-selective drugs (55Hausdorff W. Caron M. Lefkowitz R. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 56Premont R. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). These unique properties of the β3AR have been suggested to be related to the fact that β3AR is resistant to desensitization (57Nantel F. Bonin H. Emorine L.J. Ziberfarb V. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 548-555PubMed Google Scholar), because it is not a substrate for either PKA or the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (24Liggett S. Freedman N.J. Schwinn D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Instead, our finding that the β3AR is capable of activating both the PKA pathway and the MAP kinase cascade raises another possibility. The simultaneous recruitment of both signaling networks may result in a more potent stimulation of lipolysis and/or may promote the growth and differentiation of brown adipocytes, which is observed in all β3AR agonist-treated animals (20Himms-Hagen J.

C4A has higher affinities to amino group-containing targets; C4B has higher affinities to hydroxyl group-containing targets. These differences are the result of four amino acid changes between positions 1101 and 1106 (22Yu C.Y. Belt K.T. Giles C.M. Campbell R.D. Porter R.R.

A significant proportion of the population has a single C4gene in chromosome 6 coding for C4A or for C4B. Deletion or duplication of the C4 genes are always concurrent with their downstream genes, steroid 21-hydroxylase genes, CYP21A orCYP21B (25Carroll M.C. Palsdottir A. Belt K.T. Porter R.R.

RP2 is a partially duplicated gene segment that contains only 913 bp of the sequence corresponding to the last two and one-half exons of RP1. RP1 transcripts are ubiquitously expressed. Derived amino acid sequence suggested thatRP1 codes for a nuclear protein that is probably a serine/threonine kinase (27Yang Z. Shen L. Dangel A.W. Wu L.C. Yu C.Y.

The cytochrome P450 steroid 21-hydroxylase genes CYP21A orCYP21B are located 3028 bp downstream of C4A orC4B, respectively (17Yu C.Y. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1057-1066PubMed Google Scholar). CYP21 is essential for the biosynthesis of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones. The complete absence of CYP21 leads to salt wasting, low activity of CYP21 causes simple virilizing, and below average CYP21 activity causes androgen excess (reviewed in Ref. 4Miller W.L. Morel Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 371-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). CYP21A is a pseudogene, because it contains three deleterious mutations: an 8-bp deletion in exon 3 and a T nucleotide insertion in exon 7 that result in frameshift mutations as well as a C to T transition in exon 8 that generates a premature stop codon. In addition, there are many other point mutations in coding and noncoding sequences (33Higashi Y. Yoshioka H. Yamane M. Gotoh O. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

If on both copies of chromosome 6, the deleterious mutations in CYP21Aare incorporated into CYP21B or the CYP21B genes are deleted, the subject suffers CAH. The 3′-ends of CYP21A or CYP21B overlap with the 3′-ends of extracellular matrix protein tenascin TNXA orTNXB by 444 bp, respectively (36Morel Y. Bristow J. Gitelman S.E. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6582-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The gene configurations of TNXA and TNXB are opposite to those ofRP, C4, and CYP21. The TNXBgene is 68.2 kb in size, consists of 45 exons and encodes a protein of 4289 amino acids (38Bristow J. Tee M. Gitelman S. Mellon S. Miller W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). 2L. Rowen, C. Dankers, D. Baskin, J. Faust, C. Loretz, M. E. Ahearn, A. Banta, S. Schwartzell, T. M. Smith, T. Spies, and L.

The derived amino acid sequence of TNXB reveals a heptad, 18.5 epidermal growth factor repeats, 32 fibronectin type III repeats, and a fibrinogen domain. The overall structure of TNXB shows a striking similarity to extracellular matrix proteins tenascin/cytostatin (TN-C) and restrictin (TN-R) (39Matsumoto K. Arai M. Ishihara N. Ando A. Inoko H.

A. 1988; 85: 2186-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). TN-C is present in the central and peripheral nervous system and in smooth muscle and tendon. It is probably involved in cell adhesion and cell morphology (42Chiquet-Ehrishmann R. Kries T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-95Google Scholar). TN-R is expressed in the nervous system and implicated in neural cell attachment (43Rathjen F.G. Kries T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 87-88Google Scholar). The function of TNXB is yet to be determined. Its transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in the fetus (38Bristow J. Tee M. Gitelman S. Mellon S. Miller W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).TNXA is a partially duplicated gene segment that corresponds to intron 32 to exon 45 of TNXB. In addition, there is a 120-bp deletion at exon 36-intron 36 that results in a frameshift mutation and premature termination of translation (30Shen L.M. Wu L.C. Sanlioglu S. Chen R. Mendoza A.R.

Diagnostic RFLPs for RP1 and RP2, and, forTNXA and TNXB, have been devised.RP-C4-CYP21-TNX genes are organized in variable, modular fashions. The unusually frequent modular variation appears to be the root cause for unequal crossovers and exchange of sequences between the functional and nonfunctional genes of the RCCX. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by an Applied Biosystems model 380B DNA Synthesis machine. The sequences added to facilitate cloning are represented in lowercase type. For amplification and sequencing of TNX genes (38Bristow J. Tee M. Gitelman S. Mellon S. Miller W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) the following oligonucleotides were used: RDX-5, aga gAA TTC AGT GAA ATC AGG GAG ACC; RDX-3, gag gaa TTC CAG TGC AGC ACG GCG AA; SDX-52, GGA GCC TCA GAG TGT GCA; SDX-32, CAA TCG GAG CCT CCA CCA; XB54H, gtg gaa ttc AAG CGA GCA CCT GAC TCA; and XA31H, gtt gaa ttc TTT TCT TGA CTC CCA CCT G. For amplification of CYP21A probe (35Rodrigues N.R. Dunham I. Yu C.Y. Carroll M.C. Porter R.R. Campbell R.D.

Genomic DNAs were isolated following standard protocols from cultured cell lines HepG2 (liver carcinoma) and MOLT4 (T-cell leukemia), peripheral blood of normal individuals, and a congenital adrenal hyperplasia patient (CAH-E1). Appropriate consents from blood donors were obtained according to approved protocols by the Institutional Board of the Columbus Children's Hospital. Complement C4A and C4B allotypes from EDTA-blood plasma were determined as described in Refs. 44Awdeh Z.L. Alper C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3576-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar and 45Sim E. Cross S. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. Briefly, 10 μl of plasma was digested with 0.1 unit of neuraminidase (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight and with 0.1 unit of carboxypeptidase B (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min. Two agarose gels were prepared. Four μl of digested plasma was loaded to each agarose gel and resolved by high voltage gel electrophoresis (46Schneider P.M. Rittner C. Dodds A.W. Sim R.B. Complement: A Practical Approach. IRL Prss at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 165-198Google Scholar). One of the agarose gels was subjected to immunofixation using goat antiserum against human C4 (Incstar, Stillwater, MN). Plasma proteins in the other agarose gel were subjected to immunoblot analyses using anti-Ch1 or anti-Rg1 monoclonal antibodies (anti-C4B, catalog no. C057–325.2, lot no. 120287; anti-Rg1, RGd1; kindly provided by Dr. Joann M. Moulds, Houston, TX) at a dilution of 1:5000 and 1:1000, respectively. Immune complexes were detected by the chemiluminescence method using the ECL Plus reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HLA typing of the E family was kindly performed by The Ohio State University Tissue Typing Laboratory. PCR of cosmid and genomic DNA were performed following standard procedures (47Saiki R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D. Sninsky J. White T. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 13-20Google Scholar). PCR products were purified from 0.8% low gelling temperature agarose and cloned into pBluescript vectors. DNA probes used were as follows: forRP, RP1.1, a 1.1-kb insert of RP1cDNA (30Shen L.M. Wu L.C. Sanlioglu S. Chen R. Mendoza A.R. Dangel A. Carroll M.C. Zipf W. Yu C.Y. J. Biol.

Giles C.M. Campbell R.D. Porter R.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); forCYP21, a 757-bp fragment of CYP21A, amplified from cos 2 using primers 21A5 and 21A3 (a cosmid isolated from a human genomic library DA (49Yu C.Y. Wu L.-C. Buluwela L. Milstein C. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 378-398Google Scholar), cos 2 spans from the 5′ region of C4A1 gene to the 3′ region ofTNXB gene; the genomic DNA of cos 2 derives from the HLA haplotype A3 B47 DR7 that contains a deletion of theCYP21B gene); for TNX, a 600-bp fragment ofTNXB, corresponding to exons 35–37 of TNXB, amplified from cos 2 using primers RDX-5 and RDX-3. Ten μg of genomic DNA was digested to completion with the appropriate restriction enzymes for 16 h, resolved on an agarose gel, blotted onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with an appropriate [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe, as described in Ref. 50Yu C.Y. Campbell R.D. Immunogenetics. 1987; 25: 384-390Google Scholar. Sequencing reactions were performed using a Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) and [35S]ATP following the dideoxy sequencing method (51Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52511) Google Scholar), or by the automated sequencing method using an ABI 377 machine. DNA sequences were compiled using PC/Gene software (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, CA). Comparisons of the sequences were performed by FASTA, BESTFIT, PILEUP, and PRETTY programs in the GCG package through the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (52Genetics Computer Group GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package: Program Manual, Version 7. Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI1991Google Scholar). Allotyping of the plasma C4 proteins from the E family is shown in Fig.2 I. Phenotypically, E1 has C4A1, C4A3, and C4BQ0 (lane 1); E2 has C4A3 and C4BQ0 (lane 2); and E3 has C4A1, C4A3, and C4B1 (lane 3). Lane 4 shows a control plasma with C4A3 and C4B1. Immunoblot analyses revealed positive reactions of C4A1 in E1 (lane 1), C4A1 and C4B1 in E3 (lane 3), and C4B1 in the control plasma (lane 4) with anti-Ch1 monoclonal (panel II). Similarly, positive reactions were observed for the C4A3 allotype in E1, E2, E3, and a control plasma with the anti-Rg1 monoclonal (lanes 1–4,panel III). In separate experiments on family B (data not shown), C4 allotyping showed that B1 has C4AQ0, C4B1; B2 has C4A3, C4B1, C4BQ0; and B3 has C4A3, C4AQ0, C4B1. Immunoblot analyses showed that the C4A3 allotype reacted with anti-Rg1 and the C4B1 reacted with anti-Ch1. Whether the flanking genes RP (located 5′ to C4) andTNX (located 3′ to CYP21) are involved in theC4-CYP21 gene deletion events were investigated. Diagnostic RFLPs were devised to detect and distinguish the presence of theRP1 and RP2 as well as TNXA andTNXB. By using an RP1 3′ probe for hybridization, the RP1 gene can be represented by a 9.6-kb BamHI fragment, and the RP2 (and TNXA gene segments) can be represented by a 5.0-kb BamHI fragment. By using a 600-bp TNX probe corresponding to TNXB exons 35–37, the presence of the TNXB gene can be detected by a 9.0-kb ScaI fragment, and the TNXA gene can be detected by a 4.0-kb ScaI fragment (Fig.3 I). Previously, techniques were established for detecting the presence of the C4A andC4B genes by NlaIV RFLP, and their associations with Rg1 or Ch1 antigenic determinants by EcoO 109I RFLP (50Yu C.Y. Campbell R.D. Immunogenetics. 1987; 25: 384-390Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of CYP21A andCYP21B can be detected by the 3.2- and 3.7-kbTaqI fragments, respectively (34White P.C. New M.I. DuPont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5111-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 (panels II–IV) shows a series of Southern blot analysis of DNA samples isolated from two families, B and E. Members of the B family appear to be normal. For the E family, there is a CAH patient E1. As shown in Fig. 3 II, restriction fragments corresponding toRP1 (9.6-kb BamHI fragment) and RP2(5.0-kb BamHI fragment) were detected in all individuals except B1 and E1. In these two individuals, only theRP1-specific 9.6-kb fragment is present (lanes 1 and 5). The presence of the C4A or C4B gene was analyzed by NlaIV restriction patterns shown in in Fig.3 III (A). B1 contains the 467-bp fragment corresponding to C4B genes (lane 1). E1 and E2 have the 276- and 191-bp fragments specific forC4A genes (lanes 5 and 6). Other individuals contain fragments corresponding to bothC4A and C4B genes. The associations ofC4 genes with the major Chido (Ch1) and Rodgers (Rg1) antigens were revealed in Fig. 3 III (B) by theEcoO 109I restriction patterns. The C4B genes in B1 express the Ch1 antigen, since only the 458-bp fragment can be detected (lane 1). The C4A genes in E2 express the Rg1 epitope, since only the 565-bp fragment is present (lane 6). Both Rg1- and Ch1-specific fragments are present in E1 (lane 5). Therefore, one of theC4A genes (C4A1) in E1 expresses Ch1 (that is frequently associated with C4B), and the other C4A gene (C4A3) expresses Rg1. All other individuals contain both C4Aand C4B genes. These C4 genes express Rg1 and Ch1 because both 565- and 458-bp fragments were detectable. An additional 344-bp Eco0 109I fragment exists in all individuals, since the 926-bp C4d-specific probe (PB) was used. This fragment is common to C4 genes with Rg1 orCh1 (50Yu C.Y. Campbell R.D. Immunogenetics. 1987; 25: 384-390Google Scholar). The presence of CYP21A and CYP21B was determined by TaqI RFLP (Fig. 3 IV). Both CYP21A(3.2-kb fragment) and CYP21B (3.7-kb fragment) were detected in all samples except B1 and E1. B1 only contains the functionalCYP21B gene (lane 1), while the CAH patient E1 only contains the pseudogene CYP21A(lane 5). The presence of TNXA and TNXB genes are determined by ScaI RFLP (Fig. 3 V). Restriction fragments for both TNXA (4.0-kb ScaI fragment) and TNXB (9.0-kb ScaI fragment) were detected in all individuals except B1 and E1 (Fig. 3 II (B)). These two individuals have the 9.0-kb ScaI restriction fragment corresponding to TNXB but no 4.0-kb ScaI fragment corresponding to TNXA (lanes 1 and 5). From the above results, it becomes clear that individuals who have a single locus for RP also have single gene loci forC4, CYP21, and TNX. Individuals with both RP1 and RP2 loci also have duplicated loci for C4, CYP21, and TNX. Hence, the four tandemly arranged genes RP, C4,CYP21, and TNX are duplicated or deleted together as a discrete genetic unit. This genetic unit is designated as the RCCX module. TheTaqI RFLP is the most widely used technique to illustrate the complexities of polymorphisms in the number and size ofC4 genes. Four fragments of 7.0, 6.4, 6.0, and 5.4 kb in size can be detected by Southern blot analysis ofTaqI-digested genomic DNA hybridized to PA, aC4 5′ probe (26Schneider P.M. Carroll M.C. Alper C.A.

Immunogenetics. 1987; 25: 384-390Google Scholar, 53Simon S. Truedsson L. Marcus-Bagley D. Awdeh Z. Eisenbarth G.S. Brink S.J. Yunis E.J. Alper C.A. Hum. Immunol. 1997; 57: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). At the same time, all theseTaqI fragments can also be detected by an RP1.1 probe, suggesting that the TaqI RFLP is caused by bothRP and C4 gene variations. There is aBamHI site at the 5′-untranslated region of theC4A and C4B genes. To segregate theRP1/RP2 variation from the C4 long/short (L/S) size dichotomy, the BamHI–TaqI double digests of genomic DNA were performed (Fig.4 I). As shown in Fig.4 II, the single 6.4-kb TaqI fragment for B1 (Fig.4 II (A), lane 1) was split into a 3.1-kb TaqI–BamHI fragment corresponding to an RP1 gene (Fig. 4 II (B),lane 1) and a 3.2-kbBamHI–TaqI fragment corresponding to a shortC4 gene (Fig. 4 II (C), lane 1). The 7.0- and 6.0-kb TaqI fragments detected in HepG2 (Fig. 4 II (A), lane 2) were split into 3.1- and 2.1-kbTaqI–BamHI fragments corresponding toRP1 and RP2 genes (Fig. 4 II(B), lane 2) and a single 4.0-kbBamHI–TaqI fragment corresponding to longC4 genes (Fig. 4 II (C),lane 2). The 7.0- and 5.4-kb TaqI fragments detected in MOLT4 (Fig. 4 II (A),lane 3) were divided into the RP1-associated 3.1-kb TaqI–BamHI fragment and theRP2-associated 2.1-kb TaqI–BamHI fragment (Fig. 4 II (B), lane 3) and the 4.0- and 3.2-kb BamHI–TaqI fragments associated with long C4 genes and short C4 genes, respectively (Fig. 4 II (C), lane 3). Therefore, the restriction patterns of the TaqI genomic Southern blot for RP or C4 genes are resulted from a combination of variations of RP1 or RP2, one or two loci of C4 genes, and long or short C4genes.

https://openalex.org/W2094162221,"The uptake of cholesterol esters from high density lipoproteins (HDLs) is characterized by the initial movement of cholesterol esters into a reversible plasma membrane pool. Cholesterol esters are subsequently internalized to a nonreversible pool. Unlike the uptake of cholesterol from low density lipoproteins, cholesterol ester uptake from HDL does not involve the internalization and degradation of the particle and is therefore termed selective. The class B, type I scavenger receptor (SR-BI) has been identified as an HDL receptor and shown to mediate selective cholesterol ester uptake. SR-BI is localized to cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-rich microdomains called caveolae. Caveolae are directly involved in cholesterol trafficking. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that caveolae are acceptors for HDL-derived cholesterol ether (CE). Our studies demonstrate that in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing SR-BI, >80% of the plasma membrane associated CE is present in caveolae after 7.5 min of selective cholesterol ether uptake. We also show that excess, unlabeled HDL can extract the radiolabeled CE from caveolae, demonstrating that caveolae constitute a reversible plasma membrane pool of CE. Furthermore, 50% of the caveolae-associated CE can be chased into a nonreversible pool. We conclude that caveolae are acceptors for HDL-derived cholesterol ethers, and that caveolae constitute a reversible, plasma membrane pool of cholesterol ethers. The uptake of cholesterol esters from high density lipoproteins (HDLs) is characterized by the initial movement of cholesterol esters into a reversible plasma membrane pool. Cholesterol esters are subsequently internalized to a nonreversible pool.

The role of HDL in cholesterol metabolism includes the delivery of cholesterol esters to steroidogenic tissues (3Murphy B.D. Rajkumar K. McKibbin P.E. MacDonald G.J. Buhr M.M. Grinwich D.L.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse cholesterol transport requires the extraction of cholesterol from extrahepatic cells by HDL and the subsequent delivery of cholesterol esters to hepatocytes. The mechanism for the delivery of cholesterol esters from HDL to cells is described as selective uptake, because the uptake of cholesterol ester is independent of HDL internalization (7Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 8Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 744-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selective uptake of cholesterol ester from HDL is characterized by the initial movement of cholesterol ester into a reversible, plasma membrane pool and the subsequent internalization to a nonreversible, intracellular pool (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,10Rinninger F. Jaeckle S. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of cholesterol and cholesterol ester exchange between the cell surface and HDL are not well understood. Receptor-independent and receptor-dependent hypotheses have been proposed to explain the transfer of cholesterol and cholesterol ester between the cell surface and HDL (6Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the receptor-independent model, diffusion is thought to account for both the uptake of cholesterol esters and the efflux of free cholesterol. In contrast, HDL-binding proteins, such as class B, type I scavenger receptor (SR-BI) and class B, type II scavenger receptor, can mediate the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar, 12Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D.

SR-BI, appears to be a physiological HDL receptor. Several studies support this assertion. First, SR-BI binds HDL and mediates the selective uptake of cholesterol esters (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar, 13Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A.

Lodish H.F. Kreiger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, SR-BI mediates the efflux of cholesterol from cells to HDL (15Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. de la Llera-Moya M. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5599-5606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Third, the expression of SR-BI is greatest in tissues that selectively take up cholesterol esters from HDL, including liver, adrenal, testis, and ovary (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar, 14Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Kreiger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, overexpression of SR-BI in hepatic tissue causes a dramatic decline in plasma HDL and an increase in biliary cholesterol (17Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rogotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Finally, disruption of the SR-BI gene leads to an increase in plasma cholesterol concentrations in mice (18Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Kreiger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that SR-BI is an HDL receptor involved in cholesterol homeostasis. SR-BI has been localized to caveolae (13Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol.

Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar, 21Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenny J.R. Anderson R.G.W.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Caveolae appear to be directly involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Newly synthesized cholesterol translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to caveolae before diffusing into the bulk plasma membrane (23Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Caveolae mediate the efflux of free cholesterol derived either from de novo synthesis or low density lipoproteins (24Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In addition, caveola morphology is dependent on the presence of free cholesterol. Depletion of membrane cholesterol causes invaginated caveolae to flatten within the plane of the membrane (25Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2931-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar,26Smart E.J. Estes K. Anderson R.G.W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Caveolin is a cholesterol-binding protein associated with the caveola coat (21Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenny J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar, 27Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The subcellular distribution of caveolin is, in part, controlled by caveola cholesterol. Oxidation of caveola cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase causes caveolin to translocate to the ER (22Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Thus, both caveola proteins and morphology are dependent on cholesterol. SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of cholesterol esters from HDL and is localized to caveolae (13Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. de Villiers W.J.S. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15241-15248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Babitt J. Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. Xu S. Kreiger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that caveolae are acceptors for HDL-derived cholesterol ethers. We further speculated that caveolae constitute a reversible pool of cholesterol ethers within the plasma membrane. The present study demonstrates that caveolae are acceptors for HDL-derived cholesterol ethers, and that caveolae constitute a reversible plasma membrane pool of cholesterol ethers. Ham's F-12 medium, Geneticin (G418 sulfate), fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, trypsin-EDTA, penicillin-streptomycin, and OptiPrep were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc..

Tris-saline consisted of 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. ldlA-7 (a low density lipoprotein receptor-negative Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line) cells were generously provided by Dr. Monty Kreiger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). CHO lines were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The human SR-BI (hSR-BI) cDNA was cloned into the pCMV5 expression vector (28Andersson S. Davis D.N. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected into ldlA-7 cells with the MBS transfection kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Lines expressing hSR-BI were selected and maintained in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate. For the analysis of cell associated cholesterol ether (CE), cells were seeded (2.5 × 105 cells/well) in six-well plates on day 0. Cells were fed on day 1, and uptake into reversible and nonreversible pools was determined at confluence on day 2. For cell fractionation studies, cells were seeded (5 × 105cells/plate) in 10-cm dishes on day 0. Cells were confluent on days 4–5. HDL (d1.063–1.21 g/ml) was isolated from fresh human plasma by density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (29Strachan A.F. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Coetzee G.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The HDL3 subfraction (d 1.13–1.18 g/ml) was isolated from other HDL subfractions using a density gradient fractionator (ISCO). [1α,2α-3H]Cholesteryl-oleoyl ether was incorporated into HDL3 as described previously (30Gwynne J.T. Mahaffee D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8141-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of [3H]CE-HDL ranged from 32 to 35 dpm/ng of cholesterol. HDL3 apolipoproteins were iodinated by the iodine monochloride method (31Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 400–600 cpm/ng of protein. The selective uptake of cholesterol ether from HDL into cells was determined using nonhydrolyzable [3H]CE (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Confluent ldlA-7 and hSR-BI (ldlA-7 cells expressing hSR-BI) cells were rinsed twice with PBS (37 °C). Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% human lipoprotein-deficient serum and 10 μg/ml [3H]CE-HDL was added to the cells for the indicated times. After incubation, uptake was terminated by aspirating the medium and washing the cell monolayers four times with Tris-saline (4 °C). The cells were dissolved in 1m NaOH, and the amount of radiation was determined by scintillation counting. To determine the quantity of CE within the reversible plasma membrane pool, medium (efflux medium) containing 100 μg/ml unlabeled HDL was added for 120 min at 37 °C (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The efflux medium was collected, and [3H]CE was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Radiolabel present in the efflux medium was designated the reversible pool (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were then dissolved in 1N NaOH. Total cellular protein was determined by Bradford assay, and the radiolabel remaining was designated the nonreversible pool (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 125I-HDL binding experiments were conducted in the same manner as the uptake assays. To compare cell-associated 125I-HDL with [3H]CE-HDL, [3H]CE uptake was expressed as apparent HDL protein uptake, assuming that [3H]CE uptake resulted from whole HDL particle uptake as described by Knetch and Pittman (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cellular fractions were dissolved in 0.015% (w/v) deoxycholate, concentrated by precipitation with 7% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and washed in acetone (32Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Pellets were suspended in 1 × sample buffer plus 1.2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 95 °C for 5 min immediately before loading. Proteins were separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel at 50 mA (constant current) and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 50 V (constant voltage) for 2 h. Membranes were blocked with blotting buffer for 60 min at 22 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted in blotting buffer and incubated with blocked membranes for 60 min at 22 °C. Membranes were washed four times for 10 min in wash buffer. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgGs directed against the appropriate host IgG were diluted and incubated with membranes as described for primary antibodies. Membranes were washed four times for 10 min in wash buffer and visualized using chemiluminescence. Caveolae were isolated as described previously (32Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 33Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This method generates a highly purified fraction of caveolae that is enriched in caveolin and free of bulk plasma membrane markers such as transferrin receptor and integrins (32Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Twenty to 30 μg of purified caveolae are generally isolated from CHO cells with this method. The yield of caveolae was estimated by immunoblot analysis. Two, 5 and 10% of the caveola and plasma membrane fractions were compared. The signal intensities varied linearly with the percent of each fraction loaded. The estimated yield of plasma membrane caveolae in the present study was 53% ± 8%. Least squares analysis of variance was used to evaluate the data with respect to cell fraction, time, and their interaction using the analysis of variance procedure of STASTICA (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK). When appropriate, fractions were compared within a given time using the Tukey's honestly significant difference test. Means were considered different at p < 0.01. Selective uptake of HDL cholesterol ethers involves the initial movement of CE into a reversible plasma membrane pool and the subsequent movement into an internal, nonreversible pool (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We determined whether SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of CE into a reversible pool. SR-BI-negative CHO cells (ldlA-7) and ldlA-7 cells expressing hSR-BI were incubated in the presence of [3H]CE-HDL (10 μg/ml) for various times at 37 °C. The cells were washed to remove unbound [3H]CE-HDL and then incubated with excess (100 μg/ml) unlabeled HDL (efflux medium) for 120 min at 37 °C. The [3H]CE in the efflux medium was designated the reversible pool (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The remaining, cell-associated CE was designated the nonreversible pool. Fig.1 A indicates that after 7.5 min the reversible CE pool was 5.0-fold greater in hSR-BI cells than in ldlA-7 cells (p < 0.01; ▪ versus ■). Similarly, the nonreversible CE pool was 8.4-fold greater in hSR-BI cells than in ldlA-7 cells (p < 0.01; Fig.1 A, ● versus ○). The nonreversible CE pool increased linearly (p < 0.01) in hSR-BI cells. In contrast, the reversible CE pool did not increase (104 ± 11 ng of CE/mg of cell protein) between 30 and 60 min. To ensure that the reversible CE pool reached equilibrium, SR-BI-dependent uptake was examined for up to 4 h. SR-BI-specific uptake was calculated by subtracting the values obtained for ldlA-7 cells from those obtained for hSR-BI cells (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). Fig.1 B shows that SR-BI-dependent uptake of CE into the nonreversible (○) pool increased linearly (p < 0.01) and did not saturate under these conditions. In contrast, the reversible (Fig. 1 B, ●) CE pool reached equilibrium by 60 min and remained constant for up to 4 h. We next determined whether the reversible CE pool was integral to the membrane or caused by displacement of bound [3H]CE-HDL with unlabeled HDL. Cells expressing hSR-BI were incubated with125I-labeled HDL and then processed as described for Fig.1. 125I-Labeled HDL allows the tracking of the lipoprotein, whereas [3H]CE tracks cholesterol ethers (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). The selective uptake of [3H]CE was expressed as apparent particle uptake (see “Experimental Procedures”) into the reversible and nonreversible CE pools (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, after 7.5 min the uptake of [3H]CE into the nonreversible (○ and ■) CE pool was 4-fold greater than that observed for 125I-labeled HDL (54 ± 12.3 versus 12 ± 1.3 ng/mg of cell protein). Likewise, the [3H]CE present in the reversible (Fig. 2, ● and ▪) CE pool was 20-fold greater than the HDL protein (68.1 ± 8.2 versus 3.6 ± 0.8 ng/mg of cell protein). These data demonstrate that SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of HDL CE into both reversible and nonreversible pools. Confocal microscopy experiments have demonstrated that the majority of SR-BI expressed in CHO cells co-localizes with caveolin, a marker protein for caveolae (19Babitt J. Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. Xu S. Kreiger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that caveolae are acceptors for HDL-derived cholesterol ethers. To test this hypothesis, hSR-BI cells were incubated with [3H]CE-HDL for various times and then fractionated into cytosol, total plasma membranes (which includes caveola membranes), and intracellular membranes (e.g. ER and Golgi). Isolation of caveola membrane (CM) from the plasma membrane (PM) showed that >80% of the [3H]CE within the plasma membrane was associated with caveolae at 7.5 min (Fig. 3 A), indicating that initially, <20% of selective uptake occurred outside of caveolae. Fig. 3 B shows that at 7.5 min the specific activity of [3H]CE (ng of [3H]CE/mg of total protein in the subcellular fraction) was 12-fold greater in the caveolae fraction than in the plasma membrane fraction (1733 ± 79 versus142 ± 49 ng/mg of protein). Similar to the reversible pool of CE, the amount of [3H]CE associated with caveolae saturated by 30 min and remained constant for 4 h (data not shown). However, the amount of [3H]CE associated with the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes increased throughout the incubation period (data not shown). Caveola membranes were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.4 A). The caveola marker protein caveolin was present in the total PM fraction and was highly enriched in the CM of the plasma membrane. SR-BI was also highly enriched in the caveola fraction. The noncaveola proteins transferrin receptor and clathrin were detected in the plasma membrane fraction but not in the caveola fraction. The relative distribution of total protein and SR-BI are shown in Fig. 4 B. Although the caveola fraction contained only 1.6% of the starting postnuclear supernatant protein, it contained 60 ± 4% of the total plasma membrane SR-BI as determined by immunoblot analysis of hSR-BI in the plasma membrane and caveola membrane fractions (see “Experimental Procedures”). SR-BI-dependent selective uptake of HDL cholesterol ether involves uptake into a reversible plasma membrane pool (Fig. 1). If the reversible pool corresponds to the caveola compartment, then incubation with excess unlabeled HDL should result in an efflux of caveola-associated CE to HDL. To test this, hSR-BI cells were incubated with [3H]CE-HDL (10 μg/ml, 37 °C, 60 min). The cells were then washed and incubated with unlabeled HDL (100 μg/ml, 37 °C) for 0, 60, or 120 min. Plasma membranes were isolated, and caveolae were prepared as described. As shown in Fig.5 A, the [3H]CE associated with caveolae declined during the efflux period, whereas the [3H]CE in the plasma membrane remained constant, indicating that caveola [3H]CE constituted the reversible pool of CE. Knetch and Pittman (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) demonstrated that isolated plasma membranes are capable of selective uptake of HDL CE. They also established that the reversible pool of HDL-derived cholesterol ethers can be effluxed from isolated plasma membranes (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determined whether efflux of caveola HDL CE occurred from isolated plasma membranes, the membranes were labeled in vitro with [3H]CE-HDL for 60 min at 37 °C. Efflux was then determined after 0, 60, or 120 min of incubation with excess unlabeled HDL (100 μg/ml). Caveolae were isolated as in previous experiments. Interestingly, the incorporation of [3H]CE into isolated plasma membranes appears to be greater in vitro than in intact cells (Fig. 5, A versus B). Consistent with efflux from whole cells, [3H]CE declined in the caveola fraction during incubation with unlabeled HDL (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, [3H]CE associated with the plasma membrane fraction did not change during the efflux period. We next determined whether the SR-BI-dependent reversible pool proceeded to a nonreversible pool. Cells were incubated for 30 min with [3H]CE-HDL and then washed and incubated in medium only (no HDL) for up to 3 h. Efflux medium (100 μg/ml HDL) was then added for 120 min, and the reversible and nonreversible pools were determined. Fig. 6 A shows that the nonreversible pool tended to increase with time, whereas the reversible pool decreased with time (p < 0.01, linear). The [3H]CE associated with the SR-BI-dependent reversible pool moved to a nonreversible pool. If caveolae are the SR-BI-dependent reversible pool, then [3H]CE associated with caveolae should decline during a chase period. To test this, hSR-BI cells were incubated with [3H]CE-HDL for 30 min and then washed and incubated in the absence of any HDL for up to 3 h. The cells were then subfractionated, and the amount of [3H]CE in each fraction was quantified. The amount of [3H]CE declined in the CM fraction and the total PM fraction but increased in the intracellular membrane fraction (Fig. 6 B). The present study demonstrates that cholesterol ether from HDL is initially transferred to caveolae and that the transfer of HDL cholesterol ether to caveolae requires the expression of SR-BI. We previously demonstrated that the majority of murine SR-BI co-localizes with caveolin, a caveola marker protein (13Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A.

In the present study, ∼60% of total plasma membrane SR-BI co-purifies with caveolin. The yield of SR-BI in the caveola fraction is similar to the yield of caveolae based on immunoblots of caveolin (60%; Fig. 4;versus 53%; “Experimental Procedures”). These results suggest that the incomplete recovery of SR-BI is attributable to the incomplete recovery of caveolae, because caveolin present in the plasma membrane is predominantly associated with caveola membranes, as shown by Anderson and colleagues by immunoelectron microscopy (21Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenny J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar). However, some fraction of SR-BI (potentially up to 40%) may not be associated with caveolae. Importantly, >80% of the [3H]CE is associated with caveolae by 7.5 min of uptake. This strongly suggests that caveolae are involved in the initial uptake of CE. The absolute dependence of selective CE uptake on caveolae will require additional studies. We also demonstrated in the present study that cholesterol ether associated with caveolae constituted a reversible pool from which the sterol could efflux back to HDL. Furthermore, caveola-associated cholesterol ether was chased into an internal, nonreversible pool. These findings are consistent with earlier work by Pittman and Knetch (9Knetch T.P. Pittman R.C. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 1002: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), who used Hep G2 and adrenal cells to demonstrate that HDL cholesterol ether was taken up into a small, reversible plasma membrane pool before progressing to an internal, nonreversible pool. Both hepatocytes and adrenal cells abundantly express SR-BI, and it is therefore likely that the selective uptake observed in these earlier studies was mediated, at least in part, by SR-BI (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Kreiger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar, 34Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Kreiger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). We used subcellular fractionation and pulse-chase methods to demonstrate that cholesterol ether moved to an intracellular membrane compartment. We have not identified the intracellular membrane compartment. Once the cholesterol ether reached the intracellular membrane compartment, it could not be rapidly effluxed from these cells. These data show that cholesterol ether can be selectively internalized to an intracellular membrane compartment. Furthermore, these data suggest that internalization of caveola cholesterol ester does not require its hydrolysis to unesterified, free cholesterol. How does cholesterol ether traffick between caveolae and an intracellular membrane compartment? Recent research on caveola function offers two possible mechanisms. First, Schnitzer et al. (35Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) has shown that endothelial cell caveolae contain vesicle-trafficking proteins such as SNAPs and SNAREs. Furthermore, this group has shown that endothelial caveolae can invaginate and detach from the plasma membrane proper. The detached caveolae are capable of translocating through the cytosol and fusing with other membranes. Cholesterol ethers could therefore be internalized and transported to intracellular membranes in this manner. However, the ability of caveolae to vesiculate is contentious and may not occur in other types of cells (26Smart E.J. Estes K. Anderson R.G.W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Smart E.J. Foster D.C. Ying Y.-S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G.W. J.

This mechanism would also internalize entire HDL particles and therefore not be selective uptake. A second possible mechanism for sterol trafficking was described by Uittenbogaardet al. (33Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that a protein chaperone complex consisting of caveolin, HSP56, cyclophilin 40, and cyclophilin-A transported newly synthesized cholesterol directly from the ER to caveolae. This type of mechanism might also permit the uptake of cholesterol ethers from caveolae without the internalization of SR-BI and HDL. However, the caveolin-chaperone complex has not yet been demonstrated to traffick from caveolae to the ER or to transport cholesterol ethers. We have shown that both SR-BI and an isoform, class B, type II scavenger receptor, are localized to caveolae (38Webb N.R. de Villiers W.J.S. Connell P.M. de Beer F.C. van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1490-1495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, another class B scavenger receptor, CD36, has also been localized to caveolae (39Dorahy D.J. Lincz L.F. Meldrum C.J. Burns G.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 40Lisanti M.P. Sherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.-H. Cook R.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22315-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) are palmitoylated. Protein acylation is one mechanism whereby proteins can be targeted to caveolae. Shenoy-Scaria et al. (42Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), for example, demonstrated that dual acylation targeted nonreceptor tyrosine kinases to caveolae. Shaul et al. (43Shaul P.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6518-6522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) demonstrated that endothelial nitric oxide synthase required acylation for caveolae association. The role of acylation in the targeting of SR-BI or CD36 to caveolae has not been tested. Recently, Reaven et al. (44Reaven E. Nomoto A. Leers-Sucheta S. Temel R. Williams D.L. Azhar S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2847-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) published electron micrographs showing the localization of SR-BI to microvillar channels in luteal cells. The relationship between microvillar channels and caveolae is unclear. Parton et al. (45Parton R.G. Way M. Zori N. Stang E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 46Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) demonstrated that caveolae can form deep invaginations into the cytosol in skeleton muscle myocytes. Microvillar channels may be caveolae or the functional equivalent in luteal cells. Alternatively, it is possible that SR-BI is not associated with caveolae in all types of cells. SR-BI plays an important role in regulating cholesterol flow between lipoproteins and cell membranes. We suggest the following pathway for the selective uptake of HDL cholesterol ester: 1) HDL binds to SR-BI in caveolae; 2) CE is transferred to caveolae; and 3) caveola-associated CE translocates to an intracellular membrane compartment. However, our data do not rule out the possibility that caveola-associated CE moves into the bulk (noncaveola) plasma membrane before transport to an intracellular compartment. Additional work is required to elucidate these steps in CE transport and their potential regulatory mechanisms.

No protease responsible for this highly unusual, purportedly intramembranous, cleavage has been definitively identified. We examined the substrate specificity of γ-secretase by mutating various residues within or adjacent to the transmembrane domain of the APP and then analyzing Aβ production from cells transfected with these mutant APPs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and mass spectrometry. Aβ production was also analyzed from a subset of transmembrane domain APP mutants that showed dramatic shifts in γ-secretase cleavage in the presence or absence of pepstatin, an inhibitor of γ-secretase activity. These studies demonstrate that γ-secretase's cleavage specificity is primarily determined by location of the γ-secretase cleavage site of APP with respect to the membrane, and that γ-secretase activity is due to the action of multiple proteases exhibiting both a pepstatin- sensitive activity and a pepstatin-insensitive activity. Given that γ-secretase is a major therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease these studies provide important information with respect to the mechanism of Aβ production that will direct efforts to isolate the γ-secretases and potentially to develop effective therapeutic inhibitors of pathologically relevant γ-secretase activities. γ-Secretase activity is the final cleavage event that releases the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) from the β-secretase cleaved carboxyl-terminal fragment of the amyloid β protein precursor (APP).

Generation of Aβ from APP requires two proteolytic events, one at the amino terminus referred to as β-secretase and one at the carboxyl terminus known as γ-secretase (Fig.1). To date, neither of the proteases responsible for these activities has been definitively identified. Comparison of the soluble Aβ secreted by cells, soluble Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid, and insoluble Aβ isolated from the AD brain has revealed that there are numerous Aβ species with extensive amino- and carboxyl-terminal heterogeneity. The major Aβ species in both conditioned cell culture media and human cerebrospinal fluid is Aβ1–40 (∼50–70%) although some Aβ1–42 (5–20%) is also present along with minor amounts of other peptides (e.g.Aβ1–28, Aβ1–33, Aβ1–34, Aβ3–34, Aβ1–37, Aβ1–38, and Aβ1–39) (4Wang R.

The importance of the longer forms of Aβ, in particular Aβ42, has been heightened by the fact that all of the familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) linked mutations that have been analyzed result in an increase in the concentration of Aβ42 in a wide variety of model systems (reviewed in Refs. 7Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar and 8Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 479-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies have shown that the longer forms of Aβ aggregate at a much faster rate and at lower concentrations than forms ending at Aβ40 suggesting that alterations in Aβ42 concentration, as occurs in FAD linked forms of the disease, may account for the observation that the longer forms of Aβ are often the initial species deposited in the parenchyma of the AD and Down's syndrome brain (9Gravina S.A. Ho L. Eckman C.B. Long K.E. Otvos Jr., L. Younkin L.H. Suzuki N. Younkin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7013-7016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 10Iwatsubo T.

Sci. 1993; 695: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition to the β- and γ-secretase activities that generate Aβ, a third proteolytic activity referred to as α-secretase cleaves within the Aβ sequence at Lys16 to release a large secreted derivative (12Wiedemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters D.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 13Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W.

Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), thus precluding formation of full-length Aβ. Following cleavage of APP at the extracellular/lumenal domain of the APP by either α- or β-secretases, γ-secretase cleavage of the resulting COOH-terminal fragment results in the release of the p3 or Aβ, respectively. The findings that all of the FAD-linked mutations in APP and the presenilin (PS) genes alter the concentration of Aβ ending at position 42 and, with the exception of the APPK670N,M671L(NL) mutation, appear to act by altering γ-secretase activity makes understanding this activity pivotal to our knowledge of the disease process. While previous studies have shown that β-secretase cleavage, like most proteolytic cleavages, exhibits fairly rigid primary amino acid sequence requirements (15Citron M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), similar studies of the more complex γ-secretase activity demonstrates fairly loose specificity (16Tischer E.

Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15396-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), provide no compelling mechanisms for the observed alterations in cleavage associated with FAD-linked mutations. One of the more unusual aspects of γ-secretase cleavage is that based on hydropathy plots the γ-cleavage sites lie within the putative transmembrane domain (TMD) of the APP (18Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.-H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). Several other proteins, SREPB (19Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), Notch (20Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins (21Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), have been postulated to undergo such intramembranous cleavage. While recent data for SREBP site two protease cleavage (22Duncan E.A. Dave U.P. Sakai J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17801-17809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Notch (20Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), indicate that the cleavage of these proteins occurs at hydrophobic residues near the transmembrane junction, in no instance has the site of cleavage and the location of the residues with respect to the membrane at the time of cleavage been elucidated. Thus, the concept of intramembranous proteolysis remains controversial. To date, there is no definitive evidence showing that a protease can cleave bonds buried within a membrane. As a first step toward defining the mechanism of γ-secretase cleavage, we undertook a mutagenesis study in an attempt to define the specificity and structural requirements that produce Aβ species of varying lengths by using a large number of APP TMD mutants. The TMD mutant APPs are shown in Fig. 2. These mutations can be divided into several different categories. 1) Point mutations at positions Aβ41 (I637X based on the APP695 sequence) and Aβ43 (T639X) which correspond to the P1′ positions for a γ-secretase cleavage producing Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, respectively. 2) Deletion and insertion mutations designed to alter the localization of the γ-secretase cleavage site within the membrane (del and ins). 3) Point mutations that alter the putative membrane stop anchor signal or increase the number of charged residues on the lumenal side of the membrane and 4) replacement of residues carboxyl to the normal γ-cleavage sites with alanine. All mutations were made in a background of the APP695NL mutation in order to increase absolute amounts of Aβ peptides generated without affecting γ-cleavage as this mutation increases activity at the β-secretase site without altering the relative amounts of either Aβ40 or Aβ42 (5Suzuki N.

In the first step, the EcoRI/NotI fragment of pcDNA3APP695NL was replaced with a PCR product generated from wild-type APP695 using the forward primer APP+1803 and the reverse primers Δ26 (5′-CATGCGGCCGCTCGTCTCTTGAACCCACATCTTCTGCA-3′), Δ39 (5′-CATGCGGCCGCTCGTCTCCAACACCGCCCACCATGAGT-3′), and Δ52 (5′-CATGCGGCCGCTCGTCTCTCAGCATCACCAAGGTGATGA-3′), respectively, to generate the base constructs pcDNA3APP695NLΔ26, pcDNA3APP695NLΔ39, and pcDNA3APP695NLΔ52. These mutant APPs incorporated a class IIa restriction site, BsmBI, 3′ to Aβ26, Aβ39, and Aβ52. When cut with BsmBI andNotI the BsmBI site is lost, leaving a 5′ 4-bp overhang at the 3′ end, effectively truncating the APP. To produce the various TMD mutants in this study, oligonucleotides incorporating the various mutations were generated containing a BsmBI site at their 5′ end. PCR products were amplified using various mutant oligonucleotides and a common reverse primer using wild type APP as template. Subsequent cleavage of these products with BsmBI and NotI followed by cloning into the appropriate base vectors (pcDNA3APP695NLΔ26, pcDNA3APP695NLΔ39, and pcDNA3APP695NLΔ52) generated the desired mutants with no additional base changes. All PCR reactions were carried out using the High Fidelity PCR Kit from Boehringer Mannheim. All mutant cDNAs were sequenced to ensure that no additional mutations were incorporated. Sequences for all of the PCR primers used are available upon request. Cells were plated onto 6-well culture dishes (Corning) and grown to 70–80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). On the day of transfection, culture media was changed to Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After a short period of equilibration, the media was again changed to fresh Opti-MEM (0.5 ml) and 1.5 μg of DNA and 4.0 μg of DOSPER liposomal transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) were added to each well (premixed) in a volume of 0.5 ml of additional media. After overnight incubation, the media were discarded and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum (1.0 ml/well). Twenty-four hours later, the media were collected and replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; complete protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to each sample. The serum-free media were collected 24 h later, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (to 1 mm) and EDTA (to 5 mm) added to each sample. In both cases, samples were immediately centrifuged at high speed to pellet cellular debris, transferred to clean Microfuge tubes, and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C until analyzed. Pepstatin treatment was conducted by adding to the media (post-transfection) pepstatin A to a concentration of 100 μg/ml and Me2SO to 2%. Control cultures were treated with 2% Me2SO alone. Transfections and media collections were otherwise identical to untreated 293T cells. To generate and purify recombinant human sAPP, a 6-histidine tag was placed in-frame near the amino terminus of human APP695 by cleavage with KpnI and in-frame insertion of a double-stranded DNA formed by annealing two oligonucleotides. After construction in the expression vector pAG3, the APP695nterm his was stably transfected into CHO cells. For purification, after 48 h serum-free media was collected and purified using Ni2+ affinity resin (Qiagen). To perform sAPP ELISAs, MaxiSorp 96-well immunoplates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 400 ng/ml purified recombinant sAPP in 100 μl of 0.1m sodium carbonate buffer per well (pH 9.6). Plates were then blocked overnight at 4 °C with 1% Block Ace, 0.05% NaN3 in PBS (300 μl/well). Blocking solution was discarded, the plates washed twice with PBS, and the wells loaded with 40 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBSB) and 10 μl of each sample, in duplicate. Standard samples, containing from 31.5 to 8000 ng/ml sAPP in PBSB, were also loaded in duplicate. The NH2-terminal APP antibody 207 was added (100 μl) to each well, diluted 1:32,000 in PBSB. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, wells were washed twice with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, twice with PBS, and then loaded with 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:5000 in PBSB; Rockland Immunochemicals). After a 4-h incubation at room temperature, plates were washed as above, then developed with 100 μl of TMB solution (Kirkegaard & Perry). The reaction was stopped after approximately 5 min with the addition of 100 μl of 6% phosphoric acid and the plates read at 450 nm. These conditions were determined empirically to optimize detection of sAPP in transfected cell lines in our laboratory, with typical expression levels placing sAPP concentrations in a linear region of the standard curve. For determination of Aβ concentrations we used 3 well characterized sandwich ELISA systems. Total Aβ was determined by 3160 capture and detection with either 4G8 or BNT77 (9Gravina S.A. Ho L.

To control for variance in transfection efficiency and the amount of APP that is appropriately inserted in the membrane and trafficked through the secretory pathway (thus APP available for γ-secretase cleavage) Aβ levels were normalized to sAPP expression. This was accomplished by dividing the Aβ values (fmol/ml) by the sAPP values (ng/ml) resulting in a normalized Aβ value (fmol/ng). The normalized Aβ value for each mutant was then divided by the normalized Aβ value for APP695NL to give the %NL Aβ. 48 h after transfection, 293T cells were labeled for 2 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine.

Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 10% Tris-Tricine gels. PhosphorImaging analysis of the dried gels was performed. After subtracting the number of pixels of flAPP or sAPP present in the mock transfected (vector alone) sample from each of the experimental samples, the ratio of sAPP/flAPP was calculated by dividing the pixels of sAPP by the pixels of flAPP. sAPP/flAPP ratios were then compared with the ratio of sAPP/flAPP calculated for APP695NL. TMD mutants showing sAPP/flAPP ratios greater than 50% of APP695NL ratio were assumed to have preserved processing in the secretory pathway. Serum-free media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) collected for a 24-h period beginning 24 h post-transfection was used for mass spectrometric analysis. Aβ peptides were analyzed by immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometric Aβ assay as described previously (4Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

APP appears to be a substrate for γ-secretase only after it has been cleaved by α- or β-secretase (30Paganetti P.A. Lis M. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because cleavage of APP by these activities requires normal membrane insertion and trafficking through the secretory pathway, we have only performed in depth analyses of APP TMD mutants that showed preserved processing by these activities and normalized Aβ production to sAPP levels. Processing in the secretory pathway was assessed by metabolic labeling experiments and determination of the sAPP/flAPP ratio in comparison to APP695NL as described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown). To examine Aβ production in the mutants that showed preserved processing in the secretory pathway, sAPP, total Aβ, Aβ1–40, and Aβ1–42 were measured in the conditioned media by ELISA. Comparison of normalized total Aβ shows that most mutants resulted in modest to moderate decrements in Aβ production (TableI). Even strikingly non-conservative mutations at residues 637 (Aβ41) or 639 (Aβ43) had relatively modest effects on total Aβ production. Basic (Lys) or acidic (Glu) amino acid substitutions at both sites, and substitutions of amino acids with a large hydrophobic side chain (Phe and Trp) or even a proline at position 637, did not prevent γ-secretase cleavage. In addition, production of Aβ was only modestly decreased by most mutations at or near the lumenal transmembrane domain junction or by deletion or insertion mutants. The notable exceptions being the large decrements in Aβ production by del640–43, 624–626E, and ins625–631 mutants.Table ISummary of ELISA results for TMD mutantsConstruct%NL AβaAβ?, Aβ species other than those ending at 40 or 42.%Aβ1–40%Aβ1–42Major effectsI637W49***6***1.0***↓Aβ40, ↓Aβ42, ↑Aβ?aAβ?, Aβ species other than those ending at 40 or 42.I637P60*1***0.0***↓Aβ40, ↓Aβ42, ↑Aβ?I637F73*341.0***↓Aβ42, ↑Aβ?I637E28***8***0.2***↓Aβ40, ↓Aβ42, ↑Aβ?I637K85522.6Slight ↓Aβ42T639K55**411.0***↓Aβ42T639E59**453.1T639A39***339.7***↓Aβ42640–648A69**28*4.4↓Aβ40, ↑Aβ?625–626K9414***11.5***↓Aβ40, ↑Aβ42, ↑Aβ?G625P7830*3.2↓Aβ40, ↑Aβ?624–626D39***22*54.0***↓Aβ40, ↑Aβ42624–626E9***25*8.7***↓Aβ40, ↑Aβ42, ↑Aβ?del625–62862**14***48.1***↓Aβ40, ↑Aβ42ins625–62827***2***4.6↓Aβ40, ↑Aβ?ins625–63118***0***1.9↓Aβ40, ↑Aβ?del640–64318***6940.8***↑Aβ42, ↓Aβ?del644–64771*361.8*↓Aβ42ins644–6478117***4.7**↓Aβ40, ↑Aβ42, ↑Aβ?APP695NL10051 ± 4.23.3 ± 0.3Results of total Aβ ELISAs, standardized to sAPP levels (assayed in duplicate, mock transfection levels subtracted).

Six mutants (I637R, T639P, 649–651E, 649–651D, del625–631, and del640–647) showed dramatic decreases in Aβ levels (<5% of APP695NL Aβ, data not shown). Pulse-chase analyses showed that these mutations produced equivalent levels of full-length APP, but that the sAPP/flAPP ratio was markedly diminished (<1% compared with APP695NL, data not shown). Although the precise mechanism for the impaired processing of these mutations is not definitively established by these studies, based on previous studies (16Tischer E. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21914-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and our metabolic labeling data it is likely that these mutants either alter membrane insertion or prevent proper trafficking through the secretory pathway.

Comparison of the relative amounts of Aβ1–40 to Aβ1–42, measured, respectively, by BAN50/BA27 or BAN50/BC05 ELISA, shows that many of these mutants dramatically alter the relative amounts of the major Aβ species produced.

https://openalex.org/W1970407380,"Agonist-promoted internalization of some G protein-coupled receptors has been shown to mediate receptor desensitization, resensitization, and down-regulation. In this study, we investigated whether opioids induced internalization of the human and rat κ opioid receptors stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the potential mechanisms involved in this process and its possible role in activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Exposure of the human κ receptor to the agonists U50,488H, U69,593, ethylketocyclazocine, or tifluadom, but not etorphine, promoted receptor internalization. However, none of these agonists induced significant internalization of the rat κ opioid receptor. U50,488H-induced human κ receptor internalization was time- and concentration-dependent, with 30–40% of the receptors internalized following a 30-min exposure to 1 μmU50,488H. Agonist removal resulted in the receptors gradually returning to the cell surface over a 60-min period. The antagonist naloxone blocked U50,488H-induced internalization without affecting internalization itself, while pretreatment with pertussis toxin had no effect on U50,488H-induced internalization. In contrast, incubation with sucrose (0.4–0.8 m) significantly reduced U50,488H-induced internalization of the κ receptor. While co-expression of the wild type GRK2, β-arrestin, or dynamin I had no effect on κ receptor internalization, co-expression of the dominant negative mutants GRK2-K220R, β-arrestin (319–418), or dynamin I-K44A significantly inhibited receptor internalization. Whether receptor internalization is critical for MAP kinase activation was next investigated. Co-expression of dominant negative mutants of β-arrestin or dynamin I, which greatly reduced U50,488H-induced internalization, did not affect MAP kinase activation by the agonist. In addition, etorphine, which did not promote human κ receptor internalization, was able to fully activate MAP kinase. Moreover, U50,488H or etorphine stimulation of the rat κ receptor, which did not undergo internalization, also effectively activated MAP kinase. Thus, U50,488H-induced internalization of the human κ opioid receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells occurs via a GRK-, β-arrestin-, and dynamin I-dependent process that likely involves clathrin-coated pits. In addition, internalization of the κ receptor is not required for activation of MAP kinase."

In this system, certain mitochondrial pre-mRNAs are posttranscriptionally modified by the insertion and deletion of exclusively uridylate residues to otherwise cryptic transcripts (reviewed in Refs. 1Stuart K. Allen T.E. Heidmann S. Seiwert S.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 2Alfonzo J.D. Thiemann O. Simpson L.

Uridylate insertion and deletion is presumably a requirement for translation of these kinetoplast mRNAs, as it often creates start codons, stop codons, and in many cases entire open reading frames. The genetic information for kRNA editing is contained in short, mitochondrially encoded transcripts called guide RNAs (gRNAs) (4Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 5Seiwert S.D. Stuart K. Science. 1994; 266: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Each gRNA transfers the genetic information for specific uridylate insertion and deletion at multiple, adjacent sites in the pre-mRNA through base pairing interactions. In addition, multiple gRNAs are required for the complete editing of most pre-mRNAs. A complex of seven proteins that contains editing activity as well as many of the enzyme activities previously postulated to be involved in kRNA editing has been purified from Trypanosoma bruceimitochondria (6Rusché L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4069-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, given the extensive interactions between biological macromolecules that must take place during kRNA editing, it is likely that proteins exist other than those found within the purified editing complex that affect the efficiency and/or accuracy of this process. A likely target for such protein factors is gRNA, given the central role of gRNA in this process. Evidence for the existence of gRNA-binding proteins in kinetoplastid mitochondria has been presented by several laboratories (7Göringer H.U. Koslowsky D.J. Morales T.H. Stuart K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Because gRNAs exhibit little primary sequence similarity, the basis of gRNA recognition by these proteins is unclear.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3093-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Hermann T. Schmid B. Heumann H. Göringer H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2311-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To further understand the process of kRNA editing, we focused our efforts on identifying and characterizing other protein factors that interact specifically with gRNAs. We report here the identification of a gene encoding a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa that can be UV cross-linked specifically to gRNA. We designated this protein RBP16 (RNA-binding protein of 16 kDa). RBP16 was purified based on its affinity for poly(U). Subsequent experiments confirmed that RBP16 is capable of interacting with different gRNAs through the oligo(U) tail. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments provide strong evidence that RBP16 interacts with gRNA in vivo. The cDNA sequence of RBP16 predicts a protein with three domains: a cleaved mitochondrial import sequence, an N-terminal cold shock domain (CSD), and a C-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich region. The CSD of RBP16 shows extensive homology to bacterial cold shock proteins and to eukaryotic Y-box proteins. Bacterial cold shock proteins are proposed to function as RNA chaperones by preventing disadvantageous RNA secondary structures (19Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 20Graumann P. Wendrich T.M. Weber M.H.W. Schröder K. Marahiel M.A. Mol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Possible roles of RBP16 in kRNA editing and other aspects of trypanosome mitochondrial gene expression are discussed. Procyclic form T. brucei brucei clone IsTaR1 stock EATRO 164 was grown as described (22Brun R. Schönenberger V. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial vesicles were isolated and stored using a previously described method (23Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs encoding the gRNAs gA6[14] and gCYb[558], with 17 and 15 nucleotides (nt) oligo(U) tails respectively, were previously described (8Read L.K. Göringer H.U. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2629-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A gA6[14] construct lacking the 3′ oligo(U) tail was generated by PCR (8Read L.K. Göringer H.U. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2629-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Synthetic gRNA molecules possess 10 nt of vector sequence on their 5′-ends. For competition assays, a control transcript, approximately the size of a synthetic gRNA, was produced by run-off transcription from pBluescript (Stratagene) linearized withBamHI. RNAs were synthesized in vitro with T7 polymerase and gel-purified on 6% acrylamide/7 m urea. Purified mitochondrial vesicles from approximately 4 × 1011 cells were resuspended in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 15 mm MgOAc, 50 mm KCl) at a concentration of 1 × 1011cells/ml. All buffers contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm iodoacetamide to minimize proteolysis. Vesicles were lysed by addition of 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and insoluble material was cleared from mitochondrial extracts by centrifugation. After addition of 1 mm CaCl2, the cleared extract was incubated with micrococcal nuclease (100 units/1 × 1011 cells) for 15 min at 27 °C. Micrococcal nuclease was thereafter inhibited by the addition of EGTA to 5 mm. A poly(U)-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column with a 1-ml bed volume was equilibrated in Buffer A containing 50 mm KCl and 10% glycerol. The cleared, micrococcal nuclease treated extract was loaded onto the column, and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A containing 300 mmKCl. Bound proteins were eluted with 10 column volumes of Buffer A containing a linear salt gradient ranging from 300 mm-800 mm KCl. Fraction volumes of 0.5 ml were collected. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and by UV cross-linking to synthetic gA6(14) internally labeled with [α-32P]UTP. Protein was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 10 fmol of radiolabeled gA6[14], and UV cross-linking was performed as described previously (8Read L.K. Göringer H.U. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2629-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For determination of internal peptide sequence, poly(U)-Sepharose fractions containing RBP16 were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and excised from the gel. Internal peptide sequence was obtained from trypsin digestion products of RBP16 by the Harvard Microchemistry facility. RBP16 N-terminal sequence was obtained with a ProSeq Protein Microsequencing after transfer to a nylon membrane. RBP16 was further purified on poly(A)-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as follows: poly(U)-Sepharose fractions containing RBP16 were combined and dialyzed twice against 1 liter of Buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. RBP16 was collected in the flow through fraction of a 0.5-ml poly(A)-Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. The purification procedure was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and stained with silver (24Ansorge W. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1985; 11: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Protein quantification was performed with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine immunoglobulin as a standard. Internal peptide sequences were used for the construction of degenerate oligonucleotides based on previously reported T. brucei codon usage (25Parsons M. Stuart K. Smiley B.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Restriction sites at the 5′-ends of oligonucleotides are indicated by underlining. Total procyclic form cDNA was generated by reverse transcription primed with (dT)-RXS (5′-GAGAATTCTCGAGTCGACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). Internal cDNA sequence was obtained by PCR amplification of procyclic cDNA with the degenerate primers TB16-D (5′-GCGGATCCNACYTCRAAYTCVACYTCYTGRCCNAC-3′) and TB16-E (5′-GCGGATCCGGNTTYATYGARGAYGAYGCNGAY-3′). Nested PCR was then employed to selectively amplify 5′- and 3′-ends of RBP16 as follows. The 5′-end was first amplified using a primer corresponding to a portion of the splice leader sequence, E-SL22 (5′-GCGAATTCGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTG-3′), and the primer TB16K-I (5′-GCGGATCCGTTTGAAGAGCTGAGAAATGC-3′). The 5′-end was further amplified with the primers E-SL22 (above) and TB16F-OE (5′-GCGGATCCRTCNGCRTCRTCYTCRATRAANCC-3′) using 1 μl of the previous reaction as template. The 3′-end of RBP16 cDNA was amplified using primer (dT)-RXS (above) and the primer TB16K-G (5′-GCGGATCCGAAGCAACACTTTGTGCATTTCTC-3′). Further amplification of the 3′-end of RBP16 cDNA was accomplished with the primers (dT)-RXS (above) and TB16K-J (5′-GCGGATCCGCTCTTCAAACGGAAACGGGGGG-3′) using 1 μl of the previous reaction as template. All reaction products were digested and ligated into the EcoRI/BamHI site of pBluescriptII SK− (Stratagene) with the exception of the internal cDNA segment, which was cloned into the EcoRI site. Ligated products were transformed into Escherichia colistrain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transformants were selected on MacConkey agar (Difco Laboratories) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated from ampr colonies, and two clones for each cDNA segment were sequenced in both directions by automated DNA sequencing at the State University of New York at Buffalo Center for Advanced Molecular Biology and Immunology Nucleic Acid Sequencing facility. Sequences were analyzed using the GCG software package (26Devereux J. Haebberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar), and sequence comparisons were done with CLUSTAL W (27Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 22: 4673-4680Crossref Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The full-length RBP16 open reading frame (beginning with the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the N-terminal peptide sequence) was amplified by PCR from total procyclic cDNA using primers Tb16K-O (5′-GCGGATCCATGGGTAACAAGGGTAAGGTGATATCG-3′) and Tb16K-P (5′-GCGTCGACCTAAAAGTCATCGCTGAAGCTC-3′), which were constructed based on the cDNA sequence. The reaction products were inserted into the BamHI/SalI site of pMal-C2 (New England BioLabs) and transformed into E. coli strain BL21 pLysS (Novagen). Expression and purification of the resulting maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion was done by standard protocol (28Ausabel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1995Google Scholar). The expressed fusion protein (MBP-RBP16) was further purified by poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography. Partially purified RBP16 (100 ng/reaction) and purified MBP-RBP16 (680 ng/reaction) were analyzed by UV cross-linking to a synthetic gRNA in the presence of various nucleic acid competitors. Ribohomopolymers, riboheteropolymers, and the double-stranded RNA polymer (poly(A)·U)) were purchased from Sigma. Oligo-(dT)20 was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. A Bio-Rad model GS-700 imaging densitometer was used for the quantification of UV cross-linking signals in combination with Molecular Analyst software (version 1.5). For gel retardation assays, reaction conditions were identical to UV cross-linking experiments. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, RBP16-gRNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a native 4% acrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio 19:1) in 50 mm Tris-glycine (pH 8.8). Shifted bands were detected by autoradiography. The MBP-RBP16 fusion protein was used for the production of a polyclonal rabbit serum in coordination with the State University of New York at Buffalo Monoclonal Antibody center. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for the purification of IgG molecules from both immune and preimmune sera. For immunoprecipitation experiments, mitochondrial vesicles from 1 × 1010 cells were lysed in 1 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), and insoluble material was cleared by centrifugation. One hundred micrograms of purified IgG from immune or preimmune sera was added to 300 μl of extract along with 100 units of RNAguard RNase inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Reactions were added to 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose equilibrated in wash buffer (as above with 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. Immune complexes were separated from supernatants by centrifugation and washed five times with 500 μl of wash buffer. RNA was isolated from protein A-Sepharose pellets and supernatants by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C in wash buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 50 μg/ml proteinase K. The reactions were extracted twice with phenol-chloroform, and RNA was precipitated with ethanol using glycogen as a carrier. RNA was detected by labeling the 5′-ends with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products; 3000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) following dephosphorylation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Life Technologies, Inc.). gRNA was identified by labeling 5′-ends with guanylyl transferase (a generous gift from Dr. Ed Niles). Guanylyl transferase reactions were carried out in a 15-μl volume in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (NEN Life Science Products; 800 Ci/mmol), 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 6.0 mm KCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 units of RNAguard RNase inhibitor. Labeled RNA was separated on a 6% acrylamide/7m urea gel and visualized by autoradiography. All gRNA molecules possess a 3′ oligo(U) extension that could potentially act as a protein recognition site (16Blum B. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 62: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments from other laboratories demonstrated that poly(U) is an efficient competitor for the UV cross-linking of mitochondrial proteins to gRNA (9Köller J. Nörskau G. Paul A.S. Stuart K. Göringer H.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Leegwater P. Speijer D. Benne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we fractionated mitochondrial proteins from procyclic form trypanosomes according to poly(U) affinity to obtain a chromatographic fraction enriched for gRNA-binding proteins. The protein profile of the poly(U)-Sepharose fractionation procedure is shown in Fig. 1 A. An abundant protein with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa eluted in fractions 9–16. Fractions were assayed for gRNA-binding proteins by UV cross-linking to synthetic gA6[14] internally labeled with [α-32P]UTP. gA6[14] is the gRNA molecule that specifies the editing of the 3′-most editing block of the ATPase subunit 6 pre-mRNA (29Koslowsky D.J. Riley G.R. Feagin J.E. Stuart K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2043-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). UV cross-linked proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography (Fig. 1 B). An intense UV cross-linking signal was present in lanes 9–16,corresponding in size and elution pattern to the 16 kDa band observed in Fig. 1 A. We named this protein RBP16. To further purify RBP16 for UV cross-linking studies, relevant poly(U) fractions were combined and loaded onto a poly(A)-Sepharose column, and RBP16 was collected in the flow-through (Fig. 1 C, lane A). By silver stain, we estimated the flow-through fraction to consist of 75% RBP16. Using this procedure, mitochondrial vesicles from 4 × 1011 cell equivalents yield approximately 40 μg of RBP16. To examine the gRNA binding capabilities of RBP16, partially purified RBP16 was UV cross-linked to radiolabeled gA6[14] in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled competitors (Fig.2 A). The quantification of UV cross-linking signals from Fig. 2 A is shown in Fig.2 B. The gA6(14) UV cross-linking signal was competed >50% with 1000-fold molar excess unlabeled gA6[14] or gCYb[558], indicating that RBP16 has the capacity to bind different gRNAs. To examine the role of the oligo(U) tail in gRNA binding, the UV cross-linking signal was competed with increasing levels of unlabeled gA6[14]NT, a gRNA lacking the oligo(U) tail. A 4000-fold molar excess of this RNA was required to achieve the level of competition observed with unlabeled gA6[14]. To a slightly lesser extent, competition was observed at a 4000-fold molar excess of unlabeled transcript from a Bluescript plasmid. The difference in the ability of gA6[14]NT and the pBluescript transcript to compete the gA6[14] UV cross-linking signal was small but reproducible. This experiment demonstrated that RBP16 preferentially binds to gRNA over a random RNA molecule of the same size and that the major determinant of the interaction is the oligo(U) tail. Internal as well as N-terminal peptide sequences were obtained from the purified protein. Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers constructed from internal peptide sequences, a portion of the RBP16 cDNA was amplified by PCR from total procyclic cDNA followed by 5′ and 3′ amplification of cDNA ends. The RBP16 cDNA sequence predicts an RNA molecule with an open reading frame of 423 nt, as well as 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of 123 and 578 nt, respectively (Fig.3 A). Northern analysis of total procyclic RNA detected a single transcript of ∼1200 nt (data not shown), which is in good agreement with our cDNA sequence. Southern blot analysis of T. brucei genomic DNA demonstrated that RBP16 was encoded as a single copy (data not shown). Fig.3 A shows the RBP16 cDNA sequence aligned with the deduced amino acid sequence. The comparison of the N-terminal peptide sequence, which begins with asparagine 18, to the expected amino acid sequence suggests that the first 17 amino acids encode a cleaved mitochondrial import sequence. In light of this observation, the cDNA sequence predicts a mature protein of 13.2 kDa with a pI of 9.29. An overall positive charge of RBP16 at pH 8.8 may explain the slightly slower electrophoretic mobility than is predicted by its size. Sequence comparison of RBP16 to proteins in several data bases revealed significant homology of the N-terminal half of mature RBP16 to a motif known as the cold shock domain (CSD). The CSD is a well conserved nucleic acid binding domain that is homologous to the bacterial cold shock proteins and is a component of the eukaryotic Y-box proteins (reviewed in Ref. 30Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Bacterial cold shock proteins consist entirely of one CSD, whereas the eukaryotic Y-box proteins consist of one or more CSDs usually with auxiliary domains. The CSD of RBP16 presumably participates in gRNA interactions because it contains the RNP1 RNA binding motif, conserved in all CSDs (31Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2861-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B, box). Fig. 3 B shows the CSD of RBP16 aligned with CspA of E. coli and the CSDs of three eukaryotic Y-box proteins. The cold shock domain of RBP16 exhibits somewhat higher homology to prokaryotic cold shock proteins (43–46% identity) than to eukaryotic CSDs (33–38% identity). At the C terminus of RBP16 is a region that is rich in arginine (14%) and glycine (32%) and may also be capable of interacting with RNA based on an RGG type RNA binding motif (32Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that this domain contains an amino acid sequence (amino acids 107–113 of the preprotein; amino acids 90–96 of the mature protein) that is consistent with the preferred recognition motif reported for arginine methylation of hnRNP A1 (33Kim S. Merril B.M. Rajpurohit R. Kumar A. Stone K.L. Papov V.V. Schneiders J.M. Szer W. Wilson S.H. Paik W.K. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For bacterial expression of RBP16, the mature open reading frame beginning with asparagine 18 was cloned into the pMal-C2 expression vector. Upon induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, an abundant protein corresponding to the expected size of a MBP-RBP16 fusion protein (apparent molecular mass, 59 kDa), was produced (Fig.4 A, lane In). This protein was not present in extracts of uninduced cells (data not shown). The expressed fusion protein was purified from bacterial cells first based on amylose affinity (Fig. 4 A, lane Am) and subsequently based on affinity for poly(U) (Fig. 4 A, lane U). After the two-step purification, no contaminating bands were evident when 13 μg of protein were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. UV cross-linking competitions were used to characterize the binding of RBP16 to various nucleic acid substrates and to compare the binding properties of the MBP fusion protein with partially purified RBP16. The partially purified native RBP16 and the MBP fusion protein showed nearly identical preferences for various nucleic acid substrates (Fig.4, B–D). These data demonstrate that the amplified cDNA sequence encodes the RBP16 protein that was purified from trypanosome mitochondrial vesicles. RBP16 shows affinity for poly(U) and, to a lesser extent, poly(G) (Fig. 4 B). The RBP16 UV cross-linking signal is almost completely abolished by unlabeled poly(U) at 1000-fold mass excess over labeled gRNA substrate and is competed with unlabeled poly(G) to the same extent by approximately 5000-fold mass excess cold competitor. No binding to poly(A) or poly(C) was observed. Unlabeled poly(GU) and poly(CU) heteropolymers competed the UV cross-linking signal as effectively as poly(U) (Fig. 4 C). AU and AC ribopolymers were ineffective in competing UV cross-linking to gA6(14). The inability of RBP16 to bind poly(AU) maybe due to extensive formation of double-stranded regions in this RNA. Fig. 4 Ddemonstrates that RBP16 can bind RNA (poly(U)) and single-stranded DNA (oligo-(dT)20), but does not bind double-stranded RNA (poly(A)·(U)). Although binding to oligo-(dT)20 appears somewhat stronger than to poly(U), the significance of this result is difficult to interpret. Given equal masses, oligo-(dT)20contains much higher concentration of 5′- and 3′-ends than poly(U), which is hundreds of nucleotides in length. The requirement for 5′- and/or 3′-ends for RBP16 binding is unknown. Gel retardation assays were used to estimate the affinity of RBP16 for gA6[14]. When internally labeled gA6[14] was incubated with a 1 μm concentration of MBP-RBP16, no shift in the gRNA probe was observed. A single shifted band was observed when MBP-RBP16 was added to a concentration of 2.5 μm (Fig.5). At MBP-RBP16 concentrations of 5 μm and above, two band shifts were evident (Fig. 5). The appearance of two shifted forms may represent two RBP16 molecules bound to one gRNA molecule, and this possibili"

https://openalex.org/W1971376333,"Smad family proteins have been identified as mediators of intracellular signal transduction by the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily. Each member of the pathway-restricted, receptor-activated Smad family cooperates and synergizes with Smad4, called co-Smad, to transduce the signals. Only Smad4 has been shown able to function as a common partner of the various pathway-restricted Smads in mammals. Here we have identified a novel Smad4-like molecule in Xenopus (XSmad4β) as well as a Xenopus homolog of a well established Smad4 (XSmad4α). XSmad4β is 70% identical to XSmad4α in amino acid sequence. Both of the Xenopus Smad4s can cooperate with Smad1 and Smad2, the pathway-restricted Smads specific for bone morphogenetic protein and TGF-β, respectively. However, they show distinct properties in terms of their developmental expression patterns, subcellular localizations, and phosphorylation states. Moreover, XSmad4β, but not XSmad4α, has the potent ability to induce ventralization when microinjected into the dorsal marginal region of the 4-cell stage of the embryos. These results suggest that the two XenopusSmad4s have overlapping but distinct functions.

In vertebrates, at least nine different kinds of Smads have been identified. Smad proteins share a high degree of homology in their amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, the MH1 and MH2 domains, respectively, connected with a divergent proline-rich linker region. Smad proteins can be classified into three subtypes according to structure and function (1Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3327) Google Scholar, 3Attisano L.

One subtype is the pathway-restricted Smad, which is a direct substrate of type I receptors for the TGF-β superfamily. The second subtype is the co-Smad, which is not a direct substrate of receptors but participates in signaling by associating with pathway-restricted Smads. The third subtype consists of those Smads that inhibit the activation of pathway-restricted Smads and are referred to as anti-Smads (6Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y. Grinnell B.W.

Pathway-restricted Smads contain a consensus phosphorylation motif, SS(V/M)S, for the type I serine/threonine receptors at their carboxyl termini. This class of Smads interacts transiently with specific activated type I receptors and thus becomes phosphorylated following ligand stimulation. Smad2 and Smad3 are specific mediators of TGF-β and activin signaling, whereas Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are involved in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway (9Hoodless P.A. Haerry T.

Only Smad4 is known as co-Smad in mammals, where its structure is divergent from that of pathway-restricted Smads. Smad4 lacks a carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation motif and does not associate with the TGF-β receptors (14Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Each member of the various pathway-restricted Smads forms a complex with Smad4 upon ligand stimulation. Then, the heteromeric complex is translocated to the nucleus where it participates in the transcriptional activation of specific target genes (9Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M.

Smad4 was originally identified as the product of the Dpc4(deleted in pancreatic cancer) tumor suppressor gene that is mutated or deleted in a high proportion of pancreatic cancers and in a smaller proportion of other cancers (27Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). A general requirement of Smad4 is suggested not only in mammalian cells but also in Xenopusembryos, as a dominant-negative Smad4 construct interferes with Smad1 and Smad2 signaling (15Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 23Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), although cDNA cloning of a full-length Xenopus Smad4 has not yet been performed. It has been reported that Smad4-deficient mice die early in embryogenesis (29Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Itie A. Mirtsos C. Cheung A. Hahn S. Wakeham A. Schwartz L. Kern S.E. Rossant J.

A. 1998; 95: 3667-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These mice exhibit severe defects in cellular proliferation, gastrulation, and mesoderm differentiation (29Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Itie A. Mirtsos C. Cheung A. Hahn S. Wakeham A. Schwartz L. Kern S.E. Rossant J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 30Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Deng C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3667-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, Smad4 has been supposed to be a shared and obligate partner, participating in both TGF-β/activin and BMP signaling pathways. Here we report the identification, cDNA cloning, and characterization of two kinds of Smad4 in Xenopus. Both of the two Xenopus Smad4s, termed XSmad4α and XSmad4β, are shown able to function as common partners of both Smad1 and Smad2 inXenopus embryos as well as in mammalian cells to transduce respective signals from the TGF-β superfamily. Moreover, XSmad4α and XSmad4β themselves form heteromeric as well as homomeric complexes. In addition to their amino acid sequence diversity, these two XSmad4s differ in their expression profiles during earlyXenopus development and in their subcellular localization and phosphorylation states when expressed in cultured cells. Furthermore, microinjection of mRNA encoding XSmad4β into dorsal cells of Xenopus embryos leads to strong ventralization, whereas XSmad4α has little ventralizing activity. These results suggest that the two Xenopus Smad4s may function as co-Smads with distinct properties in transducing a set of TGF-β superfamily signals. AXenopus oocyte cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened using the human Smad4 coding region as a probe. RNase protection assay was carried out using an Ambion HybSpeed RPA kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The entire coding regions of XSmad4α and XSmad4β, the carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of XSmad4α and XSmad4β, and the carboxyl-terminal serine to alanine mutant of XSmad4β (AAVN) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the amplified nucleotide sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of XSmad4α and XSmad4β, the nucleotides corresponding to amino acid residues 1–508 and 1–519 were amplified, respectively. XSmad4α cDNA and XSmad4β cDNA were ligated into pSP64T or into a Myc tag fused version of pSP64T plasmids to synthesize mRNAs (31Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). In vitro synthesis of capped mRNA was performed using mMESSAGE mMACHINE (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Other constructs for cell transfection were inserted into pcDL-SRα456, pSRα-HA, or pSRα-Myc. Xenopus embryos were obtained by in vitro fertilization of eggs with testes homogenates. Embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (32Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). The animal cap assay was performed as described elsewhere (33Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Dorsal marginal zone explants were dissected at the gastrula stage (stage 10) and were cultured until sibling embryos reached stage 13. The primer pairs used here for reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were reported elsewhere (23Lagna G. Hata A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 33Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Nishida E.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 36: 675-685Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected at 24 h after seeding using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, lysates were prepared, and the luciferase activity was determined with the luciferase assay system (Promega). Relative luciferase activities were normalized by co-expressed β-galactosidase activities. After 12–15 h, cells were treated with or without 10 ng/ml of human TGF-β1 (purchased from Austral Biologicals) or 300 ng/ml BMP (Xenopus BMP4 (36Iemura S. Yamamoto T.S. Takagi C. Uchiyama H. Natsume T. Shimasaki S. Sugino H. Ueno N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9337-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar)) for 1 h, and subsequently lysates were prepared as described (37Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T.

Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation with the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitates and the aliquots of total lysates were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with antibodies against Myc or HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody or donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham). Immunoreactive bands were detected by the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham). For metabolic labeling of C2C12 cells, 24 h post-transfection cells were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h and treated with or without 10 ng/ml of TGF-β1 and lysed in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors. Myc-tagged Smads were immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The precipitates and the aliquots of cell lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. TGF-β stimulation of C2C12 cells was provided by co-transfecting the activated TGF-β type I receptor, TβR-I (T204D), and treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 1 h (25Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed by formaldehyde. Immunostaining was performed by incubation with the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h followed by incubation with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:400) for 1 h. By screening a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library with human Smad4 as a probe under low stringency, we isolated several positive clones. Sequence analysis of these cDNA clones revealed that one of them has a very high homology (91% identity) to human Smad4/DPC4 in the coding region and the other has a relatively lower (71% identity), but still the highest, homology to human Smad4 among the other Smad family proteins reported to date. Therefore, we referred to the former as Xenopus Smad4α (XSmad4α) and the latter as Xenopus Smad4β (XSmad4β). We considered XSmad4α a Xenopus ortholog of mammalian Smad4 and XSmad4β the second Smad4 (see below). The nucleotide sequences were predicted to encode proteins of 549 and 560 amino acids for XSmad4α and XSmad4β with calculated molecular masses of 60 and 61 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1 A). It is unlikely that these two Smad4-related Xenopus cDNA clones were derived from pseudoalleles resulting from the pseudotetraploid nature of Xenopus laevis genome, because we obtained several cDNA clones encoding pseudogenes for both XSmad4α and XSmad4β from the same cDNA library (data not shown). The Smad proteins typically consist of three modules: highly conserved amino-terminal (MH1) and carboxyl-terminal (MH2) domains and a poorly conserved linker region. The amino acid sequence comparison between XSmad4α or XSmad4β and human Smad4 (hSmad4) is shown in Fig.1 A. The MH1 and MH2 domains of XSmad4α are 100% identical to those of hSmad4, except that the coding region of XSmad4α initiates at the position corresponding to the second methionine residue of hSmad4. The linker region shows 74% identity between XSmad4α and hSmad4. In contrast, the identity between XSmad4β and hSmad4 is about 90% in the MH1 and MH2 domains and 34% in the linker region (Fig. 1 B). Another striking difference between XSmad4α and XSmad4β is that the carboxyl-terminal sequence of XSmad4α is QPLD, like mammalian Smad4, whereas that of XSmad4β is SSVN, which resembles the carboxyl-terminal SS(V/M)S phosphorylation motif of pathway-restricted Smads (Fig. 1 B). To examine the temporal expression of XSmad4α and XSmad4β during early development, an RNase protection analysis was performed with probes corresponding to each of the linker region of XSmad4s. Each probe was confirmed not to cross-hybridize to the other (data not shown). XSmad4α mRNA was markedly increased by zygotic expression after the blastula stage, whereas XSmad4β mRNA was highly abundant in eggs and was decreased during the gastrula stage, although both transcripts were detected throughout early embryogenesis (Fig.2 A). Thus, XSmad4α mRNA and XSmad4β mRNA are expressed differently during early development. The spatial expression of XSmad4α and XSmad4β was examined by whole mount in situ hybridization with the probes (Fig. 2,B–G). Both XSmad4α and XSmad4β mRNAs are ubiquitously expressed in the ectoderm at the early gastrula stage (Fig. 2, B and E) but become restricted to the neuroectoderm at the neurula stage (Fig. 2, C andF). In the tadpole stage, both of the XSmad4s are expressed in the central nervous system, eye, and otic vesicle (Fig. 2,D and G). XSmad4β is expressed more anteriorly than XSmad4α in the neural tube. To examine whether XSmad4α and XSmad4β act as co-Smad to cooperate with Smad1 and Smad2 to mediate BMP-like and TGF-β/activin-like responses, respectively, we first analyzed the expression of several marker genes in animal caps obtained from Xenopus embryos injected with synthetic mRNAs encoding XSmad4α or XSmad4β combined with Xenopus Smad1 or Xenopus Smad2. Injection of a low dose of XSmad1, XSmad2, XSmad4α, or XSmad4β mRNA alone was not sufficient to induce any noticeable expression of mesodermal genes (Fig. 3 A). When XSmad1 mRNA was injected together with either XSmad4α or XSmad4β mRNA, however, strong expression of a ventral mesodermal marker, α globin, was induced. Similarly, when XSmad2 mRNA was injected with either of the XSmad4 mRNAs, dorsal mesodermal markers, goosecoid and muscle actin, and a pan-mesodermal marker,Xenopus brachyury, were strongly induced (Fig.3 A). Because the carboxyl-terminal truncated form of human Smad4 has been shown to act as a dominant-negative inhibitor for signal transductions (15Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we next examined the action of carboxyl-terminal truncated constructs of XSmad4α and XSmad4β in the animal cap assay. Injection of a high dose of XSmad1 or XSmad2 mRNA was sufficient to induce expression of ventral or dorsal mesodermal marker genes, respectively. When either XSmad4α ΔC or XSmad4β ΔC mRNA was injected along with XSmad1 or XSmad2, the expression of these marker genes was significantly suppressed (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that XSmad4α and XSmad4β can function as common partners for pathway-restricted Smads to induce expression of specific marker genes in Xenopus animal caps. To elucidate more directly the cooperativity of XSmad4α and XSmad4β with XSmad1 and XSmad2, we tested the ability of the Smads to induce the reporter gene expression under the BMP- and TGF-β-responsive promoters in cultured cells. Transfection of XSmad1 alone into C2C12 mouse myoblast cells induced a low level of luciferase expression under the promoter of Xvent-2, a BMP-inducible Xenopushomeobox gene (38Onichtchouk D. Gawantka V. Dosch R. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1996; 122: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Candia A.F. Watabe T. Hawley S.H. Onichtchouk D. Zhang Y. Derynck R. Niehrs C. Cho K.W. Development. 1997; 124: 4467-4480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, co-expression of XSmad4α and XSmad4β, but not XSmad4α ΔCor XSmad4βΔC, together with XSmad1 induced a high level of the reporter gene expression (Fig.4 A). Similarly, both XSmad4α and XSmad4β synergized with XSmad2 to induce luciferase expression under the TGF-β-responsive 3TP reporter, whereas the carboxyl-terminal truncated constructs did not (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that XSmad4α and XSmad4β act synergistically with XSmad1 and XSmad2 to induce gene expression in cultured cells. As XSmad4α and XSmad4β functionally cooperated with XSmad1 and XSmad2, we would expect that XSmad4α and XSmad4β bind to XSmad1 and XSmad2 to form heteromeric complexes. To examine this hypothesis, we co-expressed Myc-tagged XSmad4s with HA-tagged XSmad1 or XSmad2 in C2C12 cells and subjected the obtained cell lysates to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. The results showed that in response to BMP treatment, XSmad1 associates with either of the two XSmad4s (Fig.5 A, upper panel) and that in response to TGF-β stimulation, XSmad2 associates with either of the two XSmad4s (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). Thus, both XSmad4α and XSmad4β are able to form heteromeric complexes with XSmad1 or XSmad2 in response to specific stimulation. We next assessed whether the extent of the ligand-induced association of XSmad4s with XSmad1 or XSmad2 would differ between XSmad4α and XSmad4β. The association of XSmad2 with XSmad4α occurred at the same level as with XSmad4β in a manner dependent on the TGF-β concentration (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). In contrast, the association of XSmad1 with XSmad4β in response to BMP stimulation occurred more strongly than with XSmad4α (Fig.5 B, upper panel). This may suggest that although both of the XSmad4s can function as common partners of XSmad1 and XSmad2, they do not have completely redundant functions, and XSmad4β may play a major role in BMP signaling. The crystallographic structure analysis of the MH2 domain of human Smad4 implied that Smad4 was able to form a homotrimer (40Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). To examine whether XSmad4α and XSmad4β form a heteromeric complex, we co-expressed both XSmad4α and XSmad4β tagged with different epitopes in C2C12 cells. Stimulation-independent hetero-oligomerization as well as homo-oligomerization was observed (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, it is possible that XSmad4α and XSmad4β form a heteromeric trimer. It may also be possible that after stimulation, XSmad4α, XSmad4β, and one of the pathway-restricted Smads form a heteromeric trimer. When expressed in C2C12 cells, XSmad4α and XSmad4β proteins showed different subcellular distribution. XSmad4α was present predominantly in the cytoplasm whereas XSmad4β was predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 6). Because it has been demonstrated that human Smad4 and a Drosophila co-Smad, Medea, are present in the cytoplasm in the absence of stimulation (25Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar,41Wisotzkey R.G. Mehra A. Sutherland D.J. Dobens L.L. Liu X. Dohrmann C. Attisano L. Raftery L.A. Development. 1998; 125: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the above result may again indicate that XSmad4α is aXenopus ortholog of a previously known Smad4. XSmad4α became localized to the nucleus in more than 60% of the cells after TGF-β stimulation when XSmad2 was co-expressed (Fig. 6,top). Hence, the expression of XSmad2 is required for XSmad4α to change its subcellular localization in response to TGF-β under the conditions. In contrast, subcellular localization of XSmad4β did not change after TGF-β stimulation, irrespective of co-expression of XSmad2 (Fig. 6, bottom). In addition to the high degree of diversity in the linker region, another striking difference in the amino acid sequence between XSmad4α and XSmad4β is found in their carboxyl termini. The SSVN sequence in XSmad4β (see Fig. 1 B) is similar to the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation motif (SS(V/M)S) of pathway-restricted Smads in which the last two serine residues undergo phosphorylation upon stimulation (42Abdollah S.

We then examined whether XSmad4β could be phosphorylated. Myc epitope-tagged XSmads were transfected into C2C12 cells, and the cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with TGF-β. An increase in XSmad2 phosphorylation after TGF-β treatment was observed, as determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody followed by autoradiography (Fig.7). No or little phosphorylation of XSmad4α was observed before or after TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 7). On the contrary, phosphorylation of XSmad4β was observed even before stimulation, and its level did not increase after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 7). To explore the possible involvement of the SSVN sequence of XSmad4β in its phosphorylation, we constructed a mutant XSmad4β having an AAVN sequence instead of SSVN at its carboxyl terminus. This mutant was still phosphorylated irrespective of TGF-β stimulation, and no decrease in the phosphorylation level was observed by this mutation (Fig. 7). Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal SSVN sequence of XSmad4β is not phosphorylated, and XSmad4β may not be a direct substrate of the TGF-β receptor. To find the functional difference between the two XSmad4s, we tested the effect of expression of XSmad4 in Xenopus embryos. Injection of XSmad4β mRNA, but not XSmad4α mRNA, into two dorsal cells of the 4-cell stage embryos led to strong ventralization, as revealed by the defects in anterior structures at the late stage (Fig.8 A). Similar phenotypes were reported to be induced by expressing Smad1 or Smad5 (16Thomsen G.H. Development. 1996; 122: 2359-2366PubMed Google Scholar, 22Suzuki A. Chang C. Yingling J.M. Wang X.F. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Injection of either of the mRNAs into the ventral side had little or no effect on the embryonic development (Fig. 8 A). The ventralizing effect of XSmad4β, when expressed in the dorsal marginal region, was dose-dependent. This was clearly demonstrated by semiquantification by scoring the dorsoanterior index (DAI) of the embryos (44Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), where 5 represents a normal embryo and 0 indicates an embryo lacking axial structures (Fig. 8 B). We confirmed that XSmad4α and XSmad4β were expressed at almost the same level in this series of experiments (Fig. 8 C). In addition to the defects in anterior structures, injection of XSmad4β mRNA into dorsal marginal cells induced an increase in the expression of a ventral mesodermal marker, Xvent-2, and a decrease in the expression of a dorsal mesodermal marker, goosecoid, more strongly than did XSmad4α mRNA, as analyzed in isolated dorsal marginal zone explants (Fig.8 D). These results indicate that the two XSmad4 proteins have distinct abilities to induce ventralization in Xenopusembryos. Smad4/DPC4 has been shown to be required as a common partner for pathway-restricted Smads to propagate the TGF-β family signals from the cell surface receptors to the nucleus by forming heteromeric complexes. Here we have identified a novel Smad4-like molecule, XSmad4β, as well as a Xenopus homolog of mammalian Smad4 (XSmad4α), and shown that both of the XSmad4s are able to function as co-Smad to cooperate and synergize with XSmad1 and XSmad2. However, they have distinct properties in terms of their temporal expression during early embryogenesis, subcellular distribution, phosphorylation state, and ventralizing activity in Xenopus embryos. Therefore, it is likely that two co-Smads, XSmad4α and XSmad4β, play both overlapping and distinct roles in transducing a set of TGF-β superfamily signals in Xenopus. We reasoned from their subcellular distribution as well as their amino acid sequence similarity to human or mouse Smad4 that XSmad4α was aXenopus ortholog of mammalian Smad4 and XSmad4β was a novel homolog. XSmad4α localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and translocated to the nucleus after stimulation when a pathway-restricted Smad was co-expressed (Fig. 6). This behavior is the same as that previously reported for human Smad4 (25Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In contrast, XSmad4β was present predominantly in the nucleus before or after stimulation. The subcellular distribution of either of the XSmad4s was not affected when the other XSmad4 was co-expressed in cells (data not shown), although they could bind to each other to form the XSmad4α-XSmad4β complexin vitro (Fig. 5 C). Although we do not know the functional significance of their different subcellular localizations, the possible formation of the heteromeric complex between XSmad4α and XSmad4β after the nuclear entry of XSmad4α in response to stimulation might have some physiological significance. An intriguing question is whether or not the existence of the second co-Smad is specific to Xenopus. At present, there is no evidence for the existence of another Smad4-like gene in mammals. We could not find any related genes in the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST). Smad4 knockout mice were shown to die early in their development (29Sirard C. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Itie A.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3667-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and the Smad4-deficient cells lost responsiveness to the TGF-β superfamily (45Zhou S. Buckhaults P. Zawel L. Bunz F. Riggins G. Le Dai J. Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2412-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover, lack of Smad4 in colon cancer cells leads to an increase in metastasis and malignancy, which suggests that Smad4 has a tumor-suppressing function (46Takaku K. Oshima M. Miyoshi H. Matsui M. Seldin M.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that if mammals have the second co-Smad, its function may be distinct from that of Smad4/DPC4. The Xenopus system has been extensively used to elucidate the cellular signaling mechanism of growth factors, including the TGF-β superfamily, that control cell differentiation and pattern formation during early embryogenesis (47Sive H.L. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 48Dawid I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6259-6262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Kessler D.S. Melton D.A.

It has been suggested that activin, nodal, and Vg1, members of the TGF-β superfamily, are involved in the differentiation of dorsal mesodermal tissues, whereas the BMP family ligands regulate the ventral mesoderm differentiation inXenopus early development. Xenopus homologs of Smad1 and Smad2 have been identified and shown to mediate activin and BMP signaling pathways, respectively (10Graff J.M. Bansal A. Melton D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 12Baker J.C. Harland R.M.

(39Candia A.F. Watabe T. Hawley S.H. Onichtchouk D. Zhang Y. Derynck R. Niehrs C. Cho K.W. Development. 1997; 124: 4467-4480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed that the expression of an excess amount of human Smad4 in Xenopus embryos compromised the antagonism between the activin/Vg1 and BMP pathways. They proposed an attractive model, which supports the theory that the activin/Vg1 and BMP pathways modulate each other's activity by sequestering a limited pool of Smad4, which commonly participates in both pathways by associating with Smad2 and Smad1, respectively. As human Smad4 corresponds to XSmad4α, XSmad4α may be commonly used as a co-Smad for both pathways, or a putative heteromeric complex between XSmad4α and XSmad4β may be a common partner for both XSmad1 and XSmad2. These considerations may be consistent with our idea that XSmad4α and XSmad4β have overlapping but somewhat distinct functions as co-Smads. Thus the observations of Candia et al. are not inconsistent with our idea that XSmad4β may be rather preferentially used for the BMP pathway, which was derived from our results showing that XSmad4β binds to XSmad1 more tightly than does XSmad4α and that XSmad4β has the more potent ventralizing activity. Although we still do not know the molecular mechanism that defines the distinct ability between XSmad4α and XSmad4β in cooperation with XSmad1 and XSmad2, it is likely that some factors interact specifically with each of the XSmad4s. It is also possible that phosphorylation of XSmad4β might have some role in regulating the function of XSmad4β. We are currently investigating the mechanisms that underlie the difference between XSmad4α and XSmad4β in their cooperativity with pathway-restricted Smads, as well as the molecular basis for determining their subcellular localization.

To test whether cpSecY forms the protein-conducting channel of the thylakoid membrane, translocation assays were conducted with the SecA-dependent substrate OE33 and the SecA-independent substrate OE23, in the presence and absence of antibodies raised against cpSecY. The antibodies inhibited translocation of OE33 but not OE23, indicating that cpSecY comprises the protein-conducting channel used in the SecA-dependent pathway, whereas a distinct protein conducting channel is used to translocate OE23.

Nuclear encoded thylakoid proteins are first targeted to the chloroplast by means of the transit peptide, which initiates the translocation of the protein across the envelope membranes into the stroma (1Schnell D.J. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1998; 49: 97-126Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Translation initiation of chloroplast encoded thylakoid proteins appears to occur in the stroma (2Klein R.R.

Considerable progress has been made in defining mechanisms by which nuclear encoded thylakoid proteins insert or translocate posttranslationally across the membrane. One class of proteins insert into the membrane in the absence of an energy supply, soluble factors, or membrane components (5Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B.

Little is known about the targeting of chloroplast encoded proteins; however, it is likely that they share many of the same translocation components described above (21Voelker R. Barkan A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Mould R.M. Knight J.S. Bogsch E. Gray J.C. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Wu G.J.

However, membrane components remain to be elucidated for the ΔpH, cpSec, and cpSRP pathways. Protein export across the bacterial inner membrane is catalyzed by a membrane-embedded translocation apparatus consisting of SecY, SecE, SecG, SecF, SecD, and YajC in conjunction with the peripheral protein, SecA (25Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The essential core of the translocase is SecY/SecE and SecA (27Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 28Akimaru J. Matsuyama S.I. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6545-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). SecY/E form a transmembrane channel through which the exported protein is threaded (29Wickner W. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). SecA is thought to act like a piston, pushing the protein through the membrane channel (30Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 31Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Bacteria also contain an SRP, and recently it was shown that polytopic membrane proteins are dependent on this complex for insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane (32Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that the Sec translocase is utilized in the bacterial SRP pathway. Thus, the SRP- and SecY-dependent pathways converge at SecY (33Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. deGier J.W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Bacteria also contain a pathway for exporting proteins across the inner membrane independently of SecY (34Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Proteins that utilize this pathway have a twin arginine motif at the N terminus (34Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 35Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), as do proteins that utilize the ΔpH pathway in chloroplasts (36Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After Hcf106 was identified as a membrane component of the ΔpH pathway (13Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Voelker R. Barkan A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it became clear that two bacterial homologues, now designated TatA and TatE, also exist (13Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A.

Deletion of tatA/Einactivates transport of proteins containing a twin arginine motif but has no affect on Sec-dependent proteins (37Sargent F. Bogsch E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, it was shown that the ΔpH pathway first described in chloroplasts also exists in bacteria (13Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 34Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F.

Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In addition to SecA, chloroplasts contain a thylakoid protein related to SecY (39Laidler V. Chaddock A.M. Knott T.G. Walker D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17664-17667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the cpSec translocase is largely uncharacterized. It has been assumed, although it remains to be shown, that cpSecY is part of the translocase that translocates SecA-dependent substrates. Furthermore, it is not known whether there is convergence of the SRP- and ΔpH-dependent targeting pathways at the level of SecY. Genetic experiments with maize mutants support the idea of pathway convergence, as SecY mutants have a more severe phenotype than SecA/Hcf106 double mutants (40Roy L.M. Barkan A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this report, we have characterized a putative cpSecE homologue, and we establish that this protein indeed is a chloroplast protein that forms a complex with cpSecY. Furthermore, we have raised antibodies against cpSecY and have used these antibodies to address whether SecA and ΔpH-dependent proteins both utilize SecY for their translocation across thylakoid membranes. Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) was grown in a growth chamber in a 16 h light/22 °C temperatureversus 8 h dark/18 °C temperature cycle. The light intensity during the light period was 60 μE m−2s−2. Digitonin (Calbiochem, high purity) was solubilized as a 10% stock solution in boiling ddH2O and kept at 95 °C for 15 min. After cooling the solution was spun for 10 min in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was used as stock solution. Radiolabeled ArabidopsiscpSecE precursor (pcpSecE), the intermediate form of wheat OE33 (iOE33), and wheat OE23 precursor (pOE23) were prepared by in vitro transcription and translation by using SP6 polymerase and [35S]methionine as described (41Adam Z. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The forward primer 5′-CCACATGTCACTAACCGCACAATTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTCACATCATGCTGAAGAAGTCTTGAAC-3′ were used to amplify the gene encoding cpSecE (Cse) from Arabidopsis genomic DNA by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). To enhance radiolabeling, the amplified Cse PCR product was designed to contain two additional methionine residues at the C terminus. The PCR product was digested with AflIII and HindIII and cloned into the NcoI-HindIII site of the translation vector pGem4SS6.5NcoI (17Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the plasmid pGem4SS6.5NcoIcpSecE. For overexpression of cpSecE, a N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged version was constructed. Cse was amplified from pGem4SS6.5NcoIcpSecE by using the forward primer 5′-CCACATGTCACTAACCGCACAATTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGGGATCCATGTCACTAACCGCACAATTC-3′. The PCR product was digested withHindIII and BamHI and cloned into theHindIII-BamHI site of the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). The resulting plasmid (pQE30cpSecE) was transformed into SG13009 cells. SG13009 cells containing pQE30cpSecE were grown to an A 600 of ∼0.6 and incubated with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside overnight. Cells were harvested, frozen and lysed in Buffer B (8 m urea, 100 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) + 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The histidine-tagged cpSecE was bound to Ni2+-NTA agarose; the column was washed three times with Buffer B and one time with Buffer C (8 m urea, 100 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 6.3) and eluted with Buffer C + 250 mm imidazole. The eluted cpSecE was further purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The major 26-kDa band was excised from acrylamide gels and used to raise antibodies in chicken (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). Antibodies against cpSecY were raised in rabbits injected with the synthetic peptide CYKNIEFYELDKYDP, corresponding to the C terminus ofArabidopsis cpSecY, fused to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Immunoblot analysis was done as described in Ref. 42Pilgrim M.L. Wijk K.-J.v. Parry D.H. Sy D.A.C. Hoffman N.E. Plant J. 1998; 13: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. For cpSecE detection, crude antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:750. For cpSecY detection, the IgG fraction purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and diethyl aminoethyl (DEAE)-Sephadex (43Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar) was used at a dilution of 1:3500. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (42Pilgrim M.L.

Arabidopsis leaf tissue (10 g of fresh weight, 4–6 weeks old) was ground in 400 ml of 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 330 mm sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.05% bovine serum albumin in a polytron (Calbiochem) and the homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth. The filtrate was centrifuged for 5 min at 2600 × g. The pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 330 mmsorbitol and centrifuged for 5 min at 2600 × g. Afterward, the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2 (HM buffer) and kept on ice for 10 min. Thylakoids were pelleted by centrifuging for 5 min at 2600 × g and washed two times in HM buffer. Finally the thylakoids were resuspended at 1 mg of chl/ml in HM buffer for translocation experiments or at 2 mg of chl/ml in 20 mmHepes, pH 8.0, for other experiments, respectively. 150 μl of thylakoids (2 mg of chl/ml in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0) and an equal volume of detergent solution (4% digitonin in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were mixed and incubated on ice for 30 min. Solubilized thylakoid membrane proteins were separated from membranes by centrifuging for 10 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated with 1.6 mg of anti-cpSecY IgGs cross-linked to 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads (43Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were transferred into Wizard minicolumns (Promega) and washed with 1 ml of 1% digitonin in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl followed by 4 ml of 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl. Excess fluid was removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and the proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 8 m urea in 2× sample buffer. Import of cpSecE into pea chloroplasts, treatment of intact chloroplasts with 0.1 mg/ml thermolysin, and fractionation of chloroplasts into thylakoids and stroma were done according to Ref. 44Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Translocation of iOE33 and pOE23 was essentially done as described (45Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3251-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arabidopsisthylakoids were prepared as described above. For inhibition of the translocation with anti-SecY antibodies, thylakoids (45 μg chl) were incubated with the indicated amounts of purified total IgGs (12 μg protein/μl) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The membranes were washed one time in HM buffer and resuspended at 1 mg of chl/ml in HM buffer (for pOE23) or pea stroma (for iOE33). Pea stroma was prepared as described (44Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by lysing chloroplasts containing 2 mg of chl in 1 ml of HM buffer. 45 μl of the thylakoid suspension were incubated with 5 μlin vitro translated iOE33 or pOE23 and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C under illumination (100 μmol m−2s−2). Assays for iOE33 translocation additionally contained 4 mm ATP. After incubation samples were digested with 0.2 mg/ml thermolysin for 1 h on ice. Thylakoids were washed with 1 ml of HM buffer and resuspended in 25 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer. For documentation, gels were developed by fluorography using either autofluor (National Diagnostics, Manville, NJ) or 20% 2,5-diphenyloxazole in acetic acid (46Perry S.E. Li H.M. Keegstra K. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For quantification gels were scanned by a PhosphorImager and quantitated using Imagequant software from Molecular Dynamics. SecE is an essential protein in bacteria (47Schatz P.J. Riggs P.D.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Most forms of SecE contain a single transmembrane domain at the C terminus, unlike Escherichia coli, which contains three transmembrane domains (49Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Görlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The highest sequence conservation between homologues occurs at the cytoplasmic domain just preceding the transmembrane domain (49Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Görlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A.

Mutational analysis in E. coli has revealed that the conserved region followed by a generic transmembrane domain is essential for SecE function (50Pohlschröder M. Murphy C. Beckwith J. J. Biol.

They noted that one of the hypothetical open reading frames has similarity to SecE preprotein translocase (GenBankTM accession number,Z97337). Fig. 1 shows an alignment of theArabidopsis hypothetical protein and bacterial SecE sequences. The putative protein most resembles SecE fromThermotoga maritimus, in which the overall similarity is 28%, and similarity is 69% between residues 111 and 173. Like other SecE proteins, the Arabidopsis sequence predicts a protein with a single transmembrane domain at the C terminus with type II topology. The putative SecE protein is predicted to have a chloroplast transit peptide with a processing site between residues 38 and 39 based on the ChloroP transit peptide prediction program (53Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). To test this prediction, radiolabeled putative SecE protein (Fig.2, lane 1) was incubated with isolated pea chloroplasts for 30 min. Nonimported protein was degraded by protease treatment, and chloroplasts were fractionated into stroma and thylakoids. As shown in Fig. 2, lane 3, a smaller, protease-resistant 16-kDa protein was present in the thylakoid fraction consistent with the size of the product predicted by ChloroP (15 kDa). That the putative SecE clone encodes a chloroplast protein was further established by immunoblot analysis. Antibodies that were raised against recombinant protein expressed from the putative SecE clone cross-reacted with a 16-kDa thylakoid protein that had the same apparent molecular weight as the imported protein (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). The protein could not be extracted from the thylakoid membrane by incubation of the membranes with 0.1n NaOH (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that cpSecE is an integral membrane protein, as predicted from the sequence analysis (Fig. 1). Together, these experiments indicate that the putative SecE protein is encoded as a precursor containing a functional chloroplast transit peptide and the mature protein is localized in the thylakoid membrane. To test whether cpSecE forms a complex with cpSecY, we examined whether the two proteins co-chromatographed and co-immunoprecipitated after detergent solubilization of thylakoid membranes. To facilitate this analysis, polyclonal antibodies were raised against a C-terminal peptide ofArabidopsis cpSecY. These antibodies reacted with a single protein in wheat germ translation extracts containing cpSecY precursor (Fig. 3) but did not cross-react with any proteins in wheat germ extract (data not shown) and reacted with a single 44-kDa protein found in the thylakoid membrane fraction after alkali extraction (Fig. 3), consistent with the fact that SecY is an integral membrane protein with 10 putative transmembrane helices (54Ito K. J. Bioenerg Biomembr. 1990; 22: 353-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membrane proteins were solubilized with 2% digitonin, at approximately 70% efficiency, and the extracted proteins were separated by gel filtration chromatography. The relative amount of cpSecY and cpSecE in the various fractions was determined by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against cpSecY and cpSecE, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, both proteins co-eluted in a single peak as higher molecular mass species of approximately 180 kDa. These data suggest either that other subunits are present or multiple copies of SecY and SecE are present in each complex. Furthermore, these data indicate that most, if not all, cpSecY and cpSecE are associated. A similar conclusion is reached by the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Antibodies raised against cpSecY were used to immunoprecipitate the digitonin-solubilized complex, and cpSecY and cpSecE in the supernatant and precipitate were detected by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, cpSecY and cpSecE were quantitatively removed from the solubilized thylakoid proteins by the anti-cpSecY antibody and were recovered in the immunoprecipitate, whereas none of the proteins were precipitated by an irrelevant antiserum. cpSecY/E complex was not stable in 1% octylglucoside/dodecylmaltoside (1:1) or 1% Triton X-100 (data not shown). Where reconstitution of the translocase has been successful, digitonin has also been the detergent of choice (25Duong F. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4871-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 55Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). It is well established that trypsin treatment of thylakoid membranes inhibits the translocation of proteins across the thylakoid membrane (6Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 56Fulson D. Cline K. Plant. Physiol. 1988; 88: 1146-1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A likely target of trypsin action is the Sec translocase. To examine whether trypsin cleaves SecY, we performed immunoblot analysis on trypsin treated thylakoids. Fig. 6 reveals that SecY is indeed cleaved by levels of trypsin that efficiently inactivate translocation or integration of proteins into the thylakoid membrane. To address whether cpSecY is a component of the translocon mediating the translocation of substrates on the Sec or ΔpH pathways, we took advantage of the fact that the anti-cpSecY antibody recognized the native cpSecY (Fig. 5). Assuming that the C terminus of SecY faces the stroma, these antibodies should bind and conceivably inhibit SecY activity. Antibodies against cpSecY and cpSecE failed to recognize the corresponding proteins in pea and spinach, necessitating the use of Arabidopsis thylakoids in the assays. To improve yields, Arabidopsis thylakoids were isolated directly from leaf tissue and not from intact chloroplasts. Pea stroma was used as the source of SecA. The substrate for the sec pathway, wheat iOE33, was efficiently translocated into the lumen ofArabidopsis thylakoids and processed to the mature size (Fig. 7 A, lanes 1 and2). Little to no translocation occurred in the absence of stroma, as shown in lane 3. When thylakoids were preincubated with increasing amounts of anti-cpSecY antibodies, translocation was progressively inhibited (Fig. 7 A, lanes 4–7). However, the inhibition could be relieved by adding an excess of cpSecY peptide antigen during the antibody pretreatment (Fig.7 A, lane 8). Furthermore, antibodies against an irrelevant protein, cpSRP54, were not inhibitory (Fig. 7 A, lane 9). Thus, the antibody effect was specific for cpSecY. These data provide the first direct demonstration that the Sec pathway substrate, iOE33, utilizes cpSecY for translocation. These data also suggest that cpSecY has a similar topology as the bacterial homologue, where the N and C termini are in the stroma (or the cis side of the membrane). The substrate for the ΔpH pathway, wheat pOE23, was also efficiently translocated into the thylakoid lumen and was processed to the mature form (Fig. 7 B, lanes 1 and 2). The translocation of pOE23 was dependent on the ΔpH, as demonstrated by the complete inhibition resulting from CCCP addition (Fig. 7 B, lane 3). In contrast to the results seen with the Sec substrate, preincubation of the thylakoids with increasing amounts of anti-cpSecY antibodies had no affect on pOE23 translocation (Fig. 7 B, lanes 4–7). This result demonstrates that pOE23 and probably other substrates of the ΔpH pathway are translocated via a translocon lacking cpSecY. Thus, the ΔpH and Sec pathways are parallel and do not converge at cpSecY in the thylakoid membrane. This work clearly establishes the existence of a chloroplast localized SecE protein that is tightly associated with cpSecY. Thus, we can conclude that at a minimum, chloroplasts contain all the core elements of the Sec translocase: SecY, SecA, and SecE. The core elements of the Sec related translocase of the ER include Sec61α (a homologue of SecY), Sec61γ (a homologue of SecE), and Sec61β (49Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Görlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Three to four of these heterotrimers form a pore-like structure in the ER (57Hanein D. Matlack K.E.S.

Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) that remains stable after solubilization with digitonin. Solubilization of the thylakoid membrane using the same detergent releases a 180-kDa complex that contains SecY and SecE. This complex may consist of multiple copies of SecY/E dimers forming a ring-like structure, like those seen after purification of the ER-complex, and may also include additional subunits, e.g. a SecG homologue. An important goal for future work will be to establish the subunit composition and stoichiometry of the proteins in the complex. Several lines of evidence have indicated that there are multiple pathways for targeting proteins to the thylakoid membrane (reviewed in Refs. 1Schnell D.J. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1998; 49: 97-126Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 59Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, and 60Robinson C. Mant A. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 431-437Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). First, in vitro studies indicated that substrates fall into distinct classes with regard to their ability to act as competitors of protein targeting to the thylakoid membrane (11Cline K. Henry R. Li C.J. Yuan J.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Second, each of these classes has distinct energetic requirements for protein targeting (10Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Third, genetic studies largely corroborate the in vitro studies; loss of Hcf106, SecA, or cpSRP43 resulted in selective reductions in the proteins shown to be substrates for the ΔpH, Sec, and cpSRP pathways, respectively (12Voelker R. Barkan A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D.G.

However, these studies did not exclude the possibility that SecY was common to all pathways. It has been observed that the targeting information specifying the ΔpH versus the Sec pathway is present in the transit peptide (36Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 63Robinson C. Cai D. Hulford A. Brock L.W. Michl D. Hazell L. Schmidt I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B.

Biochem. 1997; 245: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and when a Sec transit peptide is used to direct a ΔpH protein to the Sec translocase, the protein fails to be translocated across the thylakoid membrane (63Robinson C. Cai D. Hulford A. Brock L.W. Michl D. Hazell L. Schmidt I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,65Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X.Y. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it has been postulated that substrates using the ΔpH pathway are unable to translocate through the Sec system, and hence a distinct translocase may be employed by the ΔpH pathway (65Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X.Y. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The results from this paper clearly establish the validity of this hypothesis, as convergence at the level of the Sec translocase does not occur for the ΔpH pathway. To test whether convergence occurs for the cpSRP pathway, considerable effort was made to reconstitute LHCP integration inArabidopsis thylakoids supplemented with pea stroma. Unfortunately, thylakoids that translocated OE33 and OE23 failed to integrate LHCP. Arabidopsis thylakoids added to pea thylakoids efficiently inhibited LHCP integration into the pea thylakoids, and the inhibition could be overcome by treatment of theArabidopsis thylakoids with alkylating agents. Thus, it appears that the Arabidopsis thylakoids possess an inhibitory activity that may act on either the pea stroma or thylakoids to prevent LHCP integration. Plants that lack cpSRP are viable and contain elevated levels of cpSecY, 3P. Amin, D. Sy, M. Pilgrim, D. Parry, L. Nussaume, and N. E. Hoffman, submitted for publication. suggesting the possibility that the increases observed in the mutant compensate for the loss of targeting efficiency resulting from the absence of cpSRP. Alternatively, the elevated level of cpSecY could indicate that cpSecY forms an alternative pathway for the cpSRP-dependent substrates. However, if the cpSRP delivers its substrate to cpSecY, it must use the translocase independently of SecA, as LHCP integration is not inhibited by azide, which inhibits SecA activity (11Cline K. Henry R. Li C.J. Yuan J.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), LHCP integration is not competed by SecA-dependent substrates (11Cline K. Henry R. Li C.J. Yuan J.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and LHCP levels are not reduced in SecA mutants (12Voelker R. Barkan A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the possibility that the SecY/E core has activity in the absence of SecA. Whereas loss of either SecA and SecY is lethal, the phenotype of the SecY mutant is more severe than the SecA mutant or even the SecA/Hcf106 double mutant (40Roy L.M. Barkan A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This observation is also consistent with the notion that cpSecY/E has a residual activity in the absence of SecA.

The content of PMP70 in the transfectants increased about 5-fold when compared with the control cells. A subcellular fractionation study showed that overexpressed PMP70 was enriched in peroxisomes. This peroxisomal localization was confirmed by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. The number of immuno-gold particles corresponding to PMP70 on peroxisomes increased markedly in the transfectants, but the size and the number of peroxisomes were essentially the same in both the transfectants and the control cells. β-Oxidation of palmitic acid increased about 2–3-fold in the transfectants, whereas the oxidation of lignoceric acid decreased about 30–40%. When intact peroxisomes prepared from both the cell lines were incubated with palmitoyl-CoA, oxidation was stimulated with ATP, but the degree of the stimulation was higher in the transfectants than in the control cells. Furthermore, we established three Chinese hamster ovary cell lines stably expressing mutant PMP70. In these cells, β-oxidation of palmitic acid decreased markedly. These results suggest that PMP70 is involved in metabolic transport of long chain acyl-CoA across peroxisomal membranes and that increase of PMP70 is not associated with proliferation of peroxisomes.

The peroxisomes are involved in a variety of metabolic processes including peroxide-based respiration, oxidative degradation of fatty acids and purine, and synthesis of plasmalogen and bile acids (1Van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Early studies on rat liver peroxisomes led to the concept that peroxisomes are freely permeable to compounds of low molecular weight (2de Duve C. Baudhuin P. Physiol. Rev. 1966; 46: 323-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 3Van Veldhoven P.P. Just W.W. Mannaerts G.P J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Van Roermund et al. (4Van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) suggested recently that some metabolites were unable to permeate the membrane of peroxisomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The peroxisomal membrane in human fibroblasts has been also shown not to be freely permeable to at least one of the substrates of acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase, unless ATP is present (5Wolvetang E.J. Tager J.M. Wanders R.J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, the exchange of metabolites between peroxisomes and cytosol seems to require specific transporters.The 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70)1 is a major component of peroxisomal membranes and markedly induced by the administration of hypolipidemic agents, and its induction parallels peroxisome proliferation and induction of peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes (6Hashimoto T.

A defect in ALDP is known to be responsible for the X chromosome-linked neurodegeneration disorder adrenoleukodystrophy; this defect is an inborn error of peroxisomal β-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (18Aubourg P.

The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2325-2349Google Scholar). Mutations in the PMP70 gene have been identified in one complementation group (group 1) of Zellweger syndrome, an inborn error of peroxisome biogenesis, and it is suggested that PMP70 has an important role in peroxisome assembly (12Gärtner J. Moser H. Valle D. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, a recent study of complementation group 1 probands by Southern blotting and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) of reverse transcription-PCR fragments failed to detect PMP70 mutations (20Paton B.C. Heron S.E. Nelson P.V. Morris C.P. Poulos A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1535-1539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not clear whether PMP70 is associated with biogenesis of peroxisomes. On the other hand, the fact that inducibility of PMP70 parallels peroxisome proliferation and induction of peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes suggests that PMP70 participates in proliferation of peroxisomal membranes and/or transport of substrates for peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes.As an approach to determining the role of PMP70 in peroxisome assembly and function, we isolated CHO cells stably overexpressing PMP70 and its mutant forms. We found that PMP70 is involved in metabolic transport of long chain acyl-CoA across the peroxisomal membrane and is not required for proliferation of peroxisomes or peroxisome biogenesis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we overexpressed PMP70 in CHO cells and examined roles of PMP70 in biogenesis and function of peroxisomes. First, subcellular localization of PMP70 overexpressed in CHO cells was investigated because information about peroxisomal localization is essential to the characterization of PMP70. The following findings suggest that the overexpressed PMP70 is enriched in peroxisomes. First, the distribution of overexpressed PMP70 in a sucrose gradient was similar to that of catalase (Fig. 3). Second, the numerous dots detected by immunofluorescent staining of PMP70 in #19 and #31 cells were superimposable on those stained with anti-catalase antibody (Fig.4). Third, the enrichment of immunogold particles corresponding PMP70 on peroxisomes was shown in #19 and #31 cells by immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 5). In light of these results, we further investigated roles of PMP70 in biogenesis and function of peroxisomes.Function of PMP70An early study demonstrated that ATP stimulated overall β-oxidation activity in isolated rat liver peroxisomes (29Thomas J. Debeer L.J. De Schepper P.J. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. J. 1980; 190: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, it is well known that PMP70 is markedly induced by administration of hypolipidemic agents in parallel with the induction of peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes (6Hashimoto T. Kuwabara T. Usuda N. Nagata T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Hartl F.-U. Just W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37Imanaka T. Lazarow P.B. Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the presence of an ATP-dependent acyl-CoA carrier in the peroxisomal membranes and PMP70 may be a carrier of fatty acids or their CoA ester. If PMP70 is a transporter of long chain fatty acids or their CoA ester, its overexpression might stimulate the β-oxidation in peroxisomes. On the other hand, as PMP70 is a half-sized ABC transporter, mutant PMP70 expressed in the cells might interact with wild type PMP70, resulting in the inhibition of peroxisomal β-oxidation. In fact, the rate of β-oxidation of palmitic acid in #19 and #31 cells increased ∼2–3-fold (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the rate of β-oxidation of palmitic acid was markedly decreased by overexpression of all the mutant PMP70 (Fig. 8). It seems unlikely that the increase of β-oxidation activity in #19 and #31 cells is because of the induction of peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes or increase in the permeability of peroxisomal membranes because the amount of peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes was essentially the same in Neo, #19, and #31 cells (Fig. 2), as was the latency of catalase in isolated peroxisomes (data not shown). Furthermore, the rate of β-oxidation of lignoceric acid decreased in CHO cells overexpressing wild type and mutant PMP70 (Figs. 6 and 8), supporting the idea that increase in nonspecific permeability of fatty acids across peroxisomal membranes did not occur.Because the active site of long chain acyl-CoA synthetase is located outside of peroxisomes (38Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P. Van Broekhoven A. Vandebroek G. Debeer L.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the long chain fatty acids seem to be activated to change to acyl-CoA ester prior to β-oxidation in cells. To define whether PMP70 is involved in the transport of long chain acyl-CoA, we studied β-oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA using isolated peroxisomes prepared from Cont, #19, and #31 cells. Intact peroxisomes showed latency to palmitoyl-CoA oxidation. ATP stimulated the β-oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA when intact peroxisomes were used. The degree of stimulation was higher in the CHO cells overexpressing PMP70 than that in the Neo cells (Fig. 7). The effect of ATP was lost when the peroxisomal membranes were disrupted by the use of Triton X-100 (Fig. 7). Based on these results, we suggest that PMP70 functions as a transporter of long chain acyl-CoA across peroxisomal membranes to serve substrates for β-oxidation, and ATP facilitates the transport of the substrate by PMP70.Another important point addressed by the present study is the functional domain of PMP70. All ABC transporters characterized so far contain the consensus sequence for an ATP binding site (Walker motifs A and B (34Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar, 35Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar)). Walker A is characterized by the simple motif GXXGXGK(T/S), and the lysine as a source of the positive charge is invariant. In the case of PMP70, mutation of this lysine to alanine resulted in marked inhibition of the palmitic acid β-oxidation (Fig. 8 D). The fact that the lysine479 is critical for the PMP70 function suggests that PMP70 possesses ATP binding and hydrolytic activity, which couples to the transport of palmitoyl-CoA. EAA-like motif is a conserved sequence located in the region between the fourth and fifth putative membrane-spanning domains of ABC transporters. Studies of prokaryotic ABC transporters suggest missense mutations, which alter conserved residues, cause loss of transporter function (32Koster W. Bohm B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Kerppola R.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2329-2336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). Our mutant demonstrated that this motif is also critical for the PMP70 function.Recently, two ABC transporters called Pat1p (Pxa2p) and Pat2p (Pxa1p) were identified on peroxisomal membranes of S. cerevisiae(39Bossier P. Fernandes L. Vilela C. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Yeast. 1994; 10: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 40Shani N. Sapag A. Valle D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Disruption of PAT1 and PAT2 resulted in impaired growth on oleic acid and reduced ability to oxidize long chain fatty acids such as oleic acid. Furthermore, a possibility that pat2p is involved in the transport of long chain acyl-CoA was suggested using digitonin-permeabilized yeast cells (44Verleur N. Hettema E.H. Van Roermund C.W.T. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, PMP70 seems to be a counterpart of yeast peroxisomal ABC transporter of Pat1p or Pat2p. However, the functional unit of PMP70 and yeast peroxisomal ABC transporters Pat1p and Pat2p seems to be different. Disruption of PAT1 or PAT2 in yeast cells resulted in impaired growth in oleic acid medium, suggesting that Pat1p and Pat2p function as heterodimers (43Hettema E.H. van Roermund C.W.T.

On the other hand, overexpression of PMP70 alone in CHO cells induced β-oxidation of palmitic acid, suggesting that PMP70 can function as homodimer.Unexpectedly, overexpression of wild type as well as mutant PMP70 suppressed the β-oxidation of lignoceric acid. We don't know the reason for this at present, but one possibility is that because of the overexpression of PMP70, a part of PMP70 may associate with ALDP, although the interaction might be weak and such a heterodimer might reduce the transport activity of lignoceric acids. This possibility is now under investigation.Effect of Overexpression of PMP70 on Structure of PeroxisomesProliferation of peroxisomes parallels induction of PMP70 (6Hashimoto T. Kuwabara T. Usuda N. Nagata T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Hartl F.-U. Just W.W. Arch. Biochem.

A subset of patients with Zellweger syndrome, a peroxisome biogenesis disorder (complementation group 1), has defects at the locus encoding PMP70 (12Gärtner J. Moser H. Valle D. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This observation led us to examine whether PMP70 is involved in proliferation and biogenesis of peroxisomes. To answer this, we analyzed the number and the morphology of peroxisomes by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy using CHO cells overexpressing PMP70. The following results suggest that PMP70 is not involved in such a process. First, the number of punctulate structures corresponding to peroxisomes did not increase on overexpression of PMP70 (Fig. 9). Second, the number of gold particles against PMP70 located on peroxisomes was markedly increased by overexpression of PMP70, but the size and the number of peroxisomes did not increase (Fig. 5). Furthermore, CHO cells expressing C-terminal truncated PMP70 as well as the cells possessing missense mutations of EAA-like and Walker A motifs had morphologically normal peroxisomes (data not shown). Therefore, PMP70 seems not to be necessary for the biogenesis and proliferation of peroxisomes but to be required for the normal function of peroxisomes. Recently, it was revealed that peroxisomes in mammalian cells preferentially oxidized several kinds of lipids, prostanoids such as prostaglandin E2, F2α, and leukotriens (45Diczfalusy U. Alexson S.E.H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Jedlitschky G. Huber M. Völkl A. Müller M. Leier I. Müller J. Lehmann W.-D. Fahimi H.D. Keppler D. J.

Biochem. 1988; 178: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), trihydroxycholestanic acid (48Östlund-Farrants A.-K. Björkhem I. Pedersen J.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and phytanic acid (49Pahan K. Singh I. J.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2062-2070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These substances must be transported into peroxisomes to be oxidized. It would be interesting to know whether PMP70 is involved in the transport of these substances.In this study we found that PMP70 is involved in metabolic transport of long chain fatty acyl-CoA across the peroxisomal membrane and is not required for proliferation of peroxisomes or peroxisome biogenesis using CHO cells stably overexpressing wild and mutant type PMP70. The mechanism by which PMP70 transports long chain acyl-CoA will be the subject of further research. Peroxisomes are organelles bounded by a single membrane that are present in almost all eukaryotic cells. The peroxisomes are involved in a variety of metabolic processes including peroxide-based respiration, oxidative degradation of fatty acids and purine, and synthesis of plasmalogen and bile acids (1Van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Early studies on rat liver peroxisomes led to the concept that peroxisomes are freely permeable to compounds of low molecular weight (2de Duve C. Baudhuin P. Physiol. Rev. 1966; 46: 323-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 3Van Veldhoven P.P. Just W.W. Mannaerts G.P J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4310-4318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Van Roermund et al. (4Van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) suggested recently that some metabolites were unable to permeate the membrane of peroxisomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The peroxisomal membrane in human fibroblasts has been also shown not to be freely permeable to at least one of the substrates of acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase, unless ATP is present (5Wolvetang E.J. Tager J.M. Wanders R.J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, the exchange of metabolites between peroxisomes and cytosol seems to require specific transporters. The 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70)1 is a major component of peroxisomal membranes and markedly induced by the administration of hypolipidemic agents, and its induction parallels peroxisome proliferation and induction of peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes (6Hashimoto T. Kuwabara T. Usuda N. Nagata T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,7Hartl F.-U. Just W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We cloned and sequenced rat PMP70 and found that it was an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter (8Kamijo K. Taketani S. Yokota S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4534-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ABC transporters are a superfamily of membrane-bound proteins whose structure and function have been highly conserved from eubacteria to mammals and catalyze the ATP-dependent transmembrane translocation of a wide variety of substrates, including anti-tumor drugs and several kind of lipids (9Higgins C.F.

Pre-S2 N-glycans were characterized by anion exchange chromatography, methylation analysis, and on target sequential exoglycosidase digestions in combination with MALDI-TOF-MS, demonstrating the presence of partially sialylated diantennary complex-type oligosaccharides. In addition, the pre-S2 domain of M protein, but not that of L protein, was found to be partially O-glycosylated by a Gal(β1–3)GalNAcα-, Neu5Ac(α2–3)Gal(β1–3)GalNAcα-, or GalNAcα-residue. The respective O-glycosylation site was assigned to Thr-37 by digestion with carboxypeptidases in combination with MALDI-TOF-MS and by quadrupole time-of-flight electrospray mass spectrometry. Analytical data further revealed that about 90% of M protein is N-terminally acetylated. human hepatitis B virus bovine serum albumin electrospray ionization hepatitis B virus surface antigen hexose N-acetylhexosamine high pH anion exchange chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry quadrupole time-of-flight high-performance liquid chromatography reversed-phase HPLC M, and L proteins, small, middle and large hepatitis B surface proteins, respectively Neu5Ac(α2–3)Gal(β1–3)GalNAcα-Ser/Thr Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen Gal(β1–3)GalNAcα-Ser/Thr GalNAcα-Ser/Thr woodchuck hepatitis B virus polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Hepatitis B virus (HBV), 1 belonging to the virus family hepadnaviridae, is an important etiological agent of acute and chronic liver disease (1Hollinger F.B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippcott-Raven, Philadelphia1995: 2739-2807Google Scholar, 2Kann M. Gerlich W.H. Collier L. Balows A. Sussman M. Topley & Wilsons Microbiology and Microbial Infections. 9th Ed. Arnold, London1998: 745-774Google Scholar). Chronic HBV infection may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which result in about 1 million deaths per year worldwide. The virus replicates in the liver and is secreted in large amounts of up to 1010particles/ml into the blood (3Heermann K.H. Gerlich W.H. Chudy M. Schaefer S. Thomssen R. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 68-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to 42-nm DNA containing virions, infected hepatocytes produce subviral, noninfectious 22-nm spherical or filamentous particles in vast excess. The envelopes of virions and subviral particles contain varying amounts of three related HBV-encoded (glyco)protein species termed large (L), middle (M), and small (S) proteins, which are together referred to as HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). S protein is the major component of virions and both spherical and filamentous HBsAg particles, while filaments and virions contain more M and, in particular, more L proteins than spheres (4Heermann K.H. Goldmann U. Schwartz W. Seyffarth T. Baumgarten H. Gerlich W.H. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 396-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Heermann K.-H. Gerlich W.H. McLachlan A. Molecular Biology of Hepatitis B Virus. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 109-143Google Scholar). All envelope proteins are produced from a single open reading frame (see Fig. 1 A) by the use of three different translation start sites, dividing this open reading frame into three domains: the amino-terminal pre-S1 domain, which occurs exclusively in the L protein; the pre-S2 domain, which is present in both M and L proteins and forms the amino-terminal end of the M protein; and the S domain, which is common to S, M, and L proteins. All proteins possess a potential N-glycosylation site at Asn-146 of the S domain, which, however, is only partially utilized. Hence, the proteins exist in two isomeric forms, being either glycosylated or nonglycosylated in this position, and migrate as doublets in SDS gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 B). The second potential N-glycosylation site, present at Asn-4 2Amino acid residues derived from the pre-S2 region are underlined throughout. 2Amino acid residues derived from the pre-S2 region are underlined throughout.of the pre-S2 domain, is solely used in the M but not in the L protein (4Heermann K.H. Goldmann U. Schwartz W. Seyffarth T. Baumgarten H. Gerlich W.H. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 396-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to N-glycosylation, pre-S2 domains of HBV M protein expressed in mammalian cell culture (6Rutgers T. Cabezon T. Harford N. Vandebrugge D. Descurieux M. vanOpstal O. vanWijnendaele F.

Virol. 1998; 72: 9978-9985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported to be O-glycosylated in as yet unidentified positions. HBV envelope (glyco)proteins are functionally important during the viral life cycle. L protein mediates binding to human hepatocytes of the virus via its pre-S1 domain (10Neurath A.R. Kent S.B. Strick N. Parker K. Cell. 1986; 46: 429-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 11Pontisso P. Ruvoletto M. Gerlich W. Heermann K. Bardini R. Alberti A. Virology. 1989; 173: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Furthermore, L protein has been shown to be important for virion envelopment and secretion (12Bruss V. Ganem D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In order to fulfill these functions, the pre-S domain of the L protein has a dual topology. During and directly after translation, it is located at the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum and, hence, within the virion after budding. Therefore, L is notN-glycosylated in its pre-S region. Later, L molecules change, in part, their topology by an unknown mechanism, resulting in a surface exposure of pre-S1 and pre-S2 at HBsAg particles and virions (13Bruss V. Lu X. Thomssen R. Gerlich W.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2273-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast, the pre-S2 domain of M protein is translocated cotranslationally to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and is, thus,N-glycosylated. The role of M protein was not clear for a long time. Recent studies provided evidence, however, that M protein glycosylation at Asn-4 of the pre-S2 domain as well as subsequent trimming of this N-glycan play an important role in the secretion of HBV virions (8Werr M. Prange R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 778-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Block T.M. Lu X. Platt F.M. Foster G.R. Gerlich W.H. Blumberg B.S. Dwek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Prevention of M proteinN-glycosylation by either disruption of the Asn-4-X-Ser-6 sequon (16Mehta A. Lu X. Block T.M. Blumberg B.S. Dwek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virology. 1995; 213: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suppressed secretion of HBV particles. Likewise, treatment of cell cultures with inhibitors of the oligosaccharide-trimming enzymes α-glucosidase I and II similarly impaired virion secretion (17Mehta A. Zitzmann N. Rudd P.M. Block T.M. Dwek R.A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 18Block T.M. Lu X. Mehta A.S. Blumberg B.S. Tennant B. Ebling M. Korba B. Lansky D.M. Jacob G.S. Dwek R.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The pre-S2N-glycan mediates an association of the M protein with the chaperone calnexin, whereas the N-glycan linked to Asn-146 of the S domain is not involved in calnexin binding (8Werr M. Prange R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 778-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mehta A. Lu X. Block T.M. Blumberg B.S. Dwek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1822-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is concluded that proper folding and trafficking of the M glycoprotein, assisted by calnexin in a carbohydrate-dependent manner, may play a crucial role in the assembly of virions, whereas secretion of subviral particles is not prevented by glycosylation- and trimming-inhibitors (15Lu X. Mehta A. Dwek R. Butters T. Block T. Virology. 1995; 213: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Mehta A. Lu X. Block T.M. Blumberg B.S. Dwek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pre-S2 N-glycan of the M protein may be considered as a promising target for antiviral therapy of hepatitis B, because viremia can be suppressed by α-glucosidase I inhibitors in experimentally infected woodchucks (18Block T.M. Lu X. Mehta A.S. Blumberg B.S. Tennant B. Ebling M. Korba B. Lansky D.M. Jacob G.S. Dwek R.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the structure(s) of the N-glycan at Asn-4 of HBV M protein provided contradictory data proposing either partially fucosylated, complex-type (16Mehta A. Lu X. Block T.M.

Virol. 1983; 46: 626-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of terminal mannose would have been biologically interesting, since a genetic linkage between polymorphism of the mannose-binding protein and the persistence of HBV infection was observed (22Thomas H.C. Foster G.R. Sumiya M. McIntosh D. Jack D.L. Turner M.W. Summerfield J.A. Lancet. 1996; 348: 1417-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The pre-S1 and pre-S2 domains of HBsAg display numerous T- and B-cell epitopes (23Milich D.R. McLachlan A. Chisari F.V. Nakamura T. Thornton G.B. J.

Hence, L and M proteins are also attractive candidates for the development of improved vaccines against HBV, which might (a) override nonresponsiveness to the standard HBV vaccine consisting only of S protein (27Zuckerman J.N. Sabin C. Craig F.M. Williams A. Zuckerman A.J. Br. Med. J. 1997; 314: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), (b) allow immunotherapeutic treatment of chronic HBV infections (28Pol S. Driss F. Michel M.L. Nalpas B. Berthelot P. Brechot C. Lancet. 1994; 344: 342Abstract PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and (c) prevent selection of escape mutants with mutations in the S protein (29Carman W.F. J. Viral Hepat. 1997; 4: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Several candidate hepatitis B vaccines containing pre-S2 sequences have been developed that are produced in transfected cell cultures (27Zuckerman J.N. Sabin C. Craig F.M. Williams A. Zuckerman A.J.

The usefulness of these vaccines is not completely proven yet, particularly because the anti-pre-S response induced by these vaccines in human recipients is rather weak. 3W. H. Gerlich, unpublished observations. 3W. H. Gerlich, unpublished observations. One reason for this observation may reside in modifications of the pre-S domain. Since naturally generated HBsAg is the target of neutralizing antibodies in vivo, knowledge on post-translational modifications of the pre-S2 sequence is important for the design and evaluation of future hepatitis B vaccines. Current data onN- and O-glycosylation or phosphorylation (8Werr M. Prange R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 778-782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hildt E. Urban S. Eckerskorn C. Hofschneider P.H. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 502-507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the pre-S2 region were obtained from transfected rodent cell cultures. In order to initiate a detailed structure analysis of thein vivo pre-S2 glycosylation, we isolated HBsAg spheres from the plasma of two chronically infected HBV carriers, released the pre-S peptides from the HBsAg particles by trypsin digestion, and determined the primary structure of tryptic glycopeptides. Subviral spherical and filamentous particles were purified from the sera of two chronically HBV-infected donors, genotype D (HBsAg subtype ayw2), with a virus titer of about 6 × 109/ml and a HBsAg concentration of 100 μg/ml. The genotype and the HBsAg subtype were determined by sequencing of the viral genomes as described previously (35Naumann H. Schaefer S. Yoshida C.F. Gaspar A.M. Repp R. Gerlich W.H. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1627-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 18 ml of serum were ultracentrifuged in a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (15, 25, 35, 45, and 60% (w/w)) in TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) for 15 h at 25,000 rpm at 10 °C in a TST 28.38 rotor (Beckman, München, Germany). Fractions containing 20–40% sucrose were analyzed on a 12% gel by Laemmli SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and silver-stained. Fractions with the typical HBsAg protein pattern (Fig. 1 B) were pooled, adjusted to a density of 1.31 g/ml with solid KBr, and layered for further purification between a KBr density gradient ranging from 1.16 to 1.34 g/ml. Centrifugation for 36 h and analysis of fractions with densities of 1.20–1.25 g/ml were performed as described above. Pooled fractions were desalted and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriplus-100 filter units; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) washing three times with TNE buffer. The concentration of the purified HBsAg was estimated by A 280, assuming a value of 4.3 for 1 mg/ml (36Gerlich W. Thomssen R. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1975; 30: 78-87PubMed Google Scholar), and by amino acid analysis (see below). Purified HBsAg was stored at −20 °C. Digestion of purified native HBsAg particles (4 mg) was carried out with trypsin (Sequencing Grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) in 1.2 ml of TNE buffer for 1 h at 37 °C using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:40 (w/w). Peptides and particles were separated by ultrafiltration using one Microcon-100 filter unit (Millipore). Tryptic peptides were isolated by reversed-phase HPLC (rHPLC) on a C18- column (5 μm, 30 nm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Vydac, Hesperia, CA) using 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid with an acetonitrile gradient (0–60% in 60 min) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 30 °C. Peptides were monitored by absorption at 220 nm, and fractions were collected semiautomatically. Peptide-containing fractions were stored at −20 °C. Molecular masses of rHPLC-purified peptides were determined by MALDI-TOF-MS on a Vision 2000 mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). 1 μl of peptide solution (1–5 pmol) was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution (10 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid/ml of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 30% (v/v) acetonitrile) and allowed to air-dry. Ions were generated by irradiation with a pulsed nitrogen laser (emission wavelength 337 nm; laser power density about 106 watts/cm2), and positive ions were accelerated and detected in the reflectron and linear mode. For analysis of released oligosaccharides, 50 pmol of glycans in aequeous solution were used and analyzed as described above. For calibration of the peptide mass spectra, human angiotensin and bovine insulin (both from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) were used as external standards. For calibration of the mass spectra of released oligosaccharides, the diantennary oligosaccharide standard NA2 (Galβ4GlcNAcβ2Manα3(Galβ4GlcNAcβ2Manα6)Man β4GlcNAcβ4GlcNAc; Oxford GlycoSciences, Abingdon Oxfordshire, United Kingdom) and bovine insulin B (Sigma) were used. The accuracy of mass determination was about 0.03% for free oligosaccharides and (glyco)peptides. 20–50 ng of protein or peptide were lyophilized and hydrolyzed in the gas phase over 6 n HCl, with 0.02% mercaptoethanol, for 24 h at 110 °C. Free amino acids were dissolved in 20 μl of 0.5 m borate buffer, pH 7.7, derivatized with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl), and analyzed by rHPLC on a Merck-Hitachi (Darmstadt, Germany) system composed of an AS-4000 autosampler, a L-6200A pump, a F-1050 fluorescence detector, and a D-6000 interface. HPLC-purified peptides (50–100 pmol) or HBV subviral particles after tryptic digestion (about 500 pmol) were amino-terminally sequenced by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) pulsed liquid phase sequencer, model 477A or 471A, under standard conditions. Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives of amino acids were identified by an on-line analyzer, model 120A or 140B (Applied Biosystems), with a repetitive yield of 92–95%. N-terminally blocked tryptic peptides were further digested with chymotrypsin (sequencing grade; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Resulting products were fractionated by rHPLC and sequenced by Edman degradation as above. HPLC fractions containing theN-glycosylated pre-S2 tryptic peptides (20 μg, about 10 nmol) were pooled, lyophilized, resuspended in 150 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and digested with 100 milliunits of peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F from Flavobacterium meningosepticum (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 24 h at 37 °C. The digestion was repeated with 50 milliunits of enzyme. Oligosaccharides were separated from peptide residues by rHPLC as described previously (37Pfeiffer G. Linder D. Strube K.H. Geyer R. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Separation of released oligosaccharides was carried out at room temperature on a Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) BioLC system using a CarboPac PA-100 column (4.6 × 250 mm) in series with a CarboPac PA guard column as described in detail earlier (38Pfeiffer G. Geyer H. Geyer R. Kalsner I. Wendorf P. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1990; 4: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A sodium acetate (210 mm) gradient (0–100% in 48 min) in 100 mm NaOH was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and immediately neutralized with 25 μl of 1m acetic acid. Oligosaccharide-containing fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in water. Desalting was performed by Bio-Gel P2 (Bio-Rad) chromatography as reported earlier (39Schlüter M. Linder D. Geyer R. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 138: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate constituents were analyzed as detailed elsewhere (40Geyer R. Geyer H. Kühnhardt S. Mink W. Stirm S. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 121: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In short, hydrolysis of liberated oligosaccharides was performed with 4m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h; for hydrolysis of glycoproteins, 0.5 n sulfuric acid in 80% acetic acid (v/v) was used at 80 °C for 6 h. Following reduction with sodium borohydride and peracetylation, alditol acetates were analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using the instrumentation and microtechniques described earlier (41Geyer R. Geyer H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 86-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For linkage analyses, oligosaccharide alditols were permethylated and hydrolyzed (42Paz-Parente J.P. Cardon P. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Ricart G. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 141: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Partially methylated alditol acetates obtained after reduction and acetylation were analyzed as above. rHPLC-purified O-glycosylated peptides or released complex diantennary glycans of the pre-S2 domain were sequentially digested directly on the MALDI target (43Geyer H. Schmitt S. Wuhrer M. Geyer R. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase from bovine testes or Diplococcus pneumoniae, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from D. pneumoniae, and α-mannosidase from jack beans (all from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and O-glycosidase from D. pneumoniae (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) were dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer adjusted to the suggested pH for each enzyme (i.e. pH 6 for β-galactosidase fromD. pneumoniae and O-glycosidase; pH 5 for β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and α-mannosidase; pH 4 for β-galactosidase from bovine testes) on a floating membrane (Millipore VS) with a pore size of 0.025 μm. Sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (Calbiochem) was redissolved in water and not dialyzed before usage. 50 pmol (1 μl) of released N-glycans or 2 pmol (0.4 μl) of rHPLC-purified O-glycosylated peptide (19–48) were mixed with an equal volume of 6-aza-2-thiothymine matrix (Sigma; 5 mg/ml in water) directly on the MALDI target, air-dried, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS as described above. Spectra were recorded both in reflectron and linear modes. For glycosidase digestion, the analyte spot was resuspended in 1 μl of 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0), and 0.4 milliunits of sialidase (0.4 μl) was added. The target was incubated overnight in a moist chamber at 37 °C. Spots were air-dried and directly analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS without adding new matrix. Thereafter, the next enzyme was added, and the reaction was similarly allowed to proceed. The mass profile was determined after each step of digestion. Thus, in the case of the released N-glycans, four cycles were performed with the same analyte spot using 0.4 milliunits of sialidase and 0.5 milliunits of β-galactosidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and α-mannosidase each, and two cycles were performed in the case of the O-glycosylated peptide using 0.4 milliunits of sialidase and 0.5 milliunits ofO-glycosidase. HBsAg filaments (0.5–20 μg, untreated and after digestion with A. ureafaciens sialidase) were separated by 12% denaturating Laemmli SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). For lectin analysis, the membrane was blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA (1× crystallized, Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline overnight and incubated with digoxigenin-labeled peanut agglutinin (PNA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2with 1% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, anti-digoxigenin antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used at a concentration of 1:200 and developed with diaminobenzidine-H2O2 substrate (Sigma). For immunostaining of the blotted proteins, the membrane was blocked in 5% low fat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and incubated either with monoclonal anti-mouse antibodies Q19/10 (specific for the N-glycosylated N terminus of M protein) or MA18/7 (specific for the peptide sequence Asp-Pro-Ala-Phe (pre-S1 20–23) in the pre-S1 domain of L protein) to a concentration of 0.5 ng/μl in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% low fat milk powder. Thereafter, anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (250 units/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used at a dilution of 1:1000, and the membrane was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Sigma FastTM, Sigma). 125 pmol of lyophilized C-terminal tryptic (glyco)peptides of the pre-S2 domain (19–48) were resuspended in 8 μl of 20 mmammonium citrate buffer, pH 6.0 according to Ref. 44Bonetto V.

Aliquots (1 μl) of carboxypeptidases P and Y from Penicillium janthinellum(sequencing grade; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and yeast (excision grade; Calbiochem), each diluted to 50 ng/μl with digestion buffer, were added. Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for different times (0 min to 2 × 24 h). 15 pmol (1.2 μl) of the digest were mixed with 1 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid on the target, and MALDI-TOF analysis was performed as described above. Positive ion ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS was performed on a hybrid QTOF electrospray mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in the nanospray mode. The ions were produced in an atmospheric pressure ionization/ESI ion source, using argon as a collision gas, and were transported to the mass spectrometer through a hexapole lens for optimal transmission. The nanospray capillaries were produced in the laboratory in Münster, using a Kopf vertical pipette puller/model 720 (David Kopf Instruments, Tojunga, CA). The capillaries were not gold-coated, but an internal wire electrode was used. Nanoelectrospray low energy collision-induced dissociation was performed as described recently (45Alving K. Paulsen H.

https://openalex.org/W2019976711,"Two cDNA clones encoding NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,3GalNAc GalNAcα2,6-sialyltransferase have been isolated from mouse brain cDNA libraries. One of the cDNA clones is a homologue of previously reported rat ST6GalNAc III according to the amino acid sequence identity (94.4%) and the substrate specificity of the expressed recombinant enzyme, while the other cDNA clone includes an open reading frame coding for 302 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence is not identical to those of other cloned mouse sialyltransferases, although it shows the highest sequence similarity with mouse ST6GalNAc III (43.0%). The expressed soluble recombinant enzyme exhibited activity toward NeuAcα2, 3Galβ1,3GalNAc, fetuin, and GM1b, while no significant activity was detected toward Galβ1,3GalNAc or asialofetuin, or the other glycoprotein substrates tested. The sialidase sensitivity of the14C-sialylated residue of fetuin, which was sialylated by this enzyme with CMP-[14C]NeuAc, was the same as that of ST6GalNAc III. These results indicate that the expressed enzyme is a new type of GalNAcα2,6-sialyltransferase, which requires sialic acid residues linked to Galβ1,3GalNAc residues for its activity; therefore, we designated it mouse ST6GalNAc IV. Although the substrate specificity of this enzyme is similar to that of ST6GalNAc III, ST6GalNAc IV prefers O-glycans to glycolipids. Glycolipids, however, are better substrates for ST6GalNAc III."

In the central nervous system, DG is expressed both by glial cells and by certain groups of neurons and is suggested to be involved in blood brain barrier and synapse formation (16Tian M. Jacobson C.

Outside the nervous system, DG has been shown to be involved in epithelial morphogenesis during embryogenesis (19Durbeej M. Ekblom P. Exp.

An immunocytochemical study indicated the expression of DG by cultured human umbilical endothelial cells as well (23Belkin A.M. Smalheiser N.R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expression of DG by vascular endothelial cells, however, is still controversial because of the negative immunostaining of anti-DG antibodies found in brain capillary endothelial cells (16Tian M. Jacobson C. Gee S.H. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. Jucker M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2739-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Most recently, Durbeej et al. (24Durbeej M. Henry M.D. Ferletta M. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggested that the anti-DG immunostaining in some blood vessels emanates not from the endothelial cells, but from the smooth muscle cells, which are a rich source of DG.Vascular endothelial cells undergo drastic morphological and functional changes during angiogenesis, and it is well established that the behavior of the cell is critically influenced by interaction with the extracellular matrix in their milieu. Laminin is the major constituent of the vascular endothelial basement membrane (25Sanes J. Engvall E. Butkowski R. Hunter D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1685-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and it is generally accepted that the principal endothelial cell-surface receptor that recognizes laminin is the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules (26Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 27Cheng Y.F. Kramer R.H. J. Cell.

Several lines of evidence, however, suggested the existence of non-integrin types of laminin receptors expressed by vascular endothelial cells whose identity remains unclear (29Tressler R.J. Belloni P.N. Nicolson G.L. Cancer Commun. 1989; 1: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Basson C.T. Knowles W.J. Bell L. Albelda S.M. Castronovo V. Liotta L.A. Madri J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Given the laminin-binding capacity of DG, the purposes of this study were to confirm the expression of DG by primary cultured bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells and to establish the role of DG as a non-integrin type of laminin receptor involved in BAE cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.DISCUSSIONIn this study, expression of DG by cultured BAE cells was confirmed by cDNA cloning from a BAE cDNA library, Northern blotting of mRNA, and Western blotting of membrane proteins (Fig.1, a and b). Coexpression of βDG and PECAM1 by the cells confirmed the endothelial cell origin of the DG mRNA and protein detected (Fig. 1 c). The length of the deduced amino acid sequence of bovine DG (895 amino acids) was exactly the same as those of the rabbit, mouse, and human versions, and 91–93% of the amino acid sequence was identical to the three reported sequences (6Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Together with the similar size of the mRNA and its ubiquitous distribution on the Northern blot, these results indicate high conservation of the DG precursor gene among mammalian species.Immunocytochemical analysis revealed localization of DG on the basal side of BAE cells and a drastic change in the localization associated with cell migration (Fig. 2). In the resting cells, DG was confined in multiple plaques, the morphology of which is apparently close to that of the laminin/agrin-induced DG plaques in skeletal muscle cells (41Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Yurchenco P.D. Morris G.E. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The plaques were obscured in migrating cells, in which the trailing edge was most intensely stained. The trailing edge was then retracted when the cells actually moved in space. A straightforward explanation for these observations is that DG, with its tight association with the extracellular matrix, is left in the last part of the cell that detaches from the substratum when it moves. Although it is necessary to monitor the location of DG in live cells to verify this scenario, it is at least clear that the subcellular localization of DG in migrating BAE cells is quite different from that of integrins that have been shown to be recruited to the frontal portion of migrating leukocytes (42Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar).Two lines of biochemical evidence were presented in the this study that indicated the role of DG as a non-integrin laminin receptor involved in BAE cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. The first is the inhibition of BAE cell adhesion to laminin-1 by soluble αDG contained in the conditioned medium from DG cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6). Soluble αDG could also inhibit the biotin-laminin-1 binding to αDG in the dissociated membrane proteins (Fig. 3). Secretion of αDG to the medium was first indicated in RT4 schwannoma cells (15Matsumura K. Chiba A. Yamada H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Fujita S. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13904-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and we have confirmed the finding in cultured BAE cells. The molecular mechanism that generates the soluble form and its physiological role must be the subjects in a future study.The second line of biochemical evidence is the inhibition of BAE cell adhesion to laminin-1 by a set of glycosaminoglycans (heparin, dextran sulfate, fucoidan, and sulfatide) (Fig. 7). Of the four glycosaminoglycans, sulfatide was by far the most effective; however, it did not inhibit the αDG-laminin-1 interaction in the ligand overlay assay (Fig. 4), and it also inhibited the BAE cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 7). Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that the other three, but not sulfatide, inhibited BAE cell adhesion to laminin-1 by specifically disrupting the αDG-laminin-1 interaction. The mechanism for sulfatide inhibition is still unknown. The three glycosaminoglycans (heparin, dextran sulfate, and fucoidan) have been shown to inhibit the adhesion of RT4 schwannoma cells to laminin-1 (15Matsumura K. Chiba A. Yamada H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Fujita S. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13904-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as well as agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering in myotubes (43Bruce G.W. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3576-3582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the similar carbohydrate moiety on αDG was involved in the binding to laminin-1/agrin in these cell lines. Together with the failure of oligosaccharides to inhibit the adhesion of RT4 (15Matsumura K. Chiba A. Yamada H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Fujita S. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13904-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and BAE (Fig. 7) cells, these results indicated the importance of the high anionic charge and polymeric structure of the glycosaminoglycans in interrupting the αDG-laminin-1 interaction. The soluble αDG in the conditioned medium caused no further decrement of the cell adhesion in the presence heparin (Fig. 6), providing supportive evidence for the interruption of the αDG-laminin-1 interaction by heparin.Of the three glycosaminoglycans, heparin has been known for its activities to stimulate both endothelial cell proliferation (44Thornton S.C. Mueller S.N. Levine E.M. Science. 1983; 222: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and migration (45Azizkhan R.G. Azizkhan J.C. Zetter B.R. Folkman J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Polyanions such as heparin bind to a wide variety of glycoproteins, including extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors, and protease inhibitors, and the mechanism of action of heparin to modulate endothelial cell behavior is still unknown. Studies are underway in our laboratory to test the hypothesis that the cell behavior modulation by heparin is due to the inhibition of the αDG-laminin interaction.Both in the cases of the soluble αDG and the three glycosaminoglycans, inhibition was not observed in fibronectin-coated dishes, suggesting the laminin specificity of the DG-mediated adhesion. Laminin is a group of heterogeneous proteins, and care must be taken to interpret the results obtained with a purified protein. The mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm laminin-1 used in this study is composed of the three subunits, α1, β1, and γ1. BAE cells have been shown to express β1 and γ1, but not α1 (40Sorokin L. Girg W. Gopfert T. Hallmann R. Deutzmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recent histochemical analysis indicated the presence of α5, but not α1, in the vascular basal laminae of murine heart (23Belkin A.M. Smalheiser N.R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The laminin α5 in the vascular basal laminae may be produced by the underlying smooth muscle cells because neither BAE nor mouse aortic endothelial cells produce laminin α5, but only laminin α4 (46Frieser M. Nockel H. Pausch F. Roder C. Hahn A. Deutzmann R. Sorokin L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is at least clear that laminin-1 is unlikely to be an in vivo ligand for DG in vascular endothelial cells. We have, however, shown in the ligand overlay assay that the α5 protein expressed in E. colibound αDG and that it could disrupt the binding of laminin-1 to αDG (Fig. 5). The recombinant α5 protein immobilized on the dishes promoted the BAE cell adhesion (data not shown). These results support the idea that endothelial DG works as a laminin receptor in vivo. Further studies with laminin α5 purified from tissues or gene knockout experiments will be required to test the idea directly.In conclusion, we have confirmed the expression of DG by cultured BAE cells and presented evidence for the role of DG as a non-integrin laminin receptor involved in BAE cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. These findings expand our knowledge on the physiological roles of DG in non-muscle tissues. The distinct subcellular localization of DG in BAE cells and the essential role of the carbohydrate moiety in the αDG-laminin interaction suggest the influence of DG-mediated cell adhesion that is quite different from that of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. The control of cell behavior by the DG-laminin interaction must be the subject for future studies. Dystroglycan (DG)1consists of αDG and βDG, the two subunits yielded by proteolytic cleavage of a single precursor protein. αDG is a highly glycosylated extracellular protein with a molecular mass of 120–190 kDa, and βDG is a 43-kDa transmembrane protein (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O.

In the central nervous system, DG is expressed both by glial cells and by certain groups of neurons and is suggested to be involved in blood brain barrier and synapse formation (16Tian M. Jacobson C. Gee S.H. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. Jucker M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2739-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Drenckhahn D. Holbach M. Ness W. Schmitz F. Anderson L.V.

Outside the nervous system, DG has been shown to be involved in epithelial morphogenesis during embryogenesis (19Durbeej M. Ekblom P. Exp. Lung Res. 1997; 23: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Durbeej M. Larsson E. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies using human brain sections indicated the expression of DG by vascular endothelial cells (21Uchino M. Hara A. Mizuno Y. Fujiki M. Nakamura T. Tokunaga M. Hirano T. Yamashita T. Uyama E. Ando Y. Mita S. Ando M. Intern. Med. 1996; 35: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Yamamoto T. Shibata N. Kanazawa M. Kobayashi M. Komori T. Ikeya K. Kondo E. Saito K. Ozawa M. Acta Neuropathol. 1997; 94: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An immunocytochemical study indicated the expression of DG by cultured human umbilical endothelial cells as well (23Belkin A.M. Smalheiser N.R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The expression of DG by vascular endothelial cells, however, is still controversial because of the negative immunostaining of anti-DG antibodies found in brain capillary endothelial cells (16Tian M. Jacobson C. Gee S.H. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. Jucker M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2739-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Most recently, Durbeej et al. (24Durbeej M. Henry M.D. Ferletta M. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggested that the anti-DG immunostaining in some blood vessels emanates not from the endothelial cells, but from the smooth muscle cells, which are a rich source of DG. Vascular endothelial cells undergo drastic morphological and functional changes during angiogenesis, and it is well established that the behavior of the cell is critically influenced by interaction with the extracellular matrix in their milieu. Laminin is the major constituent of the vascular endothelial basement membrane (25Sanes J. Engvall E. Butkowski R. Hunter D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1685-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and it is generally accepted that the principal endothelial cell-surface receptor that recognizes laminin is the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules (26Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 27Cheng Y.F. Kramer R.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Albelda S.M. Daise M. Levine E.M. Buck C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1992-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence, however, suggested the existence of non-integrin types of laminin receptors expressed by vascular endothelial cells whose identity remains unclear (29Tressler R.J. Belloni P.N. Nicolson G.L. Cancer Commun. 1989; 1: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Basson C.T. Knowles W.J. Bell L. Albelda S.M. Castronovo V. Liotta L.A. Madri J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Given the laminin-binding capacity of DG, the purposes of this study were to confirm the expression of DG by primary cultured bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells and to establish the role of DG as a non-integrin type of laminin receptor involved in BAE cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. DISCUSSIONIn this study, expression of DG by cultured BAE cells was confirmed by cDNA cloning from a BAE cDNA library, Northern blotting of mRNA, and Western blotting of membrane proteins (Fig.1, a and b). Coexpression of βDG and PECAM1 by the cells confirmed the endothelial cell origin of the DG mRNA and protein detected (Fig. 1 c). The length of the deduced amino acid sequence of bovine DG (895 amino acids) was exactly the same as those of the rabbit, mouse, and human versions, and 91–93% of the amino acid sequence was identical to the three reported sequences (6Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Together with the similar size of the mRNA and its ubiquitous distribution on the Northern blot, these results indicate high conservation of the DG precursor gene among mammalian species.Immunocytochemical analysis revealed localization of DG on the basal side of BAE cells and a drastic change in the localization associated with cell migration (Fig. 2). In the resting cells, DG was confined in multiple plaques, the morphology of which is apparently close to that of the laminin/agrin-induced DG plaques in skeletal muscle cells (41Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Yurchenco P.D. Morris G.E. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The plaques were obscured in migrating cells, in which the trailing edge was most intensely stained. The trailing edge was then retracted when the cells actually moved in space. A straightforward explanation for these observations is that DG, with its tight association with the extracellular matrix, is left in the last part of the cell that detaches from the substratum when it moves. Although it is necessary to monitor the location of DG in live cells to verify this scenario, it is at least clear that the subcellular localization of DG in migrating BAE cells is quite different from that of integrins that have been shown to be recruited to the frontal portion of migrating leukocytes (42Lawson M.A. Maxfield F.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar).Two lines of biochemical evidence were presented in the this study that indicated the role of DG as a non-integrin laminin receptor involved in BAE cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. The first is the inhibition of BAE cell adhesion to laminin-1 by soluble αDG contained in the conditioned medium from DG cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6). Soluble αDG could also inhibit the biotin-laminin-1 binding to αDG in the dissociated membrane proteins (Fig. 3). Secretion of αDG to the medium was first indicated in RT4 schwannoma cells (15Matsumura K. Chiba A. Yamada H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Fujita S. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13904-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and we have confirmed the finding in cultured BAE cells. The molecular mechanism that generates the soluble form and its physiological role must be the subjects in a future study.The second line of biochemical evidence is the inhibition of BAE cell adhesion to laminin-1 by a set of glycosaminoglycans (heparin, dextran sulfate, fucoidan, and sulfatide) (Fig. 7). Of the four glycosaminoglycans, sulfatide was by far the most effective; however, it did not inhibit the αDG-laminin-1 interaction in the ligand overlay assay (Fig. 4), and it also inhibited the BAE cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 7). Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that the other three, but not sulfatide, inhibited BAE cell adhesion to laminin-1 by specifically disrupting the αDG-laminin-1 interaction. The mechanism for sulfatide inhibition is still unknown. The three glycosaminoglycans (heparin, dextran sulfate, and fucoidan) have been shown to inhibit the adhesion of RT4 schwannoma cells to laminin-1 (15Matsumura K. Chiba A. Yamada H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Fujita S. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13904-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as well as agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering in myotubes (43Bruce G.W. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3576-3582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the similar carbohydrate moiety on αDG was involved in the binding to laminin-1/agrin in these cell lines. Together with the failure of oligosaccharides to inhibit the adhesion of RT4 (15Matsumura K. Chiba A. Yamada H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Fujita S. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13904-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and BAE (Fig. 7) cells, these results indicated the importance of the high anionic charge and polymeric structure of the glycosaminoglycans in interrupting the αDG-laminin-1 interaction. The soluble αDG in the conditioned medium caused no further decrement of the cell adhesion in the presence heparin (Fig. 6), providing supportive evidence for the interruption of the αDG-laminin-1 interaction by heparin.Of the three glycosaminoglycans, heparin has been known for its activities to stimulate both endothelial cell proliferation (44Thornton S.C. Mueller S.N. Levine E.M. Science. 1983; 222: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and migration (45Azizkhan R.G. Azizkhan J.C. Zetter B.R. Folkman J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Polyanions such as heparin bind to a wide variety of glycoproteins, including extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors, and protease inhibitors, and the mechanism of action of heparin to modulate endothelial cell behavior is still unknown. Studies are underway in our laboratory to test the hypothesis that the cell behavior modulation by heparin is due to the inhibition of the αDG-laminin interaction.Both in the cases of the soluble αDG and the three glycosaminoglycans, inhibition was not observed in fibronectin-coated dishes, suggesting the laminin specificity of the DG-mediated adhesion. Laminin is a group of heterogeneous proteins, and care must be taken to interpret the results obtained with a purified protein. The mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm laminin-1 used in this study is composed of the three subunits, α1, β1, and γ1. BAE cells have been shown to express β1 and γ1, but not α1 (40Sorokin L. Girg W. Gopfert T. Hallmann R. Deutzmann R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recent histochemical analysis indicated the presence of α5, but not α1, in the vascular basal laminae of murine heart (23Belkin A.M. Smalheiser N.R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The laminin α5 in the vascular basal laminae may be produced by the underlying smooth muscle cells because neither BAE nor mouse aortic endothelial cells produce laminin α5, but only laminin α4 (46Frieser M. Nockel H. Pausch F. Roder C. Hahn A. Deutzmann R. Sorokin L.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is at least clear that laminin-1 is unlikely to be an in vivo ligand for DG in vascular endothelial cells. We have, however, shown in the ligand overlay assay that the α5 protein expressed in E. colibound αDG and that it could disrupt the binding of laminin-1 to αDG (Fig. 5). The recombinant α5 protein immobilized on the dishes promoted the BAE cell adhesion (data not shown). These results support the idea that endothelial DG works as a laminin receptor in vivo. Further studies with laminin α5 purified from tissues or gene knockout experiments will be required to test the idea directly.In conclusion, we have confirmed the expression of DG by cultured BAE cells and presented evidence for the role of DG as a non-integrin laminin receptor involved in BAE cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. These findings expand our knowledge on the physiological roles of DG in non-muscle tissues. The distinct subcellular localization of DG in BAE cells and the essential role of the carbohydrate moiety in the αDG-laminin interaction suggest the influence of DG-mediated cell adhesion that is quite different from that of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. The control of cell behavior by the DG-laminin interaction must be the subject for future studies.

We here investigated the regulation of cyclin B phosphorylation using the starfish oocyte model. Cyclin B phosphorylation is not required for Cdc2 kinase activity; both the prophase complex dephosphorylated on Cdc2 with Cdc25 and the metaphase complex dephosphorylated on cyclin B with protein phosphatase 2A display high kinase activities. An in vitro assay of cyclin B kinase activity closely mimics in vivo phosphorylation as shown by phosphopeptide maps of in vivo and in vitro phosphorylated cyclin B. We demonstrate that Cdc2 itself is the cyclin B kinase; cyclin B phosphorylation requires Cdc2 activity both in vivo(sensitivity to vitamin K3, a Cdc25 inhibitor) and in vitro (copurification with Cdc2-cyclin B, requirement of Cdc2 dephosphorylation, and sensitivity to chemical inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases). Furthermore, cyclin B phosphorylation occurs as an intra-M phase-promoting factor reaction as shown by the following: 1) active Cdc2 is unable to phosphorylate cyclin B associated to phosphorylated Cdc2, and 2) cyclin B phosphorylation is insensitive to enzyme/substrate dilution.

Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Cdc2 activation at prophase/metaphase transition requires dephosphorylation of both Thr-14 and Tyr-15. These dephosphorylations occur in two successive steps: first Thr-14 and then Tyr-15 (24Borgne A. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27847-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The Cdc25 dual-specificity phosphatase dephosphorylates both residues (reviewed in Ref. 25Millar J.B.A. Russell P. Cell. 1992; 68: 407-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The Pyp3 tyrosine phosphatase acts on Tyr-15 in fission yeast (26Millar J.B.A. Lenaers G. Russell P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4933-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A positive feedback loop originating from Cdc2 leads to the autocatalytic amplification of the complex (27Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G.

This is possibly partially generated by the singly phosphorylated form of Cdc2, dephosphorylated on Thr-14/phosphorylated on Tyr-15 (24Borgne A. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27847-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Simultaneously with Cdc2 dephosphorylation, cyclin B becomes phosphorylated as described in a variety of models such as yeast (6Booher R.N. Alfa C.E. Hyams J.S. Beach D.H. Cell. 1989; 58: 485-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), starfish oocytes (13Pondaven P. Meijer L. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), sea urchin eggs (11Meijer L. Arion D. Golsteyn R. Pines J. Brizuela L. Hunt T. Beach D.

The residues phosphorylated in cyclin B1 have been identified inXenopus: Ser-2, Ser-94, Ser-96, Ser-101, and Ser-113 (32Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3860-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,33Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).

Cell. 1995; 6: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have suggested that cyclin B phosphorylation is required neither for activity of the Cdc2 kinase, for Cdc2 binding, nor for cyclin B destruction in anaphase. More recently, Li et al. (34Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) showed that if the residues were mutated to nonphosphorylatable residues, the Cdc2-cyclin B complex does not migrate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and therefore loses its MPF activity. The kinase(s) responsible for cyclin B phosphorylations has not been identified so far. Autophosphorylation of the cyclin B by the Cdc2 kinase itself has been suggested in sea urchin eggs (11Meijer L. Arion D. Golsteyn R. Pines J. Brizuela L. Hunt T. Beach D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2275-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and in Xenopus oocytes (35Gautier J. Minshull J. Lohka M. Glotzer M. Hunt T. Maller J. Cell. 1990; 60: 487-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein kinase is able to phosphorylate Ser-94 or Ser-96 ofXenopus cyclin B1 (32Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3860-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cyclin B2has also been found to be a substrate for the Xenopusc-mos proto-oncogene product in vitro (36Roy L.M. Singh B. Gautier J. Arlinghaus R. Nordeen S.K. Maller J.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but not in vivo (37Xu W. Ladner K.J. Smith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4573-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, a kinase (Cyk) phosphorylating only one cyclin B2 residue (Ser-53) in vitro has been partially characterized in Xenopus (38Derua R. Stevens I. Waelkens E. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Merleved W. Goris J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 310-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the high and natural synchrony of starfish oocytes, we have investigated the regulation of cyclin B phosphorylation. Cyclin B phosphorylation is easily detected on an immunoblot following SDS-PAGE; compared with the unphosphorylated isoform, phosphorylated cyclin B displays a retarded migration (“shift”). We first clearly show in vitro that cyclin B phosphorylation is not required for Cdc2 kinase activity. Second, in vivo as well asin vitro, the cyclin B phosphorylation shift requires Cdc2 activation (dephosphorylation of both Thr-14 and Tyr-15 inhibitory residues). Then in vitro experiments using chemical inhibitors of CDKs, like olomoucine (39Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Daena A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J.Y. Détivaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), roscovitine (40Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), and purvalanol (41Gray N.S. Wodicka L. Thunnissen A.M. Norman T.C. Kwon S. Espinoza F.H. Morgan D.O. Barnes G. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Kim S.H. Lockhart D.J. Schultz P.G. Science. 1998; 281: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), and cyclin B phosphopeptide mapping demonstrate that Cdc2 is the kinase responsible for the cyclin B phosphorylation shift observed at metaphase in starfish oocytes. Furthermore, two experiments clearly show that Cdc2 phosphorylates its own associated cyclin B subunit, rather than the cyclin B subunit from another complex. Cyclin B phosphorylation thus occurs in an intra-MPF complex fashion. Sodium orthovanadate, 1-methyladenine (1-MeAde), EGTA, EDTA, MOPS, β-glycerophosphate, dithiothreitol, sodium fluoride,p-nitrophenylphosphate, leupeptin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine, vitamin K3, ATP, and Tween 20 were obtained from Sigma.

Purified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A1) for Cdc2 treatment was generously donated by Dr. R. W. MacKintosh (University of Dundee, UK), and another PP2A1 for cyclin B treatment was kindly donated by Dr. H. Y. L. Tung (University of Dundee, UK).

Calcium-free artificial sea water (CaFASW) contained 452.2 mm NaCl, 10.08 mm KCl, 29.8 mmMgCl2 (6H2O), 17.2 mmMgSO4 (7H2O), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 (42Shapiro H. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1941; 18: 61-78Crossref Google Scholar). High salt Barth (HSB) medium contained 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mmNaHCO3, 15 mm Tris, buffered at pH 7.4 with HCl. Homogenization buffer contained 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 25 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm disodium phenylphosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm benzamidine. Bead buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaF, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm benzamidine.

Three transfer buffers were used: anode buffer 1 (0.3 mTris, 20% methanol, pH 10.4), anode buffer 2 (0.025 mTris, 20% methanol, pH 10.4), and cathode buffer (0.025 mTris, 0.04 m glycine, 20% methanol, pH 9.4). Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST) contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20. The starfish Marthasterias glacialis were collected in Northern Brittany and kept under running sea water until use. The gonads were dissected out and gently torn open in ice-cold CaFASW. Oocytes were then filtered through cheesecloth and washed four times in CaFASW to remove the 1-MeAde-producing follicle cells. They were resuspended in the same medium as a 10% (v/v) suspension. Oocyte maturation was triggered by the addition of 1-MeAde to a final concentration of 1 μm. During maturation time course experiments, 1-ml aliquots of the oocyte suspension were withdrawn at regular intervals after hormonal stimulation and centrifuged in microtubes, and the oocyte pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Vitamin K3 is a powerful inhibitor of the Cdc25 phosphatase (24Borgne A. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27847-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 43Kerns J. Naganathan S. Dowd P. Finn F.M. Carr B. Bioorg. Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It inhibits hormone-induced oocyte maturation (24Borgne A. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27847-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Oocytes were treated with vitamin K3 (0–250 μm final concentration) for 15 min prior to the 1-MeAde addition. After a 30-min incubation, aliquots were centrifuged, and oocyte pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. 1-ml aliquots of an oocyte suspension before (prophase oocytes) or 20 min after the 1-MeAde addition (metaphase oocytes) were rapidly centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the oocyte pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Adult Xenopus laevis females were purchased from CRBM (Centre de Recherche en Biologie Moléculaire, Montpellier, France). Frogs were primed with 500 international units of human chorionic gonadotropin and stored overnight in laying tanks containing HSB. Mature oviposited eggs were dejellied in 2% cysteine in HSB medium during 10 min under agitation. They were washed three times in HSB medium and frozen immediately at −80 °C until use. The Cdc2-cyclin B complex was purified from starfish oocytes by affinity chromatography on p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads, prepared as described in Azzi et al. (44Azzi L. Meijer L. Ostvold A.C. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13279-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 400 μl of homogenization buffer were added per 100 μl of prophase or metaphase oocyte pellets. After sonication, extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and under constant rotation, with 10 μl of p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads in the presence of 400 μl of bead buffer. After removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed three times with ice-cold bead buffer. The complex was eluted or not eluted by free p9CKShs1 (2 mg/ml) for 30 min under constant rotation and used for further analysis. The same protocol was used for the preparation of Xenopus MPF. Starfish cyclin B from prophase and metaphase oocytes were prepurified first on Green A-agarose beads (loading in 10-fold diluted homogenization buffer, extensive washing with the same buffer, and elution with 0.2 m NaCl in the same buffer). This procedure leads to rapid concentration and approximately 20-fold purification of Cdc2-cyclin B. 2L. Meijer, unpublished results. The concentrated kinase was then affinity-purified on p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Amido Black staining. The prophase and metaphase cyclin B bands were digested and partially microsequenced at the Institut Pasteur (Paris). Bacterial growth and purification of the fusion proteins were as described by Borgne and Meijer (24Borgne A. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27847-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads, loaded with prophase oocyte extracts, were prepared as described above. Following the bead buffer step, the beads were washed three times with Tris buffer A prior to incubation for 30 min at 30 °C with 100 μl of recombinant phosphatases and/or 2 μl of PP2A1. The dephosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of bead buffer. The beads were washed three times with bead buffer before cyclin B phosphorylation assays. The prophase Cdc2-cyclin B complex purified on p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads and treated or not treated with different phosphatases was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 15 μm ATP in a final volume of 30 μl. The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of bead buffer. The beads were washed three times with bead buffer before the addition of 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The metaphase Cdc2-cyclin B complex was treated with 100 μl of GST-Pyp3 or 10 μl of PP2A1, after washes with Tris buffer A, for 30 min at 30 °C. The beads were then washed with bead buffer and recovered with 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For in vivo cyclin B labeling, 30 ml of prophase starfish oocytes (a 10% suspension in CaFASW) were incubated at room temperature with [32P]phosphate (40 mCi/ml) for 3 h. 1-MeAde was then added for a 20-min incubation. After washes of the oocytes with CaFASW, an extract was prepared for Cdc2-cyclin B purification on p9CKShs1-beads. In vitro labeled cyclin B was obtained in the conditions of the phosphorylation assay (see above) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. In vivo and in vitro 32P-labeled cyclin B were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Labeled cyclin B was detected by autoradiography, and the bands were excised from the gel. Cyclin B was subjected to complete digestion with trypsin or thermolysin as described by Walaaset al. (45Walaas S.I. Ostvold A.C. Laland S.G. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptides were separated by electrophoresis at pH 3.5 (first dimension) and chromatography on silica plates (second dimension). The kinase activity of Cdc2-cyclin B was measured after its purification on p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads and various treatments. Assays were performed by incubation of 10 μl of packed p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads for 5 min at 30 °C with 1 mg/ml histone H1 and 15 μm [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 30 μl. Assays were terminated by transferring the tubes into ice. After a brief centrifugation, 25 μl of supernatant were spotted on 2.5 × 3-cm pieces of Whatman p81 phosphocellulose paper. Filters were washed five times in 1% phosphoric acid, dried, and transferred in plastic scintillation vials with 1 ml of ACS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) scintillation fluid. [32P]Phosphate incorporation in the histone H1 substrate was measured in a Packard counter. 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer were added to the remaining beads and supernatant prior to SDS-PAGE and analysis by autoradiography. We have used three chemical inhibitors of CDKs, olomoucine (39Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Daena A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J.Y. Détivaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J.

Inhibition experiments were performed on prophase Cdc2-cyclin B complex, previously dephosphorylated by GST-Cdc25A, and eluted from p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads by free p9CKShs1 (2 mg/ml). Histone H1 kinase activity was assayed by incubation of 2.5 μl of soluble Cdc2-cyclin B for 10 min at 30 °C with 15 μm [γ-32P]ATP and various concentrations of inhibitors, in the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml histone H1, in a final volume of 30 μl. The histone H1 kinase activity of Cdk2-cyclin E was assayed using 0.5 μl of purified kinase incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with 1 mg/ml histone H1, 15 μm[γ-32P]ATP, and various concentrations (0–100 nm) of p27Kip1 (a GST fusion protein provided by Dr. B. Ducommun) in a final volume of 30 μl. The histone H1 kinase activities were measured in a Packard counter. The cyclin B phosphorylation assay was monitored as described above in the presence of ATP and increasing concentrations of inhibitors and analyzed by autoradiography or Western blotting. Proteins bound to p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads were recovered with 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were run in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For detection of 32P-labeled proteins, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and exposed overnight to Hyperfilm MP. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred from the gel to a 0.1-μm nitrocellulose sheet (Schleicher and Schuell) in a milliblot-graphite electroblotter system (Millipore Corp.) for 30 min at 1.5 mA/cm2 in transfer buffers. Subsequently, the filter was blocked with 5% low fat milk in TBST for 1 h. The filter was then washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with the first antibodies (anti-PSTAIRE (1:2000) or anti-cyclin B (1:1000)). After four washes (1 × 20 min, 3 × 5 min) with TBST, the nitrocellulose sheet was treated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies diluted in TBST (1:1000). The filter was then washed five times (1 time for 20 min, 4 times for 5 min) with TBST and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL detection reagents and hyperfilm MP. The addition of 1-methyladenine to prophase-arrested starfish oocytes triggers Cdc2-cyclin B kinase activation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and entry into meiotic division (reviewed in Ref. 47Meijer L. Mordret G. Sem. Dev. Biol. 1994; 5: 165-171Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The complex is inactive in prophase, Cdc2 being phosphorylated on Thr-14 and Tyr-15 and cyclin B being unphosphorylated. When cells enter in metaphase, Cdc2 is sequentially dephosphorylated first on Thr-14 and then on Tyr-15 (24Borgne A. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27847-27854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), while cyclin B becomes phosphorylated. Cyclin B phosphorylation results in a change in mobility (shift) on SDS-PAGE as detected by silver staining (Fig.1) and with monoclonal anti-cyclin B antibodies (Fig. 2). The two bands corresponding to prophase and metaphase cyclin B were partially microsequenced and compared with the M. glacialis cyclin B known sequence (10Labbé J.C. Capony J.P. Caput D. Cavadore J.C. Derancourt J. Kaghad M. Lelias J.M. Picard A. Dorée M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This comparison shows that our prophase and shifted metaphase bands correspond to bona fide M. glacialiscyclin B (Fig. 1).Figure 2In vivo dephosphorylation of Cdc2/phosphorylation of cyclin B during starfish oocyte maturation. Prophase oocytes were treated with 1 μm1-MeAde. At regular intervals, aliquots of the oocyte suspension were withdrawn and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The Cdc2-cyclin B kinase was purified from oocyte extracts by affinity chromatography on p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-cyclin B (A) and anti-PSTAIRE (B) antibodies. Nuclear envelope breakdown occurred 20 min after the 1-MeAde addition, in this experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The changes in electrophoretic mobility of the two MPF subunits can be monitored during the oocyte maturation time course following stimulation by 1-MeAde (Fig. 2). The phosphorylation state of the complex was analyzed after purification of Cdc2-cyclin B on p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting with anti-PSTAIRE antibodies for Cdc2 and with anti-cyclin B antibodies for cyclin B. At metaphase entry, cyclin B phosphorylation occurs simultaneously with Cdc2 dephosphorylation (Fig. 2). To ensure that the observed cyclin B shift is due to a phosphorylation reaction, we have treated the purified metaphase cyclin B with different phosphatases (Fig. 3,A, B, and C). Treatment with PP2A1 leads to cyclin B dephosphorylation, while treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase GST-Pyp3 does not (Fig. 3 A). After treatment with PP2A1, cyclin B presents the same electrophoretic mobility as the prophase cyclin B. We next investigated the importance of cyclin B phosphorylation for the catalytic activity of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex. The dephosphorylated Cdc2-unphosphorylated cyclin B complex can be obtained in vitro by dephosphorylation of metaphase cyclin B by PP2A1 (Fig. 3, A, B, andC) or by dephosphorylation of prophase Cdc2 by recombinant GST-Cdc25A (Fig. 3, D, E, and F).

The characteristics of IP3binding to this protein were similar as observed previously for the intact IP3R-1. Ca2+dose-dependently inhibited IP3 binding to Lbs-1 with an IC50 of about 200 nm. This effect represented a decrease in the affinity of Lbs-1 for IP3,because the K d increased from 115 ± 15 nm in the absence to 196 ± 18 nm in the presence of 5 μm Ca2+. The maximal effect of Ca2+ on Lbs-1 (5 μm Ca2+, 42.0 ± 6.4% inhibition) was similar to the maximal inhibition observed for microsomes of insect Sf9 cells expressing full-length IP3R-1 (33.8 ± 10.2%). Conceivably, the two contiguous Ca2+-binding sites (residues 304–450 of mouse IP3R-1) previously found by us (Sienaert, I., Missiaen, L., De Smedt, H., Parys, J.B., Sipma, H., and Casteels, R. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 25899–25906) mediate the effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding to IP3R-1. Calmodulin also dose-dependently inhibited IP3 binding to Lbs-1 with an IC50 of about 3 μm. Maximal inhibition (10 μmcalmodulin, 43.1 ± 5.9%) was similar as observed for Sf9-IP3R-1 microsomes (35.8 ± 8.7%). Inhibition by calmodulin occurred independently of Ca2+ and was additive to the inhibitory effect of 5 μmCa2+ (together 74.5 ± 5.1%). These results suggest that the N-terminal ligand-binding region of IP3R-1 contains a calmodulin-binding domain that binds calmodulin independently of Ca2+ and that mediates the inhibition of IP3 binding to IP3R-1. A recombinant protein (Lbs-1) containing the N-terminal 581 amino acids of the mouse type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R-1), including the complete IP3-binding site, was expressed in the soluble fraction of E. coli.

Inhibition of IP3 binding to IP3R-1 by Ca2+ might constitute one of the components inducing the descending phase of the bell-shaped dependence of IP3-induced Ca2+release on cytoplasmic Ca2+ (10Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M.

There is still controversy about the molecular mechanism responsible for the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding, because experiments on purified IP3R-1 have given conflicting results. It was suggested that Ca2+ acts directly on a Ca2+-binding site on IP3R-1 (7Picard L. Coquil J.-F. Mauger J.-P. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). On the other hand, indirect inhibition via an accessory Ca2+-binding protein like calmedin was also reported (4Danoff S.K. Supattapone S. Snyder S.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is still a matter of debate whether Ca2+-induced inhibition is caused by a decrease in the affinity of IP3R-1 for IP3 (5Joseph S.K. Rice H.L. Williamson J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Picard L. Coquil J.-F. Mauger J.-P. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or by a Ca2+-induced reduction in IP3-binding sites (9Cardy J.A. Traynor D. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, calmodulin was reported to cause inhibition of IP3 binding (14Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.A. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Cardy J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Calmodulin would in this case bind to a site different from the Ca2+-dependent calmodulin-binding site found earlier (16Yamada M. Miyawaki A. Saito K. Nakajima T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Ryo Y. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), because calmodulin was able to bind to IP3R-1 and inhibit IP3 binding to IP3R-1 in a Ca2+-independent manner (14Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.A. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,15Cardy J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the IP3R contains all the structural determinants responsible for specific and selective binding of its physiological agonist, IP3 (17Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO. J. 1990; 12: 3893-3898Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have therefore expressed the N-terminal ligand-binding site (first 581 amino acids) of the mouse IP3R-1 in Escherichia coli, using a strategy of growth and expression at low temperatures, as described previously by Yoshikawa et al. (20Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This protein contains a previously identified Ca2+-binding region located between amino acids 304–450 (21Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that Ca2+ and calmodulin can both inhibit IP3 binding to this recombinant protein and that these inhibitors act independently and additively. Our data indicate that the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of IP3R-1 contains regulatory regions directly interacting with Ca2+ and calmodulin. The full-length neuronal mouse IP3R-1 cDNA clone containing the S1 splice domain in p400C1 plasmid vector (22Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Drs. K. Mikoshiba and A. Miyawaki (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). The 5′-untranslated region of the original p400C1 clone was removed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by amplification of the 5′-terminal part up to the Cel-II restriction site (nucleotide 555), before subcloning the IP3R-1 cDNA in the baculovirus (Autographa californica) transfer vector pVL 1393 (Invitrogen). Recombinant virus was produced in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells by cotransfection of the pVL 1393 IP3R-1 construct and the linearized A. californica nuclear polyhydrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold, Pharmingen). The recombinant viruses were purified by isolating individual plaques of transfected cells. These clonal viral populations were amplified by infecting Sf9 cells. The recombinant protein was harvested 2 days after infection of the Sf9 cells with the amplified virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2–6. A bacterial expression vector (pET 21b/+, Novagen Inc.) was used to express the N-terminal 581 amino acids of the mouse IP3R-1, including the S1 splice site. PCRs were performed to produce two DNA fragments containing the coding sequence for 1) amino acid 1–64 and 2) amino acid 471–581, usingSalI cut p400C1 containing cDNA (9448 base pairs) encoding the mouse IP3R-1 (22Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) as a template. Fragment 1 was produced with forward primer 5′-CGCGCATATGTCTGACAAAATGTCG-3′ (containing an NdeI site including the start codon) and reverse primer 5′-CGGAGTATCGATTCATAGG-3′ (containing the codons for amino acids 64–65 including aClaI site). Fragment 2 was synthesized with forward primer 5′-GGTCTGTCACGAAGCTTTTGG-3′ (containing a HindIII site) and reverse primer 5′-GTATGCGGCCGCTTACATGAAGCCAAACTGCTTGG-3′ (containing the codon for methionine-581, directly followed by a stop codon and a NotI site). PCR fragment 2 was cut withHindIII and NotI and ligated into theHindIII/NotI site of pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen), yielding pcDNA-F2. The SalI digest of p400C1 containing a 329-base pair 5′ noncoding region and the complete coding region of IP3R-1 was first subcloned in the pCI expression plasmid (Promega) to yield pCI-IP3R-1. A 1751-base pair fragment was obtained from pCI-IP3R-1 by partialNheI/HindIII digest and ligated into theNheI/HindIII sites of the pcDNA-F2 construct. Subsequently, the EcoRI/NotI fragment of pcDNA-F2 was ligated into the EcoR-I/NotI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET 21b/+. To remove the 5′ noncoding sequences, the resulting construct and PCR fragment 1 were digested with NdeI/ClaI and ligated, yielding pET-581. The sequences of pET-581 and of the PCR-amplified part of the pVL 1393 IP3R-1 construct were confirmed by double-stranded sequencing using the Automated Laser FluorescentTMsequencing system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The expression of the recombinant N-terminal 581 amino acids of the IP3R-1 (Lbs-1 (ligand-bindingsite-1)) was performed essentially as described by Yoshikawa et al. (20Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A single colony of E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET-581 was resuspended in 2 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 27 °C. 1 ml of this culture was diluted in 50 ml of fresh medium (100 μg/ml ampicillin) and grown at 21 °C for 10 h to anA 600 of about 1.5. Subsequently, expression of the recombinant protein was induced in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.75 mm) for 20 h at 14 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with a buffer containing 10 mmKH2PO4, 30 mm NaHPO4, 153 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (HB) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.8 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 75 nm aprotinin. This cell suspension was digested with lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by six cycles of freeze-thawing (in liquid nitrogen and at 37 °C) and sonication at 12 kHz, two times for 15 s (probe sonicator, MSE Ltd., Westminster, UK). After centrifugation (30,000 × g, 60 min), the supernatant containing the soluble fraction of E. coli was stored at −80 °C. The soluble fraction containing the recombinant protein (Lbs-1) and supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl was loaded on a heparin-agarose column (80 μl beads/mg protein). Before loading, the column was pre-equilibrated with HB containing 0.3 m NaCl. The column was washed with 5 volumes HB supplemented with 0.3 m NaCl, and Lbs-1 was eluted with 2.5 volumes HB supplemented with 0.8 mNaCl. [3H]IP3binding was performed in 100 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 or 7.8, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA or BAPTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μg of partially purified Lbs-1, and variable concentrations of [3H]IP3 (see figure legends) at 0 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, 10 μl of γ-globulin (20 mg/ml) and 110 μl of 10% polyethylene glycol in IP3binding buffer was added for 10 min, and the mixture was quickly filtered through glass fiber filters and washed using a Combi Cell Harvester (Skatron). Activity on the filters was quantified with a Beckman scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled IP3. Routinely, specific [3H]IP3 binding amounted to more than 95% of total binding. Scatchard analyses were performed using the Kell Radlig program (version 5.0.4, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). A Student's t test (paired or unpaired) was used for statistical analyses. Values were considered statistically different when p < 0.05. Microsomes of rabbit cerebellum and RBL-2H3 cells (F3 fraction) were prepared as described by Parys et al. (23Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Vanlingen et al. (24Vanlingen S. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), respectively. Microsomes of 16HBE14o- cells and Sf9 insect cells were prepared as described by Sienaert et al. (25Sienaert I. Huyghe S. Parys J.B. Malfait M. Kunzelmann K. De Smedt H. Verleden G.M. Missiaen L. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J.

This antibody is directed against the same epitope as the previously described Rbt04 (23Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R.

A second antibody was raised against the Ca2+-binding domain cyt3b present between amino acids 378 and 450 of the mouse IP3R-1 (21Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Two rabbits were injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly with Freund's complete adjuvant containing 0.5 mg of cyt3b fused to glutathioneS-transferase. Animals were boosted 2 weeks later with the same antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant and regularly thereafter. After three boost injections, both rabbits produced high titers of antibody. Both these antibodies (named anti-cytI3b-1 and anti-cytI3b-2) reacted specifically with IP3R-1 from multiple species including rat, rabbit, and Xenopus. The partially purified soluble fraction of E. coli was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 3–12% linear gradient and either stained with Coomassie Blue or SyproTM Orange or transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Blots were blocked for 1 h in a buffer containing 10 mm NaH2PO4, 32 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.5, 154 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% milk powder and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h in the same buffer without milk powder. Alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody was used as secondary antibody. The immunoreactivity was visualized by conversion of the VistraTM ECF substrate into a fluorescent probe (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and scanned with the Storm 840 FluorImager, equipped with the Imagequant NT4.2 software (Molecular Dynamics) as described previously (24Vanlingen S.

Vanlingen S. Henning R.H. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Adenophostin-A was a gift of Dr. S. Takahashi (27Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 369-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IP3 was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [3H]IP3 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs Inc. or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. T4-DNA ligase was from Life Technologies, Inc. High purity bovine brain calmodulin was from Calbiochem. Polyethylene glycol, γ-globulins, and heparin-agarose beads were obtained from Sigma . SyproTM Orange was from Bio-Rad. Ethylene glycolbis-(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate) was from Pierce. Microsomes of Sf9 insect cells transfected with pVL 1393 IP3R-1 (Sf9-IP3R-1) were immunoreactive to an antibody specifically recognizing a C-terminal epitope of mouse IP3R-1 (Fig. 1 A). Under identical conditions, no IP3R was detected in control pVL 1393 transfected Sf9 cells. The expressed IP3R-1 migrated on SDS-PAGE with the same apparent molecular mass as observed for IP3R-1 from rabbit cerebellar microsomes and amounted to 2.5 times the value of the latter (Fig. 1 A). In the presence of 5 nm [3H]IP3, microsomes of Sf9 cells expressing IP3R-1 specifically bound IP3. The binding activity (589 ± 83 fmol/mg at pH 7.8) was also about 2.5 times the value found for rabbit cerebellar microsomes (252 ± 43 fmol/mg). Microsomes of control pVL 1393 transfected Sf9 cells showed no significant IP3 binding under these conditions. We constructed a bacterial expression vector containing the coding sequence of the N-terminal 581 amino acids of the mouse IP3R-1 (pET-581). The recombinant protein (Lbs-1) was expressed in E. coli using a strategy described earlier by Yoshikawa et al. (20Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Lbs-1 was partially purified on a heparin-agarose column and migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1 C). The protein reacted with the anti-cytI3b-1 polyclonal antibody, which specifically recognized an epitope in the N terminus of the IP3R-1 (Fig.1, B and C). Although some degradation of the 66-kDa protein occurred, it was determined by quantitative analysis of the fluorescence signals obtained on immunoblots (Fig. 1 C) and of the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with the fluorescent dye SyproTM Orange (data not shown) that at least 80% of the recombinant protein was in the intact form. Degraded proteins missing the primary antibody-epitope (amino acids 378–450 (21Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)) or smaller than 40 kDa will not bind IP3 (20Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and will therefore not influence IP3 binding measurements. The isolated IP3-binding domain was likely to exist as a monomer, because it did not contain structural elements necessary for multimerization (18Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 28Joseph S.K. Boehning D. Pierson S. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1579-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have investigated possible multimerization of Lbs-1 by chemical cross-linking experiments. After treatment with the N-hydroxysuccimide ester, ethylene glycolbis-(sulfosuccinimidylsuccinate) (0.25 mm), and separation of proteins with denaturating SDS-PAGE, we could clearly detect dimers of glutathione S-transferase (data not shown), a protein known to form dimers (29Singh S.V. Leal T. Ansari G.A. Awasthi Y.C. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Awasthi Y.C. Sharma R. Singhal S.S. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and used here as positive control. However, this treatment failed to covalently link molecules of Lbs-1 with each other or with other proteins in the suspension, either in the presence or the absence of 5 μm IP3, 1 μm adenophostin-A, or 5 μm Ca2+(data not shown). These results strongly suggest that Lbs-1 is a monomeric polypeptide. Fractions of partially purified Lbs-1 specifically bound [3H]IP3 at a pH of 7.8, whereas a similar fraction from E. coli that was only transformed with host pET 21b/+ did not bind IP3 under these conditions. [3H]IP3 was displaced from Lbs-1 by unlabeled IP3 with an IC50 of 60 nm (Fig.2). The displacement data could best be fitted using a single-site Scatchard model, yielding aK d of 46 ± 4 nm, aB max of 280 ± 60 pmol/mg, and a Hill coefficient of 1.1 ± 0.1 (Fig. 2, inset). These values are very close to values found for the intact purified mouse cerebellum IP3R-1, obtained under similar experimental conditions (IC50, 76 nm; Hill coefficient, 1.1 (31Hirota J.

Furthermore, we have previously reported a K d of 46 ± 17 nm for the purified Xenopus IP3R-1 under identical experimental conditions but at a slightly higher pH (13Parys J.B. Sernett S.W. DeLisle S.

These findings are in agreement with earlier reports, demonstrating that recombinant proteins, containing the first 788 (17Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO.

These observations indicate that Lbs-1 is in the right conformation to act as a bona fide IP3-binding pocket. Submicromolar [Ca2+] was found to inhibit IP3 binding to IP3R-1 from cerebellum (2Worley P. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Cardy J.A. Traynor D. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Lbs-1 contains two amino acid sequences (304–381 and 378–450) that were found to bind Ca2+ (21Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These sites could be involved in the inhibitory effect of Ca2+. In our hands, micromolar Ca2+ (5 μm) inhibited IP3 binding to microsomes of insect Sf9 cells expressing mouse type-1 IP3R by 33.8 ± 10.2% at a physiological pH of 7.0 (Fig.3 A). IP3 binding to Lbs-1, which includes the S1 splice site, was inhibited to the same extent by 5 μm Ca2+ under identical experimental conditions (42.0 ± 6.4%, Fig. 3 B). This inhibition was less pronounced than the maximal Ca2+-induced inhibition of IP3 binding observed in microsomes of Sf9-IP3R-1 cells (lacking S1) by Yoneshima et al. (70% (8Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) and Cardy et al.(54% (9Cardy J.A. Traynor D. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). Ca2+ dose-dependently inhibited IP3 binding to Lbs-1 within a physiological range between 30 nm and 5 μm. A half-maximal effect occurred at about 200 nm (Fig.4 A). Scatchard analyses performed in the absence or presence of Ca2+ (5 μm) yielded K d values of 115 ± 15 and 196 ± 18 nm IP3, respectively, whereas the B max values were not significantly different (330 ± 30 and 410 ± 60 pmol/mg, respectively) (Fig. 5). This indicates that Ca2+ reduced the affinity of the IP3-binding site without an effect on the number of binding sites. Furthermore, because Lbs-1 was isolated in the absence of Ca2+chelators, the protein was exposed to micromolar Ca2+concentrations for some time. The fact that after this treatment IP3 binding was higher in the presence of only Ca2+ chelators than in the presence of chelators and (sub)micromolar free Ca2+ indicates that the effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding is reversible. The Ca2+-induced reduction of affinity of Lbs-1 for IP3 is in agreement with the results obtained on rat cerebellar microsomes (5Joseph S.K. Rice H.L. Williamson J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), on microsomes of insect Sf9-IP3R-1 cells (8Yoneshima H. Miyawaki A. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and on immunopurified sheep cerebellum IP3R-1 (7Picard L. Coquil J.-F. Mauger J.-P. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In a study of the intact IP3R-1 expressed in insect cells, it was also suggested that the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ might be due to a reduction in the number of IP3-binding sites (9Cardy J.A. Traynor D. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our binding data do not indicate a decrease in binding sites for IP3. The binding data in the absence and presence of Ca2+ are compatible with a one-site model of IP3 binding, in agreement with the monomeric nature of our protein preparation. It should be pointed out, however, that a different observation with respect to the mechanism of the inhibition may be indicative for a more complex role of cytosolic Ca2+on the intact receptor as compared with the isolated IP3-binding domain. Because there are at least five additional potential interaction sites with Ca2+ in the cytosolic domains (21Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), a more complex dependence on Ca2+for the intact receptor is not unexpected. Our data indicate that there is a direct interaction of Ca2+ with the IP3-binding domain, but this interaction may represent only part of the feedback mechanism that controls IP3-induced Ca2+ release.Figure 4The effect of different [Ca2+] on IP3 binding to Lbs-1.[3H]IP3 binding to partially purified Lbs-1 (2.5 μg) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Ca2+ was expressed as a percentage of the binding measured in Ca2+-free buffer with 1 mm EGTA at pH 7.0 (A) or 1 mm BAPTA at pH 7.8 (B). The different Ca2+ concentrations were buffered with 1 mm EGTA or BAPTA and calculated with the Maxchelator software (Dr. C. Patton, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). *, significantly different from binding in Ca2+-free buffer. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least four experiments, consisting of independent quadriplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Scatchard analysis of IP3 binding to Lbs-1 in the presence and absence of Ca2+.Partially purified Lbs-1 (3.75 μg) was incubated with 3.6 nm [3H]IP3 at pH 7.0 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled IP3 in the absence (○) or presence (■) of 5 μm Ca2+. Data are expressed as means of three independent determinations of one experiment repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Remarkably, the effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding was pH-dependent. No inhibition was observed at a pH of 7.8 (Fig. 4 B). In these experiments, BAPTA was used as chelating agent. It has been suggested that high doses of Ca2+-free chelators, especially BAPTA, can inhibit IP3 binding (32Richardson A. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11528-11533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Combettes L. Hannaert-Merah Z. Coquil J.-F. Rousseau C. Claret M. Swillens S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17561-17571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on IP3binding might therefore be shielded by a stimulatory effect of Ca2+ in relieving inhibition by the chelator. IP3 binding to Lbs-1 (pH 7.8) was, however, identical in the presence of 1 mm BAPTA, 0.1 mm BAPTA, 0.1 mm BAPTA and 5 μm free Ca2+, and 1 mm EGTA (data not shown). Therefore, we can exclude the possibility that the absence of an effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding at pH 7.8 was caused by effects of BAPTA. As shown above, lowering the pH from 7.8 to 7.0 caused an increase of theK d value for the binding of IP3 to pET-581 from 46 to 115 nm. The enhancement of IP3 binding to the IP3R-1 at a higher pH is a well documented phenomenon (5Joseph S.K. Rice H.L. Williamson J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Guillemette G. Segui J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It can be suggested that the different conformational states of the IP3R-1 that apparently accompany changes in pH are unequally susceptible to inhibition by Ca2+. Because Lbs-1 was expressed in a bacterial environment, the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding to Lbs-1 strongly suggests direct binding of Ca2+ to the N-terminal IP3-binding domain of IP3R-1 and strongly disfavors the idea of involvement of accessory proteins, such as calmedin (4Danoff S.K. Supattapone S. Snyder S.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The hypothesis of direct binding of Ca2+ to IP3R-1 is in agreement with results obtained by Picardet al. (7Picard L. Coquil J.-F. Mauger J.-P. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), who showed that Ca2+ could still inhibit IP3 binding to rat cerebellar microsomes after removal of peripheral membrane proteins with high alkaline treatment and to immunopurified sheep cerebellar IP3R. We have previously demonstrated direct Ca2+ binding (21Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to a stretch of amino acids (304–450) located in the “core” IP3-binding domain (20Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Most likely, Ca2+exerts its inhibitory effect on IP3 binding by interacting with this particular region. Our data indicate that the modulation of the IP3 affinity by cytosolic Ca2+ is an inherent property of the IP3-binding domain. Unfortunately, it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to determine the amino acid residues critically involved in the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding because mutations and deletions in this region will almost certainly also affect the characteristics of IP3 binding or eliminate IP3binding (20Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our data give further strong support to the idea that Ca2+, in a physiological range, is able to inhibit IP3 binding to IP3R-1. This mechanism is likely to contribute to feedback inhibition of IP3-induced Ca2+ release by (sub)micromolar [Ca2+] (10Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 12Bezprozvanny I.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18776-18782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin binds to the regulatory domain of the type-1 and -2 IP3R (16Yamada M. Miyawaki A. Saito K. Nakajima T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Ryo Y. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that calmodulin can also bind to IP3R-1 in the absence of Ca2+, thereby inhibiting IP3 binding to the purified cerebellar IP3R (14Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.A. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and to microsomes of insect Sf9 cells expressing rat IP3R-1 (15Cardy J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In our hands, calmodulin (10 μm) inhibited IP3binding to microsomes of Sf9 cells expressing IP3R-1 and to Lbs-1 by 35.8 ± 8.7 and 43.1 ± 5.9%, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). These values were similar to maximal inhibition (10 μm calmodulin) reported for Sf9 microsomes (40% (15Cardy J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) and rat cerebellum microsomes (36% (14Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.A. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). In the presence of both Ca2+ (5 μm) and calmodulin (10 μm), IP3 binding was inhibited by 74.5 ± 5.1% (i.e. 50% of the level in the presence of only Ca2+). Therefore, inhibition by calmodulin was Ca2+-independent and was additive to inhibition by Ca2+, as suggested previously for the intact IP3R-1 (14Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.A. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Cardy J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As was also observed for the effect of Ca2+, inhibition of IP3 binding by calmodulin does not seem to depend on the presence or absence of the S1 splice domain. The effect of calmodulin on IP3 binding to Lbs-1 was concentration-dependent (Fig.6 A). Calmodulin half-maximally inhibited IP3 binding at a concentration of about 3 μm, assuming maximal inhibition of IP3binding at 10 μm (14Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.A. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Cardy J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This value is similar to the one found for the purified cerebellar IP3R (14Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.A. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) but is three times higher than that observed for IP3R-1 expressed in Sf9 cells (15Cardy J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of calmodulin was completely abolished at higher pH (Fig. 6 B). This was also reported by Patel et al. (14Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.A. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and is most likely due to an altered conformation of calmodulin at higher pH. High pH is also known to block Ca2+-independent interaction of calmodulin with the ryanodine receptor (35Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Our results on calmodulin therefore confirm and extend the results obtained for the intact IP3R-1 by Taylor and co-workers (14Patel S. Morris S.A. Adkins C.A. O'Beirne G. Taylor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11627-11632Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Cardy J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and suggest that a Ca2+-independent interaction site for calmodulin is located in the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of the IP3R-1. We have expressed the N-terminal 581 amino acids of IP3R-1 containing the complete IP3-binding site in E. coli. Ca2+dose-dependently inhibited IP3 binding to this protein by decreasing its affinity for IP3. Conceivably, this inhibition is mediated by one of the Ca2+-binding sites that we have previously located within the core IP3-binding pocket of the receptor. Furthermore, calmodulin inhibited IP3 binding to the recombinant ligand-binding site independently of Ca2+. In conclusion, we found functional evidence for both a Ca2+-binding site and a calmodulin-binding site in the N-terminal ligand-binding domain of IP3R-1."

We and others have reported that SHIP is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated upon B cell antigen receptor (BCR) cross-linking and forms a complex with the adapter protein Shc. Here, we report that cross-linking of the BCR induces association between Grb2 and SHIP as well as association between Shc and SHIP. We made use of a Grb2-deficient B cell line to demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that Grb2 expression is required for the efficient association between Shc and SHIP. The results indicate that SHIP, Shc, and Grb2 form a ternary complex in stimulated B cells, with Grb2 stabilizing the interaction between Shc and SHIP. The interactions between Shc, Grb2, and SHIP are therefore analogous to the interactions between Shc, Grb2, and SOS.

DeFranco, submitted for publication. The mechanism by which BCR cross-linking activates Ras is not established, although tyrosine kinase inhibitors block Ras activation in B cells (9Kawauchi K. Lazarus A.H. Rapoport M.J. Harwood A. Cambier J.C. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3306-3316PubMed Google Scholar). Part of this Ras activation is dependent upon protein kinase C (PKC) activity, while some is PKC-independent (10Gold M.R. Sanghera J.S. Stewart J. Pelech S.L. Biochem.

The adapter protein Shc, which has been implicated in Ras activation in other systems, becomes tyrosine phosphorylated following BCR stimulation and has been suggested to play a role in Ras activation in B cells (11Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.

Shc contains an SH2 domain and a PTB domain, allowing it to bind to proteins containing phosphotyrosines (14Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). It also contains two tyrosines, residues 239 and 313, that when phosphorylated act as binding sites for the SH2 domain of a second adapter protein, Grb2 (15Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. Mol. Cell.

Grb2 possesses two SH3 domains that permit it to bind to proline-rich sequences in the C terminus of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS (18McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Gen.

Gold M.R. J.

Indeed, Shc forms a complex with both Grb2 and SOS after BCR stimulation (12Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J.

We and others have observed that another signaling protein, variously called “p145” or SHIP (for SH2-containing inositol phosphatase), also interacts with Shc after BCR cross-linking (12Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I.

SHIP is an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase which selectively removes the 5-phosphate from inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) (21Damen J.E.

Indeed, overexpression of SHIP can antagonize PI 3-kinase function in Xenopus oocytes (23Deuter-Reinhard M. Apell G. Pot D. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Kavanaugh W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both PI(3,4,5)P3 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) levels increase transiently in B cells stimulated through the BCR (24Gold M.R. Aebersold R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 42-50PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the possibility that SHIP may play a role in modulating the levels of these lipids. PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 have been shown to bind to the SH2 and pleckstrin homology domains of a variety of proteins, regulating their enzymatic activity and presumably their intracellular localization (25Rameh L.E.

Overexpression of SHIP inhibits cellular proliferation and/or induces apoptosis, suggesting that SHIP acts as a negative regulator of hematopoietic cells (29Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S.

In addition, SHIP has been implicated in inhibitory signaling induced by FcγRIIB, the B cell receptor for the Fc portion of soluble IgG. Co-cross-linking of the FcγRIIB with the BCR inhibits B cell proliferation, Ras activation, and the influx of calcium across the cell membrane normally observed after BCR stimulation (31Phillips N.E.

Lett. 1997; 57: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and has been shown to inhibit sustained influx of calcium into the cell (37Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that SHIP may indirectly inhibit Ras activation by competing with SOS for binding to Shc (20Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar). To test this idea, we have examined the mechanism by which Shc and SHIP interact in stimulated B cells. We report that SHIP forms complexes with both Shc and Grb2 in BCR-stimulated cells and that mutation of the Grb2-binding sites on Shc perturbs both of these interactions. Significantly, SHIP and Shc associate poorly in Grb2-deficient cells and this defect can be complemented in vitro and in vivo by the addition of Grb2. These results demonstrate that Grb2 is important for the association between Shc and SHIP. We also found that a phosphopeptide that binds to the SH2 domain of SHIP brings down the intact SHIP·Shc·Grb2 complex, indicating that the SH2 domain of SHIP does not directly bind Shc or Grb2. We therefore suggest that SHIP, Shc, and Grb2 form a ternary complex similar to the Shc·Grb2·SOS complex in B cells stimulated through the BCR. The murine B cell line WEHI-231 was originally obtained from Dr. L. Lanier (DNAX Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA). The WEHI-231 cells transfected with HA-Shc were previously described (15Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The two BAL17 B cell lines were originally obtained from Dr. R. Asofsky (National Institutes of Health). It is not known when these cell lines diverged and BAL17.TR lost Grb2 expression. The human B cell line Ramos was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), the murine pre-B cell line 70Z/3 was a gift from Dr. C. Sibley (University of Washington, Seattle, WA), the human B cell line J/Y was obtained from Dr. F. Brodsky (University of California, San Francisco, CA), and the murine B cell line A20 was provided by Dr. R. Asofsky (National Institutes of Health). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm glutamine, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. To induce maximal expression of transfected HA-Shc genes in WEHI-231, cells were incubated for 48 h in media plus 5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Research Products International Corp., Mt. Prospect, IL). The cell lines used for vaccinia virus production (CV-1, 143B, and HeLa) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained as directed. B lymphocytes (5 × 106 cells/ml in culture medium) were treated at 37 °C for 3 min with medium alone, with goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies, rabbit anti-mouse IgM antibodies, or rabbit anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 fragments (all antibodies from Jackson Immunological Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 20 μg/ml unless otherwise indicated. Alternatively, cells were stimulated with 150 μm pervanadate (a 50 mm pervanadate stock was prepared by adding equal volumes of 100 mmNa3VO4 and 2% H2O2 and incubating at 25 °C for 30 min prior to use) for 4 min at 37 °C. After stimulation, cell suspensions were diluted with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmNa3VO4, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 20 mmTris (pH 8.0), 90 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin. Detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the protein concentration of the soluble fraction was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (38Richards J.D. Gold M.R. Hourihane S.L. DeFranco A.L. Matsuuchi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6458-6466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; used at 3 μg/40 × 106 cell equivalents), with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5; from BAbCO, Richmond, CA; used at 2 μg/50 × 106 cell equivalents), with anti-Shc antibody (affinity-purified rabbit antibody generated against glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fused to amino acids 359–473 of human Shc; used at 1.5 μg/45 × 106 cell equivalents (39Crowley M.T.

The beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer, analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibody (clone 81, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-Shc monoclonal antibody (PG-797, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-SHIP antiserum (kind gift of Drs. M. Lioubin and L. Rohrschneider; serum 5369 (29Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R.

Next, the immunoblots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG was from Amersham Corp.) and developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescence detection system (NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). The GST-Grb2 and GST-Grb2R86K expression vectors were generously provided by Dr. G. Koretzky, University of Iowa (50Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Jackman J.K. Sun Q. Olson A.L. Findell P.R. Koretzky G.A. J.

Unwanted alterations in the coding sequences of these clones were converted to the published sequence via site-directed mutagenesis. The fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli by standard methods (40Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Expression of the fusion proteins in bacteria was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside treatment for 3 h and the fusion proteins were affinity purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Ten units of thrombin (Novagen, Madison, WI) were added per 500 μg of GST-Grb2 fusion protein and proteolysis allowed to proceed for 3–4 h at 25 °C. The Grb2-containing supernatant was removed and passed over a p-aminobenzamidine column (Sigma) to remove thrombin. Purified Grb2 was analyzed and quantitated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Three to four μg of recombinant wild type Grb2 or SH2-mutant Grb2 (R86K) was added to stimulated B cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Anti-Shc immunoprecipitations were then performed as described above. The ITIM peptide corresponds to amino acids 303–315 of the murine Fcγ receptor IIb (AEN TIT Y(p)SL LKH P), the Y(p)xNx peptide corresponds to amino acids 307–318 of murine p52Shc (LFD DPS Y(p)VN IQN), the NPxY(p) peptide corresponds to residues 911–921 of murine SHIP (EMI NPN Y(p)IG MG), and the proline-rich peptide to amino acids 1149–1162 of murine SOS1 (VPV PPP VPP RRR PE). All peptides were obtained from Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA) and were biotinylated at the N terminus. For affinity purifications, 30 nmol of each peptide was pre-bound to 50 μl of NeutrAvidin (Pierce) and then incubated with 40 × 106 cell equivalents (stimulated and lysed as described above) for several hours at 4 °C. The beads were then treated as described for immunoprecipitations. For peptide competition assays, 25 × 106 cell equivalents were incubated with 100 μm of each peptide for 3 h at 4 °C. Anti-Shc immunoprecipitations were then carried out as described above. Grb2 and Grb2R86K cDNAs (described above) were cloned into the vaccinia expression plasmid pSC65 (gift of Dr. B. Moss, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and recombinant viruses generated using standard techniques (41Earl P.L. Moss B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 16.18.1-16.18.11Google Scholar). BAL17.TR B cells were infected at an multiplicity of infection of 20 and harvested 24 h after infection, before cytopathic effects were visible. Cells were stimulated and lysed as described above. We and others have previously noted that the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase SHIP forms complexes with the adapter protein Shc in hematopoietic cells upon stimulation with antigen or cytokines (19Crowley M.T.

To assess whether SHIP associates with Grb2 as well as Shc after cross-linking of the BCR, we immunoprecipitated SHIP, Shc, or Grb2 from unstimulated and stimulated B cells and then probed immunoblots with anti-SHIP, -Shc, or -Grb2 antibodies. As is shown in Fig.1 A, when any one of these three proteins was immunoprecipitated from stimulated cells, the other two were also precipitated. Thus anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates contained both Shc and Grb2, anti-Shc immunoprecipitates contained Grb2 and SHIP, and anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates contained SHIP and Shc. These interactions were primarily stimulation dependent, although low levels of association were seen in unstimulated cells. It was not clear from these results whether these associations represented the existence of separate Shc·Grb2, Shc·SHIP, and SHIP·Grb2 complexes or the existence of a ternary SHIP·Shc·Grb2 complex. To address this point, we examined whether depletion of Grb2 from stimulated cells also led to the depletion of the Shc·SHIP complex. Grb2 was removed from stimulated B cell lysates by serial immunoprecipitation, as was the tyrosine kinase Lyn as a control. Next, Shc was immunoprecipitated from these depleted lysates and association of SHIP and Grb2 assessed (Fig. 1 B). Depletion of Grb2 led to a roughly 2-fold decrease in the amount of Shc immunoprecipitated from the lysate, indicating that at least half of the Shc in the stimulated lysate was associated with Grb2. SHIP could barely be detected in association with the Shc that did remain. SHIP therefore associates preferentially with the population of Shc that is bound to Grb2, indicating that SHIP, Shc, and Grb2 form a ternary complex upon BCR stimulation. It has previously been shown that Shc contains two tyrosines that when phosphorylated act as binding sites for the SH2 domain of Grb2 (15Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. Mol. Cell.

In addition, SHIP contains several proline-rich regions in its C terminus that can bind to the SH3 domains of Grb2 in vitro(22Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D.A. Chin S.M. Deuter-Reinhard M. Jefferson A.B.

Therefore a SHIP·Shc·Grb2 complex could be stabilized by SH2, SH3, and/or PTB interactions in a manner analogous to the SOS·Shc·Grb2 complex (15Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. Mol. Cell.

To examine the importance of phosphorylation of the Grb2-binding sites for Shc association with SHIP, we examined the interactions of SHIP with mutated Shc proteins in which two of the three known tyrosine phosphorylation sites (15Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Curr.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6197-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) had been changed to phenylalanine. These experiments were performed in the immature B cell line WEHI-231 which had been stably transfected with wild type and mutant Shc proteins tagged with the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (15Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). HA-Shc was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated or BCR-stimulated cells and associated SHIP protein was detected by immunoblotting with anti-SHIP antibodies. SHIP was readily detected in association with wild type HA-Shc isolated from stimulated cells (Fig. 2 A, top panel). Less SHIP was found associated with HA-Shc in which tyrosine 313 was mutated to phenylalanine (HA-Shc Y313F), and little or no SHIP associated with HA-Shc in which the other Grb2-binding site, Tyr239, was mutated to phenylalanine (HA-Shc Y239F), or in which both Grb2-binding sites were mutated (HA-Shc Y239F/Y313F). The SHIP associated with Shc was also phosphorylated on tyrosine, as could be seen by reprobing these immunoblots with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2 A, middle panel). Detection of associated SHIP by this method appeared to be more sensitive, but otherwise gave similar results. To confirm these results, the reciprocal experiment was performed, in which SHIP was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated and stimulated cells and Shc was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B). HA-Shc can be distinguished from endogenous Shc protein by its slower migration on SDS-PAGE gels, due to the epitope tag addition. In BCR-stimulated cells, SHIP associated well with wild type HA-Shc, whereas mutation of Tyr239, Tyr313, or both led to a dramatic decrease in the amount of HA-Shc associated with SHIP. Similar amounts of endogenous Shc were associated with SHIP in each cell line, providing an internal control. These results indicate that the two Grb2-binding sites of Shc (15Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Curr.

Since Grb2 co-immunoprecipitated with Shc and with SHIP and mutation of the Grb2-binding sites on Shc decreased its ability to form complexes with SHIP, it seemed likely that Grb2 helps hold the Shc·SHIP complex together. An alternative explanation of the latter results would be that the SH2 domain of SHIP binds directly to the phosphorylated Tyr239 and/or"

However, hsps are also toxic when present within cells for a prolonged time period. Thus, the expression of hsps should be tightly regulated. In the present study, the expression of Hsp70 after heat shock was compared between thermotolerant cells, which contain a large concentration of Hsp70, and nonthermotolerant cells (naive). Accumulation of Hsp70, assessed by Western blotting, was negligible when thermotolerant cells were heat-shocked a second time.Hsp70 transcription was similar between thermotolerant and naive cells during heat shock. However, Hsp70 transcription was attenuated more rapidly in thermotolerant than naive cells immediately upon return to non-heat shock conditions. In addition, Hsp70 mRNA stability was reduced in thermotolerant cells as compared with naive cells following the stress. New synthesis of Hsp70 and the efficiency of Hsp70 mRNA translation were similar between thermotolerant and naive cells during the post-stress period. These results suggest that thermotolerant cells limit Hsp70expression by transcriptional and pretranslational mechanisms, perhaps to avoid the potential cytotoxic effect of these proteins. Expression of heat shock proteins (hsps) results in the protection of cells from subsequent stresses. However, hsps are also toxic when present within cells for a prolonged time period. Thus, the expression of hsps should be tightly regulated. In the present study, the expression of Hsp70 after heat shock was compared between thermotolerant cells, which contain a large concentration of Hsp70, and nonthermotolerant cells (naive). Accumulation of Hsp70, assessed by Western blotting, was negligible when thermotolerant cells were heat-shocked a second time.Hsp70 transcription was similar between thermotolerant and naive cells during heat shock. However, Hsp70 transcription was attenuated more rapidly in thermotolerant than naive cells immediately upon return to non-heat shock conditions. In addition, Hsp70 mRNA stability was reduced in thermotolerant cells as compared with naive cells following the stress. New synthesis of Hsp70 and the efficiency of Hsp70 mRNA translation were similar between thermotolerant and naive cells during the post-stress period. These results suggest that thermotolerant cells limit Hsp70expression by transcriptional and pretranslational mechanisms, perhaps to avoid the potential cytotoxic effect of these proteins. heat shock protein The expression of heat shock or stress proteins (hsps)1 is a common response to a variety of adverse conditions, including the increase in normal environmental temperatures, incubation with amino acid analogues, exposure to oxygen radicals, UV radiation, heavy metals, and ethanol (1Morimoto R.I. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar, 2De Maio A. New Horizons. 1995; 3: 198-207PubMed Google Scholar). Cells containing hsps induced after a primary stress show resistance to a secondary insult, a phenomenon termed stress tolerance. Several observations suggest that hsps are directly involved in stress tolerance. An increase in the number of Hsp70 gene copies inDrosophila melanogaster larvae results in higher protection from stress (3Feder M.E. Cartano N.V. Milos L. Krebs R.A. Lindquist S.L. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1837-1844PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the heat shock expression renders cells highly susceptible to damage (4Johnston R.N. Kucey B.L. Science. 1988; 242: 1551-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Microinjection of antibodies against hsps also increases the sensitivity of cells to stress (5Riabowol K.T. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. Science. 1988; 242: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the Hsp70 gene are more resistant to thermal stress (6Heads R.J. Latchman D.S. Yellon D.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 695-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Incubation of artificially denatured enzymes with Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp40 results in the recovery of their enzymatic activities (7Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Protein aggregates that accumulate within the cell after a stress are resolubilized by Hsp104 (8Parsell D.A. Kiwal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 9Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of hsps has been correlated with the preservation or repair of cellular structures such as microfilaments (10Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and centrosomes (11Vidair C.A. Doxsey S.J. Dewey W.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, cellular processes such as splicing (12Yost H.J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Vogel J.L. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 306-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and translation (14Mizzen L. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Circ. Shock. 1993; 40: 177-186PubMed Google Scholar, 16De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) are stabilized by hsps during stress conditions. The latter seems to be mediated by the direct interaction of Hsp70 with ribosome subunits (17Beck C.S. De Maio A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21803-21811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of hsps is mainly regulated at the level of transcription in mammalian cells. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is present in a monomeric form in non-stressed cells. After stress, HSF1 trimerizes gaining DNA binding activity (18Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lis J. Wu C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The interaction of this factor with the promoter region of the hsp genes activates polymerase II to continue transcription of these genes, which is in a paused state during normal conditions (19Lis J. Wu C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Hsp70 has been found associated with HSF1, suggesting that Hsp70 may autoregulate its own expression (20Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 21Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Mosser D.D. Duchaine J. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 17: 5427-5438Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Several studies support this hypothesis. InEscherichia coli, the interaction of DnaK (Hsp70) and DnaJ (Hsp40) regulates the transactivator factor ς32, which is involved in the transcription activation of heat shock genes in bacteria (23Tilly K. McKittrick N. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Cell. 1983; 34: 641-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Functionally defective mutants of Hsp70 result in cells that overexpress this gene (27Craig E. Gross C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Hsp70 in the absence of stress results in a reduced expression of this protein after heat shock (28Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Since thermotolerant cells contain a large concentration of hsps, the expression of hsp genes may be limited when these cells are subjected to a secondary heat shock. In the present study, the expression of Hsp70 was found to be attenuated in thermotolerant HepG2 cells. The reduced expression of Hsp70in these cells was apparently due to a rapid decrease inHsp70 transcription and an increase in Hsp70 mRNA degradation upon return to non-heat shock conditions, but not during heat shock. HepG2 cells, a human hepatoblastoma cell line, were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids (1×), sodium pyruvate (2 mm), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (10 IU/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml), and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (10%), at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Pulse-labeling of cells was performed by incubation with [35S]methionine (50 μCi, 800 Ci/mmol, Tran35S-label, ICN Biomedicals) in methionine-free, serum-free minimal essential medium for 15 min. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (15De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Circ. Shock. 1993; 40: 177-186PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by the acid-guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). RNA (10 μg) was separated in formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred onto nylon modified membranes (GeneScreen Plus). Human Hsp70 DNA (30Wu B. Hunt C. Morimoto R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) was labeled by the random primer method (31Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) using [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP (17Beck C.S. De Maio A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21803-21811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C, washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 1 m NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% SDS at 42 °C, 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C and 65 °C, and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak X-Omat AR) at −70 °C in the presence of intensifying screens. To demonstrate equal loading of the RNA samples into the gel, blots were stained with methylene blue (0.03%) in 3 m NaOAc, pH 5.2, prior to hybridization. The signal corresponding to Hsp70 mRNA was quantitated using a laser scanner densitometer and normalized to the signal of the 18 S rRNA detected by methylene blue staining prior to hybridization. Hsp70 mRNA levels were quantified by scanning densitometry. The mRNA level from each time point at which transcription was negligible was plotted as a function of time. A line was fitted to graph of the log[RNA level] as a function of time using Microsoft Excel to calculate the slope and intercept and the time at which half the RNA would have decayed. Nuclei were isolated according to the following procedure. Monolayers (90% confluent) of HepG2 cells (3 × 100-mm dishes) were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in phosphate-buffered saline (1 ml), and centrifuged (9,000 × g for 1 min). The pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (1 ml), and nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (9,000 × g for 3 s). Nuclei were resuspended in one volume of storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol). Nuclei in storage buffer (50 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.7 mm ATP, GTP and CTP, 0.8 μm UTP, and 0.1 mCi of [α-32P]UTP and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by incubation with DNase I (10 units) for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of four volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.35 m LiCl, 1 mmEDTA, 7 m urea, and 2% SDS. The reaction was further incubated with proteinase K (500 μg/ml) at 45 °C for 60 min. At the end of the incubation period, tRNA (50 μg) was added and the total mixture was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10%). The nucleic acid precipitate was resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS and hybridized to DNA targets. The DNA targets include pBluescript SK− (vector control), pHFβA-1, pHHsp70 (human Hsp70), and prRNA (human ribosomal 28 S). Hybridization was carried out in 50% formamide, 6× SSC, 10× Denhardt's, and 0.2% SDS at 42 °C for 72 h. After hybridization, filters were washed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min and 65 °C for 15 min. Washes were continued with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min twice, and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 5 min. Filters were exposed to x-ray films (Kodak X-Omat AR) at −70 °C in the presence of intensifying screens. Cells were lysed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 5 min, and the supernatant (postmitochondrial fraction) was sedimented through a 15–45% linear sucrose gradient at 178,000 × g (average) for 90 min. The gradients were fractionated using an automatic system (Brandel Biomedical), with continuous recording of the absorbance at 254 nm. Total RNA was purified from each fraction (16 fractions), slot-blotted, probed with radiolabeled probes for Hsp70 and β-actin, and visualized by autoradiography. The signal intensity in the film (linear range of exposure) was quantitated using a scanning densitometer and the tracing was plotted versus fraction number. HepG2 cells were made thermotolerant by a nonlethal pre-heat shock treatment (43 °C, 1.5 h), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h (recovery period) (15De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Circ. Shock. 1993; 40: 177-186PubMed Google Scholar). Thermotolerant cells showed over 90% incorporation of radioactive amino acids as compared with control cells maintained at 37 °C, in contrast to naı̈ve cells, which had a 30% incorporation of radioactive amino acids with respect to controls as described previously (15De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Circ. Shock. 1993; 40: 177-186PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these cells showed viability 2-fold higher than naı̈ve cells after incubation at 45 °C for 2 h. At the end of the recovery period, thermotolerant cells were thermally stressed (43 °C, 1.5 h) for a second time. Cells were lysed 3 h after the first stress (T1), immediately before the second stress (T2), and 6 h after the second stress (T3). For comparison, HepG2 cells were heat-shocked at 43 °C for 1.5 h and lysed after 6 h of recovery at 37 °C (naive cells, N). Non-stressed HepG2 cells (C) were also included in the analysis. The accumulation of Hsp70 in thermotolerant cells was analyzed by Western blotting. The levels of Hsp70 were similar between thermotolerant cells before (T2) and after (T3) the second heat shock and naive cells (Fig.1). This observation suggests that there is no additional detectable accumulation of Hsp70 in thermotolerant cells after a second heat shock. Naive and thermotolerant HepG2 cells were thermally stressed at 43 °C for 1.5 h. Nuclei were isolated from cells harvested immediately at the end of the heat shock period, or after different times during incubation at 37 °C following the stress. Transcription rates were measured by the transcript run-off technique using nuclei isolated from the same number of cells for each reaction. In naive cells, transcription of Hsp70 was maximal between the end of the heat shock (0) and 1 h of incubation at 37 °C after the stress, followed by a steady decrease between 2 and 8 h of incubation at 37 °C. The rate of Hsp70transcription at the end of the heat shock was not different between thermotolerant and naive cells. However, Hsp70 transcription in thermotolerant cells showed a sharp decrease in activity during the period immediately after the heat shock (Fig.2, A and B). Thus, transcription at 0.5 h of incubation at 37 °C was less than 10% of the rate of transcription at the end of the heat shock in thermotolerant cells (Fig. 2 B). The transcription rates were also evaluated during the heat shock period (60 and 90 min at 43 °C). No differences in Hsp70 transcription were found between naı̈ve and thermotolerant cells (Fig. 2 C). Transcription of the 28 S rRNA decreased immediately after heat shock in naive cells but not in thermotolerant cells. There was no hybridization to pSK used as a negative control (not shown). Analysis of the Hsp70 mRNA levels by Northern blotting showed a pattern similar to the transcription of the Hsp70gene. In naive cells, Hsp70 mRNA levels increased from the end of the heat shock to 5 h of return to non-heat shock conditions, which were then followed by a steady decrease (Fig.3 A). In thermotolerant cells, Hsp70 mRNA levels were identical to naive cells at the end of the heat shock. A mild increase in Hsp70 mRNA levels was observed within 1 h of the stress. There was also a sharp decrease in the message level after 1 h of post-stress recovery (Fig.3 A). The half-life of Hsp70 mRNA was determined in conditions of negligible Hsp70 transcription to avoid the use of transcriptional inhibitors. In naive cells, the Hsp70 mRNA half-life was 1 h (data not shown) at 37 °C after heat shock, which is consistent with previous observations (32Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4357-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the half-life of Hsp70 mRNA in thermotolerant cells during incubation at 37 °C after the stress was 0.5–06 h from three separate experiments (a representative experiment is presented in Fig.4).Figure 4Determination of Hsp70 mRNA half-life in thermotolerant cells. Thermotolerant HepG2 cells were heat-shocked at 43 °C for 1.5 h and allowed to recover at 37 °C for different time periods. Hsp70 mRNA half-life was determined during conditions of negligible Hsp70 transcription as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The preceding observations suggest that the reduced expression of Hsp70 in thermotolerant cells is due to a rapid decrease in transcription and an increase in Hsp70 mRNA degradation. To investigate whether translation of Hsp70 could also be affected in thermotolerant cells, synthesis of Hsp70 was analyzed by pulse-labeling experiments. Naive or thermotolerant cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min at 37 °C immediately after heat shock (0), or after 1 or 2 h of post stress recovery. After the pulse labeling, cells were lysed. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody specific for Hsp70, and the immunoprecipitate was visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 5,top panel). For comparison, Hsp70 mRNA levels in the pulse-labeled cells were also analyzed (Fig. 5,bottom panel). There were no significant differences in the synthesis of Hsp70 between naive and thermotolerant HepG2 cells when newly synthesized Hsp70 (immunoprecipitation) and Hsp70 mRNA levels were compared. To further investigate whether there were differences in translation of Hsp70 mRNA between naive and thermotolerant cells, the translational efficiency of Hsp70 mRNA was analyzed by determining the message localization in polysomes isolated from these cells after heat shock. Polysomes were obtained by density centrifugation through sucrose gradients. Fractions of these gradients were collected, total RNA was isolated from each fraction, and analyzed by slot blot/hybridization using radiolabeled probes for Hsp70 andβ-actin. The presence of the particular mRNA in the heavier polysome fractions is an indicator of a message that is well translated, whereas the presence of the mRNA in the monosome or disome fractions suggests that the message is translated less efficiently. β-Actin mRNA was efficiently translated in non-stressed cells and less efficiently translated after heat shock at 43 °C for 1.5 h (Fig. 6). This observation is consistent with reports indicating that non-heat shock proteins are synthesized poorly after heat shock (15De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Circ. Shock. 1993; 40: 177-186PubMed Google Scholar, 33DiDomenico B.J. Bugaisky G.E. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6181-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the decrease in the translation of β-actin mRNA, Hsp70 mRNA was translated with good efficiency (Fig. 6). After 1 or 2 h of incubation at 37 °C following heat shock, Hsp70 mRNA is translated with high efficiency, whereas a slow increase in the translation efficiency of β-actin mRNA was observed (Fig. 6). A similar analysis of thermotolerant cells showed that Hsp70 mRNA is always translated with high efficiency (Fig. 6), probably with higher efficiency as compared with naive cells immediately after heat shock. Interestingly, the translational efficiency of β-actin mRNA was much better preserved in thermotolerant cells (Fig. 6). This observation is consistent with the protection of protein synthesis observed in thermotolerant cells (14Mizzen L. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Circ. Shock. 1993; 40: 177-186PubMed Google Scholar, 17Beck C.S. De Maio A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21803-21811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, a limited expression of Hsp70after heat shock was observed in thermotolerant cells as compared with naive cells. This reduced expression of Hsp70 in thermotolerant cells was due to the combination of a decline inHsp70 transcription and an increase in Hsp70 mRNA degradation during the return to non-heat shock conditions after the stress. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the transcription rate of Hsp70 during heat shock between thermotolerant and naive cells. This transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of Hsp70 expression may be part of a mechanism to limit the cellular concentration of this protein. A similar mechanism has been previously proposed to regulate the expression of Hsp70 in naive Drosophila cells after heat shock (34DiDomenico B.J. Bugaisky G.E. Lindquist S. Cell. 1982; 31: 593-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the expression of hsp is attenuated proportionally to the initial stress and occurs during the recovery period in naive cells (20Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 33DiDomenico B.J. Bugaisky G.E. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6181-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Attenuation of Hsp70 expression was not observed in conditions of continuous stress, such as in the case of incubation with amino acid analogues (34DiDomenico B.J. Bugaisky G.E. Lindquist S. Cell. 1982; 31: 593-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 35Mosser D. Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 during stress has been reported to be reduced in cells that contain conditionally induced Hsp70 (28Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Functional mutation ofHsp70 results in overexpression of this gene in yeast (27Craig E. Gross C.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). A mechanism that has been proposed for autoregulation or self-limiting expression of Hsp70 is based on the observation that Hsp70 binds to HSF1 (20Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1153-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 21Baler R. Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Mosser D.D. Duchaine J. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 17: 5427-5438Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although the association of Hsp70 with HSF1 does not affect its DNA binding activity, Hsp70transcription is negatively regulated (28Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). A similar model has been proposed in E. coli, in which hsps also directly interact with the transactivator factor ς32 (23Tilly K. McKittrick N. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Cell. 1983; 34: 641-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Straus D.B. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2202-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 25Liberek K. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6224-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Gamer J. Multhaup G. Tomoyasu T. McCarty J.S. Rudiger S. Schonfeld H.-J. Schirra C. Bujard H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Our observations cannot be completely explained on the basis of this model. The level ofHsp70 transcription was similar between thermotolerant and naive cells during heat shock. Thus, Hsp70 does not block its own transcription, at least in thermotolerant cells during heat shock. As mentioned above, attenuation of Hsp70 was only observed during incubation at 37 °C after the stress. A possible explanation for this observation is that a temperature labile protein is necessary to attenuate Hsp70 transcription. This protein may be synthesized during the recovery period following the stress, resulting in the reduction of Hsp70 transcription. In thermotolerant cells, the attenuation of Hsp70 transcription is achieved more rapidly, probably because translation is protected in these cells (15De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Circ. Shock. 1993; 40: 177-186PubMed Google Scholar, 17Beck C.S. De Maio A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21803-21811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative explanation of our results could be formulated on the assumption that the inducer of the heat shock expression is the presence of denatured polypeptides within the cell. Indeed, previous studies have shown that hsps are expressed after microinjection of unfolded polypeptides into unstressed cells (36Anathan J. Goldberg A.L. Voellmy R. Science. 1986; 232: 252-254Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that polypeptides are rapidly denatured in cells during heat shock regardless of whether the cells do or do not contain Hsp70 (thermotolerant). The indirect activation of HSF1 by the presence of unfolded polypeptides is faster than the interaction and potential solubilization of the unfolded polypeptides by hsps. Thus, the initial stimuli, the presence of denatured polypeptides, is the same for thermotolerant and naive cells. Upon return to non-heat shock conditions, hsps limit the amount of denatured polypeptides, resulting in a decrease of Hsp70 expression. In addition to a decrease of Hsp70 transcription, Hsp70 mRNA is less stable in thermotolerant cells with respect to naive cells. The half-life of Hsp70 mRNA in naive cells at 37 °C is on the order of 1 h, whereas it is 0.5–0.6 h in thermotolerant cells. This accelerated degradation of Hsp70 mRNA is consistent with a mechanism to limit the expression of Hsp70. For example, the attenuation of transcription decreases further accumulation of Hsp70 mRNA. However, the remaining cytosolic Hsp70 mRNA can still be translated. Thus, degradation of Hsp70 mRNA is necessary to limit the cellular level of Hsp70. Although this hypothesis may explain the reduction in Hsp70 mRNA half-life in thermotolerant cells, the mechanism by which Hsp70 mRNA is destabilized is not clear. Many cellular mRNAs contain elements located within the message that are involved in the stability of the message (37Decker C.J. Parker R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 336-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, Hsp70 mRNA is identical between naive and thermotolerant cells. Thus, it is possible that a destabilizing protein that interacts with Hsp70 mRNA is denatured during heat shock in naive cells while protected in thermotolerant cells. In support of this hypothesis, the half-life of Hsp70 mRNA has previously been reported to be longer during heat shock in comparison to the recovery after the stress period (32Theodorakis N.G. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4357-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation of our observations is that Hsp70 mRNA is unstable under normal conditions (37 °C in mammalian cells). During heat shock, Hsp70 mRNA is apparently more stable because mRNA degradation is affected by the stress. In thermotolerant cells, degradation seems to happen immediately after returning to 37 °C. It is possible that mRNA degradation is accelerated in thermotolerant cells, resulting in a reduced half-life of Hsp70 mRNA. Hsp70 mRNA is translated with high efficiency in both thermotolerant and naive cells suggesting that translational control does not play a role in the attenuation of Hsp70 expression. On the contrary, the translation efficiency of β-actin mRNA is dramatically reduced in naive cells during heat shock, while preserved in thermotolerant cells during identical conditions. This observation is consistent with the protection of protein synthesis in thermotolerant cells during a second heat shock that has previously been reported (14Mizzen L. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Circ. Shock. 1993; 40: 177-186PubMed Google Scholar, 16De Maio A. Beck S.C. Buchman T.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that Hsp70 is associated with polysomes by the direct binding to ribosome subunits rather than nascent polypeptides (17Beck C.S. De Maio A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21803-21811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the improved translation of β-actin in thermotolerant cells during heat shock may be related to the interaction of Hsp70 with ribosomes. In summary, our study shows that the expression of Hsp70 in thermotolerant cells is attenuated by a decrease in Hsp70transcription during incubation at 37 °C (recovery period) after heat shock. An increase in Hsp70 mRNA degradation also contributes to limit the expression of this gene. The presence of Hsp70 and other hsps has been associated with cellular protection to different stresses: stress tolerance (2De Maio A. New Horizons. 1995; 3: 198-207PubMed Google Scholar). However, the accumulation of Hsp70 in the absence of stress has been shown to affect cell division (38Feder J.H. Rossi J.M. Solomon J. Solomon N. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1402-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of Hsp70 seems to be detrimental in the long term. A mechanism to limit the expression of Hsp70 may have evolved to preserve the cell from the toxic effects of this protein. The direct role ofHsp70 in this process remains to be demonstrated.

Three sites within the proximal promoter (myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), E-box, and CACC box) were individually mutated, and the effect on luciferase expression was determined. There was no change in luciferase expression in the SOL and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles when the E-box was mutated.

Lewis D.M. J. Physiol. 1965; 178: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Pette D. Vrbova G. Muscle Nerve. 1985; 8: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). An adult skeletal muscle fiber normally expresses a relatively homogeneous pattern of either fast or slow contractile protein isoforms consistent with its type of innervation. These proteins include fast and slow isoforms from the myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain (MLC),1tropomyosin, and the troponin I, T, and C gene families (3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 4Pette D. Staron R.S. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 116: 1-76PubMed Google Scholar).It has been well established that chronic low frequency electrical stimulation of fast muscle fibers, by stimulating either through the nerve or by direct stimulation of the muscle, induces the slow skeletal muscle phenotype (2Pette D. Vrbova G. Muscle Nerve. 1985; 8: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 4Pette D. Staron R.S. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 116: 1-76PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is characterized by an increased expression of the slow contractile protein isoforms. Conversely, if a slow nerve is removed or electrical activity is blocked, there is a transition from a slow to fast muscle phenotype. These transitions in phenotype have been determined at the mRNA level, which suggests that alterations in slow neural activity transcriptionally regulate slow isoform gene expression (3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 5Pette D. Staron R.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 143-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Esser K.A.

Regions of the MLC1slow, TnIslow, andMLC2slow genes have been identified that are responsive to slow innervation; however, the specific elements involved have not been isolated (7Calvo S. Stauffer J.

A. 1989; 86: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).The MLC2slow gene, in particular, is one of the contractile protein isoform genes that is largely regulated by slow innervation. Unlike many of the other contractile proteins genes, theMLC2slow gene is not expressed in newly formed myotubes either in vivo or in vitro (17Zhu H. Garcia A.V. Ross R.S. Evans S.M. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2273-2281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sutherland C. Esser K. Elsom V. Gordon M. Hardeman E. Dev.

During skeletal muscle development, in humans and rats, induction of MLC2slow expression occurs late and correlates with the establishment of mature innervation patterns. The requirement of specific neuromuscular activity for MLC2slow gene expression is most evident when studying skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo. Expression of theMLC2slow gene is only detected in the soleus muscle regenerating in the presence of its own nerve (6Esser K.A. Gunning P. Hardeman E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this system, induction of MLC2slow mRNA occurs at a time that is coincident with the establishment of functional neuromuscular junctions (21Carlson B. Hnik P. Tucek S. Vejsada R. Bader D. Faulkner J. Physiol. Bohemoslov. 1981; 30: 505-511PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this relatively clear on/off pattern of control, theMLC2slow promoter serves as a good molecular tool for the identification of promoter elements responsible for slow nerve-dependent regulation of transcription.Recently, it was determined that the 800-bp promoter of the ratMLC2slow gene was capable of directing slow nerve-dependent expression in regenerating muscles in vivo (9Lupa-Kimball V. Esser K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C229-C235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in the previous work, this study combined skeletal muscle regeneration with in vivo injection of plasmid DNA constructs into muscle. The main objectives were 1) to find a smaller region of the 800-bp MLC2slow promoter capable of directing slow nerve-dependent expression, 2) to determine specific cis-acting regulatory sites, and 3) to determine site-specific factor binding and assess potential transcription factor involvement in regulation of the MLC2slow promoter. Using site-directed mutagenesis, three sites (E-box, MEF2, and CACC box) were mutated to investigate their functional role in MLC2slow expression. It was determined that both the CACC box and MEF2 sites were important for appropriate slow nerve-dependent promoter activity during regeneration. These data suggest that the slow nerve acts through the CACC box to derepress the promoter. Once repression is lifted, then high level expression is regulated by MEF2. Interestingly, the proximal combination of the CACC box and MEF2-like sites is seen in other previously defined slow muscle specific regions of contractile protein genes, including TnIslow, TnCslow, MLC1slow, myoglobin, and slow myosin heavy chain. This suggests that a conserved mechanism may exist by which the CACC box and MEF2 sites contribute to slow nerve-dependent regulation of the subset of slow contractile protein isoform genes.DISCUSSIONFrom the results of this study, we describe a two-step model for slow nerve-dependent regulation of the MLC2slowpromoter. The first step of the model is derepression at the CACC box followed by high level expression regulated through the MEF2 site. Because overexpressing MEF2 is not sufficient to enhance transcription in SOL− and EDL muscles, this suggests that repression of theMLC2slow promoter may be a dominant effect. The appearance of closely linked CACC box and MEF2-like sites within the regulatory regions of a number of previously identified slow contractile protein genes raises the possibility that this two-step model for slow nerve regulation of the MLC2slow promoter may represent a general mechanism for controlling slow isoform contractile protein gene expression.A two-step model of gene regulation has been previously proposed for α-actin and keratin genes (36Gunning P. Hardeman E. Wade R. Ponte P. Bains W. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4100-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Mathisen P.M. Miller L. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Minty A. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). With this model, the activation of transcription is controlled by one set of transcription factors and high level expression is regulated by a different set of transcription factors. When applying this model to the MLC2slow promoter, derepression is the first step, and it is mediated by the slow nerve through binding at the CACC box. However, because there is no difference in EMSA results with SOL+, SOL−, or EDL extracts, that would argue that the slow nerve does not act by altering the number of factors binding to the CACC box. This suggests either that slow innervation leads to derepression through posttranslationally modifying the existing protein(s) binding to the CACC box or that the CACC box site, in the context of the full −270-bp promoter, has a different binding behavior compared with what was seen with the oligonucleotide in an in vitro assay.To date, there is very little known about CACC box-binding proteins. One candidate protein that was considered is the winged-helix transcription factor, MNF. This factor was initially isolated using the CACC box sequence of the human myoglobin gene (32Bassel-Duby R. Hernandez M.D. Yang Q. Rochelle J.M. Seldin M.F. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4596-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and its expression is up-regulated in muscles subjected to chronic motor nerve stimulation (32Bassel-Duby R. Hernandez M.D. Yang Q. Rochelle J.M. Seldin M.F. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4596-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, in this study, negative results from supershift assays suggest that MNF is not part of the complex binding to the CACC box sequence as either a repressor or derepressor.It was interesting to find that derepression through the CACC site is not sufficient for high level expression in SOL− muscles (see Fig. 1). This finding led to the identification of the second step of regulation in which activation through the MEF2 site is necessary for high level expression of the MLC2slow promoter. The findings from thein vivo transfection experiments (mutational and overexpression experiments) were consistent with those from thein vitro DNA binding and supershift assays. This strongly suggests that MEF2 proteins are specifically binding at the MEF2 site within the MLC2slow promoter and that this binding is critical for complex formation and subsequent transcriptional activity. The supershift experiments also indicated that the ubiquitous factor, Sp1, but not Oct-1 contributes to the binding activity on the MEF2 site. This is seen with extracts from all muscles studied and is consistent with reported Sp1 and MEF2 interaction seen with nuclear extracts from myotubes in culture (39Grayson J. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and nerve cells (40Krainc D. Bai G. Okamoto S. Carles M. Kusiak J. Brent R. Lipton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26218-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Another potential factor that has been implicated in regulating transcriptional activity through the MEF2 site of muscle specific promoters is the nuclear factor of activated T cells, NFAT. In a recent study, Chin et al. (41Chin E. Olson E. Richardson J. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of activated calcineurin, which leads to increased NFAT translocation to the nucleus, can enhance transcription of slow muscle type genes. They propose that NFAT and MEF2 are involved in a combinatorial mechanism to regulate slow muscle type genes in skeletal muscle. Although intriguing, the results from this study are not consistent with that NFAT-MEF2 model. If the slow nerve does activate transcription of slow muscle type genes through a calcineurin/NFAT mechanism, then it would be predicted in our experiments that the increase in nuclear NFAT and its interaction with MEF2 should be evident in EMSA experiments with SOL+ versus SOL− nuclear extracts. However, results from electrophoretic mobility shift assays did not detect any differences between the MEF2 complexes in SOL+ and SOL− extracts. In addition, if NFAT translocation to the nucleus was required for transcriptional activation, then overexpressing MEF2 in the SOL− muscles would not be effective in transactivating the promoter. However, overexpression of MEF2 did induce significant transactivation in the SOL− muscles when the CACC site was mutated within the MLC2slow promoter. This indicates that there are multiple levels of nerve-dependent regulation, of which modulation of repressor/derepressor activity through the CACC site is, in part, a critical step. Finally, unlike the promoters discussed by Chin et al. (41Chin E. Olson E. Richardson J. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), theMLC2slow promoter does not contain a consensus NFAT site. These arguments do not rule out NFAT involvement in some aspect of regulation, but clearly, further experiments must be done to determine its function in this system.A unique aspect of this study came from the in vivotransfection studies that provided important insight into potential mechanisms by which MEF2 transcriptional activity is regulated in adult skeletal muscle in vivo. To date, most of the information regarding regulation of contractile proteins genes by either MEF2 or the bHLH myogenic regulatory factors have been made during embryonic development or in cell culture (11Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 26Edmondson D.G. Olson E.N.

In this in vivo study, overexpressing MEF2 (both MEF2A and MEF2C) enhanced MLC2slow promoter activity in the SOL+ muscles. This suggests that MEF2 levels are limiting for quantitative transcriptional output from theMLC2slow promoter during skeletal muscle regeneration and that the MLC2slow promoter does not seem to discriminate between these two MEF2 isoforms. The additional observation from Western blots that MEF2 protein levels are significantly decreased in the SOL− muscles compared with either the SOL+ or EDL muscles also suggests that innervation is important for appropriate regulation of MEF2 levels in adult skeletal muscle.In contrast to the regulation of other skeletal muscle specific contractile protein genes (7Calvo S. Stauffer J. Nakayama M. Buonanno A. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Banerjee-Basu S. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3735-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), neither the E-box site nor one of the basic helix loop helix myogenic regulatory proteins, myogenin, was important for expression of the MLC2slowpromoter. This is consistent with the lack of MLC2slow gene expression in myotubes at times when expression of the myogenic regulatory factors are high (18Sutherland C. Esser K. Elsom V. Gordon M. Hardeman E. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 196: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, recent in vitrowork has elegantly shown that the basic helix loop helix myogenic regulatory factors (myoD and myogenin) can cooperate with MEF2 proteins and transactivate muscle specific genes (47Molkentin J. Black B. Martin J. Olson E. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was somewhat surprising in this study that MEF2 overexpression could only enhance transcription in SOL+ muscles through the MEF2 site and that overexpression of myogenin did not enhance MLC2slow promoter activity. These results suggest that within the MLC2slow promoter, myogenin (and perhaps the other basic helix loop helix proteins) is not transcriptionally important for either induction or high level expression.Results from this study have implicated the CACC box of theMLC2slow promoter as a dominant site through which the slow nerve mediates expression. The identification of the CACC box as a repressor site within the MLC2slow promoter was a surprise because mutational studies of the CACC box within the SURE element of the TnIslow gene suggested that this site acted as an activator in slow skeletal muscle of transgenic mice (48Nakayama M. Stauffer J. Cheng J. Banerjee-Basu S. Wawrousek E. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2408-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, more recent in vitro transfection studies showed that mutation of the SURE element CACC box only resulted in a slight decrease in promoter activity (7Calvo S. Stauffer J. Nakayama M. Buonanno A. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These contrasting results between transgenic mice and in vitro transfection studies suggests that the CACC box of the SURE element may provide different transcriptional functions depending on the cellular environment or developmental stage. Whether the CACC box of the MLC2slowpromoter and the CACC box of the TnIslow element share common roles in regulating slow nerve specific expression in adult animals is not clear at this time.It was not surprising, however, that a repressor element was identified within the rat MLC2slow promoter. Previous reports had noted that the rat MLC2slow gene had an upstream repressor site (HF3) that when mutated resulted in up-regulation in nonmuscle tissues (49Lee K.J. Hickey R. Zhu H. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1220-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, two separate repressor elements have been identified in the chicken MLC2slow promoter: the CSS and NMS sites (50Dhar M. Mascareno E.M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18490-18497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These two sites within the chicken gene share a common sequence motif, GAAG/CTTC, which is associated with the repressor activity. Whereas the HF3 site of the rat MLC2slow gene does contain a GAAG sequence, the CACC box of the same gene does not. This suggests that the use of the CACC box within the MLC2slow promoter may be critical for fiber type specificity in skeletal muscle, whereas the HF3/CSS/NMS type site may be important for providing striated muscle restriction.The induction of slow contractile protein isoforms in response to slow innervation or low frequency chronic stimulation in vivo has been well characterized (3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 5Pette D. Staron R.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 143-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Kraus W. Torgan C.

These studies have contributed to the concept of a coordinated pattern of isoform gene expression and have raised the possibility of a shared mechanism of gene regulation. Within the last 4 years, slow nerve-dependent regions of the MLC1slow, TnIslow, and MLC2slow genes have been identified (7Calvo S. Stauffer J. Nakayama M. Buonanno A. Dev.

Therefore, we compared the DNA sequences of previously identified slow muscle specific regions of slow contractile protein genes (Fig. 7). What is apparent is that each of these regions contains a CACC box site with a MEF2-like site in close approximation, within 50 base pairs (33Corin S.J. Levitt L.K. O'Mahoney J.V. Joya J.E.

Although speculative, this raises the possibility that the two-step model for slow nerve-dependent regulation of theMLC2slow promoter, proposed in this paper, may be shared by other slow isoform genes. Future experiments are required to test the applicability of this two-step model to other slow isoform genes.In summary, the results from in vivo transfection experiments indicate that both the CACC box and MEF2 sites are important for mediating slow nerve-dependent regulation of the MLC2slow promoter. Consistent with the in vivo findings, results from electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays confirmed MEF2 and Sp1 binding to the MEF2 site and demonstrate specific factor binding to the CACC sequence. From these results, a model for MLC2slow transcriptional regulation is proposed in which derepression occurs through factor(s) binding at the CACC box followed by quantitative expression through enhanced MEF2 activation. The prevalence of MEF2-like sites in close approximation to CACC sites within regulatory regions of many slow contractile protein isoform genes raises a question about the applicability of this two-step model for those other slow isoform genes. The acquisition and maintenance of an adult skeletal muscle phenotype is regulated, in part, by the activity of specific motor neurons (1Buller A.J. Lewis D.M. J. Physiol. 1965; 178: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Pette D. Vrbova G. Muscle Nerve. 1985; 8: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). An adult skeletal muscle fiber normally expresses a relatively homogeneous pattern of either fast or slow contractile protein isoforms consistent with its type of innervation. These proteins include fast and slow isoforms from the myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain (MLC),1tropomyosin, and the troponin I, T, and C gene families (3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 4Pette D. Staron R.S. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 116: 1-76PubMed Google Scholar). It has been well established that chronic low frequency electrical stimulation of fast muscle fibers, by stimulating either through the nerve or by direct stimulation of the muscle, induces the slow skeletal muscle phenotype (2Pette D. Vrbova G. Muscle Nerve. 1985; 8: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 4Pette D. Staron R.S. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 116: 1-76PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is characterized by an increased expression of the slow contractile protein isoforms. Conversely, if a slow nerve is removed or electrical activity is blocked, there is a transition from a slow to fast muscle phenotype. These transitions in phenotype have been determined at the mRNA level, which suggests that alterations in slow neural activity transcriptionally regulate slow isoform gene expression (3Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 5Pette D. Staron R.S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 143-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Esser K.A.

In addition, an amber-type mutation (Glu72Stop) of the GHRH-R in humans was demonstrated to cause profound GH deficiency (6Wajnrajch M.P. Gertner J.M. Harbison M.D. Chau S.C. Leibel R.L. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These genetic disorders suggest the physiological significance of GHRH-R in hypothalamo-pituitary GH axis. The relationship between the dynamics of GHRH-R expression and GH secretion remains to be clarified. Not only the functional defects of GHRH-R but also the amount of GHRH-R should affect GH synthesis and secretion in the pituitary. Hypothalamic hormone, neurotransmitters, various hormonal states, and nutrition all could modulate the activity of the GHRH-GH axis. For instance, glucocorticoids potentiate GHRH action and enhance GH secretion in rats (7Vale W. Vaughan J. Yamamoto G. Spiess J. Rivier J. Endocrinology. 1983; 112: 1553-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 8Stephanou A. Sarlis N.J. Knight R.A. Lightman S.L. Chowdrey H.S. J. Mol.

Metab. 1990; 70: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Iranmanesh A. Veldhuis J.D. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North. Am. 1992; 21: 783-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study showed that GHRH-R gene expression was increased by glucocorticoids in rats (12Lam K.S. Lee M.F. Tam S.P. Srivastava G. Neuroendocrinology. 1996; 63: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The result suggests that glucocorticoids stimulate GH synthesis and secretion, at least in part, via up-regulation of GHRH-R gene expression. Interestingly, Horikawa et al. (13Horikawa R. Hellman P. Cella S.G. Torsello A. Day R.N. Muller E.E. Thorner M.O. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2642-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) observed a marked reduction of GHRH-R mRNA in GHRH-deprived neonatal rats. This observation suggests that GHRH up-regulates GHRH-R expression in addition to direct action to stimulate GH synthesis and secretion. Thus, we need to take the alteration of GHRH-R expression into account to understand the regulatory mechanism of GH secretion. The GHRH-R transcripts have a highly specific distribution in the anterior pituitary, even though the GHRH-R gene is also expressed in the rat hypothalamus (14Takahashi T. Okimura Y. Yoshimura K. Shigeyoshi Y. Kaji H. Abe H. Chihara K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4271-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). During the development of the anterior pituitary gland, the GHRH-R transcripts were detected at embryonic day 16 in somatotrophs following the gene activation of Pit-1, a pituitary-specific POU domain transcription factor (15Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29335-29338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GHRH-R are not expressed in the pituitary of Pit-1-defective Snell/Jackson dwarf mice (16Li S. Crenshaw III, E.B. Rawson E.J. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld G.M. Nature. 1990; 347: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 17Castrillo J.-L. Theill L.E. Karin M. Science. 1991; 253: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that Pit-1 is required for the GHRH-R gene expression. However, it remains unknown whether the Pit-1-binding site is present in the GHRH-R gene and whether it functions for the GHRH-R expression. In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the 5′-flanking region of the human GHRH-R gene to elucidate the regulatory molecular mechanism of the human GHRH-R gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the 5′-flanking region contained a functional promoter and that its promoter activity was dependent on Pit-1. We cloned 5′-flanking region of the human GHRH-R gene using a PCR-based method for DNA walking in uncloned genomic DNA. (PromoterFinder DNA walking kit (CLONTECH)) (18Siebert P.D. Chenchik A. Kellogg D.E. Lukyanov K.D. Lukyanov S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1087-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Adaptor-ligated genomic DNA was amplified with two consecutive PCRs using two oligonucleotide primer pairs. One set of primers used in the primary PCR was the adaptor-specific primer ASP1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) corresponding to the synthetic adaptor and the gene-specific antisense primer GSP2 (5′-TCCATGGTGAGCCCAGCAGTGGCT-3′) corresponding to the 5′-end of the human GHRH-R cDNA (nucleotides position +5 to −19 according to Mayo (1Mayo K.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1743-1744Google Scholar)). Another set of primers for the secondary PCR was the adaptor specific primer ASP2 (5′-CTATAGGGCACGCGCGTGGT-3′), nested to ASP1, and the nested gene-specific antisense primer GSP1 (5′-GGGAAGCTTCCCTCCACCAGCCTCAGTAAGCCTT-3′, nucleotides position −19 to −44). The underlinedHindIII site was added to the 5′-end of GSP1 to facilitate subcloning. PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR conditions were 32 cycles of 94 °C for 25 s and 67 °C for 4 min following 7 cycles of 94 °C for 25 s and 72 °C for 4 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. PCR products were subcloned into pT7Blue vector (Invitrogen) or pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) and sequenced with a DNA sequencer (model 373A or 310, Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems.). 5′-RACE was performed using Marathon-Ready cDNA library (CLONTECH) derived from human pituitary glands according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the first experiment, PCR was performed using ASP1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) specific to the adaptor ligated to cDNA ends and GSP5 (5′-TTGTACAGGCACTCTCATCCTCTCTCA-3′) corresponding to the coding region from +101 to +127 of the human GHRH-R cDNA (1Mayo K.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1743-1744Google Scholar). Cycling parameters used in this 5′-RACE protocol were 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min 30 s. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on an ethidium bromide-stained 1.2% agarose gel. The PCR products were subcloned into pT7Blue vector and sequenced with a DNA sequencer. RNase protection assays were performed, based on the method of Gilman (19Gilman M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 4.7.1-4.7.8Google Scholar). A DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides −2207 to −19 was inserted into pBluescript SK(+). The plasmid containing the DNA fragment from −2207 to −19 was linearized with BalI and used as a template for antisense cRNA probe. The antisense cRNA probe was synthesized by T3 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP. The labeled probe (105 cpm) was hybridized to 4 μg of normal human pituitary gland poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) in 30 μl of hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, 400 mmNaCl, and 1 mm EDTA overnight at 50 °C. Following the hybridization step, RNases A and T1 were added to the hybridization mixture, and the mix was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The protected fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide/50% urea sequencing gel. A bacteriophage M13 mp18 single strand DNA sequencing ladder was prepared using primer (−40) to size the protected fragment. Cells from the rat pituitary-derived cell line, GH3, were cultured in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 15% (v/v) horse serum and 2.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. HeLa and BeWo cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) calf serum. All culture media contained penicillin (100 units/ml) and kanamycin (100 μg/ml). A 2189-nucleotide HindIII fragment of the 5′-flanking genomic sequence (from −2207 to −19, when the translation start site was numbered as +1) of GHRH-R gene was subcloned into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector, pGL3 basic vector (Promega), and the resulting reporter gene was named as hGHRHR-Luc(−2207,−19). This hGHRHR-Luc(−2207,−19) was digested with SacI, and after removing SacI/SacI fragment, the remaining vector was self-ligated with T4 DNA Ligase to form hGHRHR-Luc(−1377,−19). A DraI/HindIII fragment was prepared from hGHRHR-Luc(−1377,−19) by digesting withDraI and HindIII. This fragment was inserted into the multicloning site of pGL3 basic vector digested withSmaI and HindIII to form hGHRHR-Luc(−941,−19). hGHRHR-Luc(−399,−19) was prepared by self-ligating after the digestion of hGHRHR-Luc(−2207,−19) with BalI andSmaI. hGHRHR-Luc(−310,−19) was prepared by self-ligating after the digestion of hGHRHR-Luc(−2207,−19) with ApaI andSmaI. hGHRHR-Luc(−130,−19), hGHRHR-Luc(−120,−19), hGHRHR-Luc(−110,−19), and hGHRHR-Luc(−100,−19) were prepared by inserting PCR-amplified fragments from −130 to −19, from −120 to −19, from −110 to −19, and from −100 to −19 into pGL3 basic vector, respectively. The regions from −130 to −120 and −310 to −130 have putative Pit-1-binding sites P1 and P2, respectively. P1 contains one Pit-1-binding element from −129 to −123, and P2 contains two Pit-1-binding elements from −166 to −160 in upper strand (P2 upper) and from −165 to −171 in lower strand (P2 lower). To clarify their role in stimulating GHRH-R gene expression, reporter plasmid containing mutation of P1 (P1m; TGTACGA, mutated sequences are underlined), P2 upper (P2m; TAGTAAG), or both P2 upper and lower (dP2m; GTCAGTCGTAAG), was made. These plasmids were introduced into GH3, HeLa, or BeWo cells using LipofectAce (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2 μg of GHRH-R-luciferase reporter construct, pGL3 basic vector alone, or rat PRL-luciferase reporter construct, with or without RSV-Pit-1 expression vector, was transfected to the cells in 60-mm dishes. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using Luciferase Assay System and Luminometer TD-20/20 (Promega). Protein concentration was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay based on the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). For footprint studies, recombinant His-tagged Pit-1 was produced in Escherichia coli and partially purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. His-tagged Pit-1 appeared to have same function compared with recombinant Pit-1 previously described (20Okimura Y. Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1559-1565PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA fragment used for DNase-I footprint analysis of the promoter and enhancer regions of GHRH-R gene was prepared by digestion of GHRH-R 5′-flanking region withBsu36I and HindIII and uniquely radiolabeled at the upstream end by filling recessed 3′-termini with [α-32P]deoxy-ATP using DNA polymerase-I. The radiolabeled DNA fragment was first incubated with purified His-tagged Pit-1 in a 25-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 10 μl of DNase-I (0.05 unit; RQ-1 DNase-I, Promega) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 35 mm MgCl2 were added, and the sample was incubated for 8 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 85 μl of 30 mm EDTA, and then the sample was extracted with and equal volume of 1:1 (v/v) phenol-chloroform mixture. After precipitation of the aqueous fraction with ethanol, the samples were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Binding reactions contained 5000 cpm32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, varying amounts of Pit-1, 5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 25 μl. The oligonucleotide probes used were as follows: P1 probe, 5′-TTGGCTAGCTCCTGCCTATGCAAACAGCCACCTG-3′ (−145 to −112); P2 probe, 5′-CCTGGTGAATATTCAGCGGTCTGTGTCCCCTTGG-3′ (−175 to −142); P1m probe, 5′-TTGGCTAGCTCCTGCCTGTACGAACAGCCACCTG-3′ (mutated sequences are underlined); and P2m probe, 5′-CCTGGTGAATAGTAAGCGGTCTGTGTCCCCTTGG-3′. The mutated oligonucleotides had the same mutations as the reporter gene used in the transfection analysis. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then analyzed on nondenaturing, 4% polyacrylamide gels. First, we cloned 5′-flanking region of the human GHRH-R gene as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We obtained three genomic fragments, which were about 6, 2.7, and 0.9 kb in size, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the 0.9-kb fragment was identical to that of 3′-side of the 2.7-kb fragment. In addition, restriction mapping of those fragments indicated that the 6-kb fragment contained the 2.7- and 0.9-kb fragments. The complete sequence of the 2.7-kb genomic fragment is shown in Fig.1. According to the analysis of the 5′-flanking sequence of the human GHRH-R gene by Mac DNASIS Pro software (Hitachi), no typical mammalian TATA boxes were present, but a CAAT box was present at nucleotides −399 to −393. In addition, there were several putative regulatory elements similar to consensus elements, AP-1 (−1558 to −1552), AP-2 (−241 to −230), SP1 (−1179 to −1171), CRE (−524 to −517), GREs (−983 to −969, −1506 to −1492, and −2474 to −2460), two EREs (−662 to −648 and −1887 to −1873), and eleven putative Pit-1-binding elements. The locations of one nucleotide mismatched Pit-1-binding site consensus are as follows: nucleotides −129 to −123, −166 to −160, −171 to −165, −434 to −428, −839 to −833, −1049 to −1043, −1138 to −1132, −1336 to −1330, −1631 to −1625, −1816 to −1810, and −1881 to −1875. To analyze the 5′-end of the human GHRH-R cDNA, we performed 5′-RACE experiments. The 5′-RACE analysis using ASP1 and GSP5 as primers showed that about 300-nucleotide band was amplified (Fig.2 A). From the sequence analysis of these products, the 5′-end of the longest clone was found to extend to 137 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site. The 5′-ends of all the RACE products are indicated with solid circles in Fig. 2 B. To confirm the results of 5′-RACE experiments, RNase protection assays were performed. RNase mapping with a 381-nucleotide labeled cRNA probe complementary to −399 to −19 gave a major protected band of 104 nucleotides with several faint protected bands (Fig. 3). The result indicated that the major transcription start site was 122 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site. In addition, the several faint bands suggested the existence of possible minor start sites.Figure 3RNase mapping of the transcription start sites of the human GHRH-R gene. A, autoradiogram of RNase protection assay. RNase protection assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A uniformly labeled probe corresponding to bases −399 to −19 was hybridized to 4 μg of human pituitary poly(A)+ RNA or 20 μg of yeast tRNA and digested with RNases A and T1.

Plasmids containing cloned 5′-flanking sequences of the human GHRH-R gene fused to the luciferase gene were transfected into rat pituitary tumor cell line GH3 and heterologous cell lines HeLa and BeWo. As illustrated in Fig.4, a significant increase of luciferase activity was observed in GH3 cells transfected with hGHRHR-Luc(−2207,−19), but not in HeLa cells and BeWo cells. The result indicated that the 5′-flanking region has pituitary-specific promoter activity. Next, to define DNA regions important for gene expression, deletion mutants of the 5′-flanking sequences were constructed and used to transfect GH3 cells. Deletion of upstream between −2207 and −310 resulted in a moderate increase in luciferase activity. Further deletion to −130 decreased activity remarkably. Deletion to −120 or −100 resulted in a level of activity that was comparable with that of the pGL3 basic vector (Fig.5 A). This finding suggested that the regions between −310 and −130 and between −130 to −120 were important for the expression in GH3 cells. The regions from −130 to −120 and −310 to −130 have putative Pit-1-binding sites P1 and P2, respectively. P1 contains one Pit-1-binding element (−129 to −123), and P2 contains two Pit-1-binding elements, one from −166 to −160 (P2 upper) and one from −171 to −165 in the opposite orientation (P2 lower). hGHRHR-Luc(−310,−19) containing mutations in either P2 upper or P1 showed significantly lower luciferase activity than wild hGHRHR-Luc(−310,−19), and hGHRHR-Luc(−310,−19) containing mutations in both P2 upper and P2 lower showed a marked reduction in activity, which was almost the same as that of the pGL3 basic vector (Fig. 5 B). These findings, consistent with the results from the deletion study, suggested that P1, P2 upper, and P2 lower contribute to stimulation of GHRH-R expression. On the other hand, when hGHRHR-Luc(−130,−19) was used as the reporter plasmid, a P1 mutation did not change the luciferase activity, suggesting that P1 may work in the reporter plasmid with a longer 5′-region (Fig. 5 B). The drop in luciferase activity due to deletion of the region between −130 to −120, which was observed in the deletion study, could not be due to the loss of Pit-1 binding because inactivation of the Pit-1 site by mutation has no effect in the context of a short upstream region. In BeWo cells, co-transfection of the deletion mutants down to −310 and RSV-Pit-1 expression vector increased luciferase activity compared with control. However, deletion to −130 resulted in a decrease in the activity in BeWo cells even when Pit-1 expression vector was co-transfected (Fig.6). Results of these transfection studies indicated that the region from −310 to −130 was important for Pit-1-dependent GHRH-R gene expression in BeWo cells. The region from −310 to −130, which was important for the Pit-1-dependent expression of GHRH-R gene, contains DNA sequence P2 (−171 to −160), similar to the Pit-1-binding element. To confirm that Pit-1 binds to the sequence, DNase-I footprint studies were used. Recombinant Pit-1 protected the region from −176 to −155, in which P2 was included, in a dose-dependent fashion. However, Pit-1 did not protect P1 (−129 to −123), which is also similar to the Pit-1-binding element (Fig. 7). To further examine Pit-1 binding to P1 and P2, a mobility shift assay was used. A radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe spanning −175 to −142 (P2 probe) formed two specific DNA-protein complexes when incubated with Pit-1, because P2 has two putative Pit-1-binding elements. The two complexes were specifically competed by excess unlabeled oligonucleotide. When the consensus sequence of Pit-1 was mutated in the P2 probe, the upper DNA protein complex disappeared, confirming that the element was important for binding of Pit-1. Another radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe spanning −145 to −112 (P1 probe) formed only one DNA-protein complex when incubated with the same amount of Pit-1. When the consensus sequence of Pit-1 was mutated in the P1 probe, the binding of Pit-1 to P1 was reduced, confirming that the site was a Pit-1-binding element. However, the amount of DNA-protein complex was smaller than that when P2 probe was used, suggesting that the binding affinity of P1 to Pit-1 was weaker than that of P2 (Fig. 8). The finding appeared to be consistent with the result observed in the DNase-I footprint analysis that Pit-1 did not protect P1 (Fig.7). In the present study, we cloned the 5′-flanking region of the human GHRH-R gene by the PCR-based DNA walking method and determined transcription start site with RNase protection assay and 5′-RACE. Furthermore, we analyzed its function and Pit-1 dependence using transient transfection assay and determined Pit-1-binding sites with DNase-I footprint analysis and mobility shift assay. PCR-based methods are available for walking from a known region to an unknown region of the genome. Recent improvement of PCR technique allowed us to obtain longer and more accurate sequences of genomic DNA of interest. We applied the method reported by Siebert et al. (18Siebert P.D. Chenchik A. Kellogg D.E. Lukyanov K.D. Lukyanov S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1087-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) to clone the 5′-flanking region of the human GHRH-R gene. Recently Petersenn et al. (21Petersenn S. Rasche A.C. Heyens M. Schulte H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 233-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that 5′-flanking region of human GHRH-R. They (22.Petersenn, S., Heyens, M., Schulte, H. M., Program of the 10th International Congress of Endocrinology, June 12–15, 1996, San Francisco, CA, 1996, 623, (abstr.) The Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD.Google Scholar) and we (23.Takahashi, T., Okimura, Y., Mizuno, I., Kaji, H., Abe, H., Chihara, K., Program of the 10th International Congress of Endocrinology, June 12–15, 1996, San Francisco, CA, 1996, 621, (abstr.)

The Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD.Google Scholar) have been independently trying to clone the 5′-upstream sequence of GHRH-R to analysis the mechanism of GHRH-R gene expression. The sequence reported here is almost identical to that reported by Petersenn et al., although minor differences are present. The reason why minor difference exists between theirs and ours is unknown. This difference may be explained by polymorphism. The result of our RNase protection assay indicated that the major transcripts appeared to start at −122 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site in the normal pituitary gland (Fig. 3). Also, the 5′-RACE products were close to that of the major band obtained in RNase protection assay, supporting the results in RNase protection assay (Fig. 3). However, some shorter bands were detected in 5′-RACE experiments and in RNase protection assay. This finding suggests that some transcripts start from the downstream sites of the major transcript start site, which is often observed in TATA-less promoter. Petersenn et al. (21Petersenn S. Rasche A.C. Heyens M. Schulte H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 233-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the transcription start site of GHRH-R gene was 40 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site. However, the site reported by Petersenn et al.is located in the 5′-untranslated region of GHRH-R mRNA already reported by Mayo (1Mayo K.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1743-1744Google Scholar). In addition, our results obtained from RNase protection assay and 5′-RACE showed that the site was located in the sequence to be transcribed to mRNA. Thus, it is unlikely that the site reported by Petersenn et al. is a major transcription start site. No intron was found in the 5′-flanking region of the human GHRH-R gene, because the sequence of the 5′-RACE products was completely identical to that obtained from the analysis of genomic DNA flanking to GHRH-R coding region. In addition, these results suggest the accuracy of the PCR-based method. The structure of the GHRH-R gene resembles that of recently characterized human vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor gene (25Sreedharan S.P. Huang J.X. Cheung M.C. Goetzl E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2939-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which belongs to the same subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, in respect to lack of intron in its 5′-untranslated region. Typical TATA homologies were not present in the 5′-flanking sequence upstream from the transcription start site. A number of genes are known to lack obvious TATA boxes. Such TATA-less promoters can be divided into two classes. One class consists of GC-rich promoters (26Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), found in housekeeping genes, which usually contain several transcription start sites spread over a fairly large region and several Sp1-binding sites (27Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 28Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Another class has no apparent TATA boxes and is not GC-rich (27Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Many of these promoters are not constitutively active but rather are regulated during differentiation and development (27Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). In the human GHRH-R gene, GC content appeared not so rich, and neither a CAAT box nor a typical Sp1-binding site was at the site appropriate to the start site. Thus, the human GHRH-R promoter may belong to the latter class. Despite the absence of typical TATA homologies, analysis of the 2.7-kb nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region revealed that it contained a number of putative regulatory cis-acting elements. Of particular interest, we identified several sequences corresponding to Pit-1-binding consensus (TATNCAT) (Fig. 1). As described previously, the GHRH-R gene expression is considered to be controlled by Pit-1 (15Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29335-29338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Li S. Crenshaw III, E.B. Rawson E.J. Simmons D.M. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld G.M. Nature. 1990; 347: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 17Castrillo J.-L. Theill L.E. Karin M. Science. 1991; 253: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In fact, we demonstrated that our cloned 5′-flanking region of the gene increased luciferase activity in Pit-1-expressing GH3 cells and that the 5′-flanking region increased luciferase activity in non-Pit-1-expressing BeWo cells exclusively when RSV-Pit-1 expression vector was co-transfected. The region −310 to −130 was required for Pit-1-dependent promoter activity in BeWo cells according to the deletion mutant analysis. In the region, there are two Pit-1-binding elements, P2 upper and P2 lower. The mutation of P2 upper caused 50% reduction in the luciferase activity, and the mutation of both P2 upper and P2 lower suppressed the activity to basal levels in GH3 cells. These findings demonstrated that P2 is a functional site for GHRH-R gene expression. Another important region for GHRH-R gene expression was located from −130 to −120. Although the Pit-1-binding site (P1) was present in the region, mutation of P1 did not affect the luciferase activity when hGHRHR-Luc(−130,−19) was used as a reporter plasmid. This finding was consistent with the results that P1 is a low affinity binding site for Pit-1 compared with P2, which was obtained from mobility shift assay and DNase-I footprint analysis. In addition, this appears to explain why co-transfected RSV-Pit-1 expression vector did not stimulate GHRH-R reporter gene deleted to −130 in BeWo cells. However, this finding does not exclude the possibility that P1 did not play a role in stimulating GHRH-R gene expression, because P1 mutation decreased luciferase activity by 40% when hGHRHR-Luc(−310,−19) was used as a reporter gene. P1 may function in combination with P2 or other cis-elements, located from −310 to −130. On the other hand, the hGHRHR-Luc(−2207,−19) exhibited two times lower luciferase activity than serial deletion mutant constructs. The luciferase activity appeared to drop between −2207 and −1377 (Fig.5 A). The results might imply that the region −2207 to −1377 serves as a significant repressor in GH3 cells. In summary, we have cloned and characterized the 5′-flanking region of the human GHRH-R gene. The 5′-flanking region contained a functional promoter, and its promoter activity was dependent on Pit-1. The binding site of Pit-1 was located from −176 to −155 judging from DNase-I footprint analysis, and the region containing the Pit-1-binding sites was important for Pit-1-dependent expression of GHRH-R gene. Characterization of this 5′-flanking region will further clarify the regulatory mechanism of human GHRH-R gene expression. We thank Dr. Richard A. Maurer for the gift of rat PRL reporter plasmid and RSV-Pit-1 expression vector and Chika Ogata for excellent technical assistance."

A pyrene-peptide conjugate was complexed with gp96 under a variety of conditions. At room temperature in low salt (20 mm NaCl), the peptide binds gp96 with a strong affinity (∼100–150 nm) and forms pyrene excimers, suggesting that the peptides were assembled as dimers. In high salt (2.2 m NaCl), although peptide binding was stronger (K a ≈ 55 nm) than in low salt, pyrene excimers were absent, implying that peptides were farther apart in the complex. Heat shock-activated peptide binding exhibited characteristics of both low salt and high salt modes of binding. Anisotropy and average lifetime of the bound pyrene suggested that peptides were probably located in a solvent-accessible hydrophobic binding pocket in low salt, whereas in high salt, the peptide may be buried in a less hydrophobic (more hydrophilic) environment. These results suggested that peptide-gp96 complexes were assembled in several different ways, depending on the assembly conditions. Resonance energy transfer between the intrinsic tryptophan(s) in gp96 and pyrene suggested that one or more tryptophan residues were within the critical Forster distance of 27–30 Å from the pyrene in the bound peptide. It is proposed that peptides are assembled within higher order gp96 complexes (dimers, etc.) in a hydrophobic pocket and that there may be a conformational change in gp96 leading to an open configuration for peptide loading.

Science. 1997; 278: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), forms the basis for a new therapeutic strategy against human cancers using HSPs1 as vaccines. The HSP-mediated specific immunogenicity has been attributed to endogenous peptides that are noncovalently bound to the HSPs (8Srivastava P.K. Maki R.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Examples of immunogenic HSP-peptide complexes include gp96 (GRP94), BiP, protein disulfide isomerase, and calreticulin. These stress proteins are abundant and are normally present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (9Srivastava P.K. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 62: 154-177Google Scholar). Interestingly, HSPs display dual functionality. On the one hand, they act as molecular chaperones assisting in protein folding, and on the other, they appear to shunt peptides into the immune-response pathways. However, the relationship between the two functions remains unclear. From our perspective, it is the immunogenic function of HSP-peptide complexes that is the most intriguing and is of potential value to human health. The gp96 chaperone system is the most extensively studied from an immunological standpoint (10Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5398-5403PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li Z. Srivastava P.K.

Gp96 is an abundant endoplasmic reticulum resident glycoprotein that binds a variety of peptides in vitro with no apparent amino acid sequence specificity (17Breloer M. Marti T. Fleischer B. von Bonin A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1016-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unambiguous confirmation of the immunogenic properties of gp96-peptide complexes came with the demonstration thatin vitro reconstituted complexes were effective in suppression of preestablished tumors (13Blachere N.E.

The HSP-mediated mechanisms of immune response, although not yet fully understood, is an area of very active research. One plausible pathway for peptide antigen representation is outlined as follows. The antigenic peptides are endogenously generated in the cytosol by proteases in the proteasome either from precursor misfolded proteins or during extreme stress caused by infection or the onset of cancer. These peptides are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing (18Spee P. Neefjes J. Eur. J.

The HSPs then complex with the antigenic peptides and are recognized through a receptor-mediated mechanism of macrophages or other specialized antigen-presenting cells. The HSP-associated peptides are routed through the endogenous presentation pathway in the antigen-presenting cell and displayed in the context of MHC class I molecules. The peptide antigens are finally recognized by the precursor CD8+cytotoxic T lymphocytes (2Srivastava P.K. Udono H. Blachere N.E. Li Z.

Exogenous antigen peptide molecules chaperoned by gp96 can be presented by MHC class II molecules and rerouted into the endogenous pathway of the MHC class I molecules, a phenomenon referred to as cross-priming (3Suto R.

These mechanisms provide the underpinnings for the development of immunological strategies against cancer and infectious diseases using HSP-mediated antigens (15Nicchitta C.V. Curr.

Only a few papers have directly addressed this question in some molecular detail (13Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp.

Here, we have directly investigated the mechanisms of gp96-peptide interactions using a fluorescence-based assay. The distinctive advantage of a fluorimetric assay is that it is highly sensitive and yields quantitative information. We report that gp96 binds a modified peptide with surprisingly good affinities, the magnitude of which depends on the binding conditions. We propose that two peptides may be bound extremely close to each other in a gp96 dimer (or other higher order structures) and that the peptides may be indeed bound in a heterogeneous microenvironment. The pH of all buffers was adjusted at 25 °C. Low salt binding buffer consists of 20 mm Na+-HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, whereas high salt buffer has 2.2m NaCl, with other components being the same. 1-Pyrene butanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (catalog no. P-130) from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), was used as recommended by the manufacturer. Peptide was purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX) and purified by reversed phase C18 HPLC using a water/CH3CN/trifluoroacetic acid gradient. Purified peptide was derivatized with 1-pyrene butanoic acid, succinimidyl ester as follows. To 0.39 mg of peptide dissolved in 0.1 ml of 100 mm NaHCO3 (pH 8.3) was added 1.0 ml of 5 mg/ml 1-pyrene butanoic acid, succinimidyl ester dissolved in Me2SO. The mixture was vortexed and kept at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 1 h and loaded on a Sep-Pak C18 reverse phase cartridge (Waters). The peptide-pyr conjugate was eluted with 100% methanol after washes, first with water and then with 60% methanol. The 100% methanol fraction was dried in vacuuo and dissolved in 200 μl of 0.1 m TEAA (pH 7.0), and the peptide-pyr conjugate was purified by C18 reversed-phase HPLC. The following HPLC gradient was used: 10 min of 0.1 mTEAA-water and a linear ramp from 100% 0.1 m TEAA-water to 100% 0.1 m TEAA-60% CH3CN in 30 min. The peptide-pyr-containing fractions were identified using in-line absorption spectra collected using a diode array detector (1090 series HPLC) and fluorescence spectra. The 1:1 ratio of pyrene to peptide in the conjugate was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (Protein/DNA Technology Center, The Rockefeller University) and by the fluorescence spectra. The concentration of peptide-pyr conjugate was determined using the extinction coefficient of pyrene ε340 4.7 × 104m−1 cm−1. BA-pyr was prepared as described above except that a 10-fold molar excess of BA was added to 1-pyrene butanoic acid, succinimidyl ester. A plasmid vector (pZ010) was constructed by Dr. Z. Li in the laboratory of Dr. P.K. Srivastava (University of Connecticut at Farmington, CT) and donated to us. This plasmid contained the murine gp96 gene with a hexahistidine tag inserted at its N terminus. In this construct, the His-gp96 gene was transcribed in vivo by T7 RNA polymerase, the synthesis of which was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Escherichia coli JM109 (pZ010) was grown to an A 660 of 0.8 at 37 °C in rich medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) was added to the growth medium, and the cells were infected with bacteriophage M13-T7 gene1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were harvested after 3 h, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cell paste was resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmbenzamidine, and lysozyme was added (100 μg/ml). The mixture was stirred for 1 h and then subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. Following sonication, the lysate was adjusted to 10 mmMgCl2 and 5 μg of deoxyribonuclease I per ml (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). The mixture was incubated for 1 h, and the unbroken cells and debris were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min). Supernatant proteins were precipitated overnight with ammonium sulfate (60% saturation). The precipitate was centrifuged (20,000 × g for 20 min), and the pellet was resuspended in Buffer IA (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mmimidazole, 1 mm benzamidine). The centrifugation was repeated, and the supernatant was loaded onto metal chelating Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that were charged with Ni2+ (0.1 m NiSO4). The column was washed with 10 volumes of Buffer IB (Buffer IA containing 0.2% w/v CHAPS) and 15 volumes of Buffer IC (IB with 80 mmimidazole, pH 6.0). Bound proteins were eluted in Buffer ID (IC with 500 mm imidazole), and 5 mm EDTA was added to the protein fractions to chelate any leached Ni2+. Fractions containing gp96 were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted with Buffer IIA (sodium phosphate (pH 7), 17 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) until the conductivity was equal to that of Buffer IIB (Buffer IIA with 150 mm NaCl) and loaded onto Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 20 volumes of Buffer IIB and 4 volumes of Buffer IIC (with 300 mm NaCl), and gp96 was eluted with Buffer IID (with 500 mm NaCl). Fractions containing gp96 were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) and silver staining, and these were pooled and concentrated to 1 mg/ml protein in a 50,000 Da molecular mass cutoff device (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). In some instances, peak fractions of column 1 were used after pooling and dialysis in 75,000 molecular weight cutoff membranes versusBuffer IE (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 300 mm NaCl); sometimes 0.05% CHAPS was included in the dialysis buffer. Using these procedures, we routinely obtained >95% pure His-gp96. Yields were about 6 and 0.5 mg of gp96 from 1 liter of cells following 1 and 2 columns, respectively. Purified gp96 was run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Marker proteins from Bio-Rad or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech were run alongside. Gels were stained with Silver Stain Plus reagents (Bio-Rad). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) in chilled transfer buffer (25 mm Tris base, 192 mmglycine, 20% methanol) for 1 h at 70 V in a Mini Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were rinsed with TBST (10 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% w/v Tween-20), blocked in TM (TBST plus 5% dried skim milk) for 40 min and incubated with primary antibody in TM for 3 h to overnight and then rinsed four times in TM. The membrane was incubated with secondary antibody in TM for 1.5 h and rinsed six times with TBST. The following antibodies were used: anti-grp94 and anti-grp78 (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), anti-XpressTM (Invitrogen), sheep anti-mouse Ig horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and goat anti-rat Ig horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). All spectra/measurements were acquired at 23 °C using a computer-controlled JOBIN YVON/SPEX fluorolog3 τ instrument (Instruments, S.A. Inc., N.J.) equipped with polarizers. When required, the instrument was switched between the steady state mode, with or without the polarizers engaged, and the lifetime mode. The instrument was calibrated using Xe lamp intensity spectra and water Raman emission spectra every time before measurements were taken. The reference and experimental samples were loaded in fused quartz square jacketed cuvettes (0.4 cm, 0.7 ml) with constant stirring. The excitation and the emission bandwidths were set at 5 nm. Excitation was usually at 340 nm, and emission was either at 376 nm or in the scan mode, as specified in the figure legends. All steady state emission spectra were corrected for wavelength-dependent Xe lamp output intensity fluctuation and for the photomultiplier response using a reference detector. Short integration times and an average of three scans were used to minimize photobleaching of the fluorophore. Standard emission acquisition was carried out in a final volume of 600 μl containing a constant concentration of peptide-pyr, His-gp96, or BA-pyr (see figure legends). In the titration experiments, the maximum volume change was 5–10% of the total sample volume. The data for the binding isotherms is reported in an arbitrary scale, where the units represent the corrected fluorescence Fpep − FBA, which indicates a value obtained after subtracting the fluorescence intensity of BA-pyrene added to gp96 (control sample) from the fluorescence intensity of the peptide-pyr + gp96 (experimental sample). The calculation of the macroscopic binding constant was based on a simple minimalist model of the reaction, as follows, G+P⇄k−1k1GP SCHEME1where G is His-gp96, P is peptide-pyr,GP is the complex, and k 1 andk −1 represent the forward and the reverse rate constants, respectively. The macroscopic association constant (K a) is given by the following relationship. Ka=k1k−1=[GP][G][P]Equation 1 [GP] is assumed to be directly proportional to the corrected fluorescence intensity. A plot of the initial data points of the corrected fluorescence intensity versus [G] or [P], with one or the other kept constant, would yield a straight line with a slope that is equivalent toK a. Anisotropy measurements were carried out using the T-format two-channel method. The emission was measured with the S-detector set at 376 nm, and the T-detector was fitted with a neutral density filter to cut off stray light below 360 nm (Mellisgriot 03FNQ022). The alignment of the polarizers was checked using a dilute solution of glycogen in water as a scattering agent (anisotropy = 0.99807). The measurements were done in the Instruments SA constant wavelength analysis mode by excitation at 340 nm. The G-factor was measured, and the data were auto corrected for dark current. Anisotropy (r) was calculated by the computer program using the relation (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 75-91Google Scholar), r=(IVV−GIVH)/(Ivv+2GIVH)Equation 2 where I is the fluorescence intensity with the polarizers oriented either vertically (V) or horizontally (H), and G is the instrument factor. Each anisotropy measurement reported was the average of five independent readings (S.E. = 0.005). Average lifetime measurements were carried out using the phase shift and demodulation method (28Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 75-91Google Scholar). The instrument was calibrated usingp-Terphenyl (average lifetime, 1.0 ns) and (1,4-bis[5-phenyl-2-oxazolyl]benzene) (average lifetime, 1.3 ns) and a scattering agent, LUDOX® TMA colloidal silica (lifetime, 0 ns). Excitation was set at 340 nm, and emission was measured using the T-detector fitted with the same filter used for measuring anisotropies and the internal R-detector. The AC/DC signals from the reference compound (glycogen) and sample were adjusted to approximately the same ratios before the actual measurements were taken. Twenty-two frequencies were used between 1 and 10 MHz in the log mode, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10 measurements. Phase angle varied between 0 and 90°, and the modulation was between 0 and 1.0. The residuals for the phase angles were within ±1.5, and for the demodulation, they were within ±0.02. The data were analyzed using an Instruments SA graph, and the average lifetime was calculated using both the phase shift and demodulation data. Lifetime modeling was carried out using a built-in postexperiment modeling application, Lifetime, Version 2.1, assuming a multiexponential decay (see under “Results”). Fitting the data to a single-component model or a two-component model gave unacceptably high χ2 values. We used the three-component model because there are three major substances in the reaction, viz., His-gp96, peptide, and pyrene. Using the three-component model, better χ2 values were obtained. To achieve the lowest χ2 values, Occam's razor was applied for changing the concentration of each component in the three-component model to obtain the best fits. was done using a DynaProTM light scattering photon counting instrument developed by ProteinSolutionsTM with an Nd-YAG laser as the light source (883 nm). A built-in computer software package automatically calculated the mean hydrodynamic radius (Rh) and the average molecular mass of the protein aggregates using mono-model dispersion, and the data were presented as histograms. Each molecular parameter was an average of 40 individual measurements. The His-tagged gp96 protein was overexpressed in E. coli, remained in a soluble form, and was purified by a two-column chromatography procedure (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The first column consisted of a Ni2+ affinity resin, which specifically adsorbed the His-tagged gp96 protein. To further purify the protein, we used an anion exchange resin. The final preparation was greater than 95% pure His-gp96, as judged from a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1, top panel). The His-tagged gp96 protein migrated slightly more slowly than the intact murine gp96 preparation, presumably due to the addition of the hexahistidine tag. Specific antisera were used to ascertain the identity and intactness of the purified His-gp96 protein (Fig. 1,bottom panels). Both murine gp96 and His-tagged gp96 were recognized by antisera raised against mouse gp96, indicating that the bacterial gp96 had the same epitopes as murine gp96 (Fig. 1,bottom center panel). The intactness of His-gp96 was confirmed by staining with two distinct antisera. The anti-Xpress antibody recognized the bacterial plasmid-encoded amino acids in the N terminus of His-gp96, but not the murine gp96 (Fig. 1, bottom left panel). On the other hand, the C terminus of both proteins was recognized by the anti-KDEL antibody, which recognized the endoplasmic reticulum-localizing signal (Fig. 1, bottom right panel). Unless otherwise stated, all the studies presented here were done with His-gp96. An immunogenic peptide (SLSDLRGYVYQGLKSGNVS) derived from the nucleocapsid of VSV (29Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G.

We covalently attached a pyrene moiety to the unique lysine via the ε-amino group (Fig.2) using a commercially available pyrene succinimidyl ester derivative (30Haugland R.A. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR1996: 36Google Scholar) (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The expected molecular mass (m/z = 2445) of the peptide-pyrene conjugate (hereafter referred to as peptide-pyr) was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (observed mass m/z = 2446). Pyrene is an excellent fluorescent probe for studying molecular interactions because of several intrinsic properties (e.g.Refs. 31Knopp J.A. Weber G. J. Biol.

Its spectral characteristics are sensitive to the environment, and it has an extremely long singlet excited state lifetime (∼100 ns), which makes it especially useful for studying macromolecular motions. Its high photostability and high molar absorptivity (ε342 = 4 × 104m−1 cm –1) and fluorescence quantum yield (Φ383 = 0.25; sensitivity = εmax ΦF 100 × 10−2) can deliver very high signal to noise ratios. Fig.3 A shows the typical excitation and fluorescence emission characteristics of the peptide-pyr conjugate. These spectra are identical to the published spectra for pyrene (30Haugland R.A. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR1996: 36Google Scholar). The principal excitation band we used is at ∼340 nm. The structured emission shows the characteristic two major bands of pyrene monomer: a band at ∼376 nm that was slightly more intense than the band centered at ∼394 nm. Where applicable, the 376 nm band was used to measure the emission intensity.Figure 3A, normalized excitation and emission spectra of peptide-pyr. For the excitation spectrum, the emission was at 376 nm. For the emission spectrum, the excitation was set at 340 nm.B, changes in pyrene emission spectra as a consequence of the binding of peptide-pyr to His-gp96. Gp96 and peptide-pyr were mixed in either low salt buffer or high salt buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then dialyzed against a 1000-fold excess volume of the respective buffer to remove any unbound peptide using a molecular weight 70,000 cutoff membrane. The emission spectra of the samples were taken by excitation at 340 nm, and the spectra were plotted using the same scale for all the scans. The molar ratio of His-gp96 to peptide-pyr was 4:1 before dialysis. The concentrations of peptide-pyr for the low salt and the high salt experiment were 1.5 and 2.5 μm, respectively. The 2-nm red shift in high salt is not readily apparent because of the long scale used. Digitization of the spectra revealed the red shift (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ascertain that His-gp96 binds peptide-pyr, it was incubated with a molar excess of His-gp96 for 10 min at room temperature in low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). The mixture was dialyzed using a 70,000 molecular weight cutoff membrane for 2 h to remove any unbound peptide-pyr. The fluorescence of the retentate was monitored by excitation at 340 nm (Fig. 3 B). At this excitation wavelength, the protein chromophores (Trp and Tyr) do not absorb UV light, and only the pyrene is excited. We observed a striking ∼1.8–2-fold increase in the intensity of the emission bands at 376 and 394 nm compared with that of an equimolar concentration of the unliganded pe"

The eukaryotic cell cycle is governed in part by the periodic transcription of cyclin genes, whose protein products associate with and positively regulate the cyclin-dependent kinases. To understand better the growth inhibitory effect of IFN-γ on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we compared the expression and activity of G1 and S phase cyclins in control and IFN-γ-treated VSMCs. IFN-γ treatment did not inhibit the G1 cyclins but did decrease cyclin A protein, mRNA, and associated kinase activity by 85, 90, and 90%, respectively. Nuclear run-on and mRNA stability determinations indicated that this decrease was the result of transcriptional inhibition. To investigate the molecular basis of this inhibition, we examined protein-DNA interactions involving the cyclin A promoter. Electromobility shift assays showed little change with IFN-γ treatment in the binding of nuclear proteins to isolated ATF, NF-Y, and CDE elements. In vivo genomic footprinting indicated that IFN-γ treatment changed the occupancy of chromosomal NF-Y and CDE sites slightly and did not affect occupancy of the ATF site. In a previous study of transforming growth factor-β1-mediated inhibition of the cyclin A promoter, we mapped the inhibitory effect to the ATF site; in the present study of IFN-γ treatment, functional analysis by transient transfection showed that inhibition of the cyclin A promoter persisted despite mutation of the ATF, NF-Y, or CDE elements. We hypothesize that IFN-γ inhibits cyclin A transcription by modifying co-activators or general transcription factors within the complex that drives transcription of the cyclin A gene.

However, because IFNs increase expression of 50–100 different proteins, many without known function (1Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 1-11Google Scholar), the changes in cellular activity mediated by IFNs, including suppression of growth, are at best partially understood. Normal cellular replication is governed in part by periodic transcription of the cyclin genes, whose protein products associate with and positively regulate the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). The cdks are negatively regulated by phosphorylation or by association with a number of distinct proteins known as cdk inhibitors (reviewed in Refs. 2Harper J.W.

Although growth inhibitory properties have been associated with several of the proteins induced by IFNs (6Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T.

IFN-α/β and IFN-γ are structurally dissimilar and bind to distinct cell-surface receptors. The pathways the IFN receptors use to signal the nucleus to induce gene expression share some components, and the various IFN types regulate expression of partially overlapping sets of genes (9Shuai K. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A. Harpur A. Sadowski H. Gilman M. Darnell J. Nature. 1993; 366: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Although induction of gene expression by IFN-α/β is typically direct, requiring no new protein synthesis, that effected by IFN-γ, which targets a more diverse set of genes, can be direct or indirect (1Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 1-11Google Scholar). The precise subset of genes affected differs not only with the type of IFN but also with the type of cell (1Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Transcriptional Regulation in the Interferon System.

In irreversibly arrested mammary epithelial cells, IFN-γ may mediate inhibition of cdk2 and cyclin E-associated kinase activity through p27 kip1, which is up-regulated by a post-translational mechanism (17Harvat B.L.

Because overlap among targets of IFN-γ and IFN-α/β is only partial, and because the profile of genes affected by individual IFNs varies by cell type, extrapolations about mechanisms among IFNs and cell types are uncertain. For example, cell cycle arrest due to IFN-α treatment in hematopoietic cells corresponds to the G0 (13Tiefenbrun N. Melamed D. Levy N. Resnitzky D. Hoffmann I. Reed S.I. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell.

Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar) and to the late G1 or early S phase in primary macrophages (15Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Novak U. Royston A.K. Whitty G. Filonzi E.L. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hamilton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 599-608PubMed Google Scholar). These differences in the point of cell cycle arrest indicate functional differences in the underlying growth inhibitory mechanisms. IFN-γ inhibits the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Because this effect occurs in vivo (19Hansson G. Holm J. Circulation. 1991; 84: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) as well as in vitro (20Hansson G.K. Jonasson L. Holm J.

The growth inhibitory effect of IFN-γ on VSMCs has been linked with induction of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (21Warner S.J. Friedman G.B. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the first enzyme in the 2′-5′-adenylate IFN-regulated pathway of RNA degradation (22Silverman R. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and with suppression of c-myc mRNA and protein (23Bennett M.R. Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Evan G.I. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Newby A.C. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about the effect of these changes in gene expression on components of the cell cycle machinery in VSMCs. We evaluated the effect of IFN-γ on the expression of cdks and cdk inhibitors in VSMCs and the expression and activity of cyclins in VSMCs. IFN-γ treatment induced both proliferative (CDK6) and antiproliferative (P15) genes but did not inhibit kinase activity associated with the G1 cyclins. In contrast, cyclin A-associated kinase activity decreased markedly after IFN-γ treatment, in proportion to decreases in the expression of cyclin A mRNA and protein. Although this inhibition of cyclin A expression appeared to be caused by a decrease in transcription, electromobility shift assays, in vivo genomic footprinting, and functional analysis by transient transfection indicated that the decrease did not depend on individual cis-acting elements in the cyclin A promoter. VSMCs were harvested from the aortas of male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by enzymatic dissociation according to the method of Gunther et al. (25Gunther S. Alexander R. Atkinson W. Gimbrone M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The growth medium for these cells was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (Sigma); cells were made quiescent by culture for 72 h in medium containing 0.4% calf serum. Rat VSMCs were used for experimentation within 4–6 passages from primary culture. Growth medium for human VSMCs (aortic; Clonetics) consisted of medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (250 ng/ml). These cells were used within 8 passages from primary culture. Recombinant rat IFN-γ (Life Technologies, Inc.) and human IFN-γ (Genzyme) were reconstituted in sterile water and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. For some experiments, VSMCs were synchronized by incubation with medium containing 0.4% calf serum (HyClone) for 72 h before stimulation with growth medium (with or without IFN-γ). For in vivo footprinting experiments, human VSMCs were synchronized according to a two-step protocol as follows: cells in growth medium were first blocked in S phase for 20 h with hydroxyurea (1 mm) and then released and blocked in M phase for 20 h by adding new medium containing nocodazole (500 ng/ml). Synchronized monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, stimulated with fresh growth medium with or without IFN-γ, and harvested at defined intervals for DNA or RNA extraction. Nuclear proteins were extracted as described (26Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad). Total nuclear protein (30 μg) from control and IFN-γ-treated cells was fractionated by electrophoresis through 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in 4% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline for 40 min, followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. Anti-cyclin antibodies and working concentrations were rabbit anti-cyclin D1 (PharMingen 14726E), 1:5000; rabbit anti-cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-481), 1:2500; and rabbit anti-human cyclin A (gift of R. Schlegel, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA), 1:2000. Immune complexes were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cyclin-dependent kinase assays were performed as described (27Tsai J.-C. Wang H. Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Sibinga N.E.S. Tan L.C. Haber E. Chang T.H.-T. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), with modifications. In brief, total cellular protein (50 μg) from control and IFN-γ-treated rat VSMCs was immunoprecipitated with antiserum (2.5 μg) against cyclin A, D1, or E at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose beads (16 mg/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 cpm/pmol; 100 mm), with glutathioneS-transferase-retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (40 μg/ml; Rb amino acids 769–921, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used as phosphorylation substrate for anti-cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates, and histone H1 (200 μg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim) used as phosphorylation substrate for anti-cyclin A or E immunoprecipitates. Reaction products were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. Signals were quantified with the ImageQuant version 1.1 software analysis program (Molecular Dynamics). Quiescent rat VSMCs were stimulated with growth medium with or without IFN-γ for 24 h before addition of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim). Cells were harvested for RNA extraction at intervals over the ensuing 8 h. Total RNA was obtained from cultured cells by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction followed by centrifugation through cesium chloride (28$$Google Scholar). The RNA was fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, which were then hybridized at 68 °C for 2 h with random-primed, 32P-labeled cDNA probes (106cpm/ml) in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene). The filters were washed in 30 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C (probe and target RNA from same species) or at 25–42 °C (probe and target RNA from different species), stored on phosphor screens for 12–16 h for phosphorimaging, and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film for 48 h at −80 °C. Previously described cDNAs used as probes in Northern analysis included rat cyclin A (29Yoshizumi M. Lee W.-S. Hsieh C.-M. Tsai J.-C. Li J. Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Schlegel R.

Phosphor screens were scanned, and radioactive signal intensity was determined with the ImageQuant version 1.1 software analysis program (Molecular Dynamics). Quiescent rat VSMCs were stimulated for 24 h with growth medium with or without IFN-γ. The cells were lysed and nuclei were isolated as described (26Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C.

Nuclear suspension samples (200 μl) were incubated with 0.5 mmeach of CTP, ATP, and GTP and 250 μCi of 32P-labeled UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min. The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and resuspended in water for scintillation counting; equivalent amounts of radioactive probe were added to nitrocellulose filters bearing target cyclin A and control β-actin cDNAs. Filters were hybridized for 72 h at 40 °C in the presence of formamide, washed, and subjected to autoradiography. Radioactivity hybridizing to cyclin A target cDNA was normalized to the activity of the corresponding β-actin control. In vivo dimethyl sulfate (DMS) treatment was performed as described by Mueller and Wold (37Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) with some modification (38Patterson C. Wu Y. Lee M.-E. Devault J.D. Runge M.S. Haber E. J. Biol.

In brief, for in vivo DNA methylation, intact human VSMC monolayers were exposed to 0.1% DMS at room temperature for 2.5 min. Cells were washed and lysed, and methylated DNA was recovered and deproteinized overnight at 37 °C. For in vitromethylation, naked genomic DNA was treated with 1% DMS for 4 or 6 min at room temperature. Methylated DNA was cleaved by treatment with 1m piperidine. Human VSMCs were treated in vivowith DNase I according to the method of Pfeifer and Riggs (39Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) with some modification. Cells in a monolayer were permeabilized with 0.05% lysolecithin (Sigma) and then exposed to DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim, 150 Kunitz units/ml) for 4 min at room temperature. Genomic DNA was treated in vitro with DNase I (0.03 Kunitz units/ml) for 8 min at room temperature. LM-PCR was performed according to the method of Garrity and Wold as described by Patterson et al.

Primers 5′-1, 5′-2, and 5′-3, with their respective positions (40Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 3′ set of primers was described by Zwicker et al. (41Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For first-strand synthesis, DNA was denatured at 95.5 °C for 5 min, annealed at 55 °C for 30 min, and extended at 76 °C for 10 min. Ligation to asymmetric linkers was performed for 6 h at 17 °C. PCR cycling conditions for the 5′ primer set were 95.5 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 2 min, and 76 °C for 3 min, for a total of 21 cycles. PCR cycling conditions for the 3′ primer set were 95.5 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2 min, and 76 °C for 3 min, for a total of 21 cycles. Two cycles of primer extension were performed. Primers were annealed at 68.5 °C with 32P-end-labeled primer 5′-3 and at 72 °C with 32P-end-labeled primer 3 derived from Zwicker et al. (41Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Primer extension products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Electromobility shift assays were performed as described (42Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M.

Sense strand sequences of DNA probes with respective positions in the cyclin A promoter were NF-Y, 5′-GAGCGCTTTCATTGGTCCATTTCAATAGTC-3′ (−65 to −36), and CDE-CHR, 5′-CAATAGTCGCGGGATACTTGAACTGCAA-3′ (−43 to −16).

Typical binding reactions contained double-stranded DNA probe (20,000 cpm), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 50 mm KCl, 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 25 μl. The specificity of binding interactions was assessed by competition with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide of identical sequence. Reporter constructs were made by ligating wild-type (42Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell.

Deletion fragments and mutants were generated by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) by using standard cycling conditions. Primers for the −83 to +5 fragment were forward 5′-GAATGCACGTCAAGGCCGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-CCGCTGGAGCGCGGCTGTTC-3′. Site-directed mutagenesis of the reverse NF-Y site (ATTGG) was performed by PCR from a wild-type template with the forward primer 5′-GAGCGCTTTCcggttTCCATTTCAATAG-3′. The CDE-CHR sequence (CGCGGGATACTTGAA) was mutated by PCR with the primer 5′-TCCATTTCAATAGTatattGATcaggtAACTGCAAGAACAGCC-3′. (Lowercase denotes mutant bases.) The ATF mutant was described elsewhere (42Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell.

Rat VSMCs in 6-well plates were transfected with reporter plasmid (2 μg/well) by the DEAE-dextran method (43Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

After 4 h, cells were treated with growth medium with vehicle (control) or rat IFN-γ for 24 h until harvest. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (CAT) was assayed as described (44Lee M. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To correct for variability in transfection efficiency, we co-transfected cells with 0.5 μg/well of pCMV-β-gal (CLONTECH) and determined β-galactosidase activity by solution assay. Transfections were performed three times, each time in triplicate. Corrected CAT activities (mean ± S.E.) were normalized in relation to a parallel transfection with pCAT3 control (Promega), the activity of which was set as 100%. Comparisons among groups were made by factorial analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni/Dunn post hoc analysis. Statistical significance was accepted for ap value < 0.05. After confirming the growth inhibitory effect of IFN-γ treatment (19Hansson G. Holm J. Circulation. 1991; 84: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Hansson G.K. Jonasson L. Holm J.

Northern analysis was performed with RNA derived from rat VSMCs synchronized in a quiescent state and then stimulated to enter the cell cycle by the addition of 10% fetal bovine serum with or without IFN-γ. A 4–5.5-fold induction of Stat 1a mRNA in IFN-γ-treated cells (Fig.1) confirmed their responsiveness to IFN-γ (45Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H.T. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Although we postulated that this growth inhibition mediated by IFN-γ might be reflected in a decrease in the expression of cdks or an increase in that of cdk inhibitors, we found little change in the level of CDK2, CDK4, p21, or p27 mRNA during the 48 h after stimulation. Note that CDK6 and p15, which contribute to and inhibit, respectively, activity associated with D-type cyclins (46Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), were both induced by approximately 2-fold in cells treated with IFN-γ in comparison with time-matched controls. IFN-γ treatment is associated with arrest of the cell cycle in the G1 phase in fibroblasts (47Watanabe Y. Sokawa Y. J. Gen.

In myeloid cells, growth arrest associated with IFN-γ is linked to a decrease in expression of a principal G1 cyclin, cyclin D1, even when the cytokine is added late in the G1 phase (16Cocks B.G.

Incubation of Raji with Fg resulted in the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, pp60Src and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK). The increase in ERK-1 phosphorylation was blocked by a peptide with sequence matching ICAM-1-(8–22) and corresponded to a decrease in ERK-1 enzymatic activity. 100 μm amounts of Fg peptide γ-(117–133) caused an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK-1. These results are consistent with our previous report wherein ICAM-1-(8–22) blocked Fg-induced mitogenesis and Fg-γ-(117–133) induced proliferation in Raji. The specific inhibitor of MEK, PD98059 (25 μm), abrogated the increased phosphorylation of ERK-1 and blocked Raji mitogenesis by >50%. Inhibitors of pp60Src, geldanamycin (62 nm), and herbimycin A (2.5 μm) blocked >50% of Raji proliferation. These results indicate that the proliferation induced by Fg interactions with ICAM-1 is mediated in part by receptor-associated tyrosine kinases and ERK-1, and that the recognition sequences within Fg and ICAM-1 participate in the signaling process.

ICAM-1 belongs to a superfamily of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like proteins and is composed of five extracellular Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The binding of leukocytes through integrins αLβ2 and αMβ2to ICAM-1 on EC results in cellular interactions that regulate immune and inflammatory reactions (1Springer T.A.

However, in recent reports the occupancy and cross-linking of ICAM-1 by anti-ICAM-1 antibodies has resulted in the phosphorylation of diverse intracellular proteins (11Holland J. Owens T. J. Biol.

As Fg-ICAM-1 interactions mediated through recognition sequences in this ligand-receptor pair regulate growth in Raji, we sought to identify signals that may define the unique Fg-dependent proliferative function in this human B-cell line. The proliferative signals generated by activation or ligation of the prototypic growth factor receptors (platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor) results in the activation of the p21 ras signaling pathway. The cytoplasmic tails of the growth factor receptors possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and become coupled to cytosolic mitogen-activated protein tyrosine kinases (MAPK) (14Cowley S.

In this study using soluble Fg to bind ICAM-1 on Raji, we have observed that the key proteins that are phosphorylated are pp60Srcand components of the MAP kinase cascade: p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p42 MAPK, also known as ERK-1 and ERK-2 (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1 and -2). In addition, defined regions within Fg and ICAM-1 participate in the signaling process and inhibitors of pp60Src and MAPK kinase (MEK-1) block Raji mitogenesis induced through the binding of Fg to ICAM-1. Transferrin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and dimethyl sulfoxide were purchased from Sigma.

The polyclonal antibodies, anti-ERK-1 raised in goat and anti-pp60Srcraised in rabbit, were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Murine anti-ERK-1 antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. ICAM-1-expressing lymphoblastoid Raji cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Raji were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum and 1.0 mm glutamine plus penicillin and streptomycin in incubators maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Proliferation assays were performed as described previously (5Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Raji were exchanged into serum-free medium 18 h prior to commencement of an experiment in order to achieve cellular quiescence. Cells were washed in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) (BioWhittaker) and counted with a hemocytometer. Aliquots of 0.2 ml of cells (4 × 105cells/ml) were mixed with 0.2-ml protein solutions diluted with IMDM and 4 μl of [3H]thymidine (1.0 μCi/μl). Some protein solutions contained reagents reported to inhibit known cell proliferation pathways. Cell suspensions (0.1 ml) were aliquoted into four replicate wells of a 96-well flat-bottomed plate (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and plates were stored at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 8 h. To measure uptake of [3H]thymidine, the contents of each well were transferred to a 96-well plate with v-shaped wells. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (200 × g/10 min) and washed twice in PBS then resuspended in 50 μl of PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA. [3H]Thymidine that had been incorporated into cellular DNA was precipitated by addition of 0.1 ml of 20% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid for 12 h at 4 °C. Trichloroacetic acid pellets were solubilized in 0.2 m NaOH containing 2% (v/v) SDS and assayed for radioactivity in a β-counter. Fg was purified from fresh human plasma by cryoethanol precipitation (21Budzynski A.Z. Marder V.J. Shainoff J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2294-2302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Doolittle R.F. Schubert D. Schwartz S.A. Arch. Biochem.

Using electrophoretic conditions that allow the separation of fibrin from Fg monomer and subsequent visualization using Coomassie Blue R-250 (23Shainoff J.R. Smejkal G.B. DiBello P.M. Mitkevich O.V.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24129-24137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the isolated material was estimated to comprise greater than 95% Fg. Preparations of Fg were also analyzed for the presence of free fibrinopeptides A and B by elution on a Sep-Pak C18 high performance liquid chromatography column using standard preparations of each of the fibrinopeptides (Sigma). At protein concentrations of at least 50-fold greater than those used in these experiments, amounts of fibrinopeptides A and B were below detectable levels. Peptides with amino acid sequences corresponding to regions of ICAM-1 and Fg (6D'Souza S.E. Byers-Ward V.J. Gardiner E.E. Wang H. Sung S.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24270-24277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were synthesized by theN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl method on an Applied Biosystems ABI-66 instrument. Specific sequences were ICAM-1-(8–22), KVILPRGGSVLVTCS; ICAM-1-(130–145), REPAVGEPAEVTTTV; Fg-γ-(117–133), NNQKIVNLKEKVAQLEA; Fg-γ-(117–133), scrambled ALENAEVQNLVKKIQKN; and Fg-γ-(124–133), LKEKVAQLEA. Peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected using crystalline phenol and thioanisole and then purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Raji were maintained in serum-free medium for 18 h prior to the commencement of an experiment. Cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's PBS and once in ion-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and resuspended in an incubation medium of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, to an approximate cell concentration of 105-106 cells per ml. Aliquots of cells (0.1 ml) were mixed with 0.1 ml of incubation medium alone or containing 200–400 nm amounts of Fg, fibronectin, transferrin, or BSA. Some cells were incubated for 10 min with either 100–500 nm amounts of synthetic peptides ICAM-1-(8–22) or ICAM-1-(130–145) or the inhibitory compounds PD98059 or geldanamycin prior to the addition of proteins. Cell suspensions were maintained at 22 °C for 10–60 min then 20 μl of 0.1 m sodium orthovanadate was added and cells were separated from medium by centrifugation (100 × g/30 s). Cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's PBS containing 10 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were then lysed on ice by addition of 50 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 37 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mmEDTA). Levels of protein in each cell lysate were estimated using the BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and portions of each lysate containing equivalent amounts of protein (50–70 μg) were separated on 12.5% acrylamide/SDS gels and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were soaked in a solution of 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (wash buffer) to which was added 5% (w/v) BSA for 1 h, rinsed in wash buffer, then incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 for 4 h. Membranes were washed and probed with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The bound antibody was detected using the Immunostar chemiluminescence kit (Bio-Rad). ERK-1 or pp60Src were purified from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed as described and precleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Aliquots containing equivalent amounts of protein were mixed with 5 μg of an anti-ERK-1 or anti-pp60Src monoclonal antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C, then 30 μl of a slurry of protein G-Sepharose was added to each immunoprecipitation tube and tubes were mixed for 4 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed twice in lysis buffer, and once with Dulbecco's PBS. The precipitated immune complexes were extracted from the Sepharose beads by boiling in nonreducing SDS gel loading buffer. Samples were analyzed for phosphorylation of ERK-1 by elution on 12.5% acrylamide/SDS gels and immunoblotting as described above. Kinase activity in samples immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK-1 antibodies was measured using a myelin basic protein phosphorylation assay (24Bokemeyer D. Guglielmi K.E. McGinty A. Sorokin A. Lianos E.A. Dunn M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Sepharose beads containing precipitated immune complexes were rinsed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, and 100 units/ml Trasylol). For the kinase assay, Sepharose beads containing immune complexes were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer then 10 μl of myelin basic protein (2 mg/ml) and 10 μl of a solution of 1 μCi/μl of [γ-32P]ATP (50 μm ATP) containing 7.5 mm MgCl2 was added. Tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then 25 μl of the reaction mixture was mixed with SDS gel loading buffer and eluted on 15% acrylamide/SDS gels. Gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, dried, and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Densitometric quantitation of ECL exposures and 32P incorporation into myelin basic protein were performed using a Linotype-Hell Saphir Ultra2 scanner and Adobe Photoshop software. In each experiment, the final densitometric values comparing levels of phosphorylation within an experiment were first corrected to normalize for each amount of relevant proteins immunoprecipitated. Previous results from our laboratory have identified an increase in cellular proliferation in Raji upon incubation with nanomolar amounts of Fg (5Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This 2–3-fold increase in proliferation was shown to be dependent in part on the association of Fg with ICAM-1 on the surface of Raji. As little is known about cell signaling events associated with occupancy of ICAM-1 by ligands we investigated the nature of the Fg-induced signal. Since phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within numerous intracellular proteins is an event key to the conveyance of a signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus, we appraised changes in levels of phosphorylation of intracellular proteins in Raji upon incubation with 200 nmFg. This concentration of Fg was chosen as it consistently induced cell proliferation in Raji. Raji were incubated at 37 °C with Fg or transferrin (as control) for increasing periods of time. Cells were then rinsed with fresh medium and lysed in TBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and equivalent amounts of protein from cell lysates were separated on 12.5% acrylamide/SDS gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig.1 shows an increase in phosphorylation of several proteins in lysates prepared from cells that were treated with 200 nm Fg when compared with control incubations containing fibronectin or media alone. The major proteins in which a specific increase in phosphorylation was observed were of approximate molecular masses 32, 40, and 56–65 kDa. The phosphorylation of these proteins was rapid and sustained up to 30 min. The 32-kDa protein became phosphorylated by 5 min and was dephosphorylated by 30 min. The 40-kDa protein and proteins migrating at 56–65 kDa became phosphorylated at 10 min and were sustained at the 30-min time point (Fig. 1, lane 4). In order to identify specific proteins that demonstrated increased tyrosine phosphorylation as a result of treatment with Fg, Raji lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for candidate proteins known to be phosphorylated during cellular proliferation events. Intracellular proteins ERK-1 and pp60Src were isolated from cell lysates using monoclonal antibodies. The resultant immune complexes were captured on protein G-Sepharose beads. Proteins were eluted from the beads in SDS sample buffer then separated on SDS-acrylamide gels, transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 2 shows an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of pp60Src (panel A) and ERK-1 (panel B) in samples isolated from cell preparations that had been treated with 200 nm Fg but not control proteins. The lower portion of each panel demonstrate that equivalent amounts of each protein were isolated from the cell lysates. Under the assay conditions, we observed a marked increase in the phosphorylation of pp60Src when cells were incubated in the presence of Fg compared with cells incubated in media lacking Fg (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). The extent of ERK-1 phosphorylation was modest when Raji were incubated in the presence of Fg (Fig. 2 B). The extent of phosphorylation in these two proteins could be a reflection of their relative abundance in Raji. More importantly, the inclusion of 20 μm PD98059 (a cell permeable inhibitor of MEK-1, the enzyme responsible for phosphorylating ERK-1) to Raji cultures blocked the increased phosphorylation of ERK-1 induced by 200 nmFg. This result validates the specificity of ERK-1 activation in cells incubated with Fg. The increased ERK-1 activity in cultures treated with Fg was further confirmed using a kinase assay. Samples of ERK-1 that had been purified from control or Fg-treated Raji lysates by immunoprecipitation were measured in an assay using [γ-32P]ATP as a phosphate donor and myelin basic protein as a kinase substrate. Assay tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min before the addition of 3 × SDS gel loading buffer. Tubes were boiled and the contents were separated on 15% acrylamide/SDS gels and levels of incorporation of32P were estimated by autoradiography and densitometry. Fig. 2 (panel C) illustrates an increase in levels of32P associated with material corresponding to the molecular mass of myelin basic protein (18 kDa) in samples isolated from Fg-treated Raji lysates. These results indicate that phosphorylation of ERK-1 renders it enzymatically active in a manner that is dependent on the concentration of Fg. Densitometric measurements of the32P-labeled bands revealed a 2.29-fold increase in incorporation of radioactivity into myelin basic protein by ERK-1 isolated from cells that had been treated with 20 μg/ml Fg, as compared with control cells treated with 20 μg/ml BSA. This fold increase in ERK-1 activity (Fig. 2 C) parallels the extent of phosphorylation observed in Fig. 2 B. An increased phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within both of these proteins is known to correspond to increased kinase activity of these proteins and correlates with known roles for these proteins in intracellular signaling cascades resulting in increased cellular proliferation.

A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar), a specific inhibitor of the upstream regulator of ERK-1 (MEK-1), has been previously used to block cell proliferation mediated through the MAP kinase pathway (17Bornfeldt K.E.

Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). The above reagents were used to assess the role of these kinases in Fg-induced Raji proliferation. Fig.3 shows that the inclusion of 62 nm geldanamycin (panel A), 2.5 μmherbimycin A (panel B), or 25 μm PD98059 (panel C) resulted in greater than 50% blockade of proliferation of Raji induced by 200 nm Fg. Higher concentrations of geldanamycin (1.0 μm), herbimycin A (>5.0 μm), or PD98059 (100 μm) completely abrogate the proliferation in Raji. Equivalent amounts of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) alone did not influence the proliferation. These results indicate that the induction of proliferation in Raji generated by Fg requires the activation of the Src family and MAP kinase family of proteins, in a manner reminiscent of proliferation induced by growth hormones receptors. The region ICAM-1-(8–22) has been shown to mediate Fg-binding (6D'Souza S.E. Byers-Ward V.J. Gardiner E.E. Wang H. Sung S.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24270-24277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and block Fg-induced proliferation in Raji (5Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To confirm a requirement for occupancy of ICAM-1 by Fg to generate increased phosphorylation of ERK-1, Fg was preincubated with peptides corresponding to ICAM-1 amino acid fragment-(8–22) or fragment-(130–145). Raji were incubated with 200 nmFg/peptide mixtures at 37 °C for 10 min then cells were rinsed, lysed, and ERK-1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation as described. Immune complexes were eluted from protein G beads and separated on 12.5% acrylamide/SDS gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig.4 demonstrates that inclusion of 50 μm amounts of ICAM-1-(8–22) but not ICAM-1-(130–145) caused a reduction of the increased phosphorylation of ERK-1 in Raji, induced by 200 nm Fg. An analysis of ICAM-1-(8–22) and ICAM-1-(130–145) indicates that these two peptides are structurally comparable (5Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Densitometric scanning of the upper panel of Fig. 4 indicated a 26% reduction in the band intensity in incubations containing ICAM-1-(8–22) after correction for gel loading, compared with ERK-1 isolated from incubations treated with Fg alone. Inclusion of either ICAM-1-(8–22) or ICAM-1-(130–145) alone in incubations did not influence phosphorylation of ERK-1 (data not shown). In our proliferation assays we observe that 50–100 μmICAM-1-(8–22) causes up to 60% reduction in Fg-induced proliferation of Raji (5Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This indicates that association of Fg with ICAM-1 via the region spanning amino acids 8–22 is important for the generation of intracellular signals and increased tyrosine phosphorylation observed in ERK-1 upon treatment of Raji with Fg. A discrete region of Fg known to bind to ICAM-1 (7Altieri D.C. Duperray A. Plescia J. Thornton G.B. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 696-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) is able to induce a proliferative response in Raji (5Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We investigated whether this portion of Fg encompassing amino acids 117–133 of the γ chain could induce increased phosphorylation of ERK-1 in Raji. Raji were incubated with 100 μm amounts of either Fg peptides γ-(117–133) or γ-(117–133 scrambled) for 10 min at 37 °C, then cells were washed and lysed as described under “Materials and Methods.” ERK-1 was immunoprecipitated from equivalent amounts of protein from each lysate, and levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were analyzed by immunoblotting as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig.5 shows increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK-1 extracted from cell preparations treated with 100 μm amounts of Fg-γ-(117–133) but not Fg-γ-(117–133 scrambled), suggesting the interaction of this discrete region of Fg with ICAM-1 was sufficient to increase activity of ERK-1 in Raji. This result is in good agreement with previous data which demonstrated an increased cell proliferation in Raji that were incubated with 100 μm amounts of Fg-γ-(117–133) (5Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Raji binding studies using soluble 125I-labeled Fg-γ-(117–133) produce a binding curve which suggests binding of Fg-γ-(117–133) to a single class of proteins on Raji (data not shown). Comparison of the primary structure of this peptide with amino acid sequences of other known peptide hormones reveal no homology. It remains to be determined whether the tertiary structure of this peptide resembles the structure of other peptides known to have a role in cell proliferation. We have previously reported that Fg binding to ICAM-1 expressing B-lymphoid Raji cells results in the proliferation of these cells (5Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15474-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present report, our results indicate that ligation of ICAM-1 by Fg, a dimeric molecule, induces the rapid activation of pp60Src and ERK-1. These kinases become specifically tyrosine phosphorylated within Raji in the presence of soluble 200 nm Fg. The immediate upstream regulator of ERK-1 is MAPK kinase also known as MEK-1. A specific inhibitor of MEK-1, PD98059, blocked Fg induced cell proliferation in Raji and blocked the ERK-1 activation in Raji lysates (Figs. 2 B and 3 C). At similar concentrations PD98059 blocked growth activity induced by platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (17Bornfeldt K.E. Campbell J.S. Koyama H. Argast G.M. Leslie C.C.

Concentrations of geldanamycin and herbimycin A similar to those used in other studies to specifically inhibit pp60Src (25Blagosklonny M.V. Toretsky J. Neckers L.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 780-785PubMed Google Scholar) were sufficient to block Raji proliferation. In our previous report, Fg recognition peptide ICAM-1-(8–22) blocked mitogenesis, while the ICAM-1 recognition peptide Fg-γ-(117–133) induced proliferation of Raji (5Gardiner E.E. D'Souza S.E. J.

In concordance with the above results, 50 μm ICAM-1-(8–22) blocked the hyperphosphorylation of ERK-1 induced through the interaction of Fg with Raji (Fig. 4). Fg-γ-(117–133) on the other hand through its interaction with ICAM-1 induced ERK-1 activation. The peptide results are an independent verification and extend the findings that suggest that the activation of the MAP kinase pathway is involved in B-cell proliferation induced through Fg interaction with ICAM-1. Therefore, Fg and its derivative Fg-γ peptide-(117–133), utilize and transduce growth signal similar to that of bona fide growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor), phorbol esters, and cytokines. In this context it is tempting to speculate that Fg binding to ICAM-1 may cause ICAM-1 dimerization or clustering (31Reilly P.L. Woska Jr., J.R. Jeanfavre D.D. McNally E. Rothlein R. Bormann B.-J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 529-532PubMed Google Scholar), as is the case with platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor upon ligand interaction. Nevertheless, this is the first report of Fg-induced ICAM-1 signaling, and more interestingly through a small discrete region Fg-γ-(117–133) that ligates ICAM-1. The structure of ICAM-1 lacks the common tyrosine-containing motif required for the recognition of Src family kinases that has been identified in other receptors (14Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 15Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). However, Lyn has been demonstrated to bind IL-3 and IL-5 receptors that lack the consensus Src family binding motifs (32Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is likely that ICAM-1 may transduce signals by association with adaptor proteins such as Grb 2, SOS, and Shc; some of these proteins are known to participate in signaling through integrins (33Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, recently the Src-related protein tyrosine kinase Lyn, has been shown to be phosphorylated upon ICAM-1 ligation with monoclonal antibodies in murine B-cells (11Holland J. Owens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9108-9112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in this report a role for Lyn in mitogenesis was not investigated. Interestingly, in the rat brain endothelial cell line (RBE4), ligation of ICAM-1 with syngeneic encephalitogenic T cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of pp60Src and its substrate cortactin, an 85-kDa actin-binding protein (12Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Cazaubon S. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12536-12540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such cellular and cytoskeletal changes may facilitate the transmigration of lymphocytes in the brain. The physical association of ICAM-1 cytoplasmic tail with another actin-binding protein, α-actinin, has also been documented (34Carpén O. Pallai P. Staunton D.E. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The interaction of Fg with integrin αMβ2 on monocytic cells augments the ability of these cells to adhere and transmigrate through the EC (2Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 35Sriramarao P. Languino L.R. Altieri D.C. Blood. 1996; 88: 3416-3423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, future experiments will verify whether pp60Src and cortactin become phosphorylated, in contrast to ERK-1, in a distinct ICAM-1 ligation process. There is now overwhelming evidence that the tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK-1 is involved in cell proliferation. However, recent reports now indicate that ERK-1/2 could also act as negative regulators of cell activation, in particular the integrin adhesion receptors (36Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M.

Rosa J.-P. Bryckaert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22381-22384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ERK is also implicated in smooth muscle cell contraction (38Lai K. Wang H. Lee W.-S. Jain M.K. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1560-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In a recent report (4Hicks R.C.J. Golledge J. Mir-Hasseine R. Powell J.T. Nature. 1996; 379: 818-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), Fg induced contraction of saphenous vein endothelium in an ICAM-1-dependent manner. If the activation of ERK could be demonstrated in these cells through Fg-ICAM-1 interaction, the above findings may have a mechanistic explanation. Fibrin and derivatives of Fg have been implicated in the mitogenesis of endothelial cells (39Lévesque J.-P. Hatzfeld A. Hatzfeld J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6494-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Sporn L.A. Bunce L.A. Francis C.W. Blood. 1995; 86: 1802-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results have now implicated intact Fg and a peptide within the γ chain of Fg (Fg-γ-(117–133)) in the activation of a classical MAP kinase pathway in proliferation of B-lymphoid cells through an adhesive receptor, ICAM-1. The Fg-ICAM-1 pathway has been proposed to play a role in inflammatory processes and in malignant cell growth (2Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C.

Since compounds such as PD98059, herbimycin A, and geldanamycin, block proliferative signals and cell growth through Fg-ICAM-1 interaction, these reagents may help understand vascular diseases such as restenosis after angioplasty (17Bornfeldt K.E.

In addition to the cis-acting promoter sequences, a large number of activators and repressors modulate initiation of transcription. Furthermore initiation depends on alternative sigma factors that direct the RNA polymerase to specific promoter sequences. The activity of sigma factors may itself be regulated, either by stability as is the case for the Escherichia coli stationary phase ςS (1Schweder T. Lee K.H. Lomovskaya O. Matin A. J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4990-4996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of the anti-sigma factors is exercised by specific protein-protein interaction, even though the details of the molecular mechanisms involved are still largely to be elucidated (12Kutsukake K. Iyoda S. Ohnishi K. Iino T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4568-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Iyoda S. Kutsukake K. Mol. Gen.

Karlinsey J.E. Hughes K.T. Dahlquist F.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). FlgM was first identified in Salmonella as a negative regulator of the flagellar-specific sigma factor ς28, also called FliA (6Gillen K.L. Hughes K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6453-6459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ohnishi K. Kutsukake K. Suzuki H. Iino T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3149-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and later shown to interact specifically with the cognate sigma factor, forming a stable complex (15Daughdrill G.W. Chadsey M.S. Karlinsey J.E. Hughes K.T. Dahlquist F.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). FlgM has also been described in B. subtilis, where it appears to accomplish a similar regulatory function, coupling the early and late flagellar gene expression (16Mirel D.B. Lauer P. Chamberlin M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Caramori T. Barillà D. Nessi C. Sacchi L. Galizzi A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3113-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fredrick K. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7010-7013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The action of FlgM is thought to occur by specific interaction with the late flagellar sigma factor ςD. The B. subtilis FlgM has now been overproduced inEscherichia coli, purified, and shown to form a complex with purified ςD protein. Limited proteolysis studies suggest that FlgM contains a relatively stable N-terminal domain. The flgMgene (264 base pairs) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of Bacillus subtilis chromosomal DNA, using primers (forward, 5′-CGGAATTCATATGAAAATCAATCAATTTGG-3′ and backward 5′-CCCGGATCCTTATTGCTTTTTATAAAAATTAATC-3′) with a NdeI andBamHI site, respectively; after purification and restriction, this NdeI-BamHI fragment was cloned into the expression vector pET12a (19Studier F.W Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pBG9, allows high level overproduction of FlgM in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (19Studier F.W Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). To purify FlgM, BL21 (DE3) (pBG9) cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking in 150 ml of Luria broth medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At A 600 of 3–4, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 liter of Luria broth medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin; isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm, and growth was continued for 3 h at 21 °C, until an A 600 of 0.7. The cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml of A buffer (20 mm NaH2PO2, 29.6 mmNa2HPO2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged to remove cell debris and inclusion bodies. The supernatant, containing the soluble fraction of the protein, was loaded on a FPLC1 (Pharmacia) S-Sepharose 26/10 column, pre-equilibrated with A buffer. The FlgM protein was purified by elution with a 0–0.5 m gradient of NaCl in A buffer; 19 mg of FlgM were recovered, eluting with 0.3 mNaCl. The protein was further purified by gel exclusion chromatography on an FPLC Sephacryl S-100 column in B buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol). ςB was overexpressed by using a pT7–5 derivative, kindly supplied by W. G. Haldenwang. For purification we followed the procedure described by Huang et al. (20Huang X. Fredrick K.L. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3765-3770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for ςW. The last steps (heparin-Sepharose and Superdex) were omitted and substituted by a single HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The molecular mass of FlgM and its fragments were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy using a matrix of sinapinic acid or of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystem 477A liquid pulse protein sequencer. Purified proteins FlgM and ςD were incubated together at equimolar ratio at 0 °C for 1 h, and the mixture was fractionated by chromatography on an FPLC Superose HR 12 gel exclusion column in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Fractions collected were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Purified proteins were cross-linked in a 50 μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol by adding ethylene glycol-bis(succinic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (EGS, Sigma) or dithio-bis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP, Sigma) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. EGS and DSP were predissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mg/ml. After incubation at 0 °C for 2 h,l-lysine was added to a final concentration of 20 mm. Cross-linked products were separated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Isoelectric focusing was performed in nondenaturating conditions, using horizontal electrophoresis apparatus with 1 m NaOH and 1 mH3PO4 as electrode solutions. The samples (5–20 μl) were applied to a 1-mm-thick gel using isoelectric focusing applicator (Pharmacia). After focusing, proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. DNA binding reactions (10 μl) contained about 0.5 pmol of 5′-end-labeled DNA fragment and purified proteins (as indicated) incubated in binding buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 5 ng/μl unspecific plasmid DNA) at 37 °C for 20 min prior to separation by native 5% PAGE at room temperature. To label the DNA, the PD-6 promoter containing fragment (300 base pairs) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using unphosphorilated primers (5′-GATCAAGTGAAGCTTGGAATT-3′ and 5′-AATATTGTGGTTAATTCTCAT-3′), labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by 5% PAGE. To analyze the protein components associated with the shifted DNA band, the corresponding portion of the gel was cut out, rerun in 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was probed with anti-FlgM polyclonal antibodies, followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The peroxidase activity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.) FlgM (2.5 mg/ml) was incubated at 21 °C for 30 min in reaction containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgSO4, and 0.01 mg/ml subtilisin. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and visualized by 20% SDS-PAGE. Samples were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed by automated amino acid sequencing. In a second experiment the products of limited proteolysis were separated by reverse phase HPLC (Jasco on an Aquapore RP-300 C 8 column (25 × 0.46 cm). The solvent system used was either 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (system A) or 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN (system B). The elution was with a linear gradient from 0 to 50% system B in system A, in 70 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml min−1. The elution of peptides was monitored at 220 nm. Aliquots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and Edman degradation. The B. subtilis FlgM is a 9.8-kDa protein (16Mirel D.B. Lauer P. Chamberlin M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence coding for FlgM was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification ofB. subtilis chromosomal DNA, using primers with aNdeI and BamHI site, respectively; after purification and restriction, flgM was cloned in the expression vector pET12a. The coding sequence was followed by the original stop codon, and the expected product was only FlgM, without fusion to any resident sequence. The resultant plasmid, pBG9, was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Following induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside expression of FlgM was obtained at high level, but in the insoluble protein fraction. After several attempts we found conditions at which the majority of FlgM was in the soluble fraction. The volume of the culture was 1 liter in a 5-liter volume flask, the incubation temperature was 21 °C, and the concentration of the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside inducer 0.1 mm. The soluble fraction was purified by S-Sepharose chromatography, followed by a gel exclusion column of Sephacryl S-100. After this step, the protein was estimated to be at least 95% pure by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 1). The final yield was 19 mg of FlgM/liter of culture of E. coligrown to an A 600 of 0.7. N-terminal determination by Edman degradation of an aliquot of the purified protein gave the sequence MKINQFG corresponding to the first seven amino acids of FlgM as deduced from the nucleotide sequence (16Mirel D.B. Lauer P. Chamberlin M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mass, measured by mass spectrometry was 9,931 Da, in agreement with the estimated mass of 9,862 Da. We used gel exclusion chromatography to determine whether FlgM is a dimer in solution. The elution volume on a Sephacryl S-100 column corresponds to a molecular mass of about 21 kDa, suggesting that FlgM is a dimer. This was further confirmed by PAGE under nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 2). The dimer nature of FlgM is also corroborated by results of chemical cross-linking experiments. Incubation of FlgM with cross-linker generated a faster migrating species, probably due to internal cross-linking, and a band of approximately 20 kDa, again suggestive of a homodimer (Fig.3 A, lane 3). At least one other anti-sigma factor, SpoIIAB of B. subtilis, has been reported to be present as a dimer (4Duncan L. Alper S. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).

Barillà D. Nessi C. Sacchi L. Galizzi A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3113-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2D. Barillà and M. Chamberlin, personal communication. To investigate the interaction of the two proteins, we purified ςD according to Chen and Helmann (23Chen Y.-F. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Upon mixing and incubation at 0 °C for 1 h, the two proteins formed a complex that could be resolved by gel exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12HR column. The complex was stable even in 0.6 m NaCl, suggesting a participation of hydrophobic interaction between the two polypeptide chains in the complex. The purified complex was treated with the homobifunctional cross-linking agents DSP and EGS. Analysis of the DSP-treated product by SDS-PAGE showed a single band of approximately 40 kDa (Fig.3 A). Similar results were obtained upon treatment with EGS (data not shown). No bands corresponding to the two proteins, FlgM and ςD, were observed, suggesting that the complex is very stable and long lived, because it is not in equilibrium with the monomers. The same cross-linked product was obtained by treating the two proteins, immediately upon mixing. FlgM and ςDtreated separately with DSP did not produce a band of the same mobility as that obtained when the mixture was treated (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3 and 5). The complex appears to be an heterodimer by the mass of the cross-linked complex estimated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoresis of purified complex under nondenaturing gel gradient electrophoresis. In addition the mass of the EGS cross-linked complex was measured by mass spectrometry, and the observed value of 43,399 Da is in good agreement with the theoretical value of 39,311 Da (9, 862 Da of FlgM + 29, 449 Da of ςD), considering the presence of an unknown number of EGS molecules. The same type of heterodimeric structure has been reported for the Salmonella FlgM.ς28 complex (15Daughdrill G.W. Chadsey M.S. Karlinsey J.E. Hughes K.T. Dahlquist F.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The B. subtilis purified complex, not treated with the cross-linking agent, had a pI of about 6.8 as determined experimentally by isoeletric focusing; distinct from the observed pI of ςD (5.9) and the deduced pI of 9.9 of FlgM (data not shown). The complex gave a single band in PAGE under nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). Using antibodies anti-ςD to detect free ςD in Western blotting, in nondenaturing conditions, we estimated that the apparent dissociation constant for the FlgM·ςD complex is 10−6m or less (data not shown). To evaluate the specificity of the complex formation, we performed similar experiments with FlgM and a different sigma factor of B. subtilis, ςB, which is known to interact with the cognate anti-sigma, RsbW (3Benson A.K. Haldenwang W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2330-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We failed to observe any interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and3). (In the electrophoretic system used, FlgM is not visible, because it moves out of the gel.) ςD belongs to the group of sigma factors devoid of region 1, responsible for masking the rest of the molecule. Thus these factors can bind to the promoter sequence even in absence of core RNA polymerase (23Chen Y.-F. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). FlgM inhibits initiation of transcription from ςD-dependent promoters in vitro.2 Unexpectedly the FlgM·ςDcomplex gave a supershift in a gel retardation assay with a probe containing the flagellin, ςD-dependent promoter PD-6 (22Alper S. Duncan L. Losick R. Cell. 1994; 77: 195-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Not only was the probe retarded more than observed with only ςD, but the amount of probe bound to the complex was much higher. The experiment was performed in the presence of cold unspecific plasmid DNA. To show that the supershift was indeed due to the complex, a gel slice corresponding to the shifted band was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western immunoblotting with anti-FlgM antibodies. These polyclonal antibodies cross-react with ςD and allowed the detection of the presence of both proteins in the shifted band (Fig. 4). The same shift was observed when the probe was first incubated with ςD and an equimolar amount of FlgM added 5 min prior to the electrophoresis (Fig. 4, lane 5). In our tests, ςD alone gave a weak shift of the probe (Fig. 4,lane 4), and this is probably due to incomplete renaturation of the protein solubilized by guanidine hydrochloride. The higher amount of probe retained in the presence of FlgM suggests that the anti-sigma factor may facilitate the renaturation of ςD. To gain information on the structural organization of FlgM, we performed experiments of limited proteolysis. Partial digestion with subtilisin gave consistently one major product that in PAGE had a mobility of approximately 5 kDa (Fig.5 A). The same electrophoretic pattern was obtained following incubation at 21 °C for at least one h (data not shown). Edman degradation of the material transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, indicated the presence of the N terminus of FlgM. In a parallel experiment the products of partial proteolysis were subjected to separation by HPLC. Only one peak was observed, but two N-terminal sequences were obtained in approximately equimolar amounts: MKINQFGTQSVNPY and IENGSYKVDANHIA (Fig.5 B). The first sequence corresponds to the N terminus of FlgM, whereas the second one corresponds to residues 65–78 of the protein. Various attempts to further purify the two components were unsuccessful. The same fraction obtained by HPLC was analyzed by mass spectrometry and gave the values of 5754 and 2284 Da, respectively (Fig. 5 B). The M r of 5754 is in good agreement with the calculated value (5753 Da) of a peptide consisting of the first 51 residues of FlgM; the smaller peptide ofM r 2284, should correspond to amino acids Ile65 to Phe84 (calculated mass, 2279 Da) toward the C terminus of the protein. A minor component ofM r 5810 was also observed as a shoulder of the main peak of M r 5754; we infer that the proteolytic cleavage can occur either upstream or downstream of Gly52. The results of the partial proteolysis are summarized in the Fig.5 C. We conclude that FlgM is organized in two regions: the N-terminal part (residues 1–51) and the C-terminal portion (residues 65–84), which appear structured and resistant to proteolytic cleavage. The two structural motifs are presumably connected by a loop, easily accessible to cleavage. We have overexpressed and obtained in soluble form the anti-sigma factor FlgM of B. subtilis, the main regulator of ςD activity. The protein is a dimer in solution, as determined by gel exclusion chromatography and PAGE electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. The anti-sigma factor FlgM forms a stable and long lived complex with the cognate sigma factor ςD. Highly stable complexes have been reported for two other B. subtilis sigma-anti-sigma couples, SpoIIAB·ςF and RsbW·ςB (24Alper S. Dufour A. Garsin D.A. Duncan L. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Duncan L. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). FlgM·ςD complex still binds to the promoter sequence, but the fact that FlgM does not interfere with the interaction of ςD at the promoter site may have a marginal physiological significance, as already noted for the DNA binding by the same sigma factor (23Chen Y.-F. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, if, as it seems plausible, in vivothe promoter recognition is performed by the holoenzyme, the specific anti-transcriptional activity of FlgM could be exerted in three ways: (i) sequestering of free ςD molecules in the FlgM·ςD complex, (ii) removing ςD from the holoenzyme, and (iii) hampering a productive interaction between the holoenzyme and the promoter. In the case of bacteriophage T4, the anti-sigma AsiA forms a tight complex with the ς70 subunit (8Orsini G. Ouhammouch M. Le Caer J.-P. Brody E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 85-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Severinova E. Severinov K. Fenyö Marr M. Brody E.N. Roberts J.W. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nevertheless a detailed analysis of its mechanism of action suggests that AsiA interacts with the holoenzyme, thereby modifying the interaction between the enzyme and promoter sequence and not simply dissociating the sigma factor from the core (27Adelman K. Orsini G. Kolb A. Graziani L. Brody E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27435-27443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol.

Recently it has been shown that the Salmonella FlgM, in addition to sequestering the free sigma factor, binds to the holoenzyme and increases the rate of dissociation of sigma from the core (30Chadsey M.S. Karlinsey J.E. Hughes K.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3123-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The anti-sigma factors themselves are regulated. In the case of SpoIIAB and RsbW, the sigma factor is set free to accomplish transcription by the action of an anti-anti-sigma factor (SpoIIAA and RsbV, respectively), which under certain conditions forms a complex with the anti-sigma protein (25Duncan L. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31Diederich B. Wilkinson J.F. Magnin T. Najafi S.M.A. Errington J.

As for FlgM we do not yet know the mechanism regulating its activity. A clue derives from work on the Salmonella homologue of FlgM that has been shown to be secreted into the medium by the flagellar secretion system (34Hughes K.T. Gillen K.L. Semon M.J. Karlinsey J.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1277-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 35Kutsukake K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). When the flagellar hook-basal body complex is assembled, the devoted class III secretory apparatus export FlgM from the cell, thereby relieving the inhibition exerted by the anti-sigma factor. In solution the free Salmonella FlgM is mostly unfolded, which may facilitate its secretion; it forms a stable complex with ς28, but upon binding, the C-terminal half of FlgM becomes structured, with the N terminus still unfolded and thus potentially competent for secretion (15Daughdrill G.W. Chadsey M.S. Karlinsey J.E. Hughes K.T. Dahlquist F.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The present results from partial proteolysis indicate a different organization of the B. subtilis FlgM polypeptide. The N-terminal region is structured, at least as deduced from partial proteolysis and not unfolded as suggested for the Salmonella FlgM from NMR studies. The structural differences may hint at different mechanisms in the way to regulate the anti-sigma factor activity in the cell.

To investigate the biological functions of CCaMK, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to isolate genes encoding proteins that interact with CCaMK. One of the cDNA clones obtained from the screening (LlEF-1α1) has high similarity with the eukaryotic elongation factor-1α (EF-1α). CCaMK phosphorylated LlEF-1α1 in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner. The phosphorylation site for CCaMK (Thr-257) was identified by site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, Thr-257 is located in the putative tRNA-binding region of LlEF-1α1. An isoform of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) phosphorylated multiple sites of LlEF-1α1 in a Ca2+-dependent but calmodulin-independent manner. Unlike CDPK, CCaMK phosphorylated only one site, and this site is different from CDPK phosphorylation sites. This suggests that the phosphorylation of EF-1α by these two kinases may have different functional significance. Although the phosphorylation of LlEF-1α1 by CCaMK is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent, in vitro binding assays revealed that CCaMK binds to LlEF-1α1 in a Ca2+-independent manner. This was further substantiated by coimmunoprecipitation of CCaMK and EF-1α using the protein extract from lily anthers.

Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1993; 12: 185-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). One of the major mechanisms decoding the change of intracellular Ca2+ and transducing Ca2+ signal is the action of Ca2+-modulated proteins. Calmodulin (CaM)1 is a highly conserved and the most widely distributed Ca2+-binding protein (2Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). CaM is believed to be a primary receptor for intracellular Ca2+ and functions as a regulatory element for its target proteins when activated by Ca2+. One group of CaM-modulated proteins is composed of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases.Extensive investigation of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation has revealed that protein kinases play key roles in various signal transduction pathways leading to cellular and physiological responses (3Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation has been implicated in regulating a broad array of biological functions and is believed to play a pivotal role in amplifying and diversifying the action of Ca2+/CaM-mediated signals in animals. A number of different types of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases, including CaM kinases (CaMKs) I–IV, phosphorylase kinase, and myosin light chain kinase, have been cloned and demonstrated to regulate various cellular processes (4Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some indirect evidence for the existence of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation has been reported in plants (1Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1993; 12: 185-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, until recently, no direct and convincing evidence has been presented. In recent years, three Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase genes having some features similar to the mammalian multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) were cloned from plants (6Watillon B. Kettmann R. Boxus P. Burny A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1381-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Lu Y.T. Hidaka H. Feldman L.J. Planta. 1996; 199: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The apple Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase was isolated using an interaction screening method with labeled CaM as a ligand probe (6Watillon B. Kettmann R. Boxus P. Burny A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1381-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CCaMK from lily and MCK1 from maize were cloned using the polymerase chain reaction screening method with oligonucleotide primers designed based on the conserved regions of mammalian CaMKs (7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Lu Y.T. Hidaka H. Feldman L.J. Planta. 1996; 199: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the sequence similarity between lily CCaMK, maize MCK1, and apple Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase is only observed in their conserved kinase domains. No obvious sequence similarity exists outside their kinase domains. Although these three kinases were directly or indirectly demonstrated to bind CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, only biochemical properties for CCaMK have been reported to show that its kinase activity is regulated by Ca2+/CaM (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Ramachandiran S. Takezawa D. Wang W. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).CCaMK has a unique structural feature characterized by the presence of a kinase domain, a CaM-binding domain, and a neural visinin-like Ca2+-binding domain within a single polypeptide (7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Its kinase domain and CaM-binding domain are highly similar to those of mammalian CaMKII. The sequence of its C-terminal domain does not show significant homology to any known protein kinase. This domain has high similarity with a family of neural visinin-like Ca2+-binding proteins (7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and its Ca2+-binding property was confirmed by biochemical characterization (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In plants, a predominant and widely expressed form of protein kinase is the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase or CaM-like domain protein kinase (CDPK) (11Harper J.F. Sussman M.R. Schaller G.E. Putnam-Evans C. Charbonneau H. Harmon A.C. Science. 1991; 252: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Roberts D.M. Harmon A.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 375-414Crossref Scopus (568) Google Scholar). CDPK contains a kinase domain similar to that of mammalian CaMKII, a junction domain, and a CaM-like domain (11Harper J.F. Sussman M.R. Schaller G.E. Putnam-Evans C. Charbonneau H. Harmon A.C. Science. 1991; 252: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although both CCaMK and CDPK contain a kinase domain and a Ca2+-binding domain and have similarity in their overall structures, they distinctly differ in terms of their sequences as well as regulation of their kinase activities. There is no striking sequence similarity shared between them except their kinase domains. Unlike the CaM-like domain of CDPK, the Ca2+-binding domain of CCaMK contains three EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites and has higher similarity to visinin-like proteins than CaM (7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Unlike CCaMK, the full-length CDPK does not bind to CaM, and its kinase activity is Ca2+-dependent but does not require exogenous CaM (13Harmon A.C. Yoo B.C. McCaffery C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Another difference between these kinases is that CDPK is encoded by a large family of genes and is ubiquitously distributed among plant tissues, while CCaMK is a single copy gene in lily and its expression is developmentally and spatially regulated (7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Study of protein-protein interactions between a kinase and its target proteins is crucial to illustrate intracellular signal transduction that eventually leads to physiological responses. Isolation and characterization of interacting proteins/substrates of CCaMK is a major step in understanding its in vivo regulation, cellular compartmentalization, and biological functions. In this study, the yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning system was used to isolate cDNAs encoding proteins that interact with CCaMK. Here we report that one of the cDNA clones (LlEF-1α1) isolated from the screening is homologous to the eukaryotic elongation factor-1α (EF-1α), and CCaMK phosphorylates LlEF-1α1 in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner, but their binding does not require Ca2+.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified a CCaMK-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid interaction screening method. Sequence comparison revealed that this protein (LlEF-1α1) is a homolog of EF-1α. It is well known that the eukaryotic EF-1α is an essential component of polypeptide synthesis complex and promotes the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site on ribosomes during the elongation phase of translation in the cytoplasm (23Riis B. Rattan S.I.S. Clark B.F.C. Merrick W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 420-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, EF-1α is a ubiquitous and highly conserved protein. It is one of the most abundant proteins and is normally present in excessive molar ratios compared with other essential components of the translational machinery. Growing evidence indicates that EF-1α is a multifunctional protein and that it is involved in other cellular processes besides protein synthesis (23Riis B. Rattan S.I.S. Clark B.F.C. Merrick W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 420-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 24Durso N.A. Cyr R.J.

An EF-1α from tobacco cells was reported to have similar properties to vitronectin, an adhesion protein in animals (26Zhu J.K. Damsz B. Kononowicz A.K. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 393-404PubMed Google Scholar). In carrot cells, an EF-1α homolog was identified as an activator of a plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (22Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EF-1α has been demonstrated to bind to actin filaments and microtubules and affect their dynamics bothin vitro and in vivo (19Durso N.A. Cyr R.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 893-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Durso N.A. Cyr R.J. Protoplasma. 1994; 180: 99-105Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Yang F. Demma M. Warren V. Dharmawardhane S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence indicate that EF-1α possesses other biological functions beyond its activity in protein synthesis.In both plants and protozoan parasites, the interaction between CaM and EF-1α has been demonstrated, and their association depends on the presence of Ca2+ (19Durso N.A. Cyr R.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 893-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kaur K.J. Ruben L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23045-23050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since CaM is an important receptor for intracellular Ca2+ in regulating cytoskeletal functions (2Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), the finding of the Ca2+-dependent association of CaM and EF-1α led to speculation that this might be one of the mechanisms mediating the dynamics and functions of cytoskeleton by Ca2+/CaM. The significance of interaction between Ca2+/CaM and EF-1α has been implicated in several studies. It has been reported that the ability of EF-1α to bundle microtubules and F-actin was regulated by CaM in the addition of Ca2+ (24Durso N.A. Cyr R.J. Protoplasma. 1994; 180: 99-105Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Kurasawa Y. Hanya K. Watanabe Y. Numata O. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Moore R.C. Durso N.A. Cyr R.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Considering the multipotentiality of EF-1α, the connection between Ca2+, CaM, and EF-1α may involve not only the dynamics of cytoskeleton but also other cellular and biochemical processes.EF-1α undergoes three different post-translational modifications,i.e. methylation, formation of glycerylphosphoryl-ethanolamine, and phosphorylation (23Riis B. Rattan S.I.S. Clark B.F.C. Merrick W.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 420-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 33Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the effects of these post-translational modifications on its translational activity remain unclear. Protein phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms in regulating cellular and biochemical events. It is also highly involved in protein synthesis through phosphorylation of various components of the translational machinery including EF-1α (33Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). EF-1α was reported to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C, S6 kinase, and plant CDPK (22Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28252-28257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of EF-1α would facilitate its interaction with aminoacyl-tRNA and decrease its binding to ribosomes, and dephosphorylation is required for the transfer of aminoacyl-tRNA to 80 S ribosomes (33Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1992; 32: 243-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of EF-1 by multipotential S6 kinase resulted in stimulation of EF-1 activity (35Chang Y.W.E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28252-28257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, an in vitro assay indicated that phosphorylation of isolated EF-1α by protein kinase C did not affect its function as an elongation factor (34Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12574-12580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of its effect on protein synthesis, phosphorylation of a carrot EF-1α was shown to be pivotal to its function as an activator of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (22Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol.

These studies indicate that phosphorylation of EF-1α may not necessarily regulate its activity only in protein synthesis and may be involved in mediating its other functions also.In this report, we demonstrated that a homolog of EF-1α was phosphorylated by a plant Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner. The only phosphorylation site for CCaMK is located in the putative tRNA-binding region. This threonine residue is conserved among all EF-1α sequences available in eukaryotes. The functional significance of the phosphorylation and the localization of the phosphorylation site in the tRNA-binding region are currently not known. It is unclear whether the same site can be phosphorylated by the mammalian CaMKII or other protein kinases. We also showed that LlEF-1α1 was phosphorylated by a CDPK in a Ca2+-dependent but CaM-independent manner, which is consistent with the finding of a previous study (22Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CDPK phosphorylates multiple sites in LlEF-1α1, and these sites differ from the phosphorylation site of CCaMK. This suggests that these two kinases have some structural similarities, yet they differ in their regulation of kinase activity. Phosphorylation of EF-1α by CDPK was reported to be crucial for its function as an activator of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (22Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since CCaMK and CDPK phosphorylate different sites in EF-1α, it is reasonable to speculate that their phosphorylation may regulate different aspects of its biological functions.In vitro binding experiments revealed that CCaMK binds to EF-1α in a Ca2+-independent manner, and the addition of Ca2+ disrupts their association. In eukaryotic cells, a large family of protein kinases regulate a variety of cellular processes. How these kinases coordinate their functions is a very challenging and fundamental area in signal transduction. In recent years, progress in this area has revealed that one of the mechanisms for accomplishing the coordination is regulation of their subcellular localization through association with their anchoring proteins (36Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 37Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar, 38Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Association between CCaMK and EF-1α may provide a mechanism in the regulation of the kinase activity of CCaMK by localizing it into specific cellular compartments. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that EF-1α is associated with many proteins, including the components of the translational machinery, microtubules, and actin filaments (19Durso N.A. Cyr R.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 893-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Riis B. Rattan S.I.S. Clark B.F.C. Merrick W.C. Trends Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 18-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both CCaMK and EF-1α are highly expressed in similar tissues in lily (Fig. 3). It is very intriguing that targeting CCaMK into cytoskeleton or translational machinery through EF-1α may be one of the mechanisms to localize CCaMK into the neighborhood of its substrates.The results revealed that CCaMK phosphorylates EF-1α in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner but binds to it in a Ca2+-independent manner. We propose that CCaMK may be localized in cells through direct association with EF-1α in a Ca2+-independent manner. The transient kinase/substrate interaction of CCaMK with EF-1α requires Ca2+/CaM, while EF-1α serves as a substrate for CCaMK. It can be envisioned that CCaMK is compartmentalized into the subcellular domains, where its substrates exist, by association with EF-1α at the resting level of Ca2+ in cells. At this stage in the process, CCaMK is inactive. When Ca2+ concentration increases in cells due to external or internal signals, CCaMK dissociates from EF-1α and subsequently, upon binding Ca2+/CaM, becomes active to phosphorylate its substrates such as EF-1α or proteins near EF-1α. To some extent, this possible mechanism is analogous to the regulation of another second messenger-regulated protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, where activation of the kinase is achieved through the release of the catalytic subunits from the inactive holoenzyme by cAMP (3Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Various binding proteins for several protein kinases have been identified. Their interactions are mediated by either kinase domains or other regions and are subject to different types of regulation (41Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Rubenstein J.L. Gorelick F.S. Greengard P.

It remains to be investigated how CCaMK mediates its direct association with EF-1α and how Ca2+ disrupts their binding. Future studies will aim at illustrating the functional significance of the phosphorylation of EF-1α by CCaMK and its possible roles in tRNA binding, protein synthesis, and/or other cellular processes. Ca2+ is a universal second messenger that regulates diverse developmental and physiological processes in plants (1Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1993; 12: 185-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). One of the major mechanisms decoding the change of intracellular Ca2+ and transducing Ca2+ signal is the action of Ca2+-modulated proteins. Calmodulin (CaM)1 is a highly conserved and the most widely distributed Ca2+-binding protein (2Zielinski R.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 697-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). CaM is believed to be a primary receptor for intracellular Ca2+ and functions as a regulatory element for its target proteins when activated by Ca2+. One group of CaM-modulated proteins is composed of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases. Extensive investigation of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation has revealed that protein kinases play key roles in various signal transduction pathways leading to cellular and physiological responses (3Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation has been implicated in regulating a broad array of biological functions and is believed to play a pivotal role in amplifying and diversifying the action of Ca2+/CaM-mediated signals in animals. A number of different types of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases, including CaM kinases (CaMKs) I–IV, phosphorylase kinase, and myosin light chain kinase, have been cloned and demonstrated to regulate various cellular processes (4Schulman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some indirect evidence for the existence of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation has been reported in plants (1Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1993; 12: 185-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, until recently, no direct and convincing evidence has been presented. In recent years, three Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase genes having some features similar to the mammalian multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) were cloned from plants (6Watillon B. Kettmann R. Boxus P. Burny A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1381-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The apple Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase was isolated using an interaction screening method with labeled CaM as a ligand probe (6Watillon B. Kettmann R. Boxus P. Burny A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1381-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CCaMK from lily and MCK1 from maize were cloned using the polymerase chain reaction screening method with oligonucleotide primers designed based on the conserved regions of mammalian CaMKs (7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Lu Y.T. Hidaka H. Feldman L.J. Planta. 1996; 199: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the sequence similarity between lily CCaMK, maize MCK1, and apple Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase is only observed in their conserved kinase domains. No obvious sequence similarity exists outside their kinase domains. Although these three kinases were directly or indirectly demonstrated to bind CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, only biochemical properties for CCaMK have been reported to show that its kinase activity is regulated by Ca2+/CaM (9Takezawa D.

Poovaiah B.W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CCaMK has a unique structural feature characterized by the presence of a kinase domain, a CaM-binding domain, and a neural visinin-like Ca2+-binding domain within a single polypeptide (7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Its kinase domain and CaM-binding domain are highly similar to those of mammalian CaMKII. The sequence of its C-terminal domain does not show significant homology to any known protein kinase. This domain has high similarity with a family of neural visinin-like Ca2+-binding proteins (7Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and its Ca2+-binding property was confirmed by biochemical characterization (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In plants, a predominant and widely expressed form of protein kinase is the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase or CaM-like domain protein kinase (CDPK) (11Harper J.F. Sussman M.R. Schaller G.E. Putnam-Evans C. Charbonneau H. Harmon A.C. Science. 1991; 252: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Roberts D.M. Harmon A.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 375-414Crossref Scopus (568) Google Scholar). CDPK contains a kinase domain similar to that of mammalian CaMKII, a junction domain, and a CaM-like domain (11Harper J.F. Sussman M.R. Schaller G.E. Putnam-Evans C. Charbonneau H. Harmon A.C. Science. 1991; 252: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2031757749,"Abstract TESK1 (testis-specific protein kinase 1) is a protein kinase with a structure composed of an N-terminal protein kinase domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. Whereas the 3.6-kilobase TESK1 mRNA is expressed predominantly in the testis, a faint 2.5-kilobase TESK1 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously. The kinase domain of TESK1 contains in the catalytic loop in subdomain VIB an unusual DLTSKN sequence, which is not related to the consensus sequence of either serine/threonine kinases or tyrosine kinases. In this study, we show that TESK1 has kinase activity with dual specificity on both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. In an in vitrokinase reaction, the kinase domain of TESK1 underwent autophosphorylation on serine and tyrosine residues and catalyzed phosphorylation of histone H3 and myelin basic protein on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses revealed that Ser-215 within the “activation loop” of the kinase domain is the site of serine autophosphorylation of TESK1. Replacement of Ser-215 by alanine almost completely abolished serine autophosphorylation and histone H3 kinase activities. In contrast, replacement of Ser-215 by glutamic acid abolished serine autophosphorylation activity but retained histone H3 kinase activity. These results suggest that autophosphorylation of Ser-215 is an important step to positively regulate the kinase activity of TESK1."
https://openalex.org/W2137302957,"Osmotic shock and growth-medium stimulation of Dictyostelium cells results in rapid cell rounding, a reduction in cell volume, and a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton that leads to resistance to osmotic shock. Osmotic shock induces the activation of guanylyl cyclase, a rise in cGMP mediating the phosphorylation of myosin II, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of actin and the approximately 130-kDa protein (p130). We present data suggesting that signaling pathways leading to these different responses are, at least in part, independent. We show that a variety of stresses induce the Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase-3 (PTP3). This modification does not alter PTP3 catalytic activity but correlates with its translocation from the cytosol to subcellular structures that co-localize to endosomal vesicles. This translocation is independent of PTP3 activity. Mutation of the catalytically essential Cys to a Ser results in inactive PTP3 that forms a stable complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated p130 (pp130) in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that PTP3 has a substrate specificity for pp130. The data suggest that stresses activate several interacting signaling pathways controlled by Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphorylation, which, along with the activation of guanylyl cyclase, mediate the ability of this organism to respond to adverse changes in the external environment."

In the present report, we identified and monitored the pocket protein-E2F complexes in human primary B-lymphocytes after activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Consistent with previous data from human and mouse fibroblasts and T-lymphocytes, E2F4 and DP1 form the predominant E2F heterodimers both in G0 and G1 phases of the human B-lymphocyte cell cycle, whereas E2F1 and -3 are first detected in late G1, and their expression levels increase towards S phase. Intriguingly, the major E2F complex that we detected in quiescent human B-lymphocytes is consisted of pRB, E2F4, and DP1. Though the levels of DP1 and -2 increase when cells progress from G0 to S, the proportion of DP1 to DP2 remains relatively constant during the cell cycle. We also observed an increase in electrophoretic mobility of the predominant E2F components, DP1 and E2F4, as B-lymphocytes progressed from G0 into early G1. This increase in mobility was attributable to dephosphorylation, as λ phosphatase treatment could convert the slower migrating forms into the corresponding faster mobility forms. We further demonstrated that this change in phosphorylation status correlates with a decrease in DNA binding activity. This modulation of DNA binding activity mediated through the dephosphorylation of DP1 and E2F4 could help to explain the lack of in vivo DNA footprinting in late G1 and S phases of gene promoters negatively regulated through E2F sites and suggests a novel mechanism for controlling E2F transcriptional activity during the transition from quiescence to proliferation.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, exceptions to this general concept have also been reported, as some pRB-E2F complexes persist well into S and G2 phases (37Schwarz J.K. Devoto S.H. Smith E.J. Chellappan S.P. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In G0 and early G1, p107 is present at low levels in a hypophosphorylated form. As cells progress toward late G1, the level of p107 expressed increases, and the majority becomes hyperphosphorylated. (29Beijersbergen R.L. Carlee L. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1340-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Hypophosphorylated forms of p130 are detected primarily in G0 and early G1 phases of the cell cycle. In mid-G1, p130 becomes hyperphosphorylated, which persists for the rest of the cell cycle (32Mayol X. Garriga J. Grana X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p130 at mid-G1 is believed to play an essential role in relieving E2F-mediated repression of G1/S phase genes (7Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1685-1692PubMed Google Scholar), includingE2F1 and B-myb. However, p130 may not regulate E2F activity in continuously cycling cells as it is present at low levels and/or in a hyperphosphorylated state (38Thomas N.S.B. Pizzey A.R. Tiwari S. Williams C.D.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2561-2566PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has shown that cyclins and their dependent kinases (cdks) associate with pocket proteins and are largely responsible for their phosphorylation in vivo (5Weinberg R.A.

Though previous mobility shift analyses have shown that the predominant E2F complex in S phase consists of p107, E2F4, DP1, and cyclin A (19Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J.

Cell. 1991; 65: 1243-1253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), recentin vivo footprinting studies of the B-myb,cyclin A, and cdc2 promoters have demonstrated that the corresponding E2F sites are only engaged by transcription factors in G0 and early G1 but are largely unoccupied in late G1 and S phases (42Huet X. Rech J. Plet A. Vie A. Blanchard J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 43Zwicker J. Liu N. Engeland K. Lucibello F.C. Muller R.

The reason for this discrepancy is not yet understood, and further information is required on the molecular mechanisms regulating the occupancy of the endogenous E2F binding sites that can account for these in vivo protection patterns. The E2F transcription factor, in conjunction with the retinoblastoma family of proteins, orchestrates the orderly expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins at specific points of the cell cycle and thereby controls cell cycle progression. Hence, the pocket protein-E2F complexes are convergence points of positive and negative proliferative signals. Although it has been shown that overexpression of E2F activity can drive cell lines from G0 (quiescence) into S (DNA synthesis) phase, the modulation of E2F activity that accompanies this cell cycle phase transition in primary cells under normal physiological conditions is not fully defined. In particular, little information is available for the regulation and roles of the DP family of proteins during this G0 to S transition, despite the wealth of knowledge relating to the E2F family proteins. Moreover, little is known about the roles of the E2F and pRB families of proteins during B-lymphocyte activation. The present report describes the modulation of E2F complexes during human B-lymphocyte activation through stimulation by PMA1 (45Defrance T. Vanbervliet B. Durand I. Briolay J. Banchereau J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2831-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 46Murphy J.J. Norton J.D. Leuk. Res. 1993; 17: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and explores the molecular mechanisms involved. Platelet depleted buffy coats obtained from the National Blood Transfusion Service were pooled, and the mononuclear lymphocytes were enriched using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gradient centrifugation for 20 min at 800 × g. The B-lymphocytes were isolated by positive selection using CD19-coupled Dynabeads (M-450 pan-B, Dynall). The B-lymphocytes captured by the magnetic beads were then released using Detachabeads (Dynall). As the control, small dense B-lymphocytes were also isolated by flow cytometric sorting from human tonsils, as described (45Defrance T. Vanbervliet B. Durand I. Briolay J. Banchereau J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2831-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The freshly purified B-lymphocytes were seeded at 106 cells/ml in culture medium containing 15% fetal calf serum in RPMI and incubated for at least 36 h at 37 °C before stimulation by the addition of PMA at 30 μg/ml. Purity of B-lymphocytes was assessed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human B cell (CD20) antibodies (DAKO) and assayed using flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis was performed by propidium iodide and FITC staining as described previously (55Williams C.D. Linch D.C. Watts M.J. Thomas N.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 194-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS before fixing in 20% PBS and 80% ethanol. The fixed cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with DNase free-RNase (0.5 mg/ml), propidium iodide (20 μg/ml), and FITC (0.05 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C before analysis using a EPICS-Elite flow cytometer (Coulter, UK). For anti-CD20 staining, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml FITC-conjugated anti-human CD20 antibody (Dako A/S, Denmark) in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum for 30 min at 4 °C before fixing with ethanol/PBS. Whole cell extracts from human B-lymphocytes were prepared as detailed previously (57Bandara L.R. Lam E.W.-F. Sorensen T.S. Zamanian M. Girling R. La Thangue N.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3104-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Protein yield was quantified by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad). E2F gel retardation assays were performed essentially as described (19Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), using a double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GATCTAGTTTTCGCGCTTAAATTTGA) containing the distal E2F binding site from the adenovirus type 5 E2a promoter (57Bandara L.R. Lam E.W.-F. Sorensen T.S. Zamanian M. Girling R. La Thangue N.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3104-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of whole cell extract was incubated with 1–2 ng of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe in the presence of 2 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 200 ng of a comparable unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide with mutated E2F site (5′-GATCTAGTTTTCGATATTAAATTTGA) in a total volume of 20 μl at 30 °C for 15 min. The reactions were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.33 × Tris-buffered EDTA at 4 °C. The gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray films. Supershift assays were performed by adding 1 μl of concentrated antibodies. Rabbit anti-pRB2/p130 and anti-cyclin A antisera were kindly provided by Dr. A. Giordano and Dr. J. Pines, respectively. Anti-pRB mouse monoclonal antibody 21C9 (58Belbrahem A. Godden-Kent D. Mittnacht S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Sybille Mittnacht. Anti-DP1, -E2F1, -E2F4 rabbit antisera were raised against peptides corresponding to unique carboxyl-terminal regions of the respective human proteins and have been described previously (49Lam E.W.-F. Choi M.S. van der Sman J. Burbidge S.A. Klaus G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10051-10057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The anti-DP2 polyclonal antibodies were raised against peptides corresponding to unique regions at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. Anti-E2F2 (L-20), anti-E2F3 (N-20), and anti-E2F5 (E19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Western blot extracts were prepared from B-lymphocytes by lysing cells with 4 times the packed cell volume of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 20 min. Fifty μg of lysate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and recognized by specific antibodies. The antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Both the anti-DP1 and DP2 monoclonal antibodies were raised against s6-His-tagged (Qiagen) peptides corresponding to unique amino-terminal regions of the corresponding human proteins. The antibodies against E2F1(KH95), E2F2(l-20), E2F3(N-20), E2F4(C-20), E2F5(MH5), pRB(C-15), p107(C-18), and p130(C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal antibody against human c-MYC was prepared from supernatant of the hybridoma 9E10 (59Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of cell extracts was performed by incubating whole cell extracts with 500 units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 1 h as detailed before (55Williams C.D. Linch D.C. Watts M.J. Thomas N.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 194-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by boiling with SDS sample buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western-blotted with the appropriate antibodies. Note that the anti-E2F4 polyclonal antibodies also recognized an unspecific band (indicated by asterisk in Fig. 5) in the whole cell extracts, which was not detected previously in the Western blot lysate. DNA binding assays were performed as described previously (38Thomas N.S.B. Pizzey A.R. Tiwari S. Williams C.D. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23659-23667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were collected and lysed on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as detailed by Thomas (60Thomas N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13697-13700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After clearing by centrifugation, the nuclear pellet was lysed further with 1/10 of the same buffer containing 450 mm NaCl. Both the high salt and low salt supernatants were combined and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 10 μg of mutant double-stranded 5′-biotinylated E2F oligonucleotide (as described for mobility shift assay) and 20 μl of avidin-coupled methacrylate matrix (Softlink Avidin, Promega). The supernatant was then incubated similarly with the wild-type E2F oligonucleotide and avidin beads. In both cases, the beads were washed three times in low salt lysis buffer and then boiled in SDS sample buffer before examination by Western blot analysis. Human B-lymphocytes were purified from platelet-depleted buffy coats by positive selection using CD19-conjugated immunomagnetic beads after preliminary enrichment over Ficoll density gradients. The purity of human B-lymphocytes isolated by this procedure was routinely more than 95%, as verified by staining using fluorochrome-conjugated CD20 antibodies (Fig.1 A). The purified human B-lymphocytes were then stimulated to enter the cell cycle using PMA, and their cell cycle status was monitored by flow cytometric analysis of both DNA and protein content, gauged by the levels of propidium iodide and FITC staining, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Untreated B-lymphocytes had a 2N DNA and a low protein content, indicating that the majority of the unstimulated B-lymphocytes were in G0. Upon PMA stimulation, the first sign of increased cellular protein content (FITC staining) was observed at 12 h, indicating that cells were beginning to enter early G1 (47Darzynkiewicz Z. Crissman H. Traganos F. Steinkamp J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 113: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the majority of the cells traversed the G0/G1boundary between 24 and 36 h. A small population of PMA-stimulated cells began to enter S phase (DNA synthesis) at 60 h, which is indicated by an increase in their DNA content. It is also notable that with PMA stimulation alone, the majority of cells remained in G0/G1 after 72 h. The relatively long G1 made this cell system ideal for investigating the early phases of the cell cycle. To characterize the functional E2F complexes in human B-lymphocytes, mobility shift analysis was performed on extracts derived from PMA-stimulated cells. The mobility-shift analysis (Fig. 2 A) identified at least five species of DNA binding complexes containing E2F (complexes A to E) by virtue of the difference in their mobility. Of these, two are free E2Fs (complexes D and E), and the other three are complexed E2Fs (complexes A, B, andC), shown previously also to contain the pRB-related pocket proteins. As we have shown previously (48Williams C.D. Linch D.C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Thomas N.S. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 96: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), only one predominant species of E2F complex (complex B) was detected in unstimulated human B-lymphocytes. Upon PMA stimulation, the level of this complexed E2F (complex B) increased, reaching a peak at 30 h. However, as the cells progressed toward S phase, this E2F complex declined gradually and was eventually replaced by two other complexed E2Fs (complexes A and C) and two free E2F species (complexes D and E). To identify the components of these E2F complexes, we performed antibody supershift experiments on extracts corresponding to B-lymphocytes at G0, G1, and S phases of the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 2 B (0 h), the anti-pRB antibody supershifted the majority of the E2F complex (complex B) found in the G0 phase of the cell cycle, whereas the anti-p130 antibody shifted less than 50% of this G0 complex, and the anti-p107 failed to shift this complex at all. The addition of anti-cyclin A antibody produced an unspecific band but failed to disrupt the G0 complex, indicating that cyclin A is not present in the G0 E2F complex in B-lymphocytes. It is notable that the anti-cyclin A used here does not supershift E2F complexes but disrupts E2F complexes containing cyclin A (49Lam E.W.-F. Choi M.S. van der Sman J. Burbidge S.A. Klaus G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10051-10057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The G0 complex could also be supershifted by the anti-E2F4 antibody but not antibodies against E2F1, -2, -3. Antibodies raised against DP1 could again shift the majority of the complex, and the remaining E2F complex could be shifted by different anti-DP2 antibodies (Fig. 2 C). This indicates that though DP1 is the predominant DP protein present in these complexes, a low level of DP2 is also complexed with E2F4 and pRB or p130. Therefore, we propose that the predominant E2F complex (B) present in unstimulated, quiescent B-lymphocytes largely contains E2F4, DP1, and pRB or p130. It is also notable that the majority of the G0 complex contains pRB instead of p130 complexing with E2F4 and DP1. This observation is in contrast to what has been reported to be present in quiescent cells of other primary cell types. For example, in quiescent serum-starved mouse fibroblasts and in resting human primary T lymphocytes and CD34+ cells, the major E2F complex consists of E2F4 and DP1 complexed with p130 (9Vairo G. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 27Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell.

As the B-lymphocytes progressed into early G1 (24 h), there was a general increase in the level of this pRB- or p130-containing E2F complex (complex B), although the components of this complex remained unchanged, as demonstrated by the supershift analysis (Fig.2 B). Notably, at this time, low levels of free E2F started to accumulate. The slower migrating free E2F (complex D) can be supershifted by anti-E2F4, whereas the higher mobility free E2F (complex E) can only be shifted by antibodies to E2F5 but not other E2Fs. In late G1/S phase (48 h, 72 h), the complexes containing pRB and p130 disappeared and were replaced by at least four different E2F complexes (Fig. 2 A). Subsequent supershift analyses (Fig. 2 B) showed that the slowest migrating E2F complex (complex A) contains predominantly p107, cyclin A, E2F4, and DP1, the faster complexed E2F (complex C) consists of pRB, DP1, and E2F1, -2, -3, or -4, the slower of the two free E2F (complex D) is composed of DP1 and E2F4, and finally, the fastest migrating complex (complex E) is made up mainly of DP1 complexed either with E2F1, -2, -3, or -5. Although previous studies have shown that E2F1, -2, and -3 interact specifically with pRB, and E2F4 and 5 with p107 and p130, we show here that E2F4 and DP heterodimers bind largely to pRB in B-lymphocytes in G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Consistent with our findings is the previous observation that E2F4 also complexes with pRB as well as p130 in Daudi B cells during cell cycle arrest caused by α-interferon (38Thomas N.S.B. Piz"

It has been implicated in angiogenic diseases including atherosclerosis, cancer and inflammatory diseases. In the present study, the entire transcriptional unit of the mouse FGF-1 gene, including four promoters, is characterized. By nucleotide sequence and RNase protection analyses, we have determined that its 3′-end resides 3.2 kilobase pairs downstream from the stop codon. We have previously cloned and characterized the mouse homologue of the human 1B promoter, as well as a novel upstream untranslated exon. In order to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of FGF-1 gene expression, the mouse promoter containing TATA and CAAT consensus sequences (FGF-1.A) was isolated from a P1 library and characterized. We further determined that the mouse heart is the most abundant source for the FGF-1.A mRNA. Finally, via both RNase protection analysis and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we determined the transcription start site of the FGF-1.A mRNA."

The second unique property is that γ12 associates with F-actin in cells and in a cell-free system (11Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J.

To examine the role of γ12, we overexpressed γ12, other γ subunits and their mutants together with β1 in NIH 3T3 cells.

NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described. After 48 h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and immunostained using antibodies against γ or β, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (MBL) as described (11Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were also stained for F-actin with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin. After transfection, the cells (5 × 106 cells) washed with phosphate-buffered saline were incubated for 5 min at 0 °C with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C (11Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was washed once with the same buffer. The supernatant and pellet were used as the Triton X-100-soluble and Triton X-100-insoluble fractions, respectively (11Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM for 24 h prior to the 32P incorporation experiment. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-free medium (Eagle's minimum essential medium without sodium phosphate), preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the same medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.2 mCi), and then incubated for 30 min with 10% calf serum in DMEM. After labeling, the cells were washed with the ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in 0.2 ml of a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 nm calyculin A, and 1% CHAPS. The suspension was mixed with a vortex mixer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 5 μg of affinity-purified antibody against γ7, which had been preincubated with protein A-Sepharose beads. The Sepharose beads were washed with the solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 10 nm calyculin A, and 0.1% CHAPS. The beads were suspended in 30 μl of sample buffer for electrophoresis, and each resultant supernatant was subjected to Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10527) Google Scholar) with subsequent autoradiography (6Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y.

For immunoblotting, cells were trypsinized 48 h after transfection, seeded into culture dishes, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in DMEM with 10% calf serum. Then cell lysates were subjected to Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for immunoblotting with the antibody against phosphorylated γ12 (p-γ12) (9Asano T. Morishita R. Ueda H. Asano M. Kato K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Migration through a membrane in response to serum was assayed with the use of a Chemotaxicell chamber (Kurabo) with an 8-μm polycarbonate filter (24Cunningham C.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were trypsinized and counted, and 5 × 104 cells/well were loaded into the top wells in DMEM. The bottom wells were similarly filled with DMEM with 10% calf serum so that the cells were exposed to a gradient of serum factors. The chambers were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and the membranes were removed and stained. Under these conditions, a negligible number of cells fell off the bottom of the filter. The number of cells that had migrated through the membrane was counted for each well. To determine cell migration by chemokinesis, top and bottom wells were filled with media with 10% calf serum so that the cells were exposed to no gradient of serum factors. Cell migration in the absence of a gradient was about 40% of that in a gradient, indicating that the observed migration consisted of both chemotaxis and chemokinesis. Immunocytochemical double staining of normal NIH 3T3 cells with phalloidin showed the complete overlap of γ12 staining with staining of actin stress fibers, which were found crossing the entire cell (Fig. 1 A) as previously reported for Swiss 3T3 cells (11Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of γ12, we co-transfected γ12 or various γ subunits with β1 in NIH 3T3 cells. Most cells overexpressing γ12 were rounded, with disruption of F-actin architecture (Fig. 1 B), whereas some cells overexpressing γ12 had decreased stress fibers with a flattened shape (Fig. 1 C). Because the fluorescence of γ subunits in transfected cells was much stronger than that in normal cells, photographs with short exposure were shown in Fig. 1(B–G). Therefore, the staining of endogenous γ12 in normal cells was faint or not observed in Fig. 1(B and C). In contrast with γ12, overexpression of γ2, γ5, and γ7 did not induce such dramatic changes in cell shape, but some of cells overexpressing these γ subunits showed decreased stress fibers in the center and adopted a flattened, rounded shape (Fig. 1, D–F). Immunoblotting analyses showed that similar amounts of β1 and transfected γ subunits were expressed in these experiments, whereas basal levels of γ5 and γ12, major endogenous γ subunits in NIH 3T3 cells, were detected in all cells (Fig.2 A). To examine whether the expressed γ subunits associated with cytoskeletal components, transfected cells were fractionated using Triton X-100. A large portion of the expressed γ12 was present in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in transfected cells, and a similar distribution of endogenous γ12 was observed in control cells, whereas most γ2, γ5, and γ7 were present in Triton X-100-soluble fractions (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that expressed γ12, but not other isoforms, associates with cytoskeletal components, which is consistent with the localization of endogenous γ subunits in Swiss 3T3 cells (11Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Expression of β and γ subunits in transfected cells and association of expressed γ subunits with cytoskeletal components. A, expression of β and γ subunits in transfected cells. NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with β1 and the various γ subunits as indicated. Equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for γ subunits or SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for β subunit and immunoblotted with antibodies against β subunit and various γ subunits. The standards (Std, from top to bottom) were purified bovine βγ2 (10 ng), βγ5 (5 ng), βγ7 (5 ng), βγ12 (5 ng), and βγ2 (5 ng). Because the antibody used to detect γ7 cross-reacted with γ2, γ3and γ12 (22Asano T. Morishita R. Ohashi K. Nagahama M. Miyake T. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), staining for γ7 artifactually stained γ2 and γ12 as well as γ7. The other antibodies used to stain the γ subunits were specific for their respective isoforms (6Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S.

Transfected cells were fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble (Sol) and -insoluble (Insol) fractions. Fractions were then subjected to immunoblotting with respective antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast with the cells co-transfected with β1 and γ12, the cells transfected with γ12 alone were unchanged, suggesting that β1 and γ12were co-expressed in cells and the β1γ12complex induced cell rounding (data not shown). To test further whether the β1γ12 complex was indeed involved in induction of cell rounding, we expressed βARKct (19Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gi2α, both of which are expected to bind and sequester free βγ. Co-expression of βARKct (Fig. 1 G) or Gi2α (data not shown) prevented β1γ12-induced cell rounding, supporting the involvement of the βγ complex in these changes. The round shape of the cells suggested a decrease of cell adhesion, which might influence cell migration (24Cunningham C.C. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 25Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30688-30692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, Boyden chamber cell migration assays were performed for cells transfected with various γ subunits. Cell migration markedly increased in cells transfected with γ12 but did not significantly change in cells transfected with γ2, γ5, or γ7 (Fig.3). Co-transfection of βARKct again suppressed the increase of cell motility induced by γ12. These results suggested that γ12, but not other γ subunits, was involved in enhancement of cell motility. Expression of βARKct alone in normal cells decreased cell motility, suggesting that βγ12-induced cell migration occurred in normal cells (data not shown). Comparison of amino acid sequences of various isoforms of γ revealed diverged residues concentrated at the N-terminal region (6Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29469-29475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To test whether the ability of γ12 to associate with F-actin is determined by its N-terminal sequence, the N-terminal truncated γ12 (γ12ΔN5, Fig.4 A) was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. The deletion of the N terminus decreased the ability of γ12 to associate with cytoskeletal fractions (Fig.4 B), indicating that the N-terminal region of γ12 is important for the association with F-actin. The weak association of γ12ΔN5 with cytoskeletal fractions was not due to an inability to form the βγ complex, because γ12ΔN5 was coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody against Gi2α when co-transfected with β and Gi2α but not when co-transfected with only Gi2α (data not shown). The γ12ΔN5 mutant neither caused cell rounding nor enhanced cell migration (Fig. 4,C and F), suggesting that the association of γ12 with F-actin is important to induce these changes. On the other hand, the N-terminal region contains a site phosphorylated by PKC (6Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29469-29475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 9Asano T. Morishita R. Ueda H. Asano M. Kato K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and therefore it is possible that phosphorylation of γ12 is involved in induction of these changes. When phosphorylation of γ12 was analyzed by immunoblotting with the antibody against p-γ12, the expressed γ12 was strongly phosphorylated, whereas weak phosphorylation of endogenous γ12 was observed (Fig.4 D). The phosphorylation of the expressed γ12determined with 32P incorporation was also greater than that of the endogenous γ12 observed in control cells, but the increase appeared to be smaller than that observed in immunoblots (Fig. 4 E). The conditions of these experiments were not identical, but the main reason for the small increase of phosphorylation was that some γ12 subunits in transfected cells had already been phosphorylated before the 32P incorporation experiment (data not shown). We then transfected NIH 3T3 cells with the mutant γ12S2A, in which Ser 2A phosphorylation site of γ12 for PKC is the first serine residue from the N terminus of γ12, which was previously designated Ser1from the sequence of a mature γ12 protein (6Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21958-21965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) but is designated Ser2 in this paper. , a phosphorylation site,2 is replaced with alanine (Fig. 4 A). The γ12S2A, which was not phosphorylated, could associate with the cytoskeleton but had no effect on morphology and motility of cells (Fig. 4). Because glutamic acid can substitute for phosphoserine in some proteins activated by phosphorylation, we next transfected cells with mutant γ12S2E, in which Ser2 is replaced with glutamate (Fig. 4 A). This mutant caused similar effects in transfected cells to wild-type γ12, except of the increase of phosphorylation (Fig. 4). These results supported the idea that phosphorylation of γ12 induced cell rounding and enhanced cell motility. In Fig. 4 (D and E), smaller increases of phosphorylation were observed in the cells transfected with γ12ΔN5, γ12S2A, and γ12S2E, in comparison with control cells. The reason for these increases will be discussed later (see “Discussion”). To further evaluate the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of γ subunits, we mutated the N-terminal region of a different γ, γ2, to introduce SSK, the phosphorylation motif for PKC (γ2SSK, Fig. 4 A) (9Asano T. Morishita R. Ueda H. Asano M. Kato K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The γ2SSK was phosphorylated as well as γ12 in cells when judged by32P incorporation, whereas the antibody against p-γ12 weakly recognized phosphorylated γ2SSK, probably due to a low reactivity with the mutant. However, the γ2SSK, which hardly associated with cytoskeletal fractions, neither induced cell rounding nor increased cell migration (Fig. 4), suggesting that phosphorylation is not sufficient for the changes induced by phosphorylated γ12. The weak association of this mutant with cytoskeletal fractions (Fig.4 B) suggested that the association with the cytoskeleton might be essential for enhancing cell migration. The present study showed that transfection of βγ12markedly induced cell rounding and increased cell migration, but transfection of βγ2, βγ5, and βγ7 induced only minor changes, clearly indicating a functional difference among γ subunits. This specific function of γ12 is derived from its unique property of selective phosphorylation by PKC. However, the phosphorylation is not sufficient to account for the activity of γ12, because the γ2SSK mutant, which could be phosphorylated, did not induce these changes in cells. This is in contrast to the result that the activity of the βγ complex containing phosphorylated γ10G4K (γ10SSK) mutant was similar to that of the phosphorylated βγ12 in stimulating type II adenylyl cyclase (10Yasuda H. Lindorfer M.A. Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21958-21965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Some part(s) of the structure of γ12 other than the N terminus might also be important for enhancing cell migration or/and some other characteristic of γ12 important for associating with F-actin might be essential for inducing these changes. The present results demonstrated that γ subunits unable to associate with cytoskeletal factions did not increase cell migration, but further experiments are necessary to show whether association with F-actin is essential. Although the effects of γ2, γ5, and γ7 were not very remarkable, decreases of stress fibers (Fig. 1, E–G) and small increases of cell motility (Fig. 3) were observed in cells transfected with these γ subunits. One previous report showed that transfection of β1γ2 did not induce morphological changes in Swiss 3T3 cells (27Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), but another report indicated that microinjection of β1γ2 reduced stress fibers in CV-1 cells (28Lin H.C. Duncan J.A. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5057-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which is basically consistent with our present observations. These isoforms may have weak activities, but it is also possible that the apparent effects of γ2, γ5, and γ7 are due to βγ12released from endogenous G protein due to displacement by the overexpressed βγ. This speculation might be supported by the evidence that phosphorylation of γ12 slightly increased in the cells transfected with γ subunits other than wild-type γ12 in comparison with control cells (Fig. 4,D and E). Because similar amounts of endogenous γ12 exist in all these cells, the increase of phosphorylated γ12 suggests the replacement of the βγ12 in endogenous G protein and an increase of the free βγ12. We have shown that phosphorylation of γ12 enhances fibroblast migration in response to serum. A variety of growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (26Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R.

Science. 1991; 251: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), were shown to stimulate migration of fibroblasts. Down-regulation or inhibition of PKC abolished the effect of platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor on cell migration, suggesting the role of PKC in these processes (29Derman M.P.

Our previous observation that platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid, and serum stimulated phosphorylation of γ12 in Swiss 3T3 cells (9Asano T. Morishita R. Ueda H. Asano M. Kato K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) strongly suggests the involvement of phosphorylation of γ12 in cell migration stimulated by these growth factors. For phosphorylation of γ12, activation of G proteins is important as well as PKC activation, because free βγ12 was a better substrate for PKC than the trimer form (6Morishita R. Nakayama H. Isobe T. Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Okano T. Fukada Y. Mizuno K. Ohno S. Kozawa O. Kato K. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29469-29475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Lysophosphatidic acid could stimulate Gi and Gq, so that both G protein and PKC could be activated by this agonist. By contrast, receptor tyrosine kinases are well known to stimulate PKC via activation of phospholipase Cγ, and the evidence that basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated migration of endothelial cells was reduced by pertussis toxin suggests the involvement of G protein activation in this process (31Sa G. Fox P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3219-3225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neptune and Bourne (32Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, they also suggest that Gi activation is necessary but probably not sufficient for chemotaxis. Activation of PKC to phosphorylate γ12 might be necessary for maximal stimulation of chemotaxis. Cell migration requires dynamic and coordinated disassembly and reassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions, but the precise mechanisms regulating these processes are not clear (25Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The present observations that overexpression of γ12 decreases stress fibers and induces cell rounding suggest that γ12 may be involved in disassembly of stress fibers. Because PKC and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, of which activation increases cell migration, have also been found to associate with the cytoskeleton (16Payrastre B. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.

Recent studies showed the role of Rho family GTPases such as Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in regulation of assembly and organization of the actin cytoskeleton (34Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5242) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, βγ complex has been shown to associate with Cdc24, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42, suggesting a cascade from βγ to actin organization via Cdc42 (35Nern A. Arkowitz R.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At present, this cascade has not been shown in mammalian cells, but future experiments will elucidate downstream signaling molecules linking βγ12 to cell migration, possibly including this cascade.

Human endothelial cells were treated with low concentrations of ethanol (0.25–25 mm, 0–24 h), which are associated with moderate alcohol consumption. Although treatment with ethanol alone did not affect t-PA gene transcription or mRNA expression, it augmented isoproterenol (ISO)-stimulated t-PA gene transcription and mRNA levels by 3.4- and 2.8-fold, respectively, and decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA levels by 65%. These effects of ethanol correlated with 2.5- and 6.9-fold increases in ISO-stimulated cyclic AMP levels and 4×-cyclic AMP response element heterologous promoter activity, respectively. To determine whether alcohol-induced changes in agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP levels were because of modulation of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), we assessed the effects of ethanol on Gαs and Gαi2. Although ethanol did not affect the expression of Gαs or Gαi2, it increased ISO-stimulated Gαs GTPase and GTP binding activity by 2.2- and 2.9-fold and decreased UK14304-stimulated Gαi2 GTPase and GTP binding activity by 38 and 80%. These results indicate that treatment with relatively low concentrations of ethanol enhances agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP-dependent t-PA gene transcription in vascular endothelial cells through differential modulation of G protein.

Although the precise mechanism(s) by which alcohol protects against atherosclerotic heart disease is not known, recent studies suggest that some of the beneficial effects of alcohol may be mediated by its ability to prevent vascular thrombosis and occlusion (3Renaud S. de Lorgeril M. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1523-1526Abstract PubMed Scopus (3181) Google Scholar). Because the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques with ensuing thrombosis is widely believed to be the predominant etiology underlying acute coronary syndromes (4Libby P. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar), endogenous mediators such as the proteolytic enzyme, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA),1 and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 are important in regulating the thrombotic process (5Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1980; 43: 77-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of t-PA is to convert plasminogen to a proteolytic enzyme, plasmin, which digests fibrin-dependent blood clots. Thus, thrombotic vascular complications may be attenuated by agents that increase the secretion of t-PA and/or decrease the expression of PAI-1 (6Gorinstein S. Zemser M. Lichman I. Berebi A.

Indeed, the plasma level of t-PA has been shown to be inversely correlated with the risk of myocardial infarction (9Ridker P.M. Vaughan D.E. Stampfer M.J. Manson J.E. Hennekens C.H. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1165-1168Abstract PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The induction of t-PA gene transcription is regulated, in part, by cAMP and transcription factors that bind to activator protein-2 and shear-stress response element (10Nagamine Y. Reich E. Proc.

The ability of cAMP to mediate increases in t-PA expression has been demonstrated in many cell types including hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (13Uno S. Nakamura M. Ohomagari Y.

Although higher concentrations of alcohol (i.e. >100 mm) have been shown to modulate guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) activity and cAMP levels in neuronal tissues or cell lines (17Mochly-Rosen D.

Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is not known whether lower concentrations of alcohol (i.e. <5 mm) have similar effects in vascular endothelial cells and whether these effects, if present, translate into specific gene expression that contributes to the cardiovascular protective effects of moderate alcohol ingestion. Thus, the purpose of this study is to characterize the effects of alcohol on G-protein function in vascular endothelial cells and to determine whether concentrations of alcohol that are associated with the ingestion of less than two alcoholic beverages can up-regulate t-PA expression via G-protein-mediated cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. All standard culture reagents were obtained from JRH Bioscience. Isoproterenol, propranolol, ascorbic acid, creatinine phosphate, phosphocreatine kinase, GTPγS, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin, ATP, GDP, GTP, 8-bromo-cAMP, and cholera and pertussis toxins were purchased from Sigma. UK14304 (α2-adrenergic receptor agonist) was a gift from Pfizer. The radioisotopes, [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol), [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and the polyclonal rabbit antisera to Gαs (RM/1) were supplied by NEN Life Science Products. The polyclonal rabbit antisera P4 was raised against a purified decapeptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal regions of Gαi2 (20Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein molecular weight markers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The chemiluminesence detection kit (ECL) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (pore size 0.2 μm) was purchased from Bio-Rad. The heterologous 4×-CRE promoter luciferase reporter construct (p.CRE-Luc) was purchased from Strategene (San Diego, CA). The full-length human t-PA and PAI-1 cDNAs were obtained from Sandra J. Degen (University of Cincinnati) and David Luskatoff (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA), respectively. Endothelial cells were harvested from human saphenous veins and human and bovine aortas as described (21De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 22Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 5 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), and an antibiotic mixture of penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), Fungizone (250 ng/ml). Relatively pure endothelial cell cultures were confirmed by Nomarski optical microscopy (Olympus IX70, 40 × objective) and by immunofluorescence staining with anti-Factor VIII antibodies. All passages were performed with a disposable cell scraper (Costar), and only endothelial cells of less than six passages were used. Confluent endothelial cells (∼2 × 106 for human and ∼5 × 106 for bovine) were treated with various concentrations of ethanol, and culture dishes were parafilm-wrapped for the indicated time intervals. Partially purified membranes were prepared from control and ethanol-treated endothelial cells as described previously (22Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (25 μg) and molecular weight markers were separated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% running, 4% stacking gel). The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated overnight at 4 °C with blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) before to the addition of the following dilutions of specific rabbit polyclonal antisera: P4 (1:400) and RM/1 (1:1000). The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then treated with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:4000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radiographic chemiluminescence was performed several times at 23 °C, and the appropriate exposures were subjected to densitometric analysis. Equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg) were separated by 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred overnight onto Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary action, and baked for 2 h at 80 °C before prehybridization. Radiolabeling of full-length human t-PA or PAI-1 cDNA were performed using random hexamer priming, [α-32P]CTP, and Klenow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were hybridized with the indicated probes overnight at 45 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. All Northern blots were subjected to stringent washing conditions (0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C) before autoradiography with intensifying screen at −80 °C for 24–72 h. Equalization of RNA loading was assessed by re-probing all blots with human β-tubulin (ATCC number 37855). Membranes (30 μg) from endothelial cells treated with the indicated conditions were incubated for 90 min at 22 °C in the presence or absence of specific COOH-terminal antisera before GTPase assay as described (23Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12987-12992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies revealed that maximal inhibition of receptor-G-protein coupling was achieved by the antisera at the following dilutions: P4 (1:50) and RM/1 (1:100). The GTPase assay was initiated by the addition of isoproterenol (100 nm) or UK14304 (α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, 10 nm) to the reaction mixture as described previously (20Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nonspecific activity was determined in the presence of GTPγS (10 μm) and represented ∼10% of total activity. Isoproterenol- and UK14304-stimulated GTPase activity was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific activity and expressed as pmol/min/mg of membrane protein. Assays were performed in duplicate with less than 10% variation. Membrane proteins (30 μg) from control and ethanol-treated endothelial cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing [35S]GTPγS (20 nm), GTP (2 μm), MgCl2 (5 mm), EGTA (0.1 mm), NaCl (50 mm), creatine phosphate (4 mm), phosphocreatine kinase (5 units), ATP (0.1 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), leupeptin (100 μg/ml), aprotinin (50 μg/ml), bovine serum albumin (0.2%), and triethanolamine HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4). The assay was initiated by the addition of isoproterenol (100 nm) or UK14304 (10 nm) and terminated after 30 min with excess unlabeled GTPγS (100 μm). Samples were then resuspended in 100 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing Triton X-100 (1%), SDS (0.1%), NaCl (150 mm), EDTA (5 mm), Tris-HCl (25 mm, pH 7.4), leupeptin (10 μg), aprotinin (10 μg), and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (2 mm). The following G-protein antisera with their corresponding final dilutions were added to the mixture: αi2 (P4, 1:20) and αs (RM/1, 1:100). The samples were allowed to incubate for 16 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The antibody-G-protein complexes were then incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1 mg/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. Preliminary studies indicated that all αi2 and αs were completely precipitated by this procedure because Western blot analysis of the supernatant with the P4 and RM/1 antisera did not reveal the presence of 40–41- or 46–52-kDa proteins, respectively. The pellets were washed three times in a buffer containing HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.4), NaF (100 μm), sodium phosphate (50 mm), NaCl (100 mm), Triton X-100 (1%), and SDS (0.1%). The final pellet containing the immunoprecipitated [35S]GTPγS-labeled G-protein was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LS 1800, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Nonspecific activity was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled GTPγS (100 μm). Confluent endothelial cells were treated for 12 h with the indicated concentrations of ethanol. After the addition of isobutylmethylxanthine(0.5 mm) for 15 min, cells were stimulated with isoproterenol (100 nm) in the presence or absence of propranolol (100 μm) for another 15 min. Unstimulated cells were treated with isobutylmethylxanthine for 30 min. Cells were scraped on ice, pelleted, and resuspended in ice-cold isobutylmethylxanthine (0.5 mm), boiled for 3 min, and frozen at −70 °C. The intracellular cAMP level was determined using a radioimmunoassay kit with [3H]cAMP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transient transfections in bovine aortic endothelial cells were accomplished using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (21De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies with β-galactosidase staining indicate that the transfection efficiency was ∼12%. A heterologous promoter containing four tandem 4×-CRE elements linked to the luciferase reporter gene (pCRE-Luc, Stratagene) were used to assess cAMP-dependent gene transcription. Bovine endothelial cells (60–70% confluent) were transfected with 5 μg of the pCRE-Luc and 1 μg of pCMV.β-gal construct. Approximately 48 h after transfection, endothelial cells were treated with ethanol or isoproterenol, alone or in combination, for 12 h. The luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined by chemiluminescence (Dual-Light, Tropix, Bedford, MA) using a Berthold L9501 luminometer. Confluent endothelial cells (5 × 107 cells) were treated with ethanol (2.5 mm, 12 h) in the presence or absence of isoproterenol (100 nm). Nuclei were isolated, and in vitrotranscription was performed with [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) as described previously (24Peng H.B. Rajavashisth T.B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (1 μg) of purified, denatured full-length human t-PA, human, β-tubulin (ATCC n number 37855), and linearized pGEM-3z cDNA were vacuum-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a slot blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization of radiolabeled mRNA transcripts to the nitrocellulose membranes was carried out at 45 °C for 48 h in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were then washed with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65 °C before autoradiography for 72 h at −80 °C. Band intensities were subjected to analyses by laser densitometry. Band intensities from Northern, Western, and nuclear run-on assay blots were analyzed densitometrically by the National Institutes of Health Image Program (25Rasband W. NIH Image Program, version 1.49. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1993Google Scholar). All values are expressed as mean ±S.E. compared with controls and among separate experiments. Paired and unpaired Student's t tests were employed to determine the significance of changes in GTPase, GTP binding, and luciferase activities. A significant difference was taken for p values less than 0.05. There were no observable adverse effects of ethanol, isoproterenol, and 8-bromo-cAMP on cell number, morphology, or immunofluorescent staining for Factor VIII-related antigens. Cellular confluence and viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion were maintained for all treatment conditions described. Treatment of human vascular endothelial cells with ethanol (0–2.5 mm, 24 h) alone did not affect steady-state t-PA mRNA expression (Fig.1 A). However, at an ethanol concentration of 25 mm, there was a 36 ± 5% reduction in t-PA mRNA levels compared with basal levels (p < 0.05, n = 3). Stimulation of untreated endothelial cells with isoproterenol (100 nm) increased t-PA mRNA levels by 48 ± 6% (p < 0.05 compared with base line, n = 3). Endothelial cells treated with 0.25 and 2.5 mm ethanol showed a 2.8- and 2.3-fold increase in isoproterenol-stimulated t-PA mRNA levels compared with ethanol alone (p < 0.05 for both,n = 3). At an ethanol concentration of 25 mm, there was no significant increase in isoproterenol-stimulated t-PA mRNA expression compared with ethanol alone (p > 0.05, n = 3). Similar results were observed with human aortic endothelial cells (data not shown). These results indicate that low concentrations of ethanol (< 10 mm) augment isoproterenol-stimulated t-PA expression in vascular endothelial cells. Treatment of endothelial cells with increasing concentrations of ethanol (0–25 mm, 24 h) also did not significantly affect PAI-1 steady-state mRNA levels (Fig. 1 B). However, stimulation with isoproterenol (100 mm) alone decreased PAI-1 mRNA levels by 28 ± 5% (p < 0.05, n = 3). Ethanol concentrations of 0.25 and 2.5 mm decreased PAI-1 mRNA levels by 40 ± 5 and 65 ± 6%, respectively (p < 0.05 for both,n = 3) in the presence of isoproterenol. Interestingly, higher concentrations of ethanol (i.e. 25 mm) produced no further decrease in PAI-1 mRNA levels in the presence of isoproterenol compared with that of isoproterenol alone (32 ± 4% versus 28 ± 5%, p > 0.05,n = 3). The effects of ethanol on t-PA expression are almost completely the opposite effects of ethanol on PAI-1 expression. These findings suggest that the effects of low concentrations of ethanol favor fibrinolysis by increasing the ratio of t-PA to PAI-1 levels. Nuclear run-on assays showed that ethanol (2.5 mm, 12 h) alone did not affect t-PA gene transcription relative to that of β-tubulin (Fig. 2). Stimulation of untreated endothelial cells with isoproterenol (100 nm) increased t-PA gene transcription by 2.2-fold relative to that of β-tubulin (p < 0.05, n = 2). In endothelial cells treated with ethanol (2.5 mm) and stimulated with isoproterenol (100 nm), t-PA gene transcription was increased by 3.4-fold compared with untreated control cells (p < 0.1) and increased by 2.8-fold compared with ethanol treatment alone (p < 0.05). These findings are consistent with changes in t-PA mRNA expression and suggest that low concentrations of alcohol augment isoproterenol-stimulated t-PA gene transcription but, by itself, have very little, if any, effects. Preliminary studies using different amounts of radiolabeled RNA transcripts demonstrate that under our experimental conditions, hybridization was linear and nonsaturable. The density of each t-PA band was standardized to the density of its corresponding β-tubulin band (relative intensity). The specificity of each band was determined by the lack of hybridization to the nonspecific pGEM cDNA vector. Because isoproterenol stimulated an increase in t-PA gene transcription and mRNA expression is dependent upon coupling to specific G-proteins, particularly Gαs, we investigated whether low concentrations of alcohol affect G-protein expression. Treatment of endothelial cells with ethanol (0–50 mm, 12 h) did not affect the protein levels of Gαs or Gαi2 (Fig. 3). Furthermore, stimulation of endothelial cells with the β2-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol (100 nm), or the α2-adrenergic agonist, UK14304 (10 nm), had no effect on Gαs and Gαi2 expression, respectively (data not shown). The P4 (Gαi2) and RM/1 (Gαs) antisera were relatively specific because recognition of their respective α subunits could be blocked in the presence of excess decapeptides from which they were derived (20Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the amount of αq/11 and common β subunit as determined by the QL and SW/1 antisera, respectively, was also unaffected by treatment with ethanol (data not shown). The basal GTPase activity in human endothelial cell membrane was 2.5 ± 0.5 pmol/min/mg. Treatment with ethanol (0–25 mm, 12 h) had no effect on basal GTPase activity (Fig.4 A). Stimulation of untreated endothelial cells (control) with isoproterenol (100 nm) and UK14304 (10 nm) increased GTPase activity by 2.6- and 5.4-fold, respectively (6.5 ± 1.1 and 13.4 ± 0.7 pmol/min/mg,p < 0.01 compared with basal levels, n= 4). Compared with isoproterenol-stimulated untreated control cells, ethanol-treated endothelial cells show a progressive increase in isoproterenol-stimulated GTPase activity, resulting in a maximal 2.2-fold increase in isoproterenol-stimulated GTPase activity at an ethanol concentration of 2.5 mm (6.5 ± 1.1 to 14.5 ± 1.2 pmol/min/mg, p < 0.01,n = 4). In contrast, ethanol-treated endothelial cells showed a maximal 38 ± 5% decrease in UK14303-stimulated GTPase activity at an ethanol concentration of 2.5 mm (13.4 ± 0.7 to 8.3 ± 1.1 pmol/min/mg, p < 0.05,n = 4). Interestingly, higher ethanol concentrations (i.e. 25 mm) resulted in no further increase or decrease in isoproterenol- and UK14304-stimulated GTPase activity, respectively (11.7 ± 1.8 and 10.0 ± 2.1 pmol/min/mg, respectively, p > 0.05 for both, compared with GTPase values at ethanol concentration of 2.5 mm). In a time-dependent manner, ethanol (2.5 mm) increased isoproterenol-stimulated GTPase activity by 290 ± 22% and decreased UK14304-stimulated GTPase activity by 42 ± 7%, with maximal effects of both agonists occurring after 12 h of ethanol exposure (Fig. 4 B). Pretreatment with the COOH-terminal antisera to αs (RM/1) and αi2 (P4) abolished 91 ± 4% (7.2 ± 0.6 to 2.9 ± 0.3 pmol/min/mg) and 93 ± 5% (13.4 ± 1.1 to 3.3 ± 0.4 pmol/min/mg) of isoproterenol- and UK14304-stimulated GTPase activity, respectively (p > 0.05 for both, compared with basal unstimulated GTPase activity of 2.5 ± 0.5 pmol/min/mg) (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, pretreatment with the P4 antisera abolished < 10% of isoproterenol-stimulated GTPase activity, whereas the RM/1 antisera decreased <5% of UK14304-stimulated GTPase activity. Furthermore, isoproterenol- and UK14304-stimulated GTPase activity were completely blocked with propranolol (0.1 mm) and rauwolscine (1 μm), respectively (data not shown). To determine the effects of ethanol on specific G-protein α subunit GTP-binding activity, αs and αi2 from ethanol-treated membranes were radiolabeled with [35S]GTPγS and immunoprecipitated with specific antisera directed against αs and αi2subunits. Treatment with ethanol (0–25 mm, 12 h) alone did not significantly affect basal αs and αi2 GTP binding activity (p > 0.05 for both). Endothelial cells stimulated with isoproterenol (100 nm) and UK14304 (10 nm) have αsand αi2 GTP binding activity of 2.0 ± 0.3 and 17.1 ± 1.3 fmol/min/mg, respectively (Fig.5). Treatment with ethanol (0–25 mm, 12 h) caused a progressive increase in αs GTP binding activity with a maximal 2.9-fold increase (5.9 ± 0.7 fmol/min/mg, p < 0.05,n = 3) occurring at an ethanol concentration of 2.5 mm. In contrast, the same membrane from ethanol-treated cells exhibited a progressive decrease in αi2 GTP binding activity with a maximal 80 ± 5% decrease (3.5 ± 0.3 fmol/min/mg, p < 0.01, n = 3), also occurring at an ethanol concentration of 2.5 mm. To determine whether the effects of ethanol on Gαs and Gαi2 correlate with downstream effector activity (i.e. adenylyl cyclase), we measured intracellular cAMP levels in ethanol-treated endothelial cells. Treatment with ethanol (0–25 mm, 12 h) did not affect basal cAMP levels (Fig. 5). Stimulation with isoproterenol (100 nm) increased cAMP level from 2.7 ± 0.2 to 4.9 ± 0.3 pmol/500,000 cells (p < 0.05, n = 4) (Fig.6). This increase in isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP level was completely blocked by propranolol (2.9 ± 0.4 pmol/500,000 cells, p > 0.05 compared with basal levels). Endothelial cells treated with ethanol (2.5 mm, 12 h) showed a significant increase in isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP level (2.7 ± 0.2 to 8.2 ± 0.5 pmol/500,000 cells,p < 0.05). This increase represented a 2.5-fold increase in absolute isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP level (2.2 ± 0.2 to 5.5 ± 0.3 pmol/500,000 cells, p < 0.05). Interestingly, lower concentrations of ethanol (0.25 mm, 12 h) did not produce a significant increase in isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP level compared with untreated cells, and higher concentrations of ethanol (25 mm, 12 h) did not produce further increases in isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP level compared with cells treated with 2.5 mm ethanol. These findings are consistent with the effects of alcohol on t-PA expression and suggest that low concentrations of alcohol augment isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP-dependent t-PA gene transcription. The cAMP-dependent gene transcription involves transcription factors that bind to the cAMP response element (CRE) of target genes (26Sloan L.S. Schepartz A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7113-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To determine whether increases in cAMP levels produced by low concentrations of ethanol are sufficient to transactivate promoters containing CRE, we transfected endothelial cells with a heterologous luciferase reporter construct containing four tandem CREs (p.CRE-Luc). Treatment of transfected endothelial cells with isoproterenol (100 nm, 12 h) or 8-bromo-cAMP (10 μm, 12 h) increased p.CRE-Luc activity by 3.7- and 3.3-fold, respectively (p < 0.05 for both,n = 3) (data not shown). Treatment of transfected endothelial cells with ethanol (0–50 mm, 12 h) alone did not affect basal p.CRE-Luc activity. However, stimulation of ethanol-treated transfected cells with isoproterenol (100 nm) augmented p.CRE-Luc activity compared with that of isoproterenol alone (Fig.7 A). The maximal isoproterenol-stimulated p.CRE-Luc activity in ethanol-treated cells was 6.9- and 2.1-fold higher than that of untreated and isoproterenol-stimulated control cells, respectively, and occurred at an ethanol concentration of 2.5 mm. Higher concentrations of ethanol (25–50 mm, 12 h) resulted in reductions in isoproterenol-stimulated p.CRE-Luc activity. In a time-dependent manner, ethanol (2.5 mm) augmented isoproterenol-stimulated p.CRE-Luc activity compared with that of untreated endothelial cells (5.6-fold versus3.5-fold, respectively, p < 0.05) (Fig.7 B). The increase in isoproterenol-stimulated p.CRE-Luc activity occurred after 12 h of ethanol exposure, and this time point is consistent with the maximal increase in isoproterenol-stimulated Gαs GTPase activity. We have shown that alcohol concentrations corresponding to moderate ingestion (i.e <10 mm) augment agonist-stimulated endothelial t-PA gene transcription via G-protein-mediated cAMPdependent pathway. Furthermore, these effects of alcohol were associated with a reciprocal decrease in agonist-stimulated PAI-1 expression. Higher concentrations of alcohol (≥25 mm), however, did not produce further increases in intracellular cAMP levels, but instead, decreased isoproterenol-stimulated GTPase activity and t-PA expression and increased PAI-1 expression. Interestingly, treatment with alcohol alone did not affect basal G-protein activity, intracellular cAMP level, p.CRE-Luc activity, or t-PA gene transcription and expression. These findings are in contrast to previous studies showing that alcohol decreased Gαsexpression and adenylyl cyclase activity in brain tissues (17Mochly-Rosen D. Chang F.H. Cheever L. Kim M. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Nature. 1988; 333: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Rabin R.A. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1148-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in these previous studies, higher concentrations of alcohol were used for a much longer duration. Our results, therefore, indicate that alcohol at concentrations associated with moderate ingestion augments β2-adrenergic receptor-stimulated intracellular cAMP level and t-PA gene transcription. The effect of alcohol on isoproterenol-stimulated Gαsactivity is rather specific because alcohol concomitantly down-regulated UK14304-stimulated GTPase activity. Because the α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, UK14304, is predominantly coupled to Gαi2 in vascular endothelial cells (28Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19528-19533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that alcohol differentially modulates Gαsand Gαi2 activity. Because there were no observable changes in the amounts of Gαs and Gαi2, our results also indicate that alcohol modulates G-protein function rather than expression. Specificity in receptor-G-protein coupling was confirmed by [35S]GTPγS binding of specific G-protein α subunits and with studies using carboxyl-terminal-directed antibodies to Gαs and Gαi2 that specifically blocked isoproterenol- and UK14304-stimulated GTPase activity, respectively. Thus, the net effects of alcohol on Gαs and Gαi2 activity is to favor receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. However, there was no direct stimulatory effect of alcohol on adenylyl cyclase activity, because alcohol alone was unable to increase intracellular cAMP level. The regulation of gene transcription by cAMP is mediated bytrans-acting factors, which bind to CRE (5′-ATGACGTCAT-3′) of target genes (26Sloan L.S. Schepartz A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7113-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the consensus sequence for CRE is not present in the t-PA promoter, a functional CRE-like element has been identified that acts synergistically with a putative activator protein-2 binding site to induced t-PA gene transcription by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (29Medcalf R.L. Schleuning W.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous studies have shown that cholera toxin and dibutyryl-cAMP can directly induce t-PA gene transcription in rat hepatocytes (13Uno S. Nakamura M. Ohomagari Y. Matsuyama S. Seki T. Ariga T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although in HeLa cells, the activation of cAMP-dependent transcription factor(s) alone is not sufficient to transactivate the t-PA promoter (14Wigler M. Weinstein I.B. Nature. 1976; 259: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 29Medcalf R.L. Schleuning W.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These studies, therefore, suggest that other cis-acting element(s) may play an important role in transactivating the t-PA promoter. Interestingly, a recent study by Grenett et al. (30Grenett H.E. Aikens M.L. Torres J.A. Demissie S. Tabengwa E.M. Davis G.C. Booyse G.M. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1998; 22: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that alcohol alone can increase t-PA gene transcription. Although we did not observe an increase in t-PA gene transcription and expression with alcohol alone, there are subtle differences between the two studies. In contrast to the previous study, our study utilized lower concentrations of alcohol (i.e. 2.5 mm) for a longer duration (i.e. up to 24 h). Furthermore, our finding that alcohol alone does not increase t-PA gene transcription is consistent with the other findings of this study showing that alcohol alone does not stimulate Gαs activity, cAMP production, or CRE promoter activity. The precise mechanism by which alcohol alters membrane signal transduction and increases t-PA expression is not known. Previous studies have shown that high concentrations of alcohol (i.e.100 mm) increase α2-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor expression in a neuronal NG108–15 cells (31Hu G. Querimit L.A. Downing L.A. Charness M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23441-23447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that alcohol may have induced similar changes in β2-adrenergic receptor affinity and density in our study, these effects of alcohol, however, are unlikely given the relatively low concentrations of alcohol used and the lack of significant changes in the EC50 (∼1 nm) of isoproterenol with respect to pCRE-Luc activity in alcohol-treated cells. It is also possible that with longer duration, alcohol, even at low concentrations, may ultimately induce changes in the level of Gαs and Gαi2. Indeed, chronic alcohol treatment, albeit at high concentrations, have been shown to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity via increasing Gαi and decreasing Gαs expression in neuronal cells (17Mochly-Rosen D. Chang F.H. Cheever L. Kim M. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. Nature. 1988; 333: 848-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Wand G.S. Diehl A.M. Levine M.A. Wolfgang D. Samy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2595-2601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions of our study, however, the observed changes in isoproterenol-stimulated G-protein activity, cAMP levels, and t-PA gene expression occurred in the absence of significant changes in endothelial Gαs and Gαi2 expression. The etiology of acute coronary syndromes is thought to be because of plaque rupture with ensuing vascular thrombosis and occlusion (4Libby P. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). The degree of vascular thrombosis and thrombolysis is regulated, in part, by the level of t-PA and PAI-1. Recent epidemiology studies suggest that moderate alcohol consumption (i.e. 1–2 drinks/day) is associated with higher serum t-PA levels and lower incidence of myocardial infarctions (1Stampfer M.J. Colditz G.A. Willett W.C. Speizer F.E. Hennekens C.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 2Rimm E.B. Giovannucci E.L. Willett W.C. Colditz G.A. Ascherio A.

Lancet. 1993; 341: 1165-1168Abstract PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Because the ingestion of two glasses of wine with an alcoholic content of 4% represents an alcohol concentration of approximately 7 mm in vivo(33Ramanathan R. Wilkemeyer M.F. Mittal B. Perides G. Charness M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that alcohol may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by augmenting t-PA level and inhibiting PAI-1 expression. Both of these effects of alcohol would enhance the fibrinolytic activity in the vessel wall. In summary, we have provided a potential mechanism by which low concentrations of alcohol may protect against atherosclerotic heart disease. Because alcohol alone does not induce, but rather, augments agonist-stimulated t-PA gene transcription via Gαs-mediated cAMP-dependent pathway, we speculate that moderate alcohol consumption may be more beneficial in terms of t-PA production in active individuals with frequent elevations in catecholamine levels. Consequently, β-blocker therapy, which is beneficial in cardiac ischemia, may paradoxically diminish some of the antithrombotic effects of alcohol on the vessel wall. We propose that low but not high concentrations of alcohol up-regulate agonist-stimulated cAMP and t-PA expression through differential effects on Gαs and Gαi2 activity. It remains to be determined, however, the mechanism by which alcohol modulates the activities of specific G proteins. We thank S. Degen and D. Luskatoff for providing the human t-PA and PAI-1 cDNA."

Molecular analysis of structures within the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain that are mediators of insulin-stimulated signal transduction pathways has provided one strategy for the study of insulin-sensitive intracellular signaling. The usual approach has been to create mutations within specific receptor sequences that result in the selective disruption of some insulin-regulated pathways, while leaving others intact. Deletion mutagenesis of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain has generated insulin receptors with altered biological properties (1White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Ullrich A.

Most mutations of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain that altered autophosphorylation sites within the cytoplasmic domain (5Tornqvist H.E. Pierce M.W. Frackelton A.R. Nemenoff R.A. Pierce M.W.

Previously, structure/function analysis required the introduction of mutated insulin receptors into cells expressing low levels of endogenous insulin receptors, e.g. Chinese hamster ovary or Rat-1 fibroblast cell lines (for a review, see Ref. 9Tavaré J.M. Siddle K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 1993; 1178: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to minimize the background signal generated by insulin activation of endogenous receptors. However, the relative insensitivity of fibroblast cell lines to insulin treatment has made them less than ideal models for studying the action of insulin on intermediary metabolism. Conversely, insulin-responsive cell types are excellent systems in which to study insulin action, but the fact that they express large numbers of endogenous insulin receptors is an impediment to the expression and analysis of mutated recombinant insulin receptors. To circumvent this concern, the extracellular ligand binding domain of the human CSF-11 receptor (10Coussens L. Van Beveren C. Smith D. Chen E. Mitchell R.L. Isacke C.M. Verma I.M. Ullrich A.

In the experiments presented here we examined the signaling properties of a CSF1R/IR construct bearing a single mutation of the tyrosine at the position corresponding to Tyr960 of the normal human insulin receptor to alanine. Our data demonstrate that the Ala960 mutation partially inhibits the ability of the CSF1R/IR to stimulate glucose uptake and blocks the ability of the chimera to stimulate the phosphorylation of IRS-1 but not IRS-2. Despite the ability of the CSF1R/IRA960 to phosphorylate IRS-2, co-precipitation studies indicate that the Ala960 mutation decreases the ability of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain to interact with IRS-2. 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IR were described previously (14Chaika O.V.

Ashmun R.A. Downing J.R. Ohtsuka M. Quan S.G. Golde D.W. Roussel M.F. Blood. 1989; 73: 1786-1793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Oncogene Science) and fluorescent secondary antibody. Flow cytometry was performed by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Where indicated, 2 × 104 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated/35-mm dish and grown to quiescence, and differentiation was induced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as described previously (14Chaika O.V.

Cells were used 14 days after induction of differentiation. Glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was measured using a modification of the method described previously (21Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 14 days after induction of differentiation, at which time >90% of the cells expressed an adipocyte phenotype. Cell monolayers were washed twice with buffer A (130 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4,8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.68 mmCaCl2,0.49 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of serum-free DMEM. To determine nonspecific glucose uptake, the cells were treated for 10 min in serum-free DMEM containing 20 μm cytochalasin B and 200 μm phloretin. Cell monolayers were washed once with 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer's phosphate buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) with or without CSF-1 or insulin as indicated and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of the same buffer. The glucose uptake assay was initiated by replacement of Krebs-Ringer's phosphate buffer in each well with Krebs-Ringer's phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mm2-deoxy-d[2,6-3H]glucose (1 μCi) for 10 min at 37 °C. Termination of glucose uptake was performed by the rapid removal of assay buffer followed by four rapid washes of each well with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A containing 500 μm phloretin. Cells were removed from each well with 0.4 ml of 0.1% SDS and counted for radioactivity after the addition of 4 ml of Optifluor (Packard Instrument Co). The incorporation of glucose into glycogen was measured as described previously (22Hess S.L. Suchin C.R. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fully differentiated adipocytes in 2-cm wells were serum-starved for 3 h in DMEM with 5.5 mm glucose and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were washed in glycogen assay buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1.7 mm KCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 1.47 mm K2HPO4, 0.9 mmMgSO4, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), stimulated with the indicated concentrations of hormones for 20 min, and incubated withd-[U-14C] glucose (1 μCi/ml, final specific activity 0.26 μCi/μmol) for 30 min. Incubations were stopped by 3 rapid washes on ice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH. Carrier glycogen (1 mg) was added, and the samples were boiled for 30 min. Glycogen was precipitated with 70% ethanol overnight at −20 °C. Each sample was centrifuged at 2100 × g, washed once with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in water. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into glycogen was determined by scintillation counting. Quiescent cells were stimulated with 10 nm CSF-1 for 10 min or left untreated, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and lysed in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmNaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmsodium inorganic pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the clarified lysates were incubated with appropriate antibodies. Proteins precipitated with the indicated antibodies were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 6% gel, electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20H conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1500), monoclonal antibody CT-1 (1:5000), or with anti-IRS-1 (1:800), anti-IRS-2 (1:1000), or Ca-1 (1:2000) polyclonal antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG followed by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 35-mm culture dishes were serum-starved for 5 h in DMEM before hormone stimulation. Cells were then stimulated with 10 nmCSF-1 or 100 nm insulin for 2 min. The media was aspirated, and the cell monolayers were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmNa3VO4. The proteins were solubilized for 10 min in lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium inorganic pyrophosphate, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 1% Triton X-100. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with the indicated antisera or antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (25 μl) was added to each immune complex, and incubation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with each of the three following buffers: (a) phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, (b) 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and (c) 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4. The pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of 30 mm HEPES, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm EGTA. The kinase reactions were started by the addition of 15 μl of sonicated substrate (0.6 mg/ml PI in 30 mm HEPES and 0.4 mm EGTA) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol)/tube. After mixing for 10 min at room temperature, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 14 μl of 6 nHCl and then extracted with 130 μl of methanol:chloroform (1:1). The samples were briefly separated by centrifugation, and the lower organic phase (20 μl) was spotted on silica gel 6OA plates (Merck) that had been pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate at 100 °C. The plates were developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (35:15:13:12:8), dried, and detected by autoradiography. Phosphorylated PI was quantified with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Quiescent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR and the CSF1R/IRA960 were incubated in the presence or absence of CSF-1, and aliquots of cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with Ca-1 antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor. Treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR chimera with CSF-1 for 10 min resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 170-kDa chimeric receptor protein (Fig. 1, 2ndlane). The same treatment of 3T3-L1 cells expressing the CSF1R/IRA960 chimera resulted in a slightly reduced extent of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the mutant receptor (Fig. 1, 4thlane) compared with the intact chimeric receptor, which is consistent with prior studies (8Feener E.P. Backer J.M. King G.L. Wilden P.A. Sun X.J. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11256-11264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intact and mutated chimera were expressed equally, as determined by Western blot with Ca-1 antibody (Fig. 1). The same effect of CSF-1 on phosphorylation of the CSF1R/IR and CSF1R/IRA960 was observed in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes results in an increase in expression of the GLUT4 and in an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose transport (23James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 338: 83-87Crossref Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 24Czech M.P. Clancy B.M. Pessino A. Woon C.-W. Harrison S.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 197-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes or 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing CSF1R/IR were treated for 20 min with a maximally effective insulin concentration (100 nm) or with CSF-1 at the indicated concentrations before the addition of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (Fig.2). After 10 min, the 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake was measured by scintillation counting. Insulin stimulated an 8–10-fold increase in 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2). Tyrosine autophosphorylation of the CSF1R/IR is maximal at 10 nm and half-maximal at 1 nm CSF-1 (14Chaika O.V. Chaika N. Volle D.J. Wilden P.A. Pirrucello S.J. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11968-11974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR were able to increase 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake approximately 7.5-fold in response to 10 nm CSF-1 and to a slightly lesser extent when 1 nm CSF-1 was used (Fig. 2). In contrast, 10 nm CSF-1 had no effect on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 control adipocytes (Fig. 2). These data suggest that physiological concentrations CSF-1 are able to activate the CSF1R/IR and stimulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Tyr960 in the insulin receptor juxtamembrane domain is essential for the ability of the receptor kinase to phosphorylate IRS-1 and couple to downstream effectors (1White M.F. Livingston J.N. Backer J.M. Lauris V. Ullrich A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 641-649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,25Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Tobe K. Ueki K. Yachi M. Akanuma Y. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3437-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The tyrosine in the CSF1R/IR corresponding to Tyr960in the insulin receptor was changed to alanine, and the resulting CSF1R/IRA960 chimera was tested for its ability to stimulate glucose uptake upon stimulation with different doses of CSF-1. CSF-1 was equipotent to insulin in its ability to stimulate maximal glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR (Fig.3 A). At submaximal concentrations, CSF-1 appears more potent than insulin in its ability to stimulate glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis (Fig. 3). This may result from the fact that the expression of CSF1R/IR is slightly higher than endogenous insulin receptors in the transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). In adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IRA960, glucose uptake in response to 100 nm CSF-1 was no greater than that observed when the same cells were treated with 1 nm insulin (Fig. 3 A). However, glucose uptake stimulated by 1 nm and 10 nm CSF-1 was unaffected by the Ala960 mutation (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether the mutation of Tyr960 inhibited only the ability of the chimera to stimulate maximal glucose uptake, we examined glycogen synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR and CSF1R/IRA960. In cells expressing the CSF1R/IR, glycogen synthesis stimulated by CSF-1 resembled the dose-dependent increases in synthesis observed with insulin (Fig. 3 B). As seen with glucose uptake, however, CSF-1 was unable to stimulate maximal glycogen synthesis in cells expressing the CSF1R/IRA960 above the level of synthesis observed with 1 nm insulin (Fig.3 B). The ability of the Ala960 mutation to blunt but not abolish CSF-1-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IRA960 indicated that the juxtamembrane mutation did not completely uncouple the CSF1R/IR from downstream effectors that regulate these biological activities. IRS-1 is readily detectable in adipocytes (26Sun X.J. Pons S. Wang L.M. Zhang Y.T. Yenush L. Burks D. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) permitting examination of the ability of the CSF1R/IR and CSF1R/IRA960 to tyrosine-phosphorylate this endogenous substrate of the insulin receptor kinase. Cells were left untreated or treated with CSF-1 and lysed, and IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. CSF-1 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in adipocytes expressing the intact CSF1R/IR (Fig. 4). Consistent with previous studies (27Backer J.M. Schroeder G.G. Cahill D.A. Ullrich A. Siddle K. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6366-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), substitution of Tyr960 with alanine-blocked CSF-1 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IRA960 (Fig. 4). Stripping and reprobing of the blot verified that equivalent amounts of IRS-1 were present in each immunoprecipitate from each cell line (Fig. 4,middle panel). In contrast, CSF-1-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IRA960 were comparable with 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR in their ability to phosphorylate IRS-2 (Fig.4). Stripping and reprobing of the blot also revealed comparable levels of expression of IRS-2 in each immunoprecipitate from each cell line (Fig. 4). A second tyrosine-phosphorylated protein co-precipitated with IRS-2 from CSF-1-treated cells (Fig. 4). To determine the identity of this protein, the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRA960 were left untreated or treated with 10 nm CSF-1, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to IRS-2 or to the carboxyl terminus of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain (CT-1). IRS-2 was phosphorylated in CSF-1-treated cells expressing the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRA960. However, the second tyrosine-phosphorylated protein co-precipitated with IRS-2 in cells expressing the CSF1R/IR but did not co-precipitate with IRS-2 in cells expressing the CSF1R/IRA960 (Fig.5). Reprobing of the blots with CT-1 antibody revealed that the CSF1R/IR, but not the CSF1R/IRA960, coprecipitated with phosphorylated IRS-2 protein. PI 3′ kinase is activated by the insulin receptor via association with tyrosine-phosphorylated intermediate proteins including IRS-1 (28Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of the juxtamembrane Tyr960 in downstream signaling by the insulin receptor, we examined the ability of the CSF1R/IRA960 to activate PI 3′ kinase associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2 or with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRA960 were serum-deprived for 5 h and then treated with 10 nm CSF-1 or with 100 nm insulin for 2 min. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to IRS-1, IRS-2, or phosphotyrosine. In adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IR, insulin and CSF-1 stimulated PI 3′ kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates as well as in anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6). In contrast, CSF-1 was unable to stimulate PI 3′ kinase in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IRA960 (Fig.6). CSF-1 stimulated PI 3′ kinase activity in anti-IRS-2 and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from adipocytes expressing the CSF1R/IRA960 (Fig. 6), consistent with its ability to stimulate the phosphorylation of IRS-2. These data demonstrate that the juxtamembrane phosphorylation site Tyr960 within the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain is an essential determinant for the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 but not for the phosphorylation of IRS-2 by the insulin receptor kinase (Fig.4). Phosphorylation of IRS-2 by the CSF1R/IRA960 is functional as it stimulates the activation of PI 3′ kinase bound to IRS-2 (Fig. 6). The Ala960 mutation blocks the ability of the chimeric CSF1R/IR to maximally stimulate glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis but does not impair stimulation of glucose transport by submaximal amounts of CSF-1 (Fig. 3). If IRS-2 is capable of mediating insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (29Zhou L. Chen H. Lin C.H. Cong L.N. McGibbon M.A. Sciacchitano S. Lesniak M.A. Quon M.J. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29829-29833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), then these data suggest that interaction of IRS-2 with the insulin receptor juxtamembrane domain may not be a required event to induce glucose uptake. The ability of the CSF1R/IRA960 to phosphorylate IRS-2 and to stimulate glucose transport may explain why ectopic expression of IRS-1 domains that interact with the insulin receptor juxtamembrane domain were able to block insulin-stimulated mitogenic effects mediated by IRS-1 but did not inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation or glucose transport (30Morris A.J. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Gustafson T.A. Mueckler M. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The data presented here demonstrate that competitive inhibition of interaction with the juxtamembrane domain is not required for tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2. These data also suggest an important but not exclusive role for Tyr960 and IRS-1 in signaling by the insulin receptor kinase (14Chaika O.V. Chaika N. Volle D.J. Wilden P.A. Pirrucello S.J. Lewis R.E.

The conclusion that other mechanisms, in addition to the phosphorylation of IRS-1, specifically contribute to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is consistent with several forms of evidence. Microinjection of antibodies and peptides or the exogenous expression of IRS-1 domains disrupt protein interaction with the insulin receptor juxtamembrane region (30Morris A.J. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Gustafson T.A. Mueckler M. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8401-8406Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Sharma P.M. Egawa K.

IRS-1−/−mice show mild resistance to insulin and impaired glucose tolerance (32Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakura H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H.

Adipocytes isolated from IRS-1−/− mice are impaired but not completely resistant to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (33Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.-E. Brüning J.C. Haag III, B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). IRS-2−/− mice also demonstrate peripheral insulin resistance, but the severity of the phenotype is compounded by a coinciding lack of pancreatic β-cell compensation (34Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y.T. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). The Ala960 mutation does appear to affect the interaction of the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain with IRS-2. Western blotting revealed that the CSF1R/IR co-precipitated with IRS-2, but the CSF1R/IRA960 was not detected in anti-IRS-2 immunoprecipitates. These data indicate that the juxtamembrane domain is a point of interaction between the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain and IRS-2 as demonstrated previously (35Sawka-Verhelle D.

The observation that IRS-2 is still tyrosine-phosphorylated upon activation of the CSF1R/IRA960 may emphasize the importance of additional domains of interaction between the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain and IRS-2. Recent observations that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are distributed differently in 3T3-L1 cells and that they translocate from intracellular membrane compartments to cytosol after insulin stimulation (37Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

Two-hybrid analyses (35Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 36He W.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that phosphorylation of Tyr624 and Tyr628 within the kinase regulatory loop binding domain of IRS-2 may inhibit interaction of this domain with the insulin receptor kinase (38Sawka-Verhelle D.

If these data are correct, then the phosphorylation-induced decrease in affinity between the insulin receptor and IRS-2 might explain the inability to co-precipitate IRS-2 and the CSF1R/IRA960 (Fig. 5).

The ability of the insulin receptor kinase to mediate diverse signals through distinct intracellular substrates may be determined not only by the phosphorylation state of the substrate but by the nature of the signaling complex formed upon interaction between the receptor and each substrate. The data presented here demonstrate the utility of the chimeric CSF1R/IR for probing the molecular details of the interactions between the insulin receptor kinase and its various intracellular effectors. We express our appreciation to K. Siddle for providing antibodies to the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain, to L. Sweet for providing antibodies against IRS-1, to J.
