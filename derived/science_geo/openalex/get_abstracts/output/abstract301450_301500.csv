https://openalex.org/W4232403897,"In the Northern Hemisphere the 18,000 B.P. world differed strikingly from the present in the huge land-based ice sheets, reaching approximately 3 km in thickness, and in a dramatic increase in the extent of pack ice and marine-based ice sheets. In the Southern Hemisphere the most striking contrast was the greater extent of sea ice. On land, grasslands, steppes, and deserts spread at the expense of forests. This change in vegetation, together with extensive areas of permanent ice and sandy outwash plains, caused an increase in global surface albedo over modern values. Sea level was lower by at least 85 m. The 18,000 B.P. oceans were characterized by: (i) marked steepening of thermal gradients along polar frontal systems, particularly in the North Atlantic and Antarctic; (ii) an equatorward displacement of polar frontal systems; (iii) general cooling of most surface waters, with a global average of -2.3 degrees C; (iv) increased cooling and up-welling along equatorial divergences in the Pacific and Atlantic; (v) low temperatures extending equatorward along the western coast of Africa, Australia, and South America, indicating increased upwelling and advection of cool waters; and (vi) nearly stable positions and temperatures of the central gyres in the subtropical Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2119620050,"Using the boundary conditions of seasurface temperature, ice sheet topography, and surface albedo assembled by CLIMAP for 18,000 B.P., the global ice-age July climate has been simulated with a two-level dynamical atmospheric model. Compared with the simulation for present July climate, the ice age is substantially cooler and drier over the unglaciated continental areas, with the maximum zonal westerlies in the Northern Hemisphere displaced southward in the vicinity of the ice sheets. The simulated changes of surface air temperature agree reasonably well with the estimates available from the analysis of fossil pollen and periglacial data, and are consistent with the simulated changes of other climatic variables. These results are generally supported by independent investigations with simpler models. In spite of this qualified success, further analysis of both simulated and verification data is needed to establish the details of ice-age climate, especially the precipitation regimes, and to document the role of eddy fluxes in maintaining the heat, momentum, and moisture balances of the ice-age general circulation. New paleoclimatic data bases for both July and January of 18,000 B.P. are being assembled by CLIMAP and will be used in new simulations of the seasonal ice-age climate."
https://openalex.org/W2060557113,"Organic chemists have begun to use intra- and intermolecular free-radical addition reactions to develop useful synthetic transformations. Carboncentered radicals can form bonds with electron-rich or electron-deficient alkenes, allenes, and acetylenes. Radical addition reactions can also be used to construct hindered carbon-carbon bonds. These characteristics, as well as the large number of functional groups that tolerate free-radical conditions contribute to the importance of such reactions in organic synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2086559993,"Alkanes, although plentiful enough to be considered for use as feedstocks in large-scale chemical processes, are so unreactive that relatively few chemical reagents have been developed to convert them to molecules having useful functional groups. However, a recently synthesized iridium (lr) complex successfully converts alkanes into hydridoalkylmetal complexes (M + R-H --> R-M-H). This is a dihydride having the formula Cp(*)(L)lrH(2), where Cp(*) and L are abbreviations for the ligands (CH(3))(5)C(5) and (CH(3))(3)P, respectively. Irradiation with ultraviolet light causes the dihydride to lose H(2), generating the reactive intermediate Cp(*)lrL. This intermediate reacts rapidly with C-H bonds in every molecule so far tested (including alkanes) and leads to hydridoalkyliridium complexes Cp(*)(L)lr(R)(H). Evidence has been obtained that this C-H insertion, or oxidative addition, reaction proceeds through a simple three-center transition state and does not involve organic free radicals as intermediates. Thus the intermediate Cp(*)lrL reacts most rapidly with C-H bonds having relatively high bond energies, such as those at primary carbon centers, in small organic rings, and in aromatic rings. This contrasts directly with the type of hydrogen-abstraction selectivity that is characteristic of organic radicals. The hydridoalkyliridium products of the insertion reactions can be converted into functionalized organic molecules-alkyl halides-by treatment with mercuric chloride followed by halogens. Expulsion (reductive elimination) of the hydrocarbon from the hydridoalkyliridium complexes can be induced by Lewis acids or heat, regenerating the reactive intermediate Cp(*)lrL. Oxidative addition of the corresponding rhodium complexes Cp(*)RhL to alkane C-H bonds has also been observed, although the products formed in this case are much less stable and undergo reductive elimination at -20 degrees C. These and other recent observations provide an incentive for reexamining the factors that have been assumed to control the rate of reaction of transition metal complexes with C-H bonds-notably the need for electron-rich metals and the proximity of reacting centers."
https://openalex.org/W2086214479,"Vesicles formed from dialkyl surfactants containing vinyl, methacrylate, diacetylene, isocyano, and styrene groups have been stabilized by polymerization across their bilayers of head groups. Polymerized vesicles have shelf lives of many months and controllable permeabilities and sizes. The kinetics of surfactant vesicle photopolymerization have been determined, and the mechanism of photopolymerization has been discussed as a two-dimensional surface process. Polymerized surfactant vesicles concentrate reagents in their aqueous interiors, in bilayers, and in their inner or outer surfaces. This, in turn, leads to altered reaction rates and sites. Polymerized surfactant vesicles also provide a good media for the generation, in situ, of small, uniform, and efficient colloidal catalysts."

Survival rates as high as 33 percent, determined by callus formation, growth, or chlorophyll formation, are reported; plant formation has been observed."
https://openalex.org/W2037832219,"Oxygen isotope analyses of planktonic foraminifera from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden indicate that during periods of maximum continental and polar glaciation in the late Pleistocene, the Red Sea was subject to strong evaporation. Between glacial maximums the salinity of the Red Sea was equal to or below that of the open ocean. This suggests that high-latitude glacial periods corresponded in time to interpluvial stages in the present-day desert belt of northern Africa, whereas high-latitude interglacial periods coincided with pluvial stages."
https://openalex.org/W1976072468,"Ground-based observation of atmospheric absorption of solar radiation at a wavelength of 2.6 millimeters has provided the first measurement of mesospheric carbon monoxide. The measurement agrees with photochemical predictions of a carbon monoxide source in the lower thermosphere due to dissociation of carbon dioxide by solar radiation, and has implications for the magnitude of vertical transport in the mesosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1994495663,"For many years iron has become less and less important for permanent magnets. Recently, however, Japanese and American researchers have brought back iron in a new compound which produces, perhaps, the best magnetic properties ever. The largest potential for this product is electric motors, which could have half the size and weight they do now. The paper gives chemical composition, crystal structures, and the history and development of this magnet. Other applications for its use are also given."
https://openalex.org/W1967282245,"Attachment of a transition metal moiety to an olefinic ligand presents the organic chemist with unequaled opportunities to control the regio- and stereospecificities of bond formation. Applications of cationic dienyliron-carbonyl complexes to a range of natural product syntheses have been developed. These applications show how the iron-carbonyl unit directs the regio- and stereochemistry of nucleophile addition. They also show that the iron-carbonyl unit can be used to stabilize otherwise inaccessible carbocations, thereby making them readily available as synthetic intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2035557312,"A detailed high-resolution geophysical study of part of the continental slope along the mid-Atlantic margin of the United States indicates that it is an ancient, relict landscape largely unmodified by modern slope processes. The slope morphology is heavily influenced by bedrock outcrops, including joints and bedding planes, rather than by any single degradational process. A pelagic drape averaging 3 to 5 meters in thickness blankets the slope. Carbon-14 dates from eight drop cores show that the drape was deposited in late Pleistocene and Holocene times. The Holocene part of the drape, comprising the uppermost 1 meter, was deposited at a continuous rate of 10 centimeters per 1000 years. Most features on the slope predate the drape cover."

The chronologies for the stratigraphic sequences of the settlements of Achilleion and Anza, based on a total of 37 La Jolla radiocarbon measurements, cover almost 1000 years."
