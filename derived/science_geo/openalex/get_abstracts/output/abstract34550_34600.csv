One or more components appear after induction by immunologic stimuli; two or more are present in both activated and non-activated macrophages. The constitutive factors can be separated on a Mr approximately 30,000 cut-off filter into high Mr fraction (HF) and low Mr fraction (LF) (Stuehr, D. J., Kwon, N. S., Gross, S. S., Thiel, B. A., Levi, R., and Nathan, C. F. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 161, 420-426). Herein we characterize the major active component in LF. The active component was dialyzable (Mr less than approximately 1,000), water soluble, and cationic at acidic to neutral pH. Fractionation on a C18 column in an acetonitrile/water gradient yielded one broad peak of activity, most of which corresponded to a fluorophore with the excitation/emission spectra of biopterins. Gas chromatography isolated a species in this peak with the mass spectrum of biopterin. Of 14 pteridines tested, only 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (H2biopterin) or 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4biopterin) could replace LF in synergizing with HF and the inducible component(s) to generate NO-2 and NO-3, the accumulating oxidation products of NO.. Half-maximal activity required 20-30 nM reduced biopterins. LFs from three cell lines were active in proportion to their content of biopterins; addition of reduced biopterins restored activity to LF from biopterin-deficient cells. Enhancement of NO-2 generation in the presence of H2biopterin but not H4biopterin was abolished by methotrexate and aminopterin, inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase. These findings implicate a redox cycle in which the generation of NO. is facilitated by catalytic amounts of H4biopterin."

https://openalex.org/W2145131343,"Incubation of a number of ferric ion chelates with H2O2 at pH 7.4 generated a reactive species able to produce chemical modifications of the bases in DNA that are very similar to those produced in DNA by the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system (Aruoma, O.I., Halliwell, B., and Dizdaroglu, M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 13024-13028). Products were identified and quantitated by the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring. Compared with other complexes used, ferric ion-nitrilotriacetic acid produced by far the largest amount of the base products. Typical hydroxyl radical scavengers and superoxide dismutase provided significant decreases in the yields of the products. On this basis, it is proposed that ferric ion complexes react with H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radical; this was also shown using the deoxyribose assay. Inhibition of product formation by superoxide dismutase suggests the involvement of superoxide radical in this reaction. It is likely that hydroxyl radical generated by reaction of the ferric ion-nitrilotriacetic acid complex with H2O2 contributes to the carcinogenicity and nephrotoxicity associated with this chelating agent."

https://openalex.org/W1578800727,"Abstract In view of the possible role of glycosphingolipids in defining the specificity of cell-cell interactions, the key molecules for recognition of cell surface glycosphingolipids have been studied. In addition to previously suggested recognition mechanisms involving endogenous lectins and glycosyltransferases, an alternative possibility, based on carbohydrate-carbohydrate (Lex-Lex) interaction, has been raised (Eggens, I., Fenderson, B., Toyokuni, T., Dean, B., Stroud, M., and Hakomori, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9476-9484). We now report a highly specific interaction between gangliotriaosylceramide (Gg3, GalNAc beta 1----4Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----Cer) and sialosyllactosylceramide (GM3, NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----Cer). The interaction requires a bivalent cation (Ca2+ or Mg2+) and can be inhibited by sialosyl 2----3 lactose, anti-GM3 antibody (DH2), anti-Gg3 antibody (2D4), or EDTA. The strength of interaction between GM3 liposome and the Gg3-coated plastic surface was highly density-dependent. The mouse lymphoma L5178 AA12 cell line (high expressor of Gg3) interacted specifically with the mouse B16 melanoma cell line (high expressor of GM3). The interaction was inhibited by 5 mM sialosyllactose, anti-GM3 antibody, anti-Gg3 antibody, and EDTA in analogy to GM3-Gg3 interaction. L5178 AV27, a genetically related variant clone which does not express Gg3, showed no interaction with B16 cells. Untreated AA12 cells, but not 2D4-treated AA12 cells or AV27 cells, interacted with GM3 coated on the plastic surface. These findings suggest a specific interaction between AA12 cells and B16 cells based on Gg3-GM3 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1615296956,"Abstract A unique protein that promotes ectopic osteoinduction in the rat has been isolated and characterized. Osteoinductive factor (OIF) was extracted from the organic matrix of bovine bone with 4 M guanidine HCl and purified by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. OIF is a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 22-28 kDa based on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Enzymatic or chemical deglycosylation of OIF reduces its mass to about 12 kDa with apparent loss of activity. OIF activity in the model used is substantially increased by addition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1 or TGF-beta 2, suggesting an important role for TGF-beta 1 and -2 in bone regeneration and repair. The N-terminal sequence of OIF has no homology to other reported proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1557792852,"Abstract We demonstrate that the gene encoding an extracellular matrix component contains two widely separated promoters controlling the generation of different transcripts in a tissue-specific fashion. Two transcription start sites, about 20 kilobase pairs apart, in the alpha 1(IX) collagen gene are utilized to generate different forms of a collagen-proteoglycan (collagen IX) in chicken cartilage and cornea. Transcripts from the upstream site encode a large (266 amino acid residues) globular domain at the amino terminus of alpha 1(IX) chains, whereas the transcripts from the downstream site encode chains that lack this globular domain and contain a short alternative sequence. Transcripts from the upstream site are predominantly present in cartilage, and transcripts from the downstream site are predominantly used in cornea. The structural differences in collagen IX molecules that are synthesized as a consequence of the use of these two alternative transcription start sites in the alpha 1(IX) gene are likely to contribute to the differences in the macromolecular organization of the extracellular matrix in cartilage and cornea. Our finding provides a novel clue to answering the general question of what mechanisms are used to generate unique fibrillar patterns in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1677984464,"Abstract We have translated the rat glucocorticoid receptor in both reticulocyte lysate and in wheat germ extract. Receptor synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate is immunoadsorbed by the 8D3 monoclonal antibody directed against the 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) and it has a normal ability to bind glucocorticoid in a high affinity manner. Although the wheat germ extract synthesizes the full length receptor, the receptor is not immunoadsorbed by 8D3 and we cannot demonstrate high affinity steroid binding. Receptor synthesized by the reticulocyte lysate can be immunoadsorbed by antibody directed against hsp90 as soon as the translation product is full length, suggesting that the receptor becomes associated with hsp90 late during translation or immediately at the termination of translation. When newly synthesized receptor is bound with steroid and incubated at 25 degrees C, it is converted to a form that binds to DNA. This study provides direct evidence that association of hsp90 with the glucocorticoid receptor is a very early event and that the newly formed heteromeric receptor-hsp90 complex is fully competent to undergo transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1518614162,"As an extension of our previous reports that cardiac and skeletal muscle troponin I (Tn-I) and troponin T (Tn-T) are excellent substrates for protein kinase C (PKC) (Katoh, N., Wise, B. C., and Kuo, J. F. (1983) Biochem. J. 209, 189-195; Mazzei, G. J., and Kuo, J. F. (1984) Biochem. J. 218, 361-369), we have now determined that PKC phosphorylated serine 43 (and/or serine 45), serine 78, and threonine 144 in the free Tn-I subunit and threonine 190, threonine 199, and threonine 280 in the free Tn-T subunit of bovine cardiac troponin. PKC appeared to phosphorylate the same sites of the subunits present in the form of the troponin complex, as indicated by the similarity in the two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps. Although some of the phosphorylation sites were shared by other classes of protein kinases, PKC exhibited a distinct substrate specificity. It was also noted that phosphorylated serine and threonine residues in Tn-I and Tn-T had neighboring basic amino acid residues separated by 1 or 2 other residues both at the amino and carboxyl termini, in agreement with the conclusion of House et al. (House, C., Wettenhall, R. E. H., and Kemp, B. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 772-777) based upon their studies on other substrate proteins. Several peptides having sequences around the phosphorylating sites have been synthesized. The phosphorylation experiments indicated that these peptides were substrates for PKC, and their relative substrate activity (determined by the ratios of Vmax/Km) compared with other proteins, in descending order, was Tn-I = Tn-I(134-154) greater than Tn-T much greater than histone H1 greater than Tn-I(33-35) approximately Tn-T(268-284) greater than Tn-T(179-198) approximately Tn-T(191-209). It is suggested that PKC phosphorylation of Tn-I and Tn-T could be biologically significant in terms of possible modifications in interactions among the individual contractile protein components as well as the Ca2+ sensitivity and activity of actomyosin ATPase."

https://openalex.org/W1578135150,"Chiral analysis of the endogenous rat liver epoxyeicosatrienoic acids shows the biosynthesis of 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in a 4:1, 2:1, and 3:1 ratio of antipodes, respectively. Animal treatment with phenobarbital results in a 3.7-fold increase in microsomal cytochrome P-450 concentration and a concomitant, regioselective 6.8- and 3.4-fold increase in the liver concentration of 8,9- and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, respectively. Phenobarbital induces the in vivo synthesis of both regioisomers as nearly optically pure enantiomers. These results demonstrate the enzymatic origin of the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids present in rat liver and document a novel metabolic function for cytochrome P-450 in the regio- and enatioselective epoxygenation of endogenous pools of arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1611526307,"17-Ketosteroid reductase (17KSR), also known as 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, catalyzes the reversible interconversion of estradiol to estrone and of androstenedione to testosterone. Using a recently cloned human placental 17KSR cDNA, we show that the 1.4-kilobase mRNA for this enzyme is detected only in tissues producing estrogens, and a 2.4-kilobase mRNA is detected in some estrogenic tissues and some androgenic tissues. This tissue distribution suggests that the interconversion of androstenedione and testosterone may be mediated by a different enzyme. Southern blotting studies show that the mRNA for this estrogenic 17KSR is encoded by two very similar genes localized to chromosome 17cen----q25 by analysis of DNA from mouse/human somatic hybrid cell lines. 8-Br-cAMP increases the abundance of estrogenic 17KSR mRNA as well as mRNAs for other steroidogenic enzymes in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. By contrast, cAMP decreases estrogenic 17KSR mRNA in primary cultures of human cytotrophoblasts and human granulosa cells, a pattern of tropic regulation that differs from other steroidogenic enzyme mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1524948665,"Abstract The membrane-binding characteristics of a number of modified vitamin K-dependent proteins and peptides showed a general pattern of structural requirements. The amino-terminal peptides from human prothrombin (residues 1-41 and 1-44, 60:40) bovine factor X (residues 1-44), and bovine factor IX (residues 1-42), showed a general requirement for a free amino-terminal group, an intact disulfide, and the tyrosine homologous to Tyr44 of factor X for membrane binding. Consequently, the peptide from factor IX did not bind to membranes. Any of several modifications of the amino terminus, except reaction with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, abolished membrane binding by the factor X and prothrombin peptides. Calcium, but not magnesium, protected the amino terminus from chemical modification. The requirement for a free amino terminus was also shown to be true for intact prothrombin fragment 1, factor X, and factor IX. Although aggregation of the peptide-vesicle complexes greatly complicated accurate estimation of equilibrium binding constants, results with the factor X peptide indicated an affinity that was not greatly different from that of the parent protein. The most striking difference shown by the peptides was a requirement for about 10 times as much calcium as the parent proteins. In a manner similar to the parent proteins, the prothrombin and factor X peptides showed a large calcium-dependent quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. This fluorescence quenching in the peptides also required about 10 times the calcium needed by the parent proteins. Thus, the 1-45 region of the vitamin K-dependent proteins contained most of the membrane-binding structure but lacked component(s) needed for high affinity calcium binding. Protein S that was modified by thrombin cleavage at Arg52 and Arg70 showed approximately the same behavior as the amino-terminal 45-residue peptides. That is, it bound to membranes with overall affinity that was similar to native protein S but required high calcium concentrations. These results suggested that the second disulfide loop of protein S (Cys47-Cys72) and prothrombin (Cys48-Cys61) were involved in high affinity calcium binding. Since factor X lacks a homologous disulfide loop, an alternative structure must serve a similar function. A striking property of protein S was dissociation from membranes by high calcium. While this property was shared by all the vitamin K-dependent proteins, protein S showed this most dramatically and supported protein-membrane binding by calcium bridging."
https://openalex.org/W178004509,"C62B rat glioma cells respond to muscarinic cholinergic stimulation with transient inositol phosphate formation and phospholipase A2-dependent arachidonic acid liberation. Since phospholipase A2 is a Ca2+-sensitive enzyme, we have examined the role of the agonist-stimulated Ca2+ response in production of the arachidonate signal. The fluorescent indicator fura-2 was used to monitor changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) of C62B cells following acetylcholine treatment. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, acetylcholine induces a biphasic [Ca2+]i response consisting of an initial transient peak that precedes arachidonate liberation and a sustained elevation that outlasts the phospholipase A2 response. The initial [Ca2+]i peak is not altered by the absence of external Ca2+ and therefore reflects intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. The sustained elevation phase is dependent on the influx of external Ca2+; it is lost in Ca2+-free medium and restored on the addition of Ca2+. Pretreating cells with phorbol dibutyrate substantially inhibits acetylcholine-stimulated inositol phosphate formation and the peak [Ca2+]i response without affecting the sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i. This suggests that the release of internal Ca2+ stores by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate can be blocked without interfering with Ca2+ influx. Pretreatment with phorbol also fails to affect acetylcholine-stimulated arachidonate liberation, demonstrating that phospholipase A2 activation does not require normal intracellular Ca2+ release. Stimulated arachidonate accumulation is totally inhibited in Ca2+-free medium and restored by the subsequent addition of Ca2+. Pretreatment with verapamil, a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel inhibitor, also blocks both the sustained [Ca2+]i elevation and arachidonate liberation without altering peak intracellular Ca2+ release. We conclude that the influx of extracellular Ca2+ is tightly coupled to phospholipase A2 activation, whereas large changes in [Ca2+]i due to mobilization of internal Ca2+ stores are neither sufficient nor necessary for acetylcholine-stimulated phospholipase A2 activation."
https://openalex.org/W1532949404,"Digestive brush-border enzymes in particulate form have been reported in the intestinal lumen in vivo and in medium from organ explants in vitro. It has been suggested that these particles derive from membrane shedding of the apical brush border. This study describes the isolation and characterization of particles derived from the 105,000 × g supernatant fraction of intestinal luminal washings and from light scrapings of the mucosa itself after fat feeding of rats. These fractions were separated in a continuous NaBr gradient, producing a visible band of 1.07-1.08 g/liter density and resulting in a 15-fold enrichment of intestinal alkaline phosphatase in the band fraction. Other brush-border hydrolases were represented in the banded fraction, but at specific activities only ⅕th to ⅟36th that of the brush border. The major phospholipid in the fraction was phosphatidylcholine (58 ± 15%), containing 75% saturated fatty acids. In contrast, the major brush-border phospholipid was phosphatidyl-ethanolamine. These characteristics showed that the particles derived from the lumen and mucosal surface were not identical to fragments of the brush border. Electron microscopy of the banded fraction revealed partially coiled membrane fragments. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blots, some proteins (e.g. surfactant protein B, collagenous protein 4) were found in common between the intestinal particles and rat pulmonary surfactant. These data suggest the production of a particle secreted by rat intestine that differs from brush-border membranes and that shares some morphological and biochemical similarities with pulmonary surfactant."

https://openalex.org/W1602149705,"Mammalian tissues and cell lines express two major types of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA-I and PKA-II, which can be distinguished at the molecular level by the presence of either type I or type II regulatory subunits in the holoenzyme. An expression vector for the mouse type II regulatory subunit (RII alpha) was transfected into ras-transformed NIH3T3 (R3T3) cells, which contain approximately equal amounts of both holoenzymes, PKA-I and PKA-II. In RII alpha-overexpressing R3T3 cells, PKA-II levels were increased, and the level of PKA-I declined. The decrease in PKA-I was dependent on the amount of RII alpha expressed, and at high levels of RII alpha expression, PKA-I was completely eliminated. In contrast, overexpression of the type I regulatory subunit (RI alpha) did not alter PKA isozyme levels. We propose that competition between RII alpha and RI alpha for a limited pool of catalytic subunit results in preferential assembly of PKA-II and that significant amounts of PKA-I are formed only if catalytic subunit is present in excess of the RII alpha subunit. The PKA-I isozyme, which is absent in untransformed 3T3 cells, is not essential for the transformed phenotype of R3T3 cells. RII alpha-overexpressing R3T3 cells that are devoid of PKA-I continued to exhibit a transformed phenotype including anchorage-independent growth. Overexpression of RII alpha provides a genetic approach that may prove useful in demonstrating specific functions for the two PKA isozymes in cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1530322280,"Isolated mouse osteoblasts that retain their osteogenic activity in culture were incubated with [35S] sulfate. Two radiolabeled proteins, in addition to proteoglycans, were extracted from the calcified matrix of osteoblast cultures. All the sulfate label in both proteins was in the form of tyrosine sulfate as assessed by amino acid analysis and thin layer chromatography following alkaline hydrolysis. The elution behavior on DEAE-Sephacel of the major sulfated protein and the apparent Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels were characteristic of bone sialoprotein II extracted from rat. This protein was shown to cross-react with an antiserum raised against bovine bone sialoprotein II, indicating that bone sialoprotein II synthesized by cultured mouse osteoblasts is a tyrosine-sulfated protein. The minor sulfated protein was tentatively identified as bone sialoprotein I or osteopontin based on its elution properties on DEAE-Sephacel and anomalous behavior on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels similar to those reported for rat bone sialoprotein I."
https://openalex.org/W1539098100,"The catalytic of subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is acylated at its NH2 terminus with myristic acid. This type of modification is thought to mediate the association of proteins with lipid bilayers, yet the catalytic subunit shows no preferential binding with membranes. We investigated the role of C subunit myristylation using a cDNA expression vector in which the acylated NH2-terminal Gly was mutagenized to Ala. Protein synthesized in NIH 3T3 cells from this modified gene did not incorporate [3H]myristate. However, the kinase activity of this altered C subunit on a synthetic substrate was not diminished, nor was its ability to form holoenzyme with regulatory subunit. Non-myristylated C subunit also regulated several biological processes occurring in specific subcellular compartments; mutant C subunit stimulated dramatic cell shape changes controlled by the cytoskeleton, restored steroidogenesis in the mitochondria of defective adrenocortical cells, and effectively induced the transcription of genes in the nucleus. These results suggest that myristylation is nonessential for C subunit conformation and enzyme activation, and is not required for C subunit interaction with other proteins in regions where C is thought to localize upon activation. The purpose for NH2-terminal myristylation of this important signal-transducing enzyme remains an enigma."
https://openalex.org/W1601807951,"The amino acid sequence of one of the major lysosomal membrane glycoproteins, lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (lamp-1), was deduced from its cDNA sequence (Fukuda, M., Viitala, J., Matteson, J., and Carlsson, S. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18920-18928). This amino acid sequence suggests that lamp-1 contains a hinge-like structure and could form disulfide bridges that are observed in the immunoglobulin superfamily. To test this possibility, we have determined the positions of the disulfide bridges by isolating and sequencing cystine-containing peptides which contain disulfide bridges. The results indicate that disulfide arrangement of lamp-1 is different from that of immunoglobulins. Each molecule contains, in total, four loops formed by disulfide bonds, and each loop contains 36-39 amino acid residues. However, none of the disulfide bonds connects two domains that are separated by a hinge-like structure. The results indicate that the hinge region has no ordered structure, and the relative positions of the two domains can be altered in space. Examination of the ultrastructure of lamp-1 by electron microscopy showed that the hinge-like structure actually functions as a hinge. These results indicate that the lamp-1 molecule represents a novel family of glycoproteins with unique structural properties."
https://openalex.org/W1605382755,"Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) metabolism has been studied in liver homogenates and in 100,000 x g supernatant and particulate fractions. When liver homogenates were incubated in an intracellular medium containing 5 mM MgATP, equal proportions of Ins(1,3,4)P3 were dephosphorylated and phosphorylated. Two inositol tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) products and an inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5) were detected. The InsP4 isomers were unequivocally identified as inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) and inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,6)P4) by high performance liquid chromatography separation of inositol phosphates, periodate oxidation, alkaline hydrolysis, and stereo-specific polyol dehydrogenase. Ins(1,3,4)P3 5-kinase is a novel enzyme activity and accounted for 16% of the total Ins(1,3,4)P3 phosphorylation. Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 was also shown to be further phosphorylated to inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5) by a kinase not previously known to occur in liver. About 75% of Ins(1,3,4)P3 kinase activities were soluble and were partly purified by anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. The two Ins(1,3,4)P3 kinase activities eluted as a single peak that was well resolved from Ins(1,3,4)P3 phosphatase, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 5-kinase, and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 5-phosphatase activities. A further novel observation was that 10 microM Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 inhibited Ins(1,3,4)P3 kinase activities by 60%."
https://openalex.org/W197557636,"Abstract The gene for the L-type pyruvate kinase possesses two promoters which are located 500 base pairs apart. The L promoter is specific to liver and regulated by hormones and diet; the L' promoter is specific to erythroid cells. We produced two series of transgenic mice carrying either the entire rat L-pyruvate kinase gene or a minigene devoid of exons two to nine, with 2.7 kilobases of flanking sequences 5' to the cap site of the L' promoter and 1.4 kilobases 3' to the downstream polyadenylation site. In both series the patterns of expression from the two promoters were similar to those of the endogenous rat gene. The rat L promoter was expressed strongly in liver and weakly in kidney and gut of adult transgenic mice. Moreover, it was regulated like the endogenous rat L-pyruvate kinase gene upon hormonal and nutritional adaptation: the level of L-pyruvate kinase mRNA was decreased dramatically by 24 h of starvation, while refeeding a carbohydrate-rich diet strongly stimulated expression of the transgenes. This stimulation was prevented by glucagon. Use of alternative polyadenylation sites in the last exon of the rat L-type pyruvate kinase gene was similar for both types of transgenes and similar to that in rat and not control mice, suggesting that the transgenes contain the sequences that control the choice of polyadenylation site. Transcription of the minigene was higher than that of the entire transgene, probably due to the high copy number of the minigene. At the protein level, rat L subunits encoded by the entire transgene were more abundant than mouse subunits in the liver of adult transgenic mice. In contrast, expression of the rat L' promoter in fetal liver was only 5% of that in fetal rat liver, and we were unable to detect rat L' subunits of pyruvate kinase enzyme in the red blood cells from transgenic mice. Our results suggest that the integrated DNA contains all elements necessary for tissue specificity (L' and L) as well as hormonal and nutritional control (L) of expression of the rat transgene. Nevertheless, a L'-specific activating element may be missing."
https://openalex.org/W1522672554,"We have recently cloned and characterized the promoter region of the gene encoding eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF-2α) to identify regulatory elements of this housekeeping gene. We compared the location of DNase I-hypersensitive (HS) sites with the distribution of protein-binding sites as revealed by footprint analysis. The eIF-2α promoter contains four upstream DNase I-HS sites extending from −650 to −40 base pairs and a fifth downstream site near the first intron-exon junction. In vitro DNase I footprint analysis shows eight distinct DNA-protein interactions organized into clusters that correspond well with the distribution of the five HS sites. None of the protected regions, however, shares obvious sequence homology with the binding sites of known regulatory factors. To initiate our analysis of factors required for eIF-2α expression, selected a CAP-proximal element shown by in vivo methylation protection analysis to bind a potential regulatory factor. A striking feature of this element is its palindrome sequences and eight-base pair direct repeats. We have purified to near homogeneity a 66-68-kDa protein that binds to this region and have designated it α-PAL. The α-PAL-binding site extends from −74 to −10. By methylation protection analysis and mobility shift assay, the α-PAL-binding site is shown to be two adjacent sites, one with high and one with lower affinity, which bind α-PAL in a noncooperative manner. When the high affinity binding site is cloned upstream of the adenovirus 2 core promoter, in vitro transcription is stimulated 2-3-fold. When linked to a CAT reporter gene, activity of the eIF-2α promoter shows an approximate 2-fold dependence on the α-PAL element."
https://openalex.org/W1564279867,"Abstract We have covalently modified rabbit reticulocyte polypeptide chain initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) with the 8-azido analogs of GTP (8-N3GTP) and ATP (8-N3ATP). Of the five subunits of GEF, the Mr 40,000 polypeptide binds 8-[gamma-32P]N3GTP, and the Mr 55,000 and 65,000 polypeptides bind 8-[gamma-32P]N3ATP. Both 8-N3GTP and 8-N3ATP specifically label the beta-subunit of eIF-2. Covalent binding of 8-azidopurine analogs to the eukaryotic initiation factors is dependent on UV irradiation. Binding of 8-N3GTP and 8-N3ATP is specific for the guanine- and adenine-binding sites on the protein, respectively. GDP and GTP, but not ATP, inhibit the photoinsertion of 8-N3GTP to the protein. Similarly, ATP, but not GTP, inhibits the photoinsertion of 8-N3ATP. The inclusion of NADP+ in the reaction mixtures also interferes with the binding of 8-N3ATP to GEF. Mg2+ inhibits the binding of the 8-azido analogs of GTP and ATP to both eIF-2 and GEF, whereas EDTA stimulates the photoinsertion of these nucleotides. Identical results are obtained when the binding of GTP and ATP to these proteins, in the presence of Mg2+ or EDTA, is estimated by nitrocellulose membranes. In enzymatic assays, 8-N3GTP supports the activity of eIF-2 and GEF, indicating that the interaction of 8-N3GTP is catalytically relevant."
https://openalex.org/W1601947646,"We have purified and characterized the adenosine A2-like binding site from human placental membranes. 5'-N-Ethylcarboxamido[2,8-3H]adenosine ([3H]NECA) binds to this site, with a Kd of 240 nM and a Bmax of 13.0 pmol/mg in human placental membranes. The adenosine A2-like binding site was purified after extraction from placental membranes with 0.1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. The purification included ammonium sulfate precipitation and concanavalin A, DEAE-Sephadex, and Sepharose 6B gel filtration chromatographies. The protein was purified 127-fold to homogeneity, with a final specific activity of 1.5-1.9 nmol/mg of protein and a 5.5-8.1% yield of binding activity from the membranes. The purified protein had similar binding properties and an identical potency order for displacement of [3H] NECA by adenosine analogs as the initial membranes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified protein revealed a single band at 98 kDa which coeluted with [3H]NECA binding activity during Sepharose 6B gel filtration chromatography. In 0.1% Triton X-100, the binding complex has a Stokes radius of 70 A, a sedimentation coefficient of 6.9 S, and a partial specific volume of 0.698 ml/g. The detergent-protein complex has a calculated molecular mass of 230 kDa. The estimated frictional ratio is 1.5. The native binding complex appears to consist of a dimer of identical subunits. The function of this ubiquitous protein remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W1673456113,"Abstract A 20-base pair (bp) conserved sequence present in the 5'-flanking regions of genes highly expressed in the exocrine pancreas forms part of the enhancers of the rat amylase 2A, chymotrypsin B, and elastase I genes. Factor(s) that interact with the conserved DNA sequence of the rat chymotrypsin B gene in vitro have been detected in extracts from acinar cells but not in three other cell lines tested. Transfection experiments suggest that the acinar cell factor(s) recognizing this enhancer core sequence are transcriptional activators. Multimers of a 28-bp sequence located by DNase I protection are capable of activating heterologous promoters in acinar cells. In vitro competition binding and methylation interference analyses indicate protein-DNA interactions at two distinct sites 10 base pairs apart on the DNA. This interaction is identical in extracts from cultured acinar cells as well as from whole pancreas tissue. The presence of two contiguous binding motifs on the same face of the DNA suggests that two (multiple) factors cooperate in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. We term these factors CACCTG pan-1 and TTTCCC pan-1. A factor with the binding specificity of the adenovirus major late transcription factor (MLTF) cross-reacts with the factor CACCTG pan-1 in vitro. However, the distribution of this factor in the various cells does not correlate with the activity of the enhancer core element in vivo. Further, conversion of the chymotrypsin sequence into a consensus MLTF site by three-point mutations abolished enhancer activity in acinar cells. Thus, the MLTF-like factor cannot substitute functionally for the factor CACCTG pan-1 and may act as an inhibitor of chymotrypsin enhancer function."
https://openalex.org/W1499817114,"Abstract Endo-alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosaminidase from Diplococcus pneumoniae was shown to have transglycosylation and transfer reaction (reversed hydrolysis) activities. Treatment of asialoglycoproteins having Gal beta 1----3GalNAc alpha 1----Ser/Thr linkages with enzyme preparations containing glycerol resulted in formation of nonreducing trisaccharides. The structure of the main trisaccharide (approximately 80%) was deduced to be Gal beta 1----3GalNAc alpha 1----1(3)-glycerol by analysis of sugar composition and the results of exoglycosidase treatment and periodate oxidation. The ability of the endoglycosidase to catalyze transfer of Gal beta 1----3GalNAc to various acceptors was also demonstrated by incubation of the enzyme with the disaccharide and the test compound. The following were found to show acceptor activity: glycerol, Tris, p-nitrophenol, threonine, serine, D-glucose, D-galactose, D-fucose, and 6-O-methylgalactose. Transfer to the primary hydroxyl groups of glycerol and hexoses appears to be favored since the major glycerol product was 1(3)-substituted and transfer to D-fucose and 6-O-methyl-D-galactose was less than that to D-galactose. In order to avoid spurious results, it is necessary to carry out incubations with this enzyme in the absence of glycerol and other hydroxy compounds. The potential use of this endoglycosidase in the synthesis of glycosides is indicated by our studies."
https://openalex.org/W1494559876,"Abstract The dihydrofolate reductase gene encodes a key enzyme of one-carbon metabolism and is constitutively expressed in all cells. Recently, transcripts initiated at 89 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional initiation site of the dihydrofolate reductase gene and transcribed from the opposite strand have been identified and shown to encode for a protein with homology to a bacterial DNA mismatch repair enzyme (Fujii, H., and Shimada, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10057-10064). Therefore, the two genes are organized in a head-to-head configuration separated by an 89-base pair segment. The promoter activities of this short spacer sequence were studied in a transient assay using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the guanine phosphoribosyltransferase genes as reporters. A 165-base pair fragment from -111 to +54 relative to the dihydrofolate reductase initiation site was shown to be sufficient for transcriptional activity in either direction, suggesting that expression of the two divergent genes is regulated by a bidirectional promoter that may use common regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1533607893,"The 18,000-dalton bovine lens fiber cell intrinsic membrane protein MP18 was phosphorylated on a serine residue by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. In addition, this protein bound calmodulin and was recognized by a monoclonal antibody (2D10). These different regions were localized using enzymatic and chemical fragmentation of electrophoretically purified MP18 that had been phosphorylated with either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C. Partial digestion of 32P-labeled MP18 with protease V8 resulted in a Mr = 17,000 peptide that bound calmodulin, but neither contained 32P or was recognized by the monoclonal antibody 2D10. Furthermore, the 17-kDa peptide had the same N-terminal amino acid sequence as MP18. Thus, the monoclonal antibody 2D10 recognition site and the protein kinase phosphorylation site(s) are close together and confined to a small region in the C terminus of MP18. This conclusion was confirmed in experiments where MP18 was fragmented with trypsin, endoproteinase Lys-C, or CNBr. The location of the phosphorylation site was confirmed by sequencing the small 32P-labeled, C-terminal peptide that resulted from protease V8 digestion of 32P-labeled MP18. This peptide contained a consensus sequence for cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1482045706,"Many of the extracellular lignin-degrading peroxidases from the wood-degrading fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium are phosphorylated. Immunoprecipitation of the extracellular fluid of cultures grown with H2K32PO4 with a polyclonal antibody raised against one of the lignin peroxidase isozymes, H8 (pI 3.5), revealed the incorporation of H2K32PO4 into lignin peroxidases. Analyses of the purified isozymes from labeled cultures by isoelectric focusing showed that, in addition to isozyme H8, lignin peroxidase isozymes H2 (pI 4.4), H6 (pI 3.7), and H10 (pI 3.3) are also phosphorylated. These analyses also showed that lignin peroxidase isozyme H1 (pI 4.7) and manganese-dependent peroxidase isozymes H3 (pI 4.9) and H4 (pI 4.5) are not phosphorylated. Phosphate quantitation indicated the presence of one molecule of phosphate/molecule of enzyme for all of the phosphorylated isozymes. To locate the site of phosphorylation, one-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis was performed with hydrolyzed 32P-protein. However, phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine could not be identified. Coupled enzyme assays of acid hydrolysate indicated the presence of mannose 6-phosphate as the phosphorylated component on the lignin peroxidase isozymes. Digestion of the isozymes with N-glycanase released the phosphate component, indicating that the mannose 6-phosphate is contained on an asparagine-linked oligosaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1643831378,"We have examined the pattern of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme and mRNA levels in cell cycle stage-specific populations obtained by centrifugal elutriation in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in a derivative line in which the dihydrofolate reductase gene is amplified approximately 50-fold. On a per cell basis, we observed a 2-fold increase in DHFR activity as cells progressed from G1 to G2/M with a concomitant 2-fold increase in the rate of protein synthesis and steady state level of mRNA. Analysis of DHFR mRNA levels in cell cycle stage-specific mouse 3T6 and human 143 tk- cells gave a similar pattern. We also demonstrate that simple alterations in growth conditions prior to elutriations can dramatically increase the levels of DHFR mRNA in all cell cycle states, thereby indicating that growth response associated with the DHFR gene functions independent of the cell cycle. We conclude that during periods of exponential growth the increases in dihydrofolate reductase activity, rate of protein synthesis, and steady state levels of mRNA parallel the general increases in cell volume and protein content associated with normal progression through the cell cycle, and therefore DHFR cannot be considered a cell cycle-regulated enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1528031285,"Interferon treatment of mammalian cells induces a double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent protein kinase known as DAI. When activated, DAI phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2, impairing its ability to be recycled and leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis. We have identified a novel DAI substrate in the ribosomal salt wash of rabbit reticulocyte lysates. This substrate is a 90-kDa polypeptide which has been purified to apparent homogeneity. It can be cross-linked by ultraviolet irradiation to adenovirus VA RNAI, a small RNA polymerase III transcript RNA which acts as an inhibitor of DAI. As assayed by a nitrocellulose filter binding assay, the 90-kDa polypeptide is also able to associate with authentic double-stranded RNA, but not single-stranded RNA, made in vitro. Thus, this newly identified substrate of DAI appears to have affinity for dsRNA structures and may be involved in dsRNA-regulated processes in the reticulocyte. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies directed against the 90-kDa polypeptide co-precipitate DAI, suggesting that these two proteins may exist as a complex."
https://openalex.org/W1555198821,"Abstract Utilizing small intestine membranes that contain heparin (50 micrograms/mg protein), binding of triglyceride lipase (homogeneous 52 kDa, specific activity, 70 nmol/mg.h) to membranes was shown to be concentration dependent and saturable, and it was characterized by a single dissociation constant (KD = 86 +/- 16 nM) with a maximal binding capacity of 54 +/- 8 pmol/mg of vesicle protein. Specific binding was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner by the addition of exogenous heparin, and binding was virtually eliminated (less than 6% control values) by pretreatment of membranes with bacterial heparinase. Cultured intestinal epithelial cells (CaCo-2), shown to possess membrane-associated heparin, also bound pancreatic triglyceride lipase in a specific and saturable manner, with KD = 77 +/- 12 nM and Bmax = 13.7 +/- 6 pmol/10(6) cells. Soluble heparin not only decreased binding, but it also diminished the enzyme-mediated cellular uptake of [14C]oleate from [14C]triolein by over 75%. Therefore, intestinal heparin, a component of the brush border membrane, localizes pancreatic triglyceride lipase in a receptor-like manner to the plasma membrane to promote the subsequent absorption of fatty acids derived from hydrolyzed triglycerides."
https://openalex.org/W1585746516,"Abstract Allophycocyanin and phycocyanin in the red alga (Cyanidium caldarium) are chloroplast-encoded, light-harvesting accessory pigments composed of alpha and beta subunit polypeptides (17-19 kDa) to which 1 or more residues of the heme-derived bile pigment chromophore phycocyanobilin are attached by cysteinyl thioether linkages (Offner, G.D., and Troxler, R.F. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9931-9940). Western blot experiments utilizing phycobiliprotein antisera revealed that immunoreactive allophycocyanin and phycocyanin apoproteins were absent in cells grown in the dark and present in cells exposed to light. Northern blot experiments using genomic DNA hybridization probes indicated that phycobiliprotein mRNAs were absent in the dark, whereas cells exposed to light contained two allophycocyanin mRNA transcripts, 1.4 and 1.6 kilobases in length, and one phycocyanin mRNA transcript, 3.0 kilobases in length, providing evidence that phycobiliproteins are encoded in photogenes which are only transcriptionally active in the light. Northern and Western analyses demonstrated that cells incubated in the dark with the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinate contained allophycocyanin and phycocyanin mRNAs and apoproteins, indistinguishable in size, number, and quantity from those made in the light. Cells incubated in the dark with delta-aminolevulinate, protoporphyrin IX, or heme, but not biliverdin or phycocyanobilin, synthesized allophycocyanin and phycocyanin alpha and beta apoproteins, suggesting a role for heme in the control phycobiliprotein gene expression. Cells incubated with heme in the dark produced allophycocyanin and phycocyanin mRNA transcripts, but did not produce mRNAs for four other photogenes coding for a P-700 reaction center protein, a 32-kDa herbicide-binding protein, and the large and small subunits of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase. These results show, for the first time, that heme is a regulatory factor specifically involved in transcriptional regulation of chloroplast genes for phycobiliproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1486210528,"Thyroid hormones contribute to the regulation of blood sugar by accelerating the turnover of glucose. The mechanism by which thyroid hormones stimulate the rate of glucose utilization in the liver was determined by investigating the effect of different thyroid states on the expression of the glucokinase gene, a key enzyme of glycolysis. In euthyroid rats the mass of glucokinase mRNA increased 8-fold during the first 4 h of refeeding a high carbohydrate diet to 48-h starved rats. In hypothyroid rats under the same conditions only a 2-fold induction was observed. In euthyroid rats a 5-fold increase was obtained 1 h after refeeding, while hypothyroid rats displayed no significant response in glucokinase mRNA within this time. Basal levels of glucokinase mRNA in starved rats were the same observed in eu- and hypothyroid rats. Injection of 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) into hypothyroid rats restored the mRNA levels of refed hypothyroid rats to euthyroid levels within 24 h. However, a 3-fold increase over untreated animals was already observed 3 h after T3 administration. Even subphysiological doses of T3 (0.1 microgram/100 g body weight) led to an significant increase in glucokinase mRNA levels (1.5-fold, p less than 0.05) in hypothyroid rats, whereas higher doses (100 micrograms/100 g body weight) restored the mRNA levels to those of euthyroid controls. Parallel increases in the cytosolic mRNA levels and rate of glucokinase gene transcription were detected when hypo- and euthyroid fasted rats were compared after 4 h of refeeding. It is concluded that thyroid hormones are permissive for the induction of glucokinase during refeeding but have no effect during starvation. They rapidly enhance the rate of gene transcription within the range of their physiologically circulating concentrations. The results suggest a major importance of thyroid hormones in regulating glucose utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1532617177,"Glycophorin C (GPC) is an integral membrane protein of human erythrocytes which plays an important role in regulating the deformability and mechanical stability of red cells. Recently, the structural gene for this glycoprotein has been cloned (Colin, Y., Le Van Kim, C., Tsapis, A., Clerget, M., d'Auriol, L., London, J., Galibert, F., and Cartron, J. P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3773-3780), and we have now determined the sequence of the 1050 base pairs of DNA preceding the transcription initiation site mapped in erythroid cells. This region contains different potential regulatory cis-acting elements found in a variety of eukaryotic promoters (TATA box, CAAT box, Sp1-binding site) as well as sequences present in the promoter and enhancer regions of genes specific for the erythroid lineage (CACCC box and NF-E1-binding site). Northern blot analysis and immunological studies indicate that the GPC gene is expressed in a large number of cells and tissues. However, the level of transcription as well as the glycosylation of the mature GPC differ in erythroid and nonerythroid cells. Primer extension analysis and mapping of the 5' end GPC mRNA by the polymerase chain reaction indicate that different transcription sites are utilized for the expression of the GPC gene in erythroid and nonerythroid tissues and cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1527992378,"Abstract To better characterize the conformational differences of G- and F-actin, we have compared the interaction between G- and F-actin with myosin subfragment 1 (S1) which had part of its F-actin binding site (residues 633-642) blocked by a complementary peptide or (Chaussepied, P., and Morales, M. F. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 7471-7475). Light scattering, sedimentation, and electron microscopy measurements showed that, with the antipeptide covalently attached to the S1 heavy chain, S1 was not capable of inducing G-actin polymerization in the absence of salt. Moreover, the antipeptide-carrying S1 did not change the fluorescence polarization of 5-[2-(iodoacetyl)-aminoethyl]aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (1,5-IAEDANS)-labeled G-actin or of 1,5-IAEDANS-labeled actin dimer, compared to the control S1. This result, interpreted as a lack of interaction between G-actin and antipeptide-carrying S1, was confirmed further by the following experiments: in the presence of G-actin, antipeptide.S1 heavy chain was not protected against trypsin and papain proteolysis, and G-actin could not be cross-linked to antipeptide.S1 by 1-ethyl-3[-3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide. In contrast, similar experiments showed that antipeptide.S1 was able to interact with nascent F-actin and with F-actin. Thus, blocking the stretch 633-642 of S1 heavy chain by the antipeptide strongly inhibits G-actin-S1 interaction but only slightly alters F-actin-S1 contact. We, therefore postulate that this stretch of skeletal S1 heavy chain is essential for G-actin-S1 interaction and that the G-F transformation generates new S1 binding site(s) on the actin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1583328345,"The rat S14 gene encodes a protein of unknown function and has an amino acid sequence unrelated to any published sequences. Expression of mRNA S14 and lipogenesis in liver, fat, and mammary gland are regulated coordinately by dietary and hormonal stimuli, suggesting that the S14 protein may be associated with lipogenesis. Antisera to synthetic peptides corresponding to portions of the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein were used to identify the protein and to compare its regulation with that of mRNA S14. Antisera specifically recognized the in vitro translation product of mRNA S14 as defined by its migration on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A product of identical Mr was identified on Western blots of liver homogenates from hyperthyroid, carbohydrate-fed rats. Subcellular fractionation showed that S14 protein is primarily cytosolic. The protein was detectable in tissues with abundant S14 gene expression, including hyperthyroid liver and epididymal fat and hypothyroid brown adipose tissue, whereas it was undetectable in hypothyroid liver and euthyroid kidney, testis, and spleen. Diurnal variation in hepatic mRNA S14 correlated with comparable changes in levels of the protein. Surprisingly, no S14 protein was observed in the livers of chronically (3 week) hypothyroid rats treated with triiodothyronine (T3) until 12 h had elapsed, despite attainment of maximal levels of mRNA S14 within 4 h. Rapid appearance of protein after T3 treatment was observed in both euthyroid and short term (4 day) hypothyroid rats, suggesting that long-term hypothyroidism is associated with a defect in the translational efficiency of mRNA S14."
https://openalex.org/W1568498396,"Abstract Bovine cardiac troponin C (cTnC) contains 2 cysteine residues, Cys-35 located in the nonfunctional Ca2+-binding loop I and Cys-84 in the N-terminal segment of the central helix. We have studied the reactivity of Cys residues in cTnC with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and 7-diethylamino-3-(4'-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM). The latter compound fluoresces only when reacted with the protein. The reaction with DTNB followed second order kinetics with respect to DTNB, the rate constants being 3.37 s-1 M-1 and 1.82 s-1 M-1 in the presence and absence of Ca2+, respectively. These rates are much slower than the rate of reaction with Cys-98 of skeletal TnC (sTnC) or with the urea-denatured cTnC, indicating that both Cys residues are partly buried within the structure of the protein. The increase in reactivity was induced by binding of Ca2+ to the single low affinity Ca2+ binding site (site II). The fluorescence increase upon reaction of cTnC with CPM in the absence of Ca2+ could be fitted with a single exponential equation indicating that both cysteine residues are equally available to the reagent. The reaction in the presence of Ca2+ was biphasic. Analysis of CNBr fragments of cTnC labeled with CPM under various conditions indicated that in the presence of Ca2+ the reactivity of Cys-84 is increased while that of Cys-35 is slightly decreased. This finding is consistent with the model of Herzberg et al. (Herzberg, O., Moult, J., and James, M. N. G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2638-2644) and the data of Ingraham and Hodges (Ingraham, R. H., and Hodges, R. S. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 5891-5898), suggesting that the Ca2+-induced conformational change in the N-terminal half of TnC involves separation of the helix C from the central helix, thereby increasing the accessibility of Cys-84. The slow overall kinetics, however, indicates that the structure in the vicinity of Cys residues is relatively compact regardless of Ca2+. We interpret the increase in reactivity towards CPM as consistent with a Ca2+-induced exposure of a hydrophobic pocket in the vicinity of Cys-84."

(1986) Biomed. Res. (Tokyo) 7, 47-51). FGL-IIb was isolated from the nervous system of A. kurodai by Iatrobeads column chromatography using three solvent systems. Pyruvic acid was identified by thin layer chromatography as its 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone and established by permethylation studies to be attached as a ketal to O-3 and O-4 of the terminal galactose of the oligosaccharide chain in FGL-IIb. By sugar analysis, permethylation studies, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and proton magnetic resonance spectrometry, the structure of FGL-IIb was concluded to be [3,4-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)]Gal beta 1----3GalNAc alpha 1----3(Fuc alpha 1----2) (2-aminoethylphosphonyl----6)Gal beta 1----4Glc beta 1----1ceramide.

https://openalex.org/W1552372108,"A full length cDNA encoding human pro-α2(V) collagen was constructed. Partial sequencing of the cDNA and primer extension analysis of mRNA from fibroblasts found that pro-α2(V) mRNA differs from the mRNAs of other fibrillar collagens in the increased length of its 5′-untranslated region. The pro-α2(V) cDNA was placed downstream of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter/regulatory sequences for expression studies in cultured Chinese hamster lung cells. These cells have been shown previously to synthesize large quantities of pro-α1(V) homotrimers as their only collagenous product. Transfection resulted in a number of clonal cell lines that express human α2(V) RNA at levels comparable to, and in some cases greater than, levels found in normal human skin fibroblasts. Pro-α2(V) chains produced in the majority of clonal lines were of sufficient quantity to complex all available endogenous pro-α1(V) chains. Chimeric heterotrimers, composed of hamster α1(V) and human α2(V) chains in a 2:1 ratio, were stable to pepsin digestion and were found predominantly associated with the cell layer. Surprisingly, pro-α2(V) chains, in excess to pro-α1(V) chains, were found in the extracellular matrix and, in much greater abundance, in media. These chains were pepsin sensitive, indicating that pro-α2(V) chains can be secreted as nonstable homotrimers or as free chains."

https://openalex.org/W1501770676,"Abstract Ornithine-delta-aminotransferase (OAT) is a nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial enzyme that converts ornithine to glutamate semialdehyde. Although OAT is expressed in most tissues of the rat, liver, kidney, and retina have the highest levels of OAT activity. Studies of OAT regulation in liver and kidney have indicated transcriptional and translational controls for the enzyme in a tissue-specific manner. Little is known about OAT modulation in retinal tissue, although chorio-retinal degeneration is the predominant feature in a hereditary disorder of OAT deficiency, gyrate atrophy. To characterize OAT regulation in retinal lines, we studied its synthesis in two retinoblastoma strains, Y79 and RB355. Baseline OAT mRNA levels were similar in the two cell lines, yet Y79 expressed 3-fold more immunoreactive OAT protein and enzyme activity than RB355; this finding suggested the presence of a post-transcriptional mechanism for the regulation of steady-state OAT levels. Treatment of the two strains with estradiol or thyroid hormone for 24 h resulted in approximately 5-fold increases in OAT protein and activity. Since similar increases in OAT mRNA levels were observed in both strains after Northern blotting, it is likely that these hormones exert their effects at the transcriptional level. Finally, primer extension analysis revealed two OAT mRNA species in both strains, due to the presence of an additional exon (exon 2) in one of the transcripts. The absence of this exon in other tissues reflects the unique mechanisms which govern OAT in retinoblastomas."

https://openalex.org/W1503135782,"The interaction of Xenopus transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) with a synthetic 66-base pair DNA fragment containing the intragenic control region (ICR) of the 5 S RNA gene was investigated by mobility shift gel electrophoresis and DNase I protection experiments. Specific EDTA-sensitive protein-DNA complexes were observed only in the presence of high concentrations of either the ICR-containing fragment or an excess of unlabeled nonspecific DNA. This predominant complex was determined to be composed of equal molar ratios of TFIIIA and the 66-base pair ICR-containing fragment, although complexes containing two TFIIIA molecules/ICR and three TFIIIA molecules/ICR were also found. In the absence of excess unlabeled specific or nonspecific DNA, TFIIIA was observed to interact with the labeled 66-mer as an aggregate that remained at the top of the gel matrix. Although the binding affinities of TFIIIA for the 66-base pair specific DNA fragment and the 74-base pair nonspecific DNA fragment were comparable as observed by direct measurement with mobility shift gel electrophoresis, a greater than 500-fold difference was observed by competition experiments at high DNA concentrations. Furthermore, a similar difference was also detected when proteolytically cleaved TFIIIA was used in the binding reaction, which substantially reduced the protein-protein interactions. DNase I digestion patterns of the noncoding strand of the 66-mer in the absence or presence of TFIIIA demonstrated that this region of DNA is structurally equivalent to the ICR contained within the 5 S RNA gene. In addition, the mode of binding observed in the mobility shift gels is identical to that observed by direct footprint analysis. Protein-protein interactions appear, therefore, to be an intrinsic and necessary activity of TFIIIA."
