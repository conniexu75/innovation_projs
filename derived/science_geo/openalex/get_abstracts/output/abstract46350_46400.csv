https://openalex.org/W2057163724,Secretion is blocked at the post-Golgi stage within 5 min of a shift of sec4-8 cells from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C. Analysis of SEC4 predicts a protein product of 23.5 kd molecular weight that shares 32% homology with ras proteins and is essential for growth. The regions of best homology are those involved in the binding and hydrolysis of GTP. Duplication of SEC4 suppresses post-Golgi-blocked mutations in three sec genes. These mutations are lethal when combined with sec4-8 at 25 degrees C. Mutations that block elsewhere on the pathway are not suppressed by the SEC4 duplication and are not lethal when combined with sec4-8. We propose that the SEC4 product is a GTP-binding protein that plays an essential role in controlling a late stage of the secretory pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2100179968,"The U2 snRNP binds to the site of branch formation during splicing of mammalian pre-mRNA in vitro. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the branch site is within the so-called TACTAAC box (UACUAAC box), an absolutely conserved intron sequence required for splicing. Based on the identification and sequence of a U2 analogue in yeast, a specific base pairing interaction between the UACUAAC box and a highly conserved region of this snRNA can be proposed. To test this hypothesis, we have taken advantage of two mutations constructed previously in the UACUAAC box of an actin-HIS4 fusion. These mutant strains were transformed with stable plasmids bearing U2-like snRNAs into which changes predicted to restore base pairing had been introduced. Allele-specific suppression of biological and biochemical phenotypes was observed in both cases. Recognition of the UACUAAC box thus relies, at least in part, on Watson-Crick base pairing with the yeast U2 analogue."
https://openalex.org/W2084542841,"Cytoplasmic granules of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) contain, in addition to the pore-forming protein perforin, a family of highly homologous serine esterases, granzymes A-H. The serine esterase affinity label diisopropyl fluorophosphate reacts strongly with granzymes A and D, to a lesser extent with B, E, F, G, and H, and not at all with C and F. For granzymes A and D, synthetic substrates have been found. Antibodies raised against granzyme B strongly cross-react with A, G, and H, and antibodies to granzyme D recognize C, E, and F. These antigenic relationships correlate with similarities in the N-terminal amino acid sequences. At least 60% homology is observed between the eight proteins, and all are similar to rat mast cell protease 2. Sequence analysis suggests the identity of granzyme A with a protease predicted from a CTL-specific cDNA clone (H factor) and of granzyme B, G, or H with a protein encoded by the CTL-specific cDNA clone CTLA 1/CCP 1."
https://openalex.org/W1547302919,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a bioactive phospholipid (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) synthesized by a variety of mammalian cell types. PAF induces hypotension, and activates neutrophils and platelets, among other actions. Removal of the acetyl moiety abolishes biological activity, so this reaction may regulate the concentration of PAF and its physiological effects. We have studied the significance of this reaction, which is catalyzed in vitro by an acetylhydrolase present in mammalian plasma, blood cells, and tissues. We have shown that the plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase is responsible for the degradation of PAF in whole human blood and that alternate pathways for PAF degradation in plasma or blood cells are negligible. Human plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase is associated with low and high density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL with apoE). We have confirmed that the activity is a stable component of these particles by density gradient ultracentrifugation, chromatography on heparin-agarose, and immunoprecipitation. The LDL-associated activity accounts for most or all of the PAF degradation that occurs in plasma ex vivo, while the HDL-associated activity contributes little to this process. However, the two activities likely are due to a single protein since the HDL- and LDL-associated PAF-acetylhydrolase activities can transfer from one lipoprotein to the other. These transfer processes are pH-dependent and specific, since they only occur from LDL to a well characterized subclass of HDL (apoE-containing HDL) and vice versa. We discuss the equilibrium between the two particles and the role that this process may have in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1537854451,"An endothelial cell growth factor has been purified about 1,000,000-fold to homogeneity from human platelets by a seven-step procedure. The purified product has an apparent Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of 45,000. The mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis was similar in the presence or absence of reducing agents, indicating that the factor consists of a single polypeptide chain. Maximal stimulation by the purified protein was achieved at a concentration of about 20 ng/ml (440 pM). Heparin did not potentiate the activity, nor did the factor bind to heparin immobilized on Sepharose. The purified factor was heat- and acid-labile; it was active on porcine and human endothelial cells, but not on human foreskin fibroblasts. Chromatofocusing revealed that the pI of the factor was 4.6. The structural and functional characteristics of the platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor are distinct from previously characterized endothelial cell mitogens with affinities for heparin."
https://openalex.org/W2040803875,"Mammalian cells express a spectrum of tubulin isotypes whose relationship to the diversity of microtubule function is unknown. To examine whether different isotypes are segregated into functionally distinct microtubules, we generated immune sera capable of discriminating among the various naturally occurring β-tubulin isotypes. Cloned fusion proteins encoding each isotype were used first to tolerogenize animals against shared epitopes, and then as immunogens to elicit a specific response. In experiments using these sera, we show that there is neither complete nor partial segregation of β-tubulin isotypes: both interphase cytoskeletal and mitotic spindle microtubules are mixed copolymers of all expressed β-tubulin isotypes. Indeed, a highly divergent isotype normally expressed only in certain hematopoietic cells is also indiscriminately assembled into all microtubules both in their normal context and when transfected into HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010422998,"The integration host factor (IHF) of Escherichia coli is necessary for maintenance of pSC101. The protein binds specifically to the replication origin of the plasmid, in the AT-rich region located immediately adjacent to the left, weak binding site for the plasmid-encoded initiator protein. DNAase I and OH- radical footprinting experiments showed that IHF protects 49 bp of the DNA at the origin region. Methylation protection analyses revealed that IHF contacts purine residues in both the major and minor grooves of the DNA. Electrophoretic analyses showed that IHF binds to bent DNA, and the protein binding further enhances the degree of DNA bending. Site-directed mutagenesis of three of the contact points not only abolished binding of the protein to the DNA but also inactivated the replication origin. Therefore, binding of IHF to the ori sequence most probably is necessary for initiation of plasmid replication."
https://openalex.org/W1619122155,"Rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) is an abundant, 15,124-Da polypeptide found in the cytosol of small intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes). It is homologous to rat liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), a 14,273-Da cytosolic protein which is found in enterocytes as well as hepatocytes. It is unclear why the small intestinal epithelium contains two abundant fatty acid-binding proteins. A systematic comparative analysis of the ligand binding characteristics of the two FABPs has not been reported. To undertake such a study we expressed the coding region of a full length I-FABP cDNA in Escherichia coli and purified large quantities of the protein. We also purified rat L-FABP from a similar, previously described expression system (Lowe, J. B., Strauss, A. W., and Gordon, J. I. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12696-12704). Analysis of fatty acids associated with each of the homogeneous E. coli-derived FABPs suggested that the two proteins differed in their ligand binding specificity and capacity. All of the fatty acids associated with I-FABP were saturated while 30% of the E. coli fatty acids bound to L-FABP were unsaturated (16:1, 18:1, 18:2). We directly analyzed the ability of I- and L-FABP to bind fatty acids of different chain length and degree of saturation using a hydroxyalkoxypropyl dextran-based assay. Scatchard analysis revealed that each mole of L-FABP can bind up to 2 mol of long chain fatty acid while each mole of I-FABP can bind only 1 mole of fatty acid. L-FABP exhibited a relatively higher affinity for unsaturated fatty acids (oleate, arachidonate) than for saturated fatty acid (palmitate). By contrast, we were not able to detect a significant difference in the affinity of I-FABP for palmitate, oleate, and arachidonate. Neither protein exhibited any appreciable affinity for fatty acids whose chain length was less than C16. The observed differences in ligand affinities and capacities suggest that these proteins may have distinct roles in metabolism and/or compartmentalization of fatty acids within enterocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2058491704,"The oncogene protein product (p21) of the ras gene has been implicated in mediating the effects of a variety of growth factors and hormones. Microinjection of monoclonal antibody 6B7, which is directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a highly conserved region of p21 (amino acids 29 to 44) required for p21 function, specifically inhibited Xenopus oocyte maturation induced by incubation with insulin. The inhibition was dose-dependent and specific since (i) the same antibody had no effect on progesterone-induced maturation, (ii) immunoprecipitation and Western blotting indicated that the antibody recognized a single protein of molecular weight 21,000 in oocyte extracts, and (iii) inhibition was not observed with identical concentrations of normal immunoglobulin. Thus, p21 appears to be involved in mediating insulin-induced maturation of Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, the mechanism may involve phosphorylation of p21, as p21 was found to be a substrate of the insulin receptor kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1581884496,"In FRTL-5 thyroid cells depleted of thyrotropin, insulin, and serum for 3 days, growth and synthesis of thyroglobulin are inhibited. Readdition of insulin or IGF-I in the absence of thyrotropin stimulates thyroglobulin synthesis or thyroglobulin mRNA level by 2-4-fold but has no effect on cell growth. The half-maximal effects of insulin and IGF-I are at 100 and 10 ng/ml, respectively. In both cases, the increased mRNA levels are accompanied by an increase in transcription rate. Maximally effective concentrations of insulin or IGF-I are additive with thyrotropin in increasing thyroglobulin mRNA levels and in increasing transcription; in contrast, the effect of insulin is not additive with IGF-I."
https://openalex.org/W2074475242,"Yeast contains at least 24 snRNAs, many of which are dispensable for viability. We recently demonstrated that a small subset of these RNAs has a functional binding site for the Sm antigen, a hallmark of metazoan snRNAs involved in mRNA processing. Here we show that one of these snRNAs, snR7, is required for growth. To determine the biochemical basis of lethality in cells lacking snR7, we engineered the conditional synthesis of snR7 by fusing the snRNA coding sequences to the yeast GAL1 control region. Cells depleted for the SNR7 gene product by growth on glucose for five generations show marked accumulation of unspliced mRNA precursors from the four intron-containing genes tested. In some cases, intron-exon 2 lariats also accumulate. We have identified a 70 nucleotide domain within snR7 with limited sequence-specific but striking structural homology to the mammalian snRNA U5. We conclude that mRNA splicing in yeast requires the function of a U5-like snRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1991766005,"As part of a study of potential vaccines against malaria, the protective efficacy of sporozoite subunit vaccines was determined by using the Plasmodium berghei murine malaria model. Mice were immunized with recombinant DNA-produced or synthetic peptide-carrier subunit vaccines derived from the repetitive epitopes of the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite gene, or with radiation-attenuated sporozoites. Immunization with subunit vaccines elicited humoral responses that were equivalent to or greater than those elicited by irradiated sporozoites, yet the protection against sporozoite challenge induced by either of the subunit vaccines was far less than that achieved by immunization with attenuated sporozoites. Passive and adoptive transfer studies demonstrated that subunit vaccines elicited predominantly antibody-mediated protection that was easily overcome whereas irradiated sporozoites induced potent cell-mediated immunity that protected against high challenge doses of sporozoites. These studies indicate that new strategies designed to induce cellular immunity will be required for efficacious sporozoite vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1494992303,"A rat liver cDNA library enriched for glucokinase sequences was constructed using the phage expression vector lambda gt11 and screened with an antiserum to glucokinase. A positive phage clone termed lambda-GK223 was isolated by several rounds of plaque purification. When introduced in the high frequency lysogenization strain Y1089, the phage was shown to encode a fusion protein containing epitopes specific to rat liver glucokinase. The 1800-base pair cDNA insert of lambda-GK223 was subcloned in a pUC plasmid, and a resulting recombinant termed pUC-GK1 was used for hybrid selection of mRNA. The selected mRNA directed the synthesis in a cell-free translation system of a protein identified as glucokinase by electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation. The cloned cDNA was then used as a probe to measure the amount of glucokinase mRNA in rat liver during postnatal development. Glucokinase mRNA, 2.4 kilobases in length, was first detectable at day 14 after birth and increased 40-fold in amount from this age to day 31, in parallel with the emergence of glucokinase enzyme activity. In the adult rat, glucokinase mRNA was low during fasting and increased more than 50-fold above the fasting level within 6 h of an oral glucose load. However, maximal accumulation of glucokinase mRNA was short-lived and the mRNA level returned toward basal values by 18 h of refeeding. These data point to rapid and massive effects on the expression of the glucokinase gene at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels during ontogenic development and dietary changes in the adult animal."
https://openalex.org/W1546244903,"Abstract Antibodies prepared against the phospholipase A2 stimulatory peptide melittin were used to identify and isolate a novel mammalian protein with similar functional and antigenic properties. The mammalian protein of Mr 28,000 was isolated from cell sonicates by high performance immunoaffinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. This stimulatory protein was stable for several months when frozen at -70 degrees C. The purified protein selectively stimulated phospholipase A2 when phosphatidylcholine was used as a substrate but had no effect on phospholipase A2 activity when phosphatidylethanolamine was used as a substrate. Furthermore, this protein had no effect on phospholipase C activity or on pancreatic or snake venom phospholipase A2. The stimulatory activity was unaffected by RNase or DNase treatment. However, boiling or trypsin digestion inactivated the phospholipase stimulatory activity. The mechanism of phospholipase A2 stimulation appeared to result from an increase in the apparent Vmax of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1668617342,"The subcellular localization of human skin chymase to mast cell granules was established by immunoelectron microscopy, and binding of chymase to the area of the dermo-epidermal junction, a basement membrane, was demonstrated immunocytochemically in cryosections incubated with purified proteinase prior to immunolabeling. Because heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans are major constituents of mast cell granules and basement membranes, respectively, the ability of chymase to bind to glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was investigated. Among a variety of GAGs, only binding of chymase to heparin and heparan sulfate appears physiologically significant. Binding was ionic strength-dependent, involved amino groups on the proteinase, and correlated with increasing GAG sulfate content, indicating a predominantly electrostatic association. Interaction with heparin was observed in solutions containing up to 0.5 M NaCl, and interaction with heparan sulfate was observed in solutions containing up to 0.3 M NaCl. Binding of heparin did not detectably affect catalysis of peptide substrates, but may reduce accessibility of proteinase to protein substrates. Measurements among a series of serine class proteinases indicated that heparin binding was a more common property of mast cell proteinases than proteinases stored in other secretory granules. Binding of chymase to heparin is likely to have a storage as well as a structural role within the mast cell granule, whereas binding of chymase to heparan sulfate may have physiological significance after degranulation."
https://openalex.org/W1554825533,"During the process by which newly synthesized subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (stoichiometry = alpha 2 beta gamma delta) mature and acquire the properties of the fully functional cell surface receptor, they undergo numerous covalent and noncovalent modifications. Using ligand-mediated and subunit-specific immunoprecipitation, four forms in the maturation of the alpha subunit can be detected: the primary translation product; alpha subunit that can bind alpha-bungarotoxin; alpha subunit assembled with the other subunits; and surface receptor. The alpha subunit acquires the ability to bind alpha-bungarotoxin with a t1/2 of approximately 40 min after translation and becomes assembled with a t1/2 of 80 min after translation. Using metabolic labeling and sucrose gradient fractionation, we have determined the subcellular location of alpha subunit when it acquires the ability to bind alpha-bungarotoxin and when it is assembled. Golgi membranes were identified across the gradient by the enzymatic activities UDP-galactose:N-acetylglucosamine galactosyltransferase and alpha-mannosidase. Endoplasmic reticulum membranes were identified by the enzymatic activity glucose-6-phosphatase and by the presence of newly synthesized alpha and beta subunits. Pulse-labeled alpha subunit that bound alpha-bungarotoxin was first detected co-migrating in the gradient with the glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Therefore, the capacity to bind alpha-bungarotoxin was acquired while the alpha subunit was in the endoplasmic reticulum. Assembled alpha subunit was detected by immunoprecipitating with an anti-beta subunit-specific monoclonal antibody. By this method, assembled receptor was first detected 15 min after translation in both the endoplasmic and Golgi portions of the gradient. To validate this method of detecting assembled receptor, we determined the sedimentation coefficient of the receptor subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum. Both unassembled subunits with sedimentation coefficients of 5 S and assembled receptor with a sedimentation coefficient of 9 S were recovered from the endoplasmic reticulum portion of the gradient. Thus, our data concerning the subcellular site of assembly are consistent with assembly occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum followed by rapid transport to the Golgi."

The enzyme preparation was comprised of three polypeptides with estimated Mr = 72,000, 11,000, and 9,000 in a alpha 2 beta 4 gamma 4 quaternary structure. The three components remained associated during native gel electrophoresis, Mono Q chromatography, and Superose 6 chromatography despite the presence of thiols, glycols, detergents, and varied buffer conditions. The apparent compositional complexity of K. aerogenes urease contrasts with the simple well-characterized homohexameric structure for jack bean urease (Dixon, N. E., Hinds, J. A., Fihelly, A. K., Gazzola, C., Winzor, D. J., Blakeley, R. L., and Zerner, B. (1980) Can. J. Biochem. 58, 1323-1334); however, heteromeric subunit compositions were also observed for the enzymes from Proteus mirabilis, Sporosarcina ureae, and Selemonomas ruminantium. K. aerogenes urease exhibited a Km for urea of 2.8 +/- 0.6 mM and a Vmax of 2,800 +/- 200 mumol of urea min-1 mg-1 at 37 degrees C in 25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazineN'-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 5.0 mM EDTA buffer, pH 7.75. The enzyme activity was stable in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% Triton X-100, 1 M KCl, and over a pH range from 5 to 10.5, with maximum activity observed at pH 7.75. Two active site groups were defined by their pKa values of 6.55 and 8.85. The amino acid composition of K. aerogenes urease more closely resembled that for the enzyme from Brevibacter ammoniagenes (Nakano, H., Takenishi, S., and Watanabe, Y. (1984) Agric. Biol. Chem. 48, 1495-1502) than those for plant ureases. Atomic absorption analysis was used to establish the presence of 2.1 +/- 0.3 mol of nickel per mol of 72,000-dalton subunit in K. aerogenes urease."
https://openalex.org/W2069115331,"In haploid homothallic yeast, cell division gives rise to a mother cell that transiently transcribes the HO gene (as it undergoes START) and a daughter cell that does not. Consequently, only mother cells switch their mating types. Here, we test the proposition that a transcription factor called SWI5 is the ""determinant"" of mother-cell-specific HO transcription; that is, that SWI5 is the only factor missing in daughter cells. We show that SWI5 RNAs are cell-cycle regulated so that they are only produced after the post-START window of HO transcription. This regulation is vital for mother-cell specificity since constitutive transcription of SWI5 causes daughter cells to switch their mating types. We propose that SWI5 gene products are partitioned asymmetrically at cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1490786462,"The post-translational acquisition of ligand binding activity by the insulin receptor was examined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In pulse-chase experiments with [35S] methionine, labeled receptor species were separated into and forms by affinity chromatography on insulin-agarose and then were characterized and quantitated. It was found that the newly translated high molecular weight proreceptor lacks the capacity to bind insulin. The acquisition of binding activity is relatively slow (t1/2 = 45 min) and occurs prior to conversion of the proreceptor to the mature alpha- and beta-subunits by proteolytic cleavage and maturation of its N-linked oligosaccharide chains (t1/2 = 3 h). Glycosylation appears to be required for this activation since the aglycoproreceptor, synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin, does not acquire insulin binding activity. However, once the proreceptor has acquired ligand binding activity, removal of its N-linked oligosaccharide chains with endoglycosidase H has no effect on the ability of the proreceptor to bind insulin. The modification of the proreceptor to bind insulin. The modification of the proreceptor that gives rise to insulin binding activity most likely involves a conformational change in the binding domain. A human autoimmune antibody that recognizes only the active insulin binding site does not interact with the inactive proreceptor, whereas a rabbit polyclonal antireceptor antibody recognizes all forms. Thus, the autoimmune antibody must recognize a new epitope created during conversion of the inactive proreceptor to the active form."
https://openalex.org/W1491851618,"The amelogenins are a complex mixture of hydrophobic proteins that are the major organic component of developing enamel. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of the amelogenins we isolated cDNA clones encoding these proteins. The clones were definitively identified by hybrid-selected translation experiments and by comparison of the DNA sequence with the protein-derived amino acid sequence. Southern hybridization of bovine genomic DNA indicated that amelogenin is a single copy gene. However, Northern hybridization experiments distinctly showed two major species of mRNA, each of which were sufficiently large enough to encode the highest known molecular weight species of amelogenin proteins. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of hybrid-selected translation products using isolated amelogenin cDNA showed multiple, translated protein products. These data are supportive of a differential mRNA processing mechanism involved in generating a heterogeneous family of amelogenin matrix proteins from a single gene."
https://openalex.org/W1571563482,"The mechanism responsible for the stimulation of secretion of lipoprotein lipase by heparin in cultured cells was studied with avian adipocytes in culture. Immunoprecipitation followed by electrophoresis and fluorography were used to isolate and quantitate the radiolabeled enzyme, whereas total lipoprotein lipase was quantitated by radioimmunoassay. Rates of synthesis of lipoprotein lipase were not different for control or heparin treatments as judged by incorporation of L-[35S]methionine counts into lipoprotein lipase during a 20-min pulse. This observation was corroborated in pulse-chase experiments where the calculation of total lipoprotein lipase synthesis, based on the rate of change in enzyme-specific activity during the chase, showed no difference between control (8.13 +/- 3.1) and heparin treatments (9.1 +/- 5.3 ng/h/60-mm dish). Secretion rates of enzyme were calculated from measurements of the radioactivity of the secreted enzyme and the cellular enzyme-specific activity. Degradation rates were calculated by difference between synthesis and secretion rates of enzyme. In control cells 76% of the synthesized enzyme was degraded. Addition of heparin to the culture medium reduced the degradation rate to 21% of the synthetic rate. The presence of heparin in cell media resulted in a decrease in apparent intracellular retention half-time for secreted enzyme from 160 +/- 44 min to 25 +/- 1 min. The above data demonstrate that the increase in lipoprotein lipase protein secretion, observed upon addition of heparin to cultured adipocytes, is due to a decreased degradation rate with no change in synthetic rate. Finally, newly synthesized lipoprotein lipase in cultured adipocytes is secreted constitutively and there is no evidence that it is stored in an intracellular pool."
https://openalex.org/W1662705935,"The existence in invertebrates, unicellular eukaryotes, and prokaryotes of materials that resemble several vertebrate peptide hormones led to the suggestion that these peptide messengers may have arisen earlier in evolution than had previously been thought. Consistent with this hypothesis, we describe here material in two plants, spinach and Lemma gibba G3, that is very similar to mammalian insulin, yet distinctive. In each of the early purification steps, which consisted of acidic methanol chloroform extraction and sequential chromatography on C-18 hydrophobic resin, Sephadex G-50, CM-Sepharose, and a short C-3 high performance liquid chromatography column, the immunoactive material from plants resembled the common vertebrate insulins. The protein nature of the material was suggested by its destruction by Pronase but not by the inactivated enzyme. In addition, on TSK chromatography it eluted in a position similar to that of insulin, i.e. equivalent to a protein of 6000 daltons. Using an isocratic high performance liquid chromatography system, the plant immunoactivity eluted earlier, and thus was more hydrophilic, than most of the common mammalian insulins, including pork insulin. The interaction of the plant material with anti-insulin antibodies in a radioimmunoassay was confirmed by using an affinity column of anti-insulin antibodies which adsorbed the plant immunoactivity at neutral pH, and released the material with acid elution. Using a quantitative double radioimmunoassay, the plant insulin-like material was distinguished immunologically from chicken insulin. Although the plant insulin-like material is clearly distinct from pork insulin chromatographically, and from chicken insulin immunologically, it resembles vertebrate insulins in its overall configuration. The plant insulin-like material bound to insulin receptors on IM-9 lymphocytes and stimulated glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in isolated adipocytes from young rats. The bioactivity was neutralized in the presence of anti-insulin antibodies, but not in the presence of normal guinea pig IgG. The role of this insulin-like material in plants is unknown but its existence is consistent with an early evolutionary origin of the insulin messenger peptide family. Alternatively we cannot exclude a later convergent development of this family or introduction of vertebrate DNA into plants."
https://openalex.org/W1528570419,"recA binding to left-handed Z-DNA was measured using nitrocellulose filter binding assays with four DNA polymers with defined nucleotide sequences and four recombinant plasmids. Two to 7-fold preferential binding of recA to Z-DNA polymers was observed. Left-handed Z-DNA polymer binding by recA required ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analog, ATP(gamma S), while ADP inhibited binding. Complex formation with both B- and Z-forms was influenced by polymer length; recA bound longer DNAs better. recA binding to recombinant plasmids containing supercoil-stabilized Z-DNA was essentially similar to that found for the control vector; thus, no preferential binding of recA to the Z-form was observed. Comparative experiments with the rec1 protein of Ustilago maydis and the Escherichia coli recA protein were performed. In our hands, recA and rec1 have a similar capacity for binding left-handed Z-DNA polymers and for binding recombinant plasmids containing B- and/or Z-regions. recA contains a left-handed Z-DNA-stimulated ATPase activity. This activity differs from the right-handed B-DNA-stimulated activity since it is less sensitive to increasing pH. The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis in B-DNA/Z-DNA mixing experiments showed that the turnover of the Z-DNA recA complex was slower than for B-DNA suggesting that left-handed Z-DNA is more stably bound by recA. Our results are consistent with the postulate that left-handed Z-DNA is involved in genetic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1592273056,"Yeast external invertase is a glycoprotein that exists as a dimer that can associate to form tetramers, hexamers, and octamers (Chu, F., Watorek, W., and Maley, F. (1983) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 223, 543-555; Esmon, P. C., Esmon, B. E., Schauer, I. E., Taylor, A., and Schekman, R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem., 262, 4395-4401), a process that is facilitated by the attached oligosaccharide chains. We have studied this association by high performance liquid chromatography on a gel filtration matrix, by which procedure wild-type bakers' yeast invertase gives two peaks, and invertase from a core mutant (mnn1 mnn9) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180 gives three peaks. Concentration of an invertase solution by freezing drives the dimers into higher aggregates that, at 30 degrees C, re-equilibrate to a mixture of smaller forms, the composition of which depends on pH, concentration, and time. The invertase from a mutant, mnn1 mnn9 dpg1, which underglycosylates its glycoproteins and produces invertase with 4-7 oligosaccharide chains, forms oligomers of much lower stability than the mnn1 mnn9 invertase, which has 8-11 carbohydrate chains. Both of these mutants release external invertase from the periplasm into the medium during growth, but we conclude that defects in the cell wall structure may be more important in this release than an altered tendency of the invertases to aggregate. Investigation of aggregate formation by electron microscopy revealed that all invertases, including the internal nonglycosylated enzyme, form octamers under appropriate conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1494198800,"The biosynthesis of S-adenosylmethionine occurs in a unique enzymatic reaction in which the synthesis of the sulfonium center results from displacement of the entire polyphosphate chain from MgATP. The mechanism of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (ATP:L-methionine s-adenosyltransferase) from Escherichia coli has been characterized by kinetic isotope effect and substrate trapping measurements. Replacement of 12C by 14C at the 5' carbon of ATP yields a primary Vmax/Km isotope effect (12C/14C) of 1.128 +/- 0.003 in the absence of added monovalent cation activator (K+). At saturating K+ concentrations (10 mM) the primary isotope effect diminishes slightly to 1.108 +/- 0.003, indicating that the step in the mechanism involving bond breaking at the 5' carbon of MgATP has a small commitment to catalysis at conditions near Vmax. No alpha-secondary 3H isotope effect from [5'-3H]ATP was detected, (1H/3H) = 1.000 +/- 0.002, even in the absence of KCl. There was no significant primary sulfur isotope effect from [35S]methionine at KCl concentrations from 0 to 10 mM. Substitution of the methyl group of methionine with tritium yielded a beta-secondary isotope effect (CH3/C3H3) = 1.009 +/- 0.008 independent of KCl concentration. The reaction of selenomethionine and [5'-14C]ATP gave a primary isotope effect of 1.097 +/- 0.006, independent of KCl concentration. Substrate trapping experiments demonstrated that the step in the mechanism involving bond making to sulfur of methionine does not have a significant commitment to catalysis at 0.25 mM KCl, therefore intrinsic isotope effects were observed. Substrate trapping experiments indicated that the step involving bond breaking at carbon 5' of MgATP has a 10% commitment to catalysis at 0.25 mM KCl. The isotope effects are interpreted in terms of an Sn2-like transition state structure in which bonding of the C5' is symmetric with respect to the departing tripolyphosphate group and the incoming sulfur of methionine. With selenomethionine as substrate an earlier transition state is implicated."
https://openalex.org/W1528384132,"The cloned carAB operon of Escherichia coli coding for the small and large subunits of carbamyl phosphate synthetase has been used to construct a recombinant plasmid with a 4.16 kilobase ClaI fragment of the car operon that lacks the major promoters, P1 and P2. The plasmid, pHN12, carries a functional carB gene. A mutant E. coli strain lacking both subunits of carbamyl phosphate synthetase when transformed with pHN12 overproduces the large subunit by 200-fold (8-10% of the cellular protein). The elevated levels of the large subunit enable the transformed cells to utilize NH3 but not glutamine as nitrogen donor for carbamyl phosphate synthesis. The large subunit has been purified from the overexpressing strain. The purified native large subunit is capable of synthesizing carbamyl phosphate from ammonia, HCO-3, and ATP. The kinetic properties of the large subunit compared with the holoenzyme indicate that the Michaelis constants of the large subunit for HCO-3 and ATP are modulated by its association with the small glutamine binding subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1532699211,"An essential initial step in fertilization in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is an intracellular membrane fusion event in the sperm known as the acrosome reaction. This Ca2+-dependent, exocytotic process involves fusion of the membrane of the acrosomal vesicle and the plasma membrane. Recently, metalloendoproteases requiring divalent metals have been implicated in several Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion events in other biological systems. In view of the suggested involvement of Zn2+ in the sea urchin sperm acrosome reaction (Clapper, D.L., Davis, J.A., Lamothe, P.J., Patton, C., and Epel, D. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 1817-1824) and the fact that Zn2+ is a metal cofactor for metalloendoproteases, we investigated the potential role of this protease in the acrosome reaction. A soluble metalloendoprotease was demonstrated and characterized in sperm homogenates using the fluorogenic protease substrate succinyl-alanine-alanine-phenylalanine-4-aminomethylcoumarin. The protease was inhibited by the metal chelators EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, and activity of the inactive apoenzyme could be reconstituted with Zn2+. The metalloendoprotease substrate and inhibitors blocked the acrosome reaction induced either by egg jelly coat or by ionophore, but had no effect on the influx of Ca2+. These observations suggest that inhibition occurs at a step independent of Ca2+ entry. Overall, the results of this study provide strong indirect evidence that the acrosome reaction requires the action of metalloendoprotease."
https://openalex.org/W1500578210,"The receptor on human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes or PMN) that mediates cellular adherence has been purified from the peripheral blood PMN obtained from an individual with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This receptor consists of two noncovalently associated subunits, designated alpha M (Mac-1 alpha, CD11b) (Mr = 170,000) and beta (Mac-1 beta, CDw18) (Mr = 100,000), respectively, which are identical on normal and CML PMN. The subunits were purified by monoclonal antibody 60.1-Sepharose (anti-alpha M) affinity chromatography and separated in 5-nmol quantities by high pressure liquid chromatography on a TSK-4000 gel filtration column. Subunits were characterized by amino acid composition, NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, and carbohydrate content. The NH2-terminal sequence of the human PMN alpha M subunit contains regions of homology with the human platelet glycoprotein IIb alpha. We conclude that nanomole amounts of individual alpha M and beta subunits of the receptor on human PMN that mediates cellular adherence can be isolated and separated using CML PMN."

https://openalex.org/W1561181474,The sequences responsible for specifying and regulating the transcription of the yeast ribosomal protein gene CYH2 have been studied using deletion analysis. We have identified a region between 235 and 260 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation which is necessary for transcription to occur. This region includes sequences which have been identified upstream of most yeast ribosomal protein genes. In the wild type gene the initiation of transcription occurs at several sites spread over about 15 nucleotides. Two TATA regions separated by about 40 nucleotides direct initiation to those sites. Deletion of those two TATA regions reveals a cryptic TATA which directs transcription initiation to specific sites downstream.
https://openalex.org/W1508177948,"A variety of proteases have been evaluated as potential structural and conformational probes of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated phosphorylase kinase. In general, the enzyme's alpha subunit is rapidly degraded, followed in most cases by hydrolysis of the beta subunit; the gamma subunit is resistant to most proteases. Trypsin clearly distinguishes between the nonactivated and activated conformers of phosphorylase kinase, in that the beta subunit in phosphorylated enzyme, as opposed to nonphosphorylated enzyme, is markedly protected from tryptic attack. In contrast, only a small difference in the rates of proteolysis of the alpha subunit in phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated enzyme is seen, even when a protease is used that is highly selective for the alpha subunit, such as chymotrypsin or endoproteinase Arg C. Incubation of nonphosphorylated phosphorylase kinase with either Mg2+ or Ca2+, which are activating cations, also protects the beta subunit from tryptic hydrolysis, whereas Mn2+, which inhibits the kinase activity, has little effect on proteolysis. The allosteric activator ADP also causes the beta subunit to become refractory to trypsin and mimics the effects of phosphorylation. Similar effector-induced conformational changes in the beta subunit are also observed with enzyme in which the alpha subunit has previously been selectively destroyed. These data indicate that activation of phosphorylase kinase by dissimilar mechanisms is associated with a conformational change in the enzyme's beta subunit that is detectable by trypsin and confirm earlier studies from this laboratory employing a chemical cross-linker as a conformational probe for activated and nonactivated conformers of the enzyme (Fitzgerald, T. J., and Carlson, G. M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3266-3274)."
https://openalex.org/W1665310165,"DNA precursor imbalances are known to be mutagenic in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. Almost certainly, such mutagenesis involves competition between correctly and incorrectly base-paired precursors at replication sites. Since other factors may be involved, it is important to identify specific mutations induced by specific pool imbalances. Using bacteriophage T4, we have developed a system for such analysis. We prepare double mutants of T4; one mutation affects a phage-coded enzyme of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) metabolism, while the second is an rII mutation known to revert along a specific pathway. We determine dNTP pools in infection by such a mutant and measure both the spontaneous reversion rate of the rII mutation and, in some cases, the nucleotide sequence at the mutant site. In this paper we analyze mutations induced by a deficiency of T4-encoded deoxycytidylate deaminase. This causes pools of 5-hydroxymethyl-dCTP to expand some 30-fold, while dTTP pools contract. This specifically stimulates AT-to-GC reversion. One of the four AT-to-GC reverters tested, rIIUV215, increases its reversion rate at least 1000-fold under these pool-imbalance conditions, while the other mutants tested show increases of only about 10-fold. Therefore, factors other than dNTP competition, including local DNA sequence environment, must be invoked to fully explain mechanisms of dNTP pool imbalance-induced mutagenesis. We discuss models for this, and we also report unexpected effects of the dCMP deaminase deficiency upon pools of ribonucleoside triphosphates."
https://openalex.org/W1567067113,"The cytosol fraction of porcine leukocytes contained 5-lipoxygenase, the activity of which was masked by a predominant activity of 12-lipoxygenase. The 5-lipoxygenase was partially purified to a specific activity of about 10 nmol of arachidonic acid oxygenated/min/mg of protein and given to mice as an antigen to prepare monoclonal antibodies against the enzyme. Two species of antibodies recognized separate sites of the 5-lipoxygenase protein and did not cross-react with 12-lipoxygenase. They were utilized to develop a peroxidase-linked immunoassay of sandwich-type, which allowed a quantitative determination of the 5-lipoxygenase protein. The assay was applied to a screening of the 5-lipoxygenase content in various porcine tissues. By far the highest content of 5-lipoxygenase was found in leukocytes. About one-tenth the amount of the enzyme was found in lung, pancreas, ileum, and thymus, which could not be attributed to the contaminating leukocytes in these tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1526601454,"We have identified 2'(3')-trinitrophenyl-ATP to be an inhibitor of the ATP-dependent initiation complex formation reaction between the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and primed DNA. The inhibitor is specific for the initiation stage; once initiation complexes are formed the subsequent elongation reaction is unaffected. Three ATP-dependent DNA polymerase III holoenzyme reactions can be independently assayed: the ATP-dependent formation of initiation complexes, ATP binding, and the primed DNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP. Trinitrophenyl ATP inhibits all three reactions to a similar extent with an apparent Ki between 6 and 15 microM in the presence of 5 microM ATP. This suggests all of these reactions are related and that they proceed through a common ATP-binding site. We include an improved purification of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme in this report."
https://openalex.org/W1543814946,"Abstract Upon internalization, epidermal growth factor (EGF) is proteolytically processed from its COOH terminus as it traverses intracellular vesicles and lysosomes. This report describes experiments which were conducted to determine whether lysosomotropic amines such as methylamine, which are known to inhibit degradation of EGF, are able to significantly inhibit the COOH-terminal processing of EGF, and whether disruption of EGF processing would negatively affect EGF-stimulated events such as DNA synthesis and induction of specific mRNA species. The results of these experiments indicated that, whereas methylamine treatment had no effect on EGF binding or internalization, vesicular translocation from endocytic vesicles to lysosomes was halted and processing of EGF was severely inhibited. The stimulation of DNA synthesis beginning 12 h after EGF exposure was also markedly inhibited by methylamine treatment. However, addition of methylamine alone produced a non-specific inhibition of DNA synthesis. The ability of EGF to induce specific transcription of the rat transin gene within 6 h of treatment was also not inhibited by methylamine treatment, but was actually increased in the presence of methylamine. These results suggest that at least some early transcriptionally regulated events induced by EGF do not require vesicular processing of EGF (or its receptor) and that the signal transduced by the binding of EGF to its receptor occurs in, or proximal to, the endocytic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1590907266,"All double-stranded RNA viruses have capsid-associated transcriptase activities. In the yeast viruses, as in reovirus, transcription appears to be the first stage of replication. We have found that the yeast viral transcriptase initiates RNA transcription in vitro and that the resultant plus strand RNA has the 5' terminus ppGp. No pre-existing primers are normally utilized in vitro. Like other double-stranded RNA viruses of eucaryotes, the yeast viruses have a primer-independent capsid-associated transcriptase. Unlike these viruses of higher eucaryotes, the yeast viruses synthesize uncapped mRNAs. Viral particles with only a single major capsid polypeptide are active in transcription and replication, while reovirus particles active in transcription have 5 or 6 polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1583883243,"Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) chloroplastic and cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetases differ in their structural and catalytic properties and do not share common antigenic determinants. Polyadenylated mRNAs, prepared from young bean leaves, have been translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system. The newly synthesized polypeptides have been submitted to immunoadsorption on protein A-Sepharose in the presence of the antibodies raised against the chloroplastic or the cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase. The specificity of the immunoadsorption has been checked by competition experiments involving the pure enzymes. Bean chloroplastic leucyl-tRNA synthetase is synthesized in vitro from a polyadenylated mRNA as a precursor polypeptide of 130 kDa, which is somewhat larger than the mature enzyme of 120 kDa. Bean cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase is synthesized in vitro as a polypeptide which has the size of the mature monomer (130 kDa). Processing of the precursor polypeptide of the chloroplastic leucyl-tRNA synthetase, yielding the mature enzyme, has been obtained by performing the in vitro translation in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. These results suggest that in vivo bean chloroplastic leucyl-tRNA synthetase could be synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor which would be transported into the chloroplasts."
