https://openalex.org/W2803430447,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy targeting CD19 is an effective treatment for refractory B cell malignancies, especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 1 . Although a majority of patients will achieve a complete response following a single infusion of CD19-targeted CAR-modified T cells (CD19 CAR T cells)2-4, the broad applicability of this treatment is hampered by severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is characterized by fever, hypotension and respiratory insufficiency associated with elevated serum cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6)2,5. CRS usually occurs within days of T cell infusion at the peak of CAR T cell expansion. In ALL, it is most frequent and more severe in patients with high tumor burden2-4. CRS may respond to IL-6 receptor blockade but can require further treatment with high dose corticosteroids to curb potentially lethal severity2-9. Improved therapeutic and preventive treatments require a better understanding of CRS physiopathology, which has so far remained elusive. Here we report a murine model of CRS that develops within 2-3 d of CAR T cell infusion and that is potentially lethal and responsive to IL-6 receptor blockade. We show that its severity is mediated not by CAR T cell-derived cytokines, but by IL-6, IL-1 and nitric oxide (NO) produced by recipient macrophages, which enables new therapeutic interventions."

We optimize cytidine (BE4) and adenine (ABE7.10) base editors by modification of nuclear localization signals (NLS) and codon usage, and ancestral reconstruction of the deaminase component. The resulting BE4max, AncBE4max, and ABEmax editors correct pathogenic SNPs with substantially increased efficiency in a variety of mammalian cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2804621837,"The human gut microbiome plays a key role in human health 1 , but 16S characterization lacks quantitative functional annotation 2 . The fecal metabolome provides a functional readout of microbial activity and can be used as an intermediate phenotype mediating host–microbiome interactions 3 . In this comprehensive description of the fecal metabolome, examining 1,116 metabolites from 786 individuals from a population-based twin study (TwinsUK), the fecal metabolome was found to be only modestly influenced by host genetics (heritability (H2) = 17.9%). One replicated locus at the NAT2 gene was associated with fecal metabolic traits. The fecal metabolome largely reflects gut microbial composition, explaining on average 67.7% (±18.8%) of its variance. It is strongly associated with visceral-fat mass, thereby illustrating potential mechanisms underlying the well-established microbial influence on abdominal obesity. Fecal metabolic profiling thus is a novel tool to explore links among microbiome composition, host phenotypes, and heritable complex traits. Comprehensive fecal metabolic profiling in 786 individuals from TwinsUK provides insights into the influence of host genetics and gut microbial composition on metabolites that may mediate microbiome-associated phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2803222616,"The ubiquitously expressed non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, is involved in signal transduction downstream of multiple growth factor, cytokine and integrin receptors1. Its requirement for complete RAS–MAPK activation and its role as a negative regulator of JAK–STAT signaling have established SHP2 as an essential player in oncogenic signaling pathways1–7. Recently, a novel potent allosteric SHP2 inhibitor was presented as a viable therapeutic option for receptor tyrosine kinase-driven cancers, but was shown to be ineffective in KRAS-mutant tumor cell lines in vitro8. Here, we report a central and indispensable role for SHP2 in oncogenic KRAS-driven tumors. Genetic deletion of Ptpn11 profoundly inhibited tumor development in mutant KRAS-driven murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. We provide evidence for a critical dependence of mutant KRAS on SHP2 during carcinogenesis. Deletion or inhibition of SHP2 in established tumors delayed tumor progression but was not sufficient to achieve tumor regression. However, SHP2 was necessary for resistance mechanisms upon blockade of MEK. Synergy was observed when both SHP2 and MEK were targeted, resulting in sustained tumor growth control in murine and human patient-derived organoids and xenograft models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. Our data indicate the clinical utility of dual SHP2/MEK inhibition as a targeted therapy approach for KRAS-mutant cancers. The phosphatase SHP2 is required for mutant KRAS signaling in pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancers and drives resistance to MEK inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2804804971,"RAS mutations are frequent in human cancer, especially in pancreatic, colorectal and non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs)1-3. Inhibition of the RAS oncoproteins has proven difficult4, and attempts to target downstream effectors5-7 have been hampered by the activation of compensatory resistance mechanisms8. It is also well established that KRAS-mutant tumors are insensitive to inhibition of upstream growth factor receptor signaling. Thus, epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy is only effective in KRAS wild-type colon cancers9,10. Consistently, inhibition of SHP2 (also known as PTPN11), which links receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway11,12, was shown to be ineffective in KRAS-mutant or BRAF-mutant cancer cell lines13. Our data also indicate that SHP2 inhibition in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells under normal cell culture conditions has little effect. By contrast, SHP2 inhibition under growth factor-limiting conditions in vitro results in a senescence response. In vivo, inhibition of SHP2 in KRAS-mutant NSCLC also provokes a senescence response, which is exacerbated by MEK inhibition. Our data identify SHP2 inhibition as an unexpected vulnerability of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells that remains undetected in cell culture and can be exploited therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2951391875,"Subclonal architectures are prevalent across cancer types. However, the temporal evolutionary dynamics that produce tumor subclones remain unknown. Here we measure clone dynamics in human cancers by using computational modeling of subclonal selection and theoretical population genetics applied to high-throughput sequencing data. Our method determined the detectable subclonal architecture of tumor samples and simultaneously measured the selective advantage and time of appearance of each subclone. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach and the extent to which evolutionary dynamics are recorded in the genome. Application of our method to high-depth sequencing data from breast, gastric, blood, colon and lung cancer samples, as well as metastatic deposits, showed that detectable subclones under selection, when present, consistently emerged early during tumor growth and had a large fitness advantage (>20%). Our quantitative framework provides new insight into the evolutionary trajectories of human cancers and facilitates predictive measurements in individual tumors from widely available sequencing data."
https://openalex.org/W2803229193,"Defining the environmental context in which genes enhance disease susceptibility can provide insight into the pathogenesis of complex disorders. We report that the intra-uterine environment modulates the association of schizophrenia with genomic risk (in this study, genome-wide association study–derived polygenic risk scores (PRSs)). In independent samples from the United States, Italy, and Germany, the liability of schizophrenia explained by PRS is more than five times greater in the presence of early-life complications (ELCs) compared with their absence. Patients with ELC histories have significantly higher PRS than patients without ELC histories, which is confirmed in additional samples from Germany and Japan. The gene set composed of schizophrenia loci that interact with ELCs is highly expressed in placenta, is differentially expressed in placentae from complicated in comparison with normal pregnancies, and is differentially upregulated in placentae from male compared with female offspring. Pathway analyses reveal that genes driving the PRS-ELC interaction are involved in cellular stress response; genes that do not drive such interaction implicate orthogonal biological processes (for example, synaptic function). We conclude that a subset of the most significant genetic variants associated with schizophrenia converge on a developmental trajectory sensitive to events that affect the placental response to stress, which may offer insights into sex biases and primary prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2804957989,"The role of KRAS, when activated through canonical mutations, has been well established in cancer1. Here we explore a secondary means of KRAS activation in cancer: focal high-level amplification of the KRAS gene in the absence of coding mutations. These amplifications occur most commonly in esophageal, gastric and ovarian adenocarcinomas2-4. KRAS-amplified gastric cancer models show marked overexpression of the KRAS protein and are insensitive to MAPK blockade owing to their capacity to adaptively respond by rapidly increasing KRAS-GTP levels. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the guanine-exchange factors SOS1 and SOS2 or the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 can attenuate this adaptive process and that targeting these factors, both genetically and pharmacologically, can enhance the sensitivity of KRAS-amplified models to MEK inhibition in both in vitro and in vivo settings. These data demonstrate the relevance of copy-number amplification as a mechanism of KRAS activation, and uncover the therapeutic potential for targeting of these tumors through combined SHP2 and MEK inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2803499181,"The androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in the development of the normal prostate as well as prostate cancer. Using an integrative transcriptomic analysis of prostate cancer cell lines and tissues, we identified ARLNC1 (AR-regulated long noncoding RNA 1) as an important long noncoding RNA that is strongly associated with AR signaling in prostate cancer progression. Not only was ARLNC1 induced by the AR protein, but ARLNC1 stabilized the AR transcript via RNA–RNA interaction. ARLNC1 knockdown suppressed AR expression, global AR signaling and prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data support a role for ARLNC1 in maintaining a positive feedback loop that potentiates AR signaling during prostate cancer progression and identify ARLNC1 as a novel therapeutic target. ARLNC1 is a newly discovered lncRNA that is induced by androgen receptor (AR) and maintains AR signaling by stabilizing the AR transcript. Knockdown of ARLNC1 suppresses AR expression, AR signaling and prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2805782810,"The formation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized by inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and vascular remodeling. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) immunomodulate aortic inflammation, to mitigate AAA formation viamodulation of microRNA-147. An elastase-treatment model of AAA was used in male C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice. Administration of EVs in elastase-treated WT mice caused a significant attenuation of aortic diameter and mitigated proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cell infiltration, an increase in smooth muscle cell α-actin expression, and a decrease in elastic fiber disruption, compared with untreated mice. A 10-fold up-regulation of microRNA (miR)- 147, a key mediator of macrophage inflammatory responses, was observed in murine aortic tissue in elastase-treated mice compared with controls on d 14. EVs derived from MSCs transfected with miR-147 mimic, but not with miR-147 inhibitor, attenuated aortic diameter, inflammation, and leukocyte infiltration in elastase-treated mice. In vitrostudies of human aortic tissue explants and murine-derived CD11b+ macrophages induced proinflammatory cy tokines after elastase treatment, and the expression was attenuated by cocultures with EVs transfected with miR-147 mimic, but not with miR-147 inhibitor. Thus, our findings define a critical role of MSC-derived EVs in attenuation of aortic inflammation and macrophage activation via miR-147 during AAA formation.—Spinosa, M., Lu, G., Su, G., Bontha, S.

https://openalex.org/W2807169763,"Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) account for ~25% of all invasive carcinomas and represent a large subset of aggressive, high-grade tumors. Despite current research focused on understanding the genetic landscape of TNBCs, reliable prognostic and predictive biomarkers remain limited. Although dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key players in many cancer types, the role of miRNAs in TNBC disease progression is unclear. We performed miRNA profiling of 51 TNBCs by next-generation sequencing to reveal differentially expressed miRNAs. A total of 228 miRNAs were identified. Three miRNAs (miR-224–5p, miR-375, and miR-205–5p) separated the tumors based on basal status. Six miRNAs (high let-7d-3p, miR-203b-5p, and miR-324–5p; low miR-30a-3p, miR-30a-5p, and miR-199a-5p) were significantly associated with decreased overall survival (OS) and 5 miRNAs (high let-7d-3p; low miR-30a-3p, miR-30a-5p, miR-30c-5p, and miR-128–3p) with decreased relapse-free survival (RFS). On multivariate analysis, high expression of let-7d-3p and low expression of miR-30a were independent predictors of decreased OS and RFS. High expression of miR-95–3p was significantly associated with decreased OS and RFS in patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Five miRNAs (let-7d-3p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30c-5p, miR-128–3p, and miR-95–3p) were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Our findings unveil novel prognostic and predictive miRNA targets for TNBC, including a miRNA signature that predicts patient response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. This may improve clinical management and/or lead to the development of novel therapies.—Turashvili, G., Lightbody, E. D., Tyryshkin, K., SenGupta, S. K., Elliott, B.

https://openalex.org/W2806658823,"The development of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) occurs by various mechanisms and appears to be almost inevitable, even in patients with lung cancer who initially respond well to EGFR-TKIs. Consequently, considerable efforts have been made to develop more effective EGFR-TKIs. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms behind TKI resistance is essential for improving EGFR-TKI thera peutic efficacy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we discovered that overexpression of antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-containing Nrf2 target genes by increased transactivation of Nrf2 occurred because of an acquired Keap1 mutation in the gefitinib-resistant (GR) NSCLC cell line we established. These GR cells also acquired cross-resistance to the irreversible EGFR-TKIs, afatinib and osimertinib, and showed increased viability, invasiveness, proliferation, and tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. These results were confirmed by the fact that inhibition of Nrf2 activity, either by treatment with brusatol or by inducing expression of exogenously introduced wild type Keap1, suppressed tumor cell proliferation and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that disruption of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway is one of the mechanisms by which EGFR-TKI resistance occurs, a fact that must be considered when treating patients with EGFR-TKI.—Park, S.-H., Kim, J.

https://openalex.org/W2806553203,"Loss of functional islet β-cell mass through cellular death or dedifferentiation is thought to lead to dysglycemia during the progression from obesity to type 2 diabetes. To assess these processes in a mouse model of obesity, we performed measures of circulating cell-free differentially methylated insulin II ( Ins2) DNA as a biomarker of β-cell death and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A3 (ALDH1A3) and forkhead box 01 (Foxo1) immunostaining as markers of β-cell dedifferentiation. Eight-week-old, C57BL/6J mice were fed a low-fat diet (LFD; 10% kcal from fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) and were followed longitudinally for up to 13 wk to measure glycemic control and β-cell mass, death, and dedifferentiation. Compared with LFD controls, β-cell mass increased during the feeding period in HFD animals, and statistically greater β-cell death (unmethylated Ins2) was detectable at 2 and 6 wk after diet initiation. Those times correspond to periods when significant step increases in fasting glucose and glucose intolerance, respectively, were detected. ALDH1A3 and Foxo1 immunostaining of the pancreas revealed evidence of β-cell dedifferentiation by 13 wk when fed an HFD, but not in LFD controls. In conclusion, early episodic β-cell death may be a feature of cellular turnover correlated with changes in glycemia during β-cell mass accrual in obesity, whereas β-cell dedifferentiation may be a feature seen later in established disease.-Tersey, S.

https://openalex.org/W2807153999,"Numerous feasible methods for inserting large fragments of exogenous DNA sequences into the zebrafish genome have been developed, as has genome editing technology using programmable nucleases. However, the coding sequences of targeted endogenous genes are disrupted, and the expression patterns of inserted exogenous genes cannot completely recapitulate those of endogenous genes. Here we describe the establishment of a novel strategy for endogenous promoter-driven and microhomology-mediated end-joining-dependent integration of a donor vector using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9. We successfully integrated mCherry into the final coding sequence of targeted genes to generate seamless transgenic zebrafish lines with high efficiency. This novel seamless transgenesis technique not only maintained the integrity of the endogenous gene but also did not disrupt the function of targeted gene. Therefore, our microhomology-mediated end-joining-mediated transgenesis strategy may have broader applications in gene therapy. Moreover, this novel seamless gene-editing strategy in zebrafish provides a valuable new transgenesis technique, which was driven by endogenous promoters and in vivo animal reporter modes for translational medicine. It is expected to be a standard gene-editing technique in the field of zebrafish, leading to some important breakthroughs for studies in early embryogenesis.-Luo, J.-J., Bian, W.-P., Liu, Y., Huang, H.-Y., Yin, Q., Yang, X.-J., Pei, D.-S.

https://openalex.org/W2806962684,"Postnatal overfeeding increases the risk of chronic diseases later in life, including obesity, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and type 2 diabetes. Epigenetic mechanisms might underlie the long-lasting effects associated with early nutrition. Here we aimed to explore the molecular pathways involved in early development of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, and we examined the potential contribution of DNA methylation and histone modifications to long-term programming of metabolic disease. We used a well-characterized mouse model of neonatal overfeeding and early adiposity by litter size reduction. Neonatal overfeeding led to hepatic insulin resistance very early in life that persisted throughout adulthood despite normalizing food intake. Up-regulation of monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase ( Mogat) 1 conceivably mediates hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance through increasing intracellular diacylglycerol content. Early and sustained deregulation of Mogat1 was associated with a combination of histone modifications that might favor Mogat1 expression. In sum, postnatal overfeeding causes extremely rapid derangements of hepatic insulin sensitivity that remain relatively stable until adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly histone modifications, could contribute to such long-lasting effects. Our data suggest that targeting hepatic monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activity during early life might provide a novel strategy to improve hepatic insulin sensitivity and prevent late-onset insulin resistance and fatty liver disease.-Ramon-Krauel, M., Pentinat, T., Bloks, V.

https://openalex.org/W2807382998,"Cytogenetic studies show that there is great karyotypic diversity in order Testudines (2n = 26-68), and that this may be mainly attributed to the presence/absence of microchromosomes. Members of the Podocnemididae family have the smallest diploid numbers of this order (2n = 26-28), which may be a derived condition of the group. Diverse studies suggest that repetitive-DNA-rich sites generally act as hotspots for double-strand breaks and chromosomal reorganization. In this context, we used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to map telomeric sequences (TTAGGG)n, 45S rDNA, and the genes encoding histones H1 and H3 in two species of genus Podocnemis. We also observed conservation of the 45S rDNA and H1 histone sequences (probable case of conserved synteny), but multiple conserved and non-conserved clusters of H3 genes, which colocalized with the interstitial telomeric sequences in the Podocnemis genome. Our results suggest that fusions have occurred between macro and microchromosomes or between microchromosomes, leading to the observed reduction in diploid number in the family Podocnemididae."
https://openalex.org/W2805926119,"LInkers of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes, composed of SUN and KASH-domain proteins, span the nuclear envelope and physically connect the nuclear interior to cytoskeletal elements. Most human cells contain two SUN proteins, Sun1 and Sun2, and several KASH-proteins suggesting that multiple functionally distinct LINC complexes co-exist in the nuclear envelope. We show here, however, that while Sun1 and Sun2 in HeLa cells are each able to bind KASH-domains, Sun1 is more efficiently incorporated into LINC complexes under normal growth conditions. Furthermore, the balance of Sun1 and Sun2 incorporated into LINC complexes is cell type-specific and is correlated with SRF/Mkl1-dependent gene expression. In addition, we found that Sun1 has a LINC complex-independent role in transcriptional control, possibly by regulating the SRF/Mkl1 pathway. Together, these data reveal novel insights into the mechanisms of LINC complex regulation and demonstrate that Sun1 modulates gene expression independently of its incorporation into LINC complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2807341376,"Background The endocannabinoid (eCB) 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a known modulator of inflammation and ligand to both, pro-inflammatory cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and anti-inflammatory CB2. While the role of both receptors in atherogenesis has been studied extensively, the significance of 2-AG for atherogenesis is less well characterized. Methods The impact of 2-AG on atherogenesis was studied in two treatment groups of ApoE-/- mice. One group received the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL)-inhibitor JZL184 [5 mg/kg i.p.], which impairs 2-AG degradation and thus causes elevated 2-AG levels, the other group received vehicle for four weeks. Simultaneously, both groups were fed a high-cholesterol diet. The atherosclerotic plaque burden was assessed in frozen sections through the aortic sinus following oil red O staining and infiltrating macrophages were detected by immunofluorescence targeting CD68. In vitro, the effect of 2-AG on B6MCL macrophage migration was assessed by Boyden chamber experiments. Transcription of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors in macrophages was assessed by qPCR. Results As expected, application of the MAGL-inhibitor JZL184 resulted in a significant increase in 2-AG levels in vascular tissue (98.2 ± 16.1 nmol/g vs. 27.3 ± 4.5 nmol/g; n = 14–16; p < 0.001). ApoE-/- mice with elevated 2-AG levels displayed a significantly increased plaque burden compared to vehicle treated controls (0.44 ± 0.03 vs. 0.31 ± 0.04; n = 14; p = 0.0117). This was accompanied by a significant increase in infiltrating macrophages within the atherosclerotic vessel wall (0.33 ± 0.02 vs. 0.27 ± 0.01; n = 13–14; p = 0.0076). While there was no alteration to the white blood counts of JZL184-treated animals, 2-AG enhanced macrophage migration in vitro by 1.8 ± 0.2 -fold (n = 4–6; p = 0.0393) compared to vehicle, which was completely abolished by co-administration of either CB1- or CB2-receptor-antagonists. qPCR analyses of 2-AG-stimulated macrophages showed an enhanced transcription of the chemokine CCL5 (1.59 ± 0.23 –fold; n = 5–6; p = 0.0589) and its corresponding receptors CCR1 (2.04 ± 0.46 -fold; n = 10–11; p = 0.0472) and CCR5 (2.45 ± 0.62 –fold; n = 5–6; p = 0.0554). Conclusion Taken together, elevated 2-AG levels appear to promote atherogenesis in vivo. Our data suggest that 2-AG promotes macrophage migration, possibly by the CCL5-CCR5/CCR1 axis, and thereby contributes to vascular inflammation. Thus, decreasing vascular 2-AG levels might represent a promising therapeutic strategy in patients suffering from atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2805758137,"Background and aims The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) tends to be lower in Western countries such as central Europe compared with Asia. The virulence of H. pylori is influenced by its subtype composition, most importantly by the presence or absence of different types of cytotoxin-associated gene A(CagA). This study aimed to assess the prevalence of H. pylori and its respective CagA phenotype in a large retrospective cohort of patients with gastric cancer or duodenal ulcer at a Western tertiary referral institution. Methods H. pylori positive gastric biopsy samples from patients diagnosed with the afore mentioned diseases within the past 25 years were re-evaluated by histology for H. pylori and status of gastritis. Confirmed H. pylori positive cases were processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) for H. pylori,CagA, and EastAsiantype CagA. Results The prevalence of H. pylori positive gastric biopsy samples decreased from 20.7% to 2.3% within the study period. Among the gastric cancer patients, the H. pylori positive rate was 16.6%, and didn’t show significant changes over time (p = 0.38). Contrary, the H. pylori positive rate of duodenal ulcer decreased significantlyfrom 40% to 5% (p = 0.01). Within H. pylori positive groups ofboth diseases, CagA was highly detected at IHC (86% and 78%, respectively). Except for a few patients originating from East Asian countries, all CagA detected in this study were of Western type. Conclusion In this first Western investigation on the chronological prevalence of H. pylori and its most relevant subtypes, Western type of CagA was highly detected in two important index diseases of the pathogen. This raises further questions about the virulence of this subtype."
https://openalex.org/W2805253117,"The mechanism that causes genomic instability in nondividing aging cells is unknown. Our previous study of mutant yeast suggested that 2 types of replication-independent endogenous DNA double-strand breaks (RIND-EDSBs) exist and that they play opposing roles. The first type, known as physiologic RIND-EDSBs, were ubiquitous in the G0 phase of both yeast and human cells in certain genomic locations and may act as epigenetic markers. Low RIND-EDSB levels were found in mutants that lacked chromatin-condensing proteins, such as the high-mobility group box (HMGB) proteins and Sir2. The second type is referred to as pathologic RIND-EDSBs. High pathological RIND-EDSB levels were found in DSB repair mutants. Under normal physiologic conditions, these excess RIND-EDSBs are repaired in much the same way as DNA lesions. Here, chronological aging in yeast reduced physiological RIND-EDSBs and cell viability. A strong correlation was observed between the reduction in RIND-EDSBs and viability in aging yeast cells ( r = 0.94, P < 0.0001). We used galactose-inducible HO endonuclease (HO) and nhp6a∆, an HMGB protein mutant, to evaluate the consequences of reduced physiological RIND-EDSB levels. The HO-induced cells exhibited a sustained reduction in RIND-EDSBs at various levels for several days. Interestingly, we found that lower physiologic RIND-EDSB levels resulted in decreased cell viability ( r = 0.69, P < 0.0001). Treatment with caffeine, a DSB repair inhibitor, increased pathological RIND-EDSBs, which were distinguished from physiologic RIND-EDSBs by their lack of sequences prior to DSB in untreated cells [odds ratio (OR) ≤1]. Caffeine treatment in both the HO-induced and nhp6a∆ cells markedly increased OR ≤1 breaks. Therefore, physiological RIND-EDSBs play an epigenetic role in preventing pathological RIND-EDSBs, a type of DNA damage. In summary, the reduction of physiological RIND-EDSB level is a genomic instability mechanism in chronologically aging cells.-Thongsroy, J., Patchsung, M., Pongpanich, M., Settayanon, S., Mutirangura, A. Reduction in replication-independent endogenous DNA double-strand breaks promotes genomic instability during chronological aging in yeast."

Several polymorphisms in the parasite’s kelch gene have been demonstrated to confer artemisinin resistance. While genotypes within the greater Mekong subregion are thoroughly examined in the literature, P. falciparum populations within several areas that do not (yet) have endemic resistance are underrepresented. Results This investigation characterised the Pfkelch13 propeller domains from 153 blood samples of 140 imported cases of P. falciparum malaria in New South Wales from 2010 to 2016. A low level of propeller domain diversity was observed, including the C580Y coding mutation most strongly associated with artemisinin resistance in South East Asia. The resistance genotype was found in a sample originating in Papua New Guinea, where this mutation, or artemisinin treatment failure, have not been previously reported. Sequencing a panel of geographically informative polymorphisms within the organellar genomes identified the C580Y parasite as having Oceanic origins. Patient data analysis revealed that New South Wales, Australia, P. falciparum malaria cases often originated from regions with limited drug resistance screening. Conclusions The C580Y finding from outside of the greater Mekong subregion supports the consensus to upscale molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance outside of South East Asia. The genetic screening results identify a risk of importing resistant falciparum malaria to Australia, supporting an ongoing surveillance protocol to pre-empt treatment failure and contribute to global data gathering."
https://openalex.org/W2806002390,"Objectives The psychological health of men who have sex with men (MSM) has received increased attention in recent years. We thus investigated the psychological status and associated factors among MSM in China. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 248 MSM was conducted from April to September 2015 using Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) in Huludao and Zhengzhou, China. Statistical analyses utilized SPSS version 19.0 for Windows. Results All Cronbach’s α coefficients of the SCL-90 subscales exceeded 0.7, suggesting acceptable reliability. The coefficient range of the collective validity for all the subscales was >0.4. For the divisional validity, each item correlated better with the hypothetical subscale than with other subscales. Collective validity and divisional validity were both acceptable. The four most frequent types of psychological distress among MSM were depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, and anxiety. Results of the univariate analysis revealed that the following groups had significantly higher SCL-90 scores (P < 0.05): peasantry, married MSM, respondents who reported condomless anal intercourse and a greater number of male partners, and respondents who had not undergone psychosocial counseling and whose family or friends did not know about their sexual identity. In a multivariate logistic regression model, the following parameters were independently associated with higher SCL-90 scores: being married (AOR [adjusted odds ratio] = 3.19; 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.96 to 5.93), condomless anal intercourse (AOR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.31), number of male partners (AOR = 1.66 and 1.81; 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.34 and 1.32 to 2.69), family or friends not knowing about sexual identity (AOR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.92), and lack of psychosocial counseling (AOR = 2.09; 95% CI: 1.06 to 4.09). Conclusions Our results indicate that psychological health problems among MSM in China are of concern. It is thus necessary to strengthen intervention efforts, with more emphasis on intervention programs to improve psychological health among Chinese MSM."

Participants were followed up for 4.7 years. At baseline and annually thereafter, biological parameters were assessed. Multivariate and linear mixed models were fit to study the interaction between B-vitamins and MTHFR genotype.Among supplemented participants, concentrations of all three B-vitamins increased during the first year (all p<0.0001) across MTHFR genotype categories. tHcy decreased by 26.3% during the first year (p<0.0001), then steadily increased throughout the 5 years (ptrend<0.001). However, at the end of follow-up, that increase was smaller among TT than among CT or CC subjects (pinteraction<0.02). At baseline, the difference in tHcy concentrations between TT homozygous and CC homozygous subjects was 2.33 μmol/l (p<0.001). After 5 years, that difference was reduced to 1.06 μmol/l and remained statistically significant (p<0.001).Participants with the TT genotype exhibited a lower 5-year decrease in tHcy concentrations following a B-vitamin supplementation than did participants with the CC or CT genotype.Current Controlled Trials # ISRCTN41926726."
https://openalex.org/W2806414454,"Abdominal congestion may play an important role in the cardiorenal syndrome and has been demonstrated to drive disease progression. An animal model for abdominal congestion, without other culprit mechanisms that are often present in patients such as low cardiac output or chronic kidney disease, might be interesting to allow a better study of the pathophysiology of the cardiorenal syndrome. The objective of this study was to develop a clinically relevant and valid rat model with abdominal venous congestion and without pre-existing heart and/or kidney dysfunction. To do so, a permanent surgical constriction (20 Gauge) of the thoracic inferior vena cava (IVC) was applied in male Sprague Dawley rats (IVCc, n = 7), which were compared to sham-operated rats (SHAM, n = 6). Twelve weeks after surgery, abdominal venous pressure (mean: 13.8 vs 4.9 mmHg, p < 0.01), plasma creatinine (p < 0.05), plasma cystatin c (p < 0.01), urinary albumin (p < 0.05), glomerular surface area (p < 0.01) and width of Bowman's space (p < 0.05) of the IVCc group were significantly increased compared to the SHAM group for a comparable absolute body weight between groups (559 vs 530g, respectively, p = 0.73). Conventional cardiac echocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters did not differ significantly between both groups, indicating that cardiac function was not compromised by the surgery. In conclusion, we demonstrate that constriction of the thoracic IVC in adult rats is feasible and significantly increases the abdominal venous pressure to a clinically relevant level, thereby inducing abdominal venous congestion."
https://openalex.org/W2807285899,"One common problem in visualizing real-life networks, including biological pathways, is the large size of these networks. Often times, users find themselves facing slow, non-scaling operations due to network size, if not a ""hairball"" network, hindering effective analysis. One extremely useful method for reducing complexity of large networks is the use of hierarchical clustering and nesting, and applying expand-collapse operations on demand during analysis. Another such method is hiding currently unnecessary details, to later gradually reveal on demand. Major challenges when applying complexity reduction operations on large networks include efficiency and maintaining the user's mental map of the drawing.We developed specialized incremental layout methods for preserving a user's mental map while managing complexity of large networks through expand-collapse and hide-show operations. We also developed open-source JavaScript libraries as plug-ins to the web based graph visualization library named Cytsocape.js to implement these methods as complexity management operations. Through efficient specialized algorithms provided by these extensions, one can collapse or hide desired parts of a network, yielding potentially much smaller networks, making them more suitable for interactive visual analysis.This work fills an important gap by making efficient implementations of some already known complexity management techniques freely available to tool developers through a couple of open source, customizable software libraries, and by introducing some heuristics which can be applied upon such complexity management techniques to ensure preserving mental map of users."

The complex network, a theory, and method for measuring the structure of a complex system can depict the structural characteristics of the internal structure of the researched object by measuring the structural indicators of the social and economic systems, revealing the complex relationships between the inner hierarchies and the external economic functions. In this paper, functions of industrial sectors on the global value chain are to be distinguished with bipartite graph theory, and inter-sector competitive relationships are to be extracted through resource allocation process. Furthermore, quantitative analysis indices will be proposed under the perspective of a complex network, which will be used to bring about simulations on the variation tendencies of economies’ status in different situations of commercial intercourses. Finally, a new econophysics analytical framework of international trade is to be established."
https://openalex.org/W2806179568,"The aim of this study was to verify whether transient inflammatory reactions induced by intra-articular medicinal ozone administration affect joint components, by in vivo evaluation of inflammatory (prostaglandin E2, Substance P, Interleukin-6, Interleukine-1, Tumor Necrosis Factor), anti-inflammatory (Interleukin-10) and oxidative (superoxide dismutase activity and oxidative burst) biomarkers and extracellular matrix degradation products (chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronic acid) in synovial fluid.The effects of medicinal ozone were analyzed at two ozone concentrations (groups A and B, 20 and 40 μg/ml, respectively), using oxygen-injected joints as controls (group C); each group received ten treatments (15 ml gas per treatment). Physical evaluation, evaluation of lameness, ultrasonography, and synovial fluid analysis were performed.All joints presented mild and transient effusion throughout the study. Group B exhibited the highest lameness score on day 14 (P<0.05), detected by the lameness measurement system, probably because of the higher ozone concentration. All groups exhibited increased ultrasonography scores on day 14 (P < 0.05). Groups A and B exhibited increased proteins concentrations on day 21 (P<0.05). There was no change in hyaluronic acid concentration or the percentage of high-molecular weight hyaluronic acid throughout the experiment. Chondroitin sulfate concentrations decreased in group B, and did not change in group A and C, indicating that neither treatment provoked extracellular matrix catabolism. Cytokine and eicosanoid concentrations were not significantly changed.The ozonetherapy did not cause significant inflammation process or cartilage degradation, therefore, ozonetherapy is safe at both evaluated doses."
https://openalex.org/W2805044852,"Blood flow changes during bone graft healing have the potential to provide important information about graft success, as the nutrients, oxygen, circulating cells and growth factors essential for integration are delivered by blood. However, longitudinal monitoring of blood flow changes during graft healing has been a challenge due to limitations in current techniques. To this end, non-invasive diffuse correlation tomography (DCT) was investigated to enable longitudinal monitoring of three-dimensional blood flow changes in deep tissue. Specific to this study, longitudinal blood flow changes were utilized to predict healing outcomes of common interventions for massive bone defects using a common mouse femoral defect model. Weekly blood flow changes were non-invasively measured using a diffuse correlation tomography system for 9 weeks in three types of grafts: autografts (N = 7), allografts (N = 6) and tissue-engineered allografts (N = 6). Healing outcomes were quantified using an established torsion testing method 9 weeks after transplantation. Analysis of the spatial and temporal blood flow reveals that major differences among the three groups were captured in weeks 1–5 after graft transplantation. A multivariate model to predict maximum torque by relative blood flow changes over 5 weeks after graft transplantation was built using partial least squares regression. The results reveal lower bone strength correlates with greater cumulative blood flow over an extended period of time (i.e., 1–5 weeks). The current research demonstrates that DCT-measured blood flow changes after graft transplantation can be utilized to predict long-term healing outcomes in a mouse femoral graft model."
https://openalex.org/W2806828559,"The effects of acute stress on allergic symptoms are little understood. The intention of this clinical study was to study the effects of acute stress and related mediators in allergic rhinitis (AR), taking the wheal and flare reaction in skin prick testing (SPT) as a readout.19 healthy and 21 AR patients were first subjected to SPTs with grass pollen-, birch pollen- and house dust mite allergen extracts, histamine and negative control. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a standardized Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), followed by SPT on the contralateral forearm. Stress responders were identified based on the salivary cortisol levels and State-subscale of State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S). Blood samples were collected before and after TSST and adrenaline, noradrenaline, serotonin, oxytocin, platelet activating factor and prostaglandin D2 were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA).SPT results of 14/21 allergics and 11/19 healthy who responded with stress after TSST were evaluated. No significant differences regarding SPT to allergens or histamine before and after the stress test could be calculated at the group level. But, the wheal and flare sizes after TSST increased or decreased substantially in several individuals, and unmasked sensitization in one ""healthy"" person, which could not be correlated with any mediator tested. The most significant finding, however, was that, independent of TSST, the baseline levels of oxytocin and noradrenaline were significantly higher in allergics.High baseline levels of noradrenaline points toward higher stress levels in allergic patients, which might be counterregulated by elevated oxytocin. Moreover, our data indicate that acute stress may have a significant influence on SPT fidelity in susceptible individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2805153784,"While the cerebral autoregulation sufficiently protects subcortical brain regions during hypoxia or asphyxia, the cerebral cortex is not as adequately protected, which suggests that regulation of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) is area-specific. Hypoxia was induced by inhalation of 5% oxygen, for reoxygenation 100% oxygen was used. Cortical and subcortical CBF (by laser Doppler flowmetry), blood gases, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), heart rate and renal blood flow were constantly monitored. Low dosed urapidil was used for α1A-adrenergic receptor blockade. Western blotting was used to determine adrenergic receptor signalling mediators in brain arterioles. During hypoxia cortical CBF decreased to 72 ± 11% (mean reduction 11 ± 3%, p < 0.001) of baseline, whereas subcortical CBF increased to 168±18% (mean increase 43 ± 5%, p < 0.001). Reoxygenation led to peak CBF of 194 ± 27% in the subcortex, and restored cortical CBF. α1A-Adrenergic blockade led to minor changes in cortical CBF, but massively reduced subcortical CBF during hypoxia and reoxygenation–almost aligning CBF in both brain regions. Correlation analyses revealed that α1A-adrenergic blockade renders all CBF-responses pressure-passive during hypoxia and reoxygenation, and confirmed the necessity of α1A-adrenergic signalling for coupling of CBF-responses to oxygen saturation. Expression levels and activation state of key signalling-mediators of α1-receptors (NOSs, CREB, ERK1/2) did not differ between cortex and subcortex. The dichotomy between subcortical and cortical CBF during hypoxia and reoxygenation critically depends on α1A-adrenergic receptors, but not on differential expression of signalling-mediators: signalling through the α1A-subtype is a prerequisite for cortical/subcortical redistribution of CBF."
https://openalex.org/W2806599671,"For many years, silver nanoparticles, as with other antibacterial nanoparticles, have been extensively used in manufactured products. However, their fate in the environment is unclear and raises questions. We studied the fate of silver nanoparticles in the presence of bacteria under growth conditions that are similar to those found naturally in the environment (that is, bacteria in a stationary phase with low nutrient concentrations). We demonstrated that the viability and the metabolism of a gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, exposed during the stationary phase is unaffected by 1 mg/L of silver nanoparticles. These results can be partly explained by a physical interaction of the poly-gamma-glutamate (PGA) secreted by Bacillus subtilis with the silver nanoparticles. The coating of the silver nanoparticles by the secreted PGA likely results in a loss of the bioavailability of nanoparticles and, consequently, a decrease of their biocidal effect."
https://openalex.org/W2807206286,"One of the main technological trends in the last five years is mass data analysis. This trend is due in part to the emergence of concepts such as social networks, which generate a large volume of data that can provide added value through their analysis. This article is focused on a business and employment-oriented social network. More specifically, it focuses on the analysis of information provided by different users in image form. The images are analyzed to detect whether other existing users have posted or talked about the same image, even if the image has undergone some type of modification such as watermarks or color filters. This makes it possible to establish new connections among unknown users by detecting what they are posting or whether they are talking about the same images. The proposed solution consists of an image matching algorithm, which is based on the rapid calculation and comparison of hashes. However, there is a computationally expensive aspect in charge of revoking possible image transformations. As a result, the image matching process is supported by a distributed forecasting system that enables or disables nodes to serve all the possible requests. The proposed system has shown promising results for matching modified images, especially when compared with other existing systems."
https://openalex.org/W2806226768,"Background Women in sub-Saharan Africa are in urgent need of female-initiated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preventative methods. Vaginal rings are one dosage form in development for delivery of HIV microbicides. However, African women have limited experience with vaginal rings. Objectives This Phase I, randomized, crossover trial assessed and compared the safety, acceptability and adherence of a silicone elastomer placebo vaginal ring, intended as a microbicide delivery method, inserted for a 12-week period in healthy, HIV-negative, sexually active women in South Africa and Tanzania. Methods 170 women, aged 18 to 35 years were enrolled with 88 women randomized to Group A, using a placebo vaginal ring for 12 weeks followed by a 12-week safety observation period. 82 women were randomized to Group B and observed for safety first, followed by a placebo vaginal ring for 12 weeks. Safety was assessed by clinical laboratory assessments, pelvic/colposcopy examinations and adverse events. Possible carry-over effect was addressed by ensuring no signs or symptoms of genital irritation at crossover. Results No safety concerns were identified for any safety variables assessed during the trial. No serious adverse events were reported considered related to the placebo vaginal ring. Vaginal candidiasis was the most common adverse event occurring in 11% of participants during each trial period. Vaginal discharge (2%), vaginal odour (2%), and bacterial vaginitis (2%) were assessed as possibly or probably related to the vaginal ring. Thirty-four percent of participants had sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at screening, compared to 12% of participants who tested positive for STIs at crossover and the final trial visit. Three participants (2%) tested HIV positive during the trial. Conclusions The silicone elastomer vaginal ring had no safety concerns, demonstrating a profile favorable for further development for topical release of antiretroviral-based microbicides."
https://openalex.org/W2805864110,"Dementia is the supreme worldwide burden for welfare and the health care system in the 21st century. The early identification and control of the modifiable risk factors of dementia are important. Global-cognitive health (GCH) metrics, encompassing controllable cardiovascular health (CVH) and non-CVH risk factors of dementia, is a newly developed approach to assess the risk of cognitive impairment. The components of ideal GCH metrics includes better education, non-obesity, normal blood pressure, no smoking, no depression, ideal physical activity, good social integration, normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and normal hearing. This study focuses on the association between ideal GCH metrics and the cognitive function in young adults by investigating the Third Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) database, which has not been reported previously. A total of 1243 participants aged 17 to 39 years were recruited in this study. Cognitive functioning was evaluated by the simple reaction time test (SRTT), symbol-digit substitution test (SDST), and serial digit learning test (SDLT). Participants with significantly higher scores of GCH metrics had better cognitive performance (p for trend <0.01 in three cognitive tests). Moreover, better education, ideal physical activity, good social integration and normal glycated hemoglobin were the optimistic components of ideal GCH metrics associated with better cognitive performance after adjusting for covariates (p < 0.05 in three cognitive tests). These findings emphasize the importance of a preventive strategy for modifiable dementia risk factors to enhance cognitive functioning during adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2807476702,"In occidental societies, high fat and high sugar diets often coincide with episodes of stress. The association is likely to modify brain energy control. Brain insulin signalling is rarely studied in stressed individuals consuming high fat diets. Furthermore the effects of cinnamon supplement are not known in these conditions. Therefore, we exposed rats, over a 12-week period, to a control (C) or a high fat/high fructose (HF/HFr) diet that induces peripheral insulin resistance. A cinnamon supplement (C+CN and HF/HFr +CN) was added or not. After diet exposure, one group of rats was exposed to a 30-min restraint followed by a 10-min open-field test, their combination featuring a moderate stressor, the other rats staying unstressed in their home cages. The insulin signalling in hippocampus and frontal cortex was studied through the mRNA expression of the following genes: insulin receptor (Ir), insulin receptor substrate (Irs1), glucose transporters (Glut1 and Glut3), glycogen synthase (Gys1) and their modulators, Akt1 and Pten. In C rats, stress enhanced the expression of Ir, Irs1, Glut1, Gys1 and Akt1 mRNA. In C+CN rats, stress induced an increase in Pten but a decrease in Gys1 mRNA expression. In HF/HFr rats, stress was associated with an increase in Pten mRNA expression. In HF/HFr+CN rats, stress increased Pten mRNA expression but also decreased Gys1 mRNA expression. This suggests that a single moderate stress favours energy refilling mechanisms, an effect blunted by a previous HF/HFr diet and cinnamon supplement."
