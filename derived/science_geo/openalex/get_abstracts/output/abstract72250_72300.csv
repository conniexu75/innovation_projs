Although assumed previously to be glycoproteins, tile Lewis antigens in plasma are glycosphingolipids Which are taken up by the the erythrocyte membrane from lipoproteins or from aqueous dispersions."
https://openalex.org/W1976451409,"With the use of monopolar recordings for averaged evoked responses, detected signals in a vigilance task are associated with a late positive component which is absent for undetected signals as well as nonsignals. Bipolar recordings obscure the late positive component associated with detected signals. The data suggest that the late positive component represents cerebral processes associated with evaluation of unpredictable changes in stimulation."

By manipulation of flow rates, cells may be exposed to exponentially declining, drug concentrations with half-times of 1.5 hours or less, providing a more realistic parallel to in vivo drug treatment than is obtained by other culture methods."

Addition of d-amphetamine to the perfusion fluid caused a significant increase in the concentration of H(3)-norepinephrine in the effluent."
https://openalex.org/W1981393151,"The probability distribution of the amplitude of scalp electroencephalogram has been investigated in an adult subject in the idle state, and during performance of a mental arithmetic task. Based on a large sample, the electroencephalogram in this subject in the idle state follows a Gaussian (normal) probability function 66 percent of the time. During performance of the arithmetic task, the portion of Gaussian electroencephalogram decreases to 32 percent. The probability function characterizing gross electroencephalographic activity is determined by the degree of mutual interaction of individual cellular generators of wave activity in the tissue underneath the recording electrode. The data imply an increase in the cooperative activity of cortical neuronal elements during performance of a mental task."

These variations result in characteristic morphological changes, and in most cases the cells remain viable. This organism should provide a useful system for clarifying the role of fatty acyl chains in biological membranes."

Seriums from 47 patients With cystic fibrosis antd 19 heterozygotes caused ciliary cessation within 35 minutes, whereas serums from only 2 of 64 individuals without cystic fibrosis inhibited ciliary activity within this time."
https://openalex.org/W2067605088,"The ability of several species of birds to synthesize L-ascorbic acid is correlated with their phylogeny. In the more primitive species, synthesis of L-ascorbic acid occurs in the kidney. Among the highly evolved passeriform species, kidney and liver can synthesize L-ascorbic acid in some, whereas in others synthesis occurs in the liver. In still others, the capacity for the synthesis of L-ascorbic acid is apparently lost. The pattern of evolution of the ascorbic acid pathway among birds is thus similar to that among mammals."

https://openalex.org/W1985024042,"When brook trout are exposed for 24 hours to sublethal doses of DDT, the cold-blocking temperature for a simple reflex, which shows lability related to thermal history, is altered in a way suggesting that DDT is aflecting the thermal acclimation mechanism. Sublethal dosage of DDT also prevents the establishment of a visual conditioned avoidance response."
https://openalex.org/W2068699540,"Triploid parthenogenetic lizards which are heterozygous at the lactate dehydrogenase b locus show approximately two doses of the b allele and approximately one dose of the b' allele. This finding agrees with the triploid karyotype composed of two haploid complements of chromosomes indistinguishable from those of species carrying the b allele and one complement indistinguishable from that of the species which carries the b' allele. Densitometry of electrophoretic patterns of lactate dehydrogenase from heart muscle and from kidney indicates approximately equal expression of each of the b alleles in the triploid lizards. Heterozygouis diploid lizards from the same parthenogenetic species, in agreement with their karyotype, show equal doses of b and b' alleles."

https://openalex.org/W2058531719,"In the pineal body of the immature rat the circadian rhythm of serotonin persists when sympathetic innervation is abolished by the administration of nerve growth factor antiserum. This rhythm is regulated by a mechanism that does not involve the sympathetic innervation and is, therefore, fundamentally different from that in the adult."

When tobacco rattle virus RNA that had been extracted with phenol was incubated with the protein at 9 degrees C, particles with more regular lengths formed; these particles correspond in size and sedimentation properties to the short particles that normally accompany infection by tobacco rattle virus. The biological activity of the reconstitutted short particles was identical to that of native short particles."

https://openalex.org/W2039432296,"Intermodulation components (combination tones) appearing in microphonic potentials were measured from guinea pig cochleas with and without polarizing direct currents passing through the cochlear partition. At moderate intensities of stimulus the polarization had a qualitatively different effect on the distortion components than on their eliciting primaries or on pure tones simulating the distortion products. At high intensities, the primaries and the combination tones were similarly influenced by the polarizing current. It is concluded that cochlear distortion is a two-stage process, mechano-electrical at low levels and mechano-hydraulic at high levels."
https://openalex.org/W2061050533,"Desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant drug, almost completely prevents the accumulation of tritiated norepinephrine by sympathetic neurons of the rat heart after the injection of a tracer dose of the labeled amine. However, desipramine does not alter the accumulation of norepinephrine after the injection of a large dose of the neurohormone. Despite the failure of desipramine to block the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine, it still prevents exogenous norepinephrine from displacing the endogenous neurohormone (previously labeled with H(3)-norepinephrine) from intraneuronal storage sites."

https://openalex.org/W1985640805,"Four species of the halictine bee genus Evylaeus keep their brood cells open during most or part of the development of the larvae. In the colonial summer phase, house bees care for the young and keep brood cells clean from feces and exuviae. Progressive feeding of nector is present at least in Evylaeus malachurus, whose fully fed larvae are, on an average, 60 percent heavier than the egg-and-pollen stage. Interactions between the two generations of social Halictinae are of general occurrence, and their intensity corresponds to the level of social behavior attained."

The same is true for spontaneous speech of normal speakers. Previous contrary findings can be accounted for by the relationship between information value and word length."

https://openalex.org/W2069758547,"The sporangiophores of Phycomyces blakesleeanus, a unicellular fungus, increase their growth rate temporarily when given a symmetric light pulse. When a sporangiophore is cooled until normal growth stops, the light pulse can still be perceived, and, after the sporangiophore is warmed to room temperature, the normal light-growth response is observed. Thus stimulus information can be ""stored"" at low temperatures in this sensory system."

https://openalex.org/W1991719425,"GALACTOSE is a physiological substance which is usually well tolerated provided its breakdown is normal. In patients with galactosaemia, who lack the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, galactose is toxic, causing cataract and brain and liver damage, presumably because of the accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate1. The exact mechanism involved is not known, however, and extensive studies have been hampered by the lack of an experimental model."

https://openalex.org/W2061820636,"I WISH to comment on Rushton's article on humming and vision1. If a cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) is operated in a free running sweep mode with a horizontal speed of about 100 cm/s, an observer will see a single horizontal straight line, as expected. If the observer coughs or clears his throat he sees a transient signal. If he sustains a “throat clearing” vibration of about 50–100 Hz, he will observe a steady sinusoidal signal on the CRO. The amplitude of the signal depends on the observer and his vocal intensity, a typical value being 5 mm at a distance of 200 cm. The amplitude increases with distance. Humming does not produce a detectable signal."

https://openalex.org/W2042401033,"When Corchorus pascuorum (Tiliaceae), native to Australia, was grown in the arid region of West Pakistan, it flowered abundantly but produced no fruit. It was induced to form fruit by treatment with 25 percent sucrose solution containing indolebutyric acid (300 parts per million). When plants were raised from the induced fruits, they fruited without any further treatment and retained the ability to produce fruits in two subsequent generations, whereas those raised from the original seeds produced no fruit."
https://openalex.org/W2056739387,"A METHOD for calculating weighted estimates of gene frequencies from a population of two allelic autosomal genes with partial sub-classification of “dominants” is available1. In blood group studies, it is sometimes necessary to estimate gene frequencies from a population of three allelic autosomal genes with partial sub-classification of one allele. For example, when blood specimens are tested with antisera A and B, four phenotypic groups, O, A, B and AB, are obtained. Again, if portions of A and AB are examined with aiitiserum A1, these groups may further be subdivided into A1 A2, A1B and A2B phenotypes. I have modified Bernstein's method to determine weighted estimates of gene frequencies of A1, A2, A, B and O jointly as follows. Where represents the proportion of A phenotype classified as to A1 and A2 phenotypes and the proportion of AB phenotype classified as to A1B and A2B phenotypes. p1, p2 p, q and r are the frequencies of alleles A1, A2, A, B and O respectively and n is the total frequency."
