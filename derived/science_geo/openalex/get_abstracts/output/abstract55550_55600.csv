https://openalex.org/W1554077494,Abstract The crystal structure analysis of tuna heart cytochrome c has been carried out at 2.45 A resolution using three isomorphous heavy atom derivatives. The space group of P21212 contrasts with the P43 of oxidized cytochrome c. Changes in conformation are seen near the heme crevice and on the right side of the molecule. The entire molecule in the reduced state is more compact and more closed to its surroundings. The heme group moves slightly within its protein framework. A mechanism for reduction is proposed based on orientations of aromatic groups and on recent chemical modification studies. The over-all chain folding is observed to be very similar in mammalian-type cytochrome c and in c-type cytochromes from two bacteria.

https://openalex.org/W1479946249,"Abstract The sites of phosphorylation of two ion pump proteins were compared. In this usage, active means the site of covalent attachment of the phosphate group to the protein. The site of the sodium and potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase of guinea pig kidney was compared with that of the calcium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit skeletal muscle. Each enzyme was phosphorylated by radioactive adenosine triphosphate under its unique experimental conditions. Subsequently, the two phosphoenzymes were treated identically. Each phosphoenzyme was denatured with acid and digested to a limit radioactive phosphopeptide with pronase. The two limit phosphopeptides were indistinguishable with respect to (a) pH hydrolysis profile, (b) electrophoretic mobility at pH levels 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, (c) oxidation by periodate, (d) lack of a positive charge below neutral pH as a result of acetylation of the phosphoenzyme before digestion, and (e) insensitivity to carboxypeptidase B. Furthermore, this limit phosphopeptide was released also from both phosphoenzymes by sequential digestion with papain first and then trypsin. Interpretation of these results suggests an site tripeptide for each enzyme, seryl or threonyl, phosphoaspartyl lysine. Both phosphoenzymes also contained a cysteine near the site on the NH2-terminal side. Digestion of each radioactive phosphoenzyme with pepsin showed clear differences between the enzymes with respect to radioactive peptides larger in molecular weight than about 2000. Simultaneous gel electrophoresis of the intact phosphoproteins showed a barely detectable difference in mobility."

These observations are consistent with the interpretation that a depolarizing transmitter is released by photoreceptors in darkness. The hyperpolarizing response to light of the horizontal cells would then result from a reduction in the amount of transmitter released."

https://openalex.org/W1597115599,"Abstract The mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex contains a core, consisting of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, to which pyruvate dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (a flavoprotein) are joined. The lipoyl moiety is bound covalently to the transacetylase and, presumably, rotates between the catalytic centers of the three different enzymes that comprise the complex. The kinetic mechanism of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from bovine kidney mitochondria has been investigated. Initial velocity patterns were a series of parallel lines, regardless of which substrate was varied at fixed levels of a second substrate. Product inhibition patterns showed that acetyl-CoA is competitive versus CoA and NADH is competitive versus NAD, and that both acetyl-CoA and NADH are uncompetitive versus pyruvate. These results are consistent with the patterns predicted from rate equations derived by Cleland for three-site ping-pong mechanisms. However, noncompetitive (rather than uncompetitive) inhibition patterns were observed for acetyl-CoA versus NAD and for NADH versus CoA. Evidence is presented which suggests that these anomalous product inhibition patterns are due to physical association of the flavoprotein with the transacetylase so that combination of acetyl-CoA with the transacetylase hinders combination of NAD with the flavoprotein and combination of NADH with the flavoprotein hinders combination of CoA with the transacetylase."
https://openalex.org/W1934335897,"Abstract Angiotensin II binding to adrenal cortex receptors is inhibited with high specificity by GTP, 5'-guanilylimidophosphate, (Gpp(NH)p), and ITP. Half-maximum inhibition of angiotensin II binding is achieved with 1.6 x 10-7 m GTP in the presence of a nucleotide-regenerating system, and Gpp(NH)p is equally effective in the absence of the nucleotideregenerating system. Guanosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate, 5'GMP, ATP, and UTP demonstrate little or no inhibition at concentrations which were 1,000- to 10,000-fold higher than those of Gpp(NH)p or GTP. Inclusion of the guanyl nucleotides (GTP and Gpp(NH)p) in the binding assay leads to a lower steady state binding of the hormone to its receptor, and addition of these nucleotides to the binding assay at steady state leads to a rapid release of bound tracer angiotensin II. It is proposed that these actions of the guanyl nucleotides are based on a conformational change at the receptor level."

The action of protein synthesis inhibitors differs from that of halogenated pyrimidines, another class of virus inducers, in their effects on biologically distinguishable viruses. The use of such inhibitors to study integrated virus expression provides a means for studying gene regulation in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1970203736,"It has been suggested that the liver may be a major site for irreversible degradation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The disappearance of autologous (125)I-labeled LDL from plasma was compared in intact and in hepatectomized swine. Contrary to expectations, the rate of irreversible removal of LDL from plasma was increased rather then decreased by hepatectomy. These studies suggest that the liver is not a major site for LDL removal. We propose further that the liver (or some function requiring an intact liver) may affect the metabolism of LDL in a manner that prolongs its lifetime in the plasma compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1563025174,"Abstract The monomer of glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase can be reversibly dissociated to a heavy (mol wt ∼130,000) and a light (mol wt ∼42,000) subunit by treatment with 1 m potassium thiocyanate. The separated heavy subunit can catalyze carbamyl phosphate synthesis from ammonia but not from glutamine; it can also catalyze two of the partial reactions that are catalyzed by the native enzyme, i.e. bicarbonate-dependent ATP cleavage, and the synthesis of ATP from ADP and carbamyl phosphate. The only catalytic activity associated with the light subunit is hydrolysis of glutamine (or γ-glutamylhydroxamate). Recombination of the heavy and light subunits restores ability of the enzyme to utilize glutamine for carbamyl phosphate synthesis. The light and heavy subunits have been characterized by hydrodynamic, chemical, and enzymatic procedures. Evidence was obtained that the heavy subunit contains the sites for the allosteric activators (NH4+, IMP, ornithine) and the inhibitor UMP. The glutaminase activity exhibited by the light subunit exhibits an apparent Km value (130 to 180 mm) which is much higher than that found for the native enzyme or the reconstituted enzyme (1 mm). The effect of glutamine concentration on the glutaminase activity of the reconstituted enzyme and also of the native enzyme that has been stored for long periods was found to be the sum of two independent hyperbolic functions, indicating that in these enzyme preparations a portion of the molecules have a relatively low affinity for glutamine. Although the heavy subunit contains all of the structural properties required for carbamyl phosphate synthesis from ammonia (and the binding sites for allosteric effectors) and the light subunit functions to bind and cleave glutamine, the data indicate that there are substantial interactions between the subunits which in the native enzyme facilitate the utilization of glutamine for the synthesis of carbamyl phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1516761710,"DNA-dependent synthesis of tryptophan (trp) operon mRNA and enzymes was studied in vitro. With φ80 trpEDCBA template DNA trp operon transcription was initiated primarily at a phage promoter estimated to be approximately 7400 to 8000 nucleotides from trpE. Sequential transcription of trp mRNA in the correct direction proceeded at a rate of about 19 nucleotides per s. Trp mRNA resulting from read-through transcription from the phage promoter was larger than 23 S. Coupled sequential synthesis of trp operon enzymes occurred at a rate of approximately 4 amino acids per s. Experiments were conducted to determine if ribosomes discharge from polycistronic trp mRNA following translation termination at natural chain termination codons. Kasugamycin was used to inhibit reinitiation of translation. Kasugamycin shut down of steady state translation required 6.5 min for trpE enzyme, 7 min for trpD enzyme, and 3 min for trpA enzyme. These results indicate that ribosomes which translate trpE mRNA must discharge and reattach in order to translate trpD mRNA, and that ribosomes that translate trpD mRNA must discharge and reattach in order to translate trpA mRNA. Kasugamycin inhibition of trpD enzyme and trpA enzyme synthesis under appropriate conditions of sequential transcription and coupled translation provided further evidence for obligatory discharge and reattachment of ribosomes. Enzyme synthesis coupled to trp operon-promoted transcription from λh80 trp template DNA was repressible by tryptophan in reaction mixtures containing S-30 extract from trpR+ cells. In contrast, enzyme synthesis coupled to read-through transcription from φ80 trp template DNA was essentially irrepressible. It is concluded that read-through transcription is not repressible in vitro. Trp operon mRNA transcribed from a λh80 trpEDCBA DNA template was smaller than 23 S. The polar mutation trpC6 was expressed in vivo in phage λh80 trpEDCBA 190-9 but not in phage φ80 trpEDCBA 190. Read-through transcription of the trp operon occurs in the latter phage but not in the former. Polarity was not expressed in vitro using template DNA from either phage. Trp operon mRNA was extremely stable in vitro; the half-life varied between 30 min and more than 2 hours."

Estrogen concentration did not change, but acid ribonuclease activity and synthesis increased during treatment with the dibutyryl cyclic nucleotide, as was shown during tumor regression due to hormonal deprivation. Growth arrest, thus, appears to derive from enhanced tissue catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1543230044,"Abstract Adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase which catalyzes the phosphorylation of histone and protamine is purified about 100-fold from the soluble fraction of bakers' yeast by streptomycin treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and isoelectrofocusing electrophoresis. A divalent cation, Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+, is needed for the enzyme activity. The apparent Ka value for cyclic AMP is about 2 x 10-8m. The mode of action of the cyclic nucleotide is essentially similar to that described for mammalian enzymes. Comparative studies have revealed that yeast and rat liver cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases exhibit closely similar but not exactly identical kinetic and catalytic properties. Nevertheless, the catalytic and regulatory units from yeast and liver enzymes are crosswise reactive, and recombination of these units of the heterologous sources produces a hybrid cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1481887030,"Abstract A scheme for isolating the stringent factor, a factor which stimulates the pyrophosphorylation of GTP and GDP, from high salt extracts of ribosomes derived from stringent strains of Escherichia coli is reported. The stringent factor was purified 400-fold from the high salt-ribosome eluates. The final preparation was judged to be 85% homogeneous by sedimentation and electrophoretic criteria. The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel ionophoresis and sedimentation analysis indicated that the factor is a protein consisting of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 77,000. In addition to the stringent factor, the conversion of GTP to the guanosine polyphosphates, ppGpp and pppGpp, was shown to require ATP, Mg2+, and ribosomes. The in vitro reaction was further characterized with respect to kinetic parameters, substrate specificity, and its sensitivity to known inhibitors of the in vivo synthesis of ppGpp. From measurements of stringent factor activity in fractions obtained by differential centrifugation of crude cell extracts it was concluded that essentially all of the factor in the extracts was bound to ribosomes. Extracts prepared from several different relaxed mutants were shown to be devoid of stringent factor activity. Evidence is presented that it is the stringent factor rather than the ribosomes which is impaired in these mutants. The implication of these results in relation to the function of the rel gene and the control mechanism underlying the stringent response is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1573660353,"Abstract Inorganic phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, divalent metal ions, EDTA, m-propoxybenzamidine, and AMP were found to be competitive inhibitors of the reaction catalyzed by phosphorylase phosphatase. By a comparison of kinetic studies with the substrates, phosphorylase a and the phosphorylated peptide, it was deduced that inorganic phosphate affected the reaction by binding to the catalyst, whereas glucose-1-P inhibited by binding to the substrate, phosphorylase. Inhibition by divalent metal ions and m-propoxybenzamidine was explained by binding to a single site on phosphorylase phosphatase. This site is presumed to be the one that interacts with the arginyl function of the substrate. EDTA inhibition appears to occur at a different locus on the phosphatase. AMP changes the phosphatase reaction by binding to phosphorylase a. The phosphorylase a-AMP complex is poorly recognized, if at all, by phosphorylase phosphatase."

The protein kinase activity lost from the cytosol was translocated to the microsomal fraction mostly in a cyclic AMP-independent form, suggesting a particulate substrate for the activated enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1590635791,"Abstract Hamster cells transformed by polyoma virus or by treatment with the chemical carcinogen dimethylnitrosamine and revertants from these transformed cells were examined for UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:hematoside N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity and for their types of gangliosides. Compared to normal cells, both the transformed and revertant cells showed 3 to 12% of the enzyme activity and a simplification of the ganglioside pattern. The presence of similar blocks in glycosyltransferase activity and ganglioside synthesis in these transformed cells and their revertants indicates that these blocks were not associated with the regulation of cell growth, but may be due to a common genetic change in transformed cells and their revertants that is not found in normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1572777390,"Abstract Glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase from Escherichia coli can exist in two different conformations which exhibit, respectively, monomer sedimentation coefficients (s020,w) of 7.3 S and 8.7 S. Both conformations undergo rapid reversible self-association upon addition of potassium ions or ornithine. Formation of the 8.7 S conformation is promoted by the addition of phosphate ions. Low concentrations of urea (0.2 to 2.0 m) or guanidine hydrochloride (0.05 to 0.5 m), both of which inhibit the enzymatic activity, favor dissociation in potassium phosphate buffer, which is reversible. Ammonia has been found to be a potent allosteric activator of the enzyme. The presence of ammonia or ornithine (also an allosteric activator) promotes oligomer formation; the maximum sedimentation coefficient observed (in potassium phosphate buffer containing ornithine) is 14.8 S. Sedimentation equilibrium studies indicate the existence of tetramer or higher species in potassium phosphate buffer containing ornithine. Models are presented which explain the apparent relationship between allosteric regulation of the enzyme and its state of association."
https://openalex.org/W1601158716,"Abstract Purified rat liver plasma membranes, rich in glucagon-stimulatable adenylate cyclase activity, were extracted by the non-ionic detergent, Lubrol-PX. Glucagon-binding proteins could be identified in crude and purified membrane extracts by gel filtration following saturation of binding sites with 125I-glucagon before or after extraction. The Hummel-Dreyer principle was adapted to provide a quantitative microbinding assay requiring as little as 0.25 µg of partially purified glucagon-binding proteins. The apparent molecular size of glucagon-binding proteins, as determined on gel columns, was a function of the presence or absence, and concentration, of the detergent. Chromatography of crude membrane extracts on 8% agarose in the presence of 0.5% Lubrol yielded glucagon-binding proteins of over 1.5 x 106 molecular weight; under these conditions much of the 125I-glucagon was also associated with micelles of the detergent to form a complex of about 125,000 molecular weight. The crude binding proteins bound either native or radioactive glucagon, but not adrenocorticotropic hormone. Glucagon-binding proteins in membrane extracts remained soluble even after reduction of the Lubrol concentration to below 0.001% by ultrafiltration; a 75-fold increase in specific glucagon-binding activity accompanied this step. Filtration of this solution on 8% agarose gel in the absence of detergent separated two-binding proteins, one included and one excluded by the pores of this gel. No micellar glucagon appeared under these conditions. The glucagon-binding proteins in detergent-reduced extracts were purified a further 40-fold by chromatography on hydroxylapatite; a small amount of protein, containing essentially all of the recovered binding activity, was not retained by this adsorbent in the presence of low ionic strength buffers. Relative to the original 0.5% Lubrol-PX membrane extract, an over-all 3000-fold increase in specific glucagon-binding activity was realized. Binding was a saturable process. Partially purified glucagon-binding protein exhibited, on Scatchard plots, two classes of binding sites, one of high affinity (Ka = 8.7 x 109 m-1) and the other of quite low affinity. Binding of 125I-glucagon, which was essentially complete by 15 to 20 min at 30°, was readily reversible merely by the application of a concentration gradient to the hormone-binding protein complex. Native glucagon both competed with 125I-glucagon for soluble binding sites and displaced the radioactive hormone from its complex with the binding protein. Concentrations of Lubrol-PX as low as 0.01% greatly inhibited binding, as did pH values greater than 8.5. The partially purified protein, whose molecular weight was estimated on a calibrated agarose column as about 190,000, also bound 125I-insulin, albeit to a lesser extent than 125Iglucagon, and bound 125I-adrenocorticotropic hormone not at all."
https://openalex.org/W1590248511,"Abstract High density lipoproteins (HDL) were isolated by centrifugation from the serum of salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) captured just before spawning. There were no detectable low density lipoproteins in their serum. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the lipoprotein fraction yielded only one band with a hydrated density of 1.103 g per ml and a peak F1.20 rate of 3.21 S. If the molecule is spherical, it would have minimum molecular weight of 180,000 and an average diameter of 80 A. The agarose gel electrophoresis pattern had one major and one minor band with the approximate mobility of human α-lipoprotein. The lipid class composition was very similar to that reported for human HDL. The phospholipids were mainly phosphatidylcholine (80%), its lysoderivative, and sphingomyelin. The major fatty acids were 16:0, 18:0, 18:1 (n-9), 20:5 (n-3), and 22:6 (n-3). Lipids accounted for 60% of the mass of the molecule. Disc electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels (in 8 m urea at pH 8.6) produced a pattern with two major and several minor bands for both the intact lipoproteins and the lipid-free protein moiety. The over-all pattern was very similar to that of human HDL. The apoproteins from the salmon HDL were eluted from diethylaminoethylcellulose columns under conditions similar to those used for elution of apoproteins from human HDL; they also gave similar elution patterns. Their circular dichroism spectra resembled those of the corresponding human apolipoproteins. Despite all of these physical similarities, there were distinct and major differences between the amino acid compositions of salmon apoproteins and their human counterparts. These data suggest that general physical properties of the HDL are not specifically dependent on the total amino acid composition of the molecule but rather on its general secondary or tertiary structure and these same features must govern the binding of lipids to proteins in soluble lipoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2215007640,"Abstract The kinetics of purified bovine hepatic fructose 1,6-diphosphatase have been examined at physiological pH. The enzyme is inhibited by high concentrations of both its substrate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2), and its cofactor magnesium. Magnesium inhibits at noninhibitory Fru-1,6-P2 concentrations, but at inhibitory substrate concentrations, magnesium activates rather than inhibits. Magnesium inhibition is competitive with Fru-1,6-P2 and the Ki (or Kss) for magnesium inhibition is the same as the Kdiss for (MgFru-1,6-P2)-1, indicating that magnesium inhibits by forming a chelate with the free substrate. This suggests that (MgFru-1,6-P2)-1 is not a substrate and the true substrate may be free Fru-1,6-P2. Inhibition by high concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 is hyperbolic, and noncompetitive with respect to magnesium. The double reciprocal plot of v versus Mg2+ concentration is intersecting, indicating a sequential mechanism for Mg2+ and Fru-1,6-P2 binding. The mechanism is not equilibrium ordered; that is, in the sequential mechanism, either magnesium or substrate can bind to the enzyme first. The evidence for the existence of an allosteric site for substrate inhibition, as well as its possible physiological significance are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1540664603,"Abstract The ternary complex, consisting of DPN+, pyruvate, and chicken heart lactate dehydrogenase, can be dissociated in base to yield a stable cyclic binary adduct. This DPNpyruvate adduct, which is a dihydropyridine derivative, is identical in structure with one of the two diastereomers produced chemically by the addition of pyruvate to DPN+ in basic solution. A structural analysis of this enzyme-generated adduct by proton magnetic resonance has led to the following conclusions concerning the 322-nm-absorbing ternary complex of DPN+, enolpyruvate, and the lactate dehydrogenases: (a) a covalent bond forms between DPN+ and enolpyruvate; (b) the substitution of pyruvate on DPN+ occurs at the nicotinamide C4 position of DPN+; (c) the substitution takes place on the A side of the nicotinamide ring; and (d) this pyridine C4-substituted adduct of DPN+ is capable of dissociating intact from lactate dehydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W1968412872,"Treatment with the dopamine precursor L-dopa produced a significant accumulation of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in the caudate nucleus of the rat. In contrast, there was no change in the amount of cyclic AMP in the cerebellum. Accumulation of cyclic AMP in the caudate nucleus after administration of L-dopa was prevented by prior treatment with the decarboxylase inhibitor RO 4-4602. These observations and those in other laboratories support the assumption that dopamine formed from L-dopa selectively activates striatal adenylate cyclase. The in vivo activation of adenylate cyclase after treatment with L-dopa may be a useful model for studying neurological and psychiatric disorders that are thought to involve the dopaminergic system of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1634443586,"Apolipoprotein-glutamine-II (apoLP-Gln-II) is one of the two major protein constituents of human plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL). ApoLP-Gln-II contains two identical chains of 77 amino acids each, which are linked by a single disulfide bond at residue 6. Each chain contains a single methionine at position 26. In the present study we have examined the phospholipid binding properties of apoLP-Gln-II, of the NH2-terminal cyanogen bromide fragment both in the reduced form (CNBr IV, residues 1 to 26) and with the disulfide bond intact (CNBr IV)2, of the COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide fragment (CNBr III, residues 27 to 77) and of performic acid-oxidized apoLP-Gln-II. The binding of phosphatidylcholine was monitored by the inhibition of the reactivation of delipidated β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from beef heart mitochondria and by the formation of phospholipid-protein complexes which were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation in sucrose. The circular dichroism and immunochemical properties of these fragments and derivatives of apoLP-Gln-II were studied both in the presence and absence of phosphatidylcholine. The results may be summarized as follows. (a) ApoLP-Gln-II and its performic acid-oxidized derivative were potent inhibitors of the reactivation of β-hydroxybutyrate apodehydrogenase. One microgram of these preparations gave approximately 50% inhibition. The COOH-terminal CNBr fragment, CNBr III, also inhibited reactivation of the apodehydrogenase at low concentrations, but was less effective than the intact protein. Both CNBr IV and (CNBr IV)2 failed to inhibit reactivation of the dehydrogenase. (b) ApoLP-Gln-II, performic acid-oxidized apoLP-Gln-II and CNBr III formed complexes with phosphatidylcholine which were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation in sucrose (d 1.063 to 1.210). These isolated complexes contained, respectively, 1.16, 1.56, and 2.00 mg of phosphatidylcholine per mg of protein or peptide. When (CNBr IV)2 was reconstituted with phosphatidylcholine and subjected to ultracentrifugation under identical conditions, the isolated peptide contained only 0.08 mg of phospholipid per mg of peptide. (c) Reconstitution with phosphatidylcholine resulted in an apparent increase in α helical content (as judged by an increase in θ222 nm in the circular dichroism spectrum). The magnitude of the changes were as follows: 49% to 64% for apoLP-Gln-II, 32 to 57% for performic acid-oxidized apoLP-Gln-II, and 32 to 44% for CNBr III. There was no significant change in the CD spectra of (CNBr IV)2 detected in the presence of phosphatidylcholine. (d) Performic acid oxidation of apoLP-Gln-II did not alter the qualitative immunoprecipitin lines when this antigen was tested against rabbit antisera prepared against apoLP-Gln-II. The same antisera reacted with CNBr III and (CNBr IV)2, but formed lines of only partial identity between the fragments or between each fragment and apoLP-Gln-II. Rabbit antisera to CNBr III formed precipitin lines of complete identity between this fragment, apoLP-Gln-II, and performic acid-oxidized apoLP-Gln-II. No differences were noted after reconstitution with phosphatidylcholine. Anti-CNBr III did not form detectable precipitin lines with (CNBr IV)2. By the tests we have employed, we conclude that CNBr III or the COOH-terminal two-thirds of apoLP-Gln-II exhibits preferential interaction with phosphatidylcholine, although to a lesser extent than does the intact protein. The NH2-terminal fragment did not show a significant interaction with phosphatidylcholine whether the disulfide linkage was intact or not. Modification of the disulfide linkage or of the methionine at residue 26 did not alter the qualitative immunoprecipitin test with the antisera employed."
https://openalex.org/W2006544595,"Fast pulse radiolysis and kinetic spectroscopy were used to rapidly generate a variety of free radicals in situ and study their reactions with ferricytochrome c in the time range 10(-6) to 1 second. The radicals included t-butanol, which is inert to ferricytochrome c; malate, lactate, and ethanol, which react with it relatively slowly but are completely utilized in reducing it to ferrocytochrome c; and hydrated electrons and hydrogen atoms, which react with it very rapidly but yield ferrocytochrome c only in part, showing intramolecular consecutive reactions and further attack on the ferrocytochrome c protein. From a detailed comparison between malate and hydrogen atoms it is argued that malate reacts directly and selectively with a specific part of the ferricytochrome c surface while hydrogen atoms react with other parts of the protein too, yielding radicals which in part transfer intramolecularly to yield ferrocytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W2260300097,"Abstract Crystalline phosphofructokinase from chicken liver undergoes rapid loss of activity at low temperatures. The rate of inactivation is influenced by protein concentration, pH, type, and concentration of salt. The enzyme is protected from the cold inactivation by positive effectors, and negative effectors such as ATP increase the rate of inactivation. The cold-inactivated enzyme can be activated by rewarming in the presence of dithiothreitol and a positive effector such as fructose bisphosphate. Cold treatment of liver phosphofructokinase is accompanied by dissociation of the enzyme to a protomer as shown by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration. Reactivation of the cold-inactivated pure enzyme by warming results in aggregation of the protomers to form an active enzyme with a molecular weight of about 400,000. A similar phenomenon was also shown with crude phosphofructokinase in the extract of chicken liver. A tentative mechanism is proposed to explain the complex process of reversible cold inactivation of phosphofructokinase."

Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthetase (prenyltransferase), which is present in dark-grown cells, is increased severalfold by photoinduction. The enzymes necessary for the synthesis of high molecular weight (C35 to C40) polyprenyl pyrophosphates and isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase were unaffected by photoinduction. This is the first report of the photoinduction of enzymes acting prior to prephytoene pyrophosphate. These enzymes are not restricted to carotene synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2992655700,"Abstract We used chromatographically purified butyrylated analogues of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) to displace [3H]cAMP bound to a partially purified bovine muscle protein kinase preparation. O2'-Monobutyryl cAMP (O2MBC) showed a linear displacement of label, with an affinity equal to 1.5% that of cAMP. N6-Monobutyryl cAMP (N6MBC) and N6,O2'-dibutyryl cAMP (DBC) show curvilinear displacement consistent with at least two types of binding sites. The most abundant of these sites does not appear to discriminate N6-butyrylated cAMPs from the N6-unsubstituted compounds. The less abundant site (∼20% of total) does distinguish N6-butyryl-substituted compounds (e.g. N6MBC has ∼100% the affinity of cAMP for the most abundant site and ∼7% for the less abundant site). The ability of these purified analogues to stimulate the kinase activity (assayed as 32P incorporation into casein) of our preparation showed a similar rank order as the binding studies. Initial rates of the enzyme reaction (relative to cAMP = 1.0) were: 0.29 for N6MBC, 0.002 for O2MBC, and 0.0003 for DBC. We conclude from these studies that: DBC is unlikely to mimic cAMP action through direct intracellular interaction with cAMP-dependent protein kinase; N6MBC is probably the active butyrylated analogue of cAMP; while N6MBC binds well to some sites it binds less effectively to others and this observation may account for observations regarding divergent biological effects of cAMP and its butyrylated analogues."

Both activities were also reduced to nearly similar extents by acetylation of hydroxyls of carbohydrate residues, positioning a negative charge on the C-6 carbons of the carbohydrate, or by formation of borate complexes. But oxidations of the C-6 hydroxyls of the carbohydrate to aldehyde groups caused no reductions of either activity. Structural similarities required for both activities therefore exist."

https://openalex.org/W1511080077,"Abstract In intact turkey erythrocytes ouabain, a specific inhibitor of sodium- and potassium-dependent ATPase, inhibits fractional sodium outflux but does not alter sodium influx. Ouabain increases isoproterenol-stimulated sodium influx by 50%, decreases isoproterenol-stimulated sodium outflux by 20%, but does not alter either the minimally effective concentration of isoproterenol (10-9 m) or the concentration (10-7 m) required for maximal stimulation of sodium fluxes. The glycoside also prolongs the duration of catecholaminestimulated sodium transport but has no effect on either the magnitude or the time course of catecholamine-stimulated cellular accumulation of cyclic 3' : 5'-AMP. This ability of ouabain to relieve the refractoriness of turkey erythrocytes to endogenous cyclic 3' : 5'-AMP suggests that the mechanisms through which ouabain and the cyclic nucleotide exert their effects may at some point share a common biochemical pathway."

From this, apart from symptomatic therapy, the only hope for effective treatment of this most prevalent of diseases is in the development of broad spectrum antiviral drugs. We have developed a substituted guanidine, ICI 65,709 (ref. 1) (Fig. 1) which has good activity in vitro against all twenty-five rhinovirus serotypes tested in human embryonic lung cells, and also against certain other picornaviruses."

https://openalex.org/W1503427314,"Abstract Succinate dehydrogenase extracted from Complex II preparations with 0.8 m sodium perchlorate in the presence of succinate requires no activation (Hanstein, W. G., Davis, K. A., Ghalambor, M. A., and Hatefi, Y. (1971) Biochemistry 10, 2517–2524) even after being subjected to procedures which deactivate other soluble or membranal preparations of the enzyme. This behavior was ascribed to the presence of succinate, a known activator, in the enzyme preparation. In the present study this type of succinate dehydrogenase preparation is shown to contain no bound succinate. The fact that this enzyme requires no activation and does not respond to treatments expected to deactivate it (e.g. dialysis, gel exclusion) has been traced to the effect of high perchlorate concentrations which, in the presence of succinate, appear to alter the regulatory properties. Even at 0°, perchlorate and other anions, in the absence of substrate, activate the dehydrogenase in Complex II, the starting material used for extraction. These ions also activate purified preparations extracted from acetone powders. If succinate is omitted during the contact with perchlorate, the resulting preparations appear to be rapidly and spontaneously deactivated during and following gel exclusion on Sephadex. When succinate is included during perchlorate treatment, however, deactivation is achieved with relative difficulty, using a combination of gel exclusion, exposure to 38°, and prolonged incubation at 0°."
https://openalex.org/W1521956152,"Abstract The relationships between ribosomal sites involved in initiation and elongation of polypeptide chains have been investigated. Thiostrepton, a peptide antibiotic that binds to a single site on the 50 S ribosomal subunit, prevents subsequent interaction of the ribosome with peptide chain elongation factors G (EF-G) and Tu (EF-Tu). In contrast, the drug does not directly impair binding of formyl methionyl transfer RNA to ribosomes. Bound formyl methionyl transfer RNA can react with puromycin indicating formation of a functional 70 S initiation complex. Prior binding of EF-G to ribosomes in the presence of either 5'-guanylyl methylene diphosphonate or fusidic acid and guanosine diphosphate prevents the subsequent binding of the ternary complex, aminoacyl-transfer RNA·EF-Tu· guanosine triphosphate to such ribosomes. In contrast, formation of the polypeptide initiation complex on ribosomes carrying bound EF-G is not inhibited but is somewhat stimulated. At a low molar ratio of IF-2 to ribosomes, prior binding of either thiostrepton or EF-G to ribosomes does not inhibit ribosome-dependent uncoupled hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate catalyzed by IF-2. At a high molar ratio of IF-2 to ribosomes however, the IF-2 guanosine triphosphatase activity is partially inhibited by binding of either thiostrepton or EF-G. However, maximum inhibition does not exceed 50%. The inhibition observed is on the rate of guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis; the yield of the hydrolytic reaction is not impaired. These results suggest that while aminoacyl-transfer RNA· EF-Tu·guanosine triphosphate complex and EF-G interact with either the same or overlapping regions of the ribosome, the ribosomal site for uncoupled hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate catalyzed by IF-2 does not overlap the EF-G site. This implies the existence of at least two guanosine triphosphatase sites on ribosomes—an IF-2-specific site and an EF-G site. However, at a relatively high molar excess of IF-2 to ribosomes, IF-2 can also interact with the EF-G site."
https://openalex.org/W1523950627,"Sheep adrenal cortex contains an enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of steroidal 20-oxo-21-al derivatives to 20-oxo-21-oic acids. The enzyme was purified 60- to 70-fold and retained broad specificity for a variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. The aldehyde dehydrogenase was localized in the cytosol. It was protected from inactivation by NAD+, which it uses as specific coenzyme, but was otherwise unstable. Reagents that react with —SH groups inactivated the enzyme. Molecular weight was estimated as 164,000. The product of 21-dehydrocorticosterone oxidation was 11β-hydroxy-3,20-diketo-4-pregnen-21-oic acid. For each mole of product made or substrate used, 1 mole of NAD+ was reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1589135311,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of cytochrome c3 of Desulfovibrio vulgaris, strain Hildenborough (NCIB 8303) has been established from the amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides and compositions, NH2- and COOH-terminal residues and partial sequences of peptides from a chymotryptic digest of the protein. Cytochrome c3 which contains three heme groups per molecule, is shown to have four pairs of cysteine residues. Two cysteine pairs are typical of c-type heme binding sites in that the cysteine residues are separated by 2 residues with the second cysteine followed by a histidine residue. The other two cysteine pairs are separated by 4 residues, indicating that at least one heme group is attached in an atypical manner."

https://openalex.org/W1561556159,"Abstract Aspartokinase of Pseudomonas fluorescens has been purified by heat treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and by successive gel filtration steps on Sephadex G-200 in the presence and absence of feedback modifiers. The 700-fold purified enzyme was judged to be greater than 90% pure. Sedimentation velocity centrifugation yielded an s020,w value of 6.7 S, a D20,w value of 5.3 x 10-7 cm2 s-1, and a molecular weight of 133,000. The Stokes radius of the native enzyme in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm KCl was found to be about 43 A. A diffusion coefficient of 5.2 x 10-7 cm2 s-1 was calculated from the Stokes-Einstein equation. A molecular weight of 137,000 was also estimated from the gel filtration data. The molecular weight of the subunit was 43,000. The enzyme had an absolute requirement for ATP and a divalent cation. No other nucleoside phosphates served as the phosphate donor. Addition of 200 mm KCl increased the reaction rate by about 40%; sodium and lithium ions had no effect. The activity of this enzyme was inhibited by concerted feedback by two pairs of amino acid end products: lysine plus threonine and methionine plus threonine. Individually, lysine and methionine were slightly stimulatory; threonine showed a slight activation at low concentrations, but was weakly inhibitory at concentrations over 10 mm. Concerted inhibition by low threonine and high lysine combination was compensated by methionine; whereas, methionine did not counteract when enzyme activity was severely decreased by high concentrations of threonine plus lysine. A possible physiological significance of the dual role of methionine is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1480755329,"Abstract Proton relaxation rates for the binary complex of the Cu2+ analog of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase and water have been measured. Titration of apoenzyme into copper salts shows approximately two tight copper-binding sites, Ki = 10-6 m, and 13 weak sites per enzyme dimer molecule. Enhancement of 1/T1p by a factor of 2 upon binding to enzyme is observed; this result for the first time suggests the participation of the metal in substrate binding. From the temperature dependence of T1p* and the fact that T1p g T2p it is concluded that T1p is not exchange-limited. From the frequency dependence of T1p and from the ratio of T1:T2 we estimate a correlation time, τc, of 4.6 x 10-9 s-1 which corresponds to the Cu2+-water proton distance r = 3.6 A when the number of ligand sites, q, = 1 or r = 3.2 when q = ½. The addition of phosphate has little effect on T1p for the copper enzyme. These results suggest that at least 1 water molecule or hydroxyl ion has access to the inner coordination sphere of the Cu2+ ion and that inorganic phosphate does not displace this ligand."
https://openalex.org/W167148247,"Abstract Concerted feedback inhibition of aspartokinase activity from Pseudomonas fluorescens by the combination of l-threonine and l-lysine, or by l-threonine and l-methionine was freely and rapidly reversible. Inhibition by l-threonine, or by the concerted pairs of amino acids was kinetically mixed with respect to l-aspartate and noncompetitive with regard to ATP. In the presence of l-threonine the Stokes radius of the enzyme increased from 44 to 49 A; a much larger value of about 56 A was estimated when both l-threonine and l-lysine were added to the enzyme. The same amino acids increased the Stokes radius of the enzyme at 15° in buffer solutions containing ATP, l-aspartate, and Mg2+, the substrates of the phosphorylation reaction, indicating that the larger molecular species were catalytically inactive. Although in phosphate buffer at 25° the combination of l-threonine plus l-methionine did not show an additional increment in the molecular radius over that seen in l-threonine alone, the same combination induced a large change (from 49 to 54 A) in the buffer containing the substrates at 15°. l-Threonine, and a combination of l-threonine plus l-lysine also increased the s20,w value of the aspartokinase by about 50%; whereas, a 10% increase in the S value was noted in l-lysine alone. The cumulative results strongly suggest that the inhibitory amino acids caused oligomerization of the enzyme. Since the inhibition of enzyme activity accompanied the structural alterations of the protein and a good correlation was seen between the degree of inhibition and the extent of enzyme oligomerization under similar experimental conditions, it is proposed that the mechanism of inhibition by l-threonine and by the concerted pairs of amino acid end products may involve modifier-induced formation of inactive enzyme oligomers."
