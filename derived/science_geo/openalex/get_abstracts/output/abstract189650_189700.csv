https://openalex.org/W2151328247,"Explaining mutualistic cooperation between species remains one of the greatest problems for evolutionary biology. Why do symbionts provide costly services to a host, indirectly benefiting competitors sharing the same individual host? Host monitoring of symbiont performance and the imposition of sanctions on 'cheats' could stabilize mutualism. Here we show that soybeans penalize rhizobia that fail to fix N(2) inside their root nodules. We prevented a normally mutualistic rhizobium strain from cooperating (fixing N(2)) by replacing air with an N(2)-free atmosphere (Ar:O(2)). A series of experiments at three spatial scales (whole plants, half root systems and individual nodules) demonstrated that forcing non-cooperation (analogous to cheating) decreased the reproductive success of rhizobia by about 50%. Non-invasive monitoring implicated decreased O(2) supply as a possible mechanism for sanctions against cheating rhizobia. More generally, such sanctions by one or both partners may be important in stabilizing a wide range of mutualistic symbioses."

https://openalex.org/W2165523086,"Growing evidence indicates that inflammation is a contributing factor leading to cancer development. However, pathways involved in this progression are not well understood. To examine whether HIF-1alpha is a factor linking inflammation and tumorigenesis, we investigated whether the HIF-1 signaling pathway was stimulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in A549 cells. We find that IL-1beta up-regulated HIF-1alpha protein under normoxia and activated the HIF-1-responsive gene vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via a pathway dependent on nuclear factor kappaB (NFkB). Interestingly, although this pathway is stimulated by upstream signaling via AKT and mTOR and requires new transcription, IL-1 mediated HIF-1alpha induction also utilizes a post-transcriptional mechanism that involves antagonism of VHL-dependent HIF-1alpha degradation, which results in increased HIF-1alpha protein stability. IL-1 mediated NFkB-dependent cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) expression served as a positive effector for HIF-1alpha induction. Although COX-2 inhibitors attenuated IL-1 mediated HIF-1alpha induction, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a physiological product of COX-2, induced HIF-1alpha protein in a dose-dependent manner. Our data, therefore, demonstrate that IL-1beta up-regulates functional HIF-1alpha protein through a classical inflammatory signaling pathway involving NFkB and COX-2, culminating in up-regulation of VEGF, a potent angiogenic factor required for tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, HIF-1 is identified as a pivotal transcription factor linking the inflammatory and oncogenic pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2033612015,"Free magnetic moments usually manifest themselves in Curie laws, where weak external magnetic fields produce magnetizations that vary as the reciprocal of the temperature (1/T). For a variety of materials that do not display static magnetism, including doped semiconductors1 and certain rare-earth intermetallics2, the 1/T law is replaced by a power law T-α with α < 1. Here we show that a much simpler material system—namely, the insulating magnetic salt LiHoxY1-xF4—can also display such a power law. Moreover, by comparing the results of numerical simulations of this system with susceptibility and specific-heat data3, we show that both energy-level splitting and quantum entanglement are crucial to describing its behaviour. The second of these quantum mechanical effects—entanglement, where the wavefunction of a system with several degrees of freedom cannot be written as a product of wavefunctions for each degree of freedom—becomes visible for remarkably small tunnelling terms, and is activated well before tunnelling has visible effects on the spectrum. This finding is significant because it shows that entanglement, rather than energy-level redistribution, can underlie the magnetic behaviour of a simple insulating quantum spin system."

https://openalex.org/W1994708622,"The human DF3/MUC1 mucin-like glycoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed by most carcinomas of the breast and other epithelia. The contribution of MUC1 overexpression to the malignant phenotype is, however, not known. In the present studies, we have stably expressed MUC1 in rat 3Y1 fibroblasts. MUC1-positive cells were selected from independent transfections. The results demonstrate that, as found in human carcinomas, MUC1 is expressed on the cell surface and as a complex with beta-catenin in the nucleus of the transfectants. Colony formation in soft agar demonstrates that cells expressing MUC1, but not the empty vector, exhibit anchorage-independent growth. The results also show that MUC1 expression confers tumor formation in nude mice. These findings provide the first evidence that MUC1 induces cellular transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2130585966,"Human alpha-synuclein accumulates in dopaminergic neurons as intraneuronal inclusions, Lewy bodies, which are characteristic of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we suggest that modulation of the functional activity of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by alpha-synuclein may be a key factor in the preferential degeneration of mesencephalic dopamine (DA)-synthesizing neurons in PD. In cotransfected Ltk-, HEK 293, and SK-N-MC cells, alpha-synuclein induced a 35% decrease in [3H]DA uptake. Biotinylated DAT levels were decreased by 40% in cotransfected cells relative to cells expressing only DAT. DAT was colocalized with alpha-synuclein in mesencephalic neurons and cotransfected Ltk- cells. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed the existence of a complex between alpha-synuclein and DAT, in specific rat brain regions and cotransfected cells, through specific amino acid motifs of both proteins. The attenuation of DAT function by alpha-synuclein was cytoprotective, because DA-mediated oxidative stress and cell death were reduced in cotransfected cells. The neurotoxin MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium), oxidative stress, or impairment of cell adhesion ablated the alpha-synuclein-mediated inhibition of DAT activity, which caused increased uptake of DA and increased biotinylated DAT levels, in both mesencephalic neurons and cotransfected cells. These studies suggest a novel normative role for alpha-synuclein in regulating DA synaptic availability and homeostasis, which is relevant to the pathophysiology of PD."

https://openalex.org/W1593794388,"Circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-6 are elevated after myocardial infarction (MI) and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Its myocardial expression post-MI suggests a pathophysiological role in this condition. To explore the role of endogenous IL-6, we analyzed MI size, left ventricular (LV) remodeling, and mortality after permanent coronary ligation in IL-6 knockout mice (IL-6-/-) and wild-type controls (WT). Six weeks after MI, IL-6-/- and WT had similar mortality rates, MI sizes, LV remodeling, and LV dysfunction in vivo, determined by catheterization. Infarct size 24 h post-MI, shown by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, was similar at 24 h. Treatment with exogenous IL-6 did not alter MI size in WT. Infarction resulted in marked phosphorylation of STAT3, without differences between genotypes. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) protein was increased 48 h post-MI in IL-6-/-, and angiotensin II and AT1 receptor (AT1R) protein were strongly increased in IL-6-/- baseline and post-MI, suggesting compensatory up-regulation. Lack of IL-6 does not affect long-term MI size or LV function, remodeling, and survival. In mice lacking IL-6, other members of the IL-6 family such as LIF and other factors signaling via JAK/STAT such as angiotensin may act in a compensatory manner to activate the JAK/STAT pathway, thereby maintaining STAT3 phosphorylation, which is crucial for the cellular effects of IL-6 cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2165642417,"Cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in human neoplasias by gene rearrangement and amplification, but no mutations in the CCND1 gene have so far been reported. However, in vitro mutagenesis of CCND1 has shown that substitutions affecting threonine 286 residue produced cyclin D1 nuclear accumulation, by interfering with protein degradation and induced neoplastic transformation in murine fibroblasts. To test whether similar genetic changes may occur in vivo, we analysed a series of 60 endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EECs) for cyclin D1 expression and gene amplification by immunohistochemistry and FISH, respectively. Two of 17 carcinomas showing cyclin D1 expression in more than 5% of neoplastic cells, but without gene amplification, were found to harbor single-base substitutions in CCND1 that changed proline 287 into threonine and serine, respectively. Both cases expressed cyclin D1 in more than 50% of neoplastic cells. Additionally, seven tumors with cyclin D1 overexpression of an independent series of 59 EECs were also analysed, and a 12-bp in-frame deletion that eliminated amino acids 289-292 was detected in one case with cylin D1 expression in more than 50% of neoplastic cells. In contrast, no mutations of the CCND1 gene were detected in a set of breast carcinomas with cyclin D1 overexpression without gene amplification. In summary, our data indicate that mutations of CCND1, which probably render the protein insensitive to degradation, represent a previously unreported mechanism of cyclin D1 overexpression in human tumors in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2080069774,"Organization of the actin cytoskeleton in eucaryotic cells is controlled by small GTPases of the Rho family. Rac becomes activated by growth factor stimulation and integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and is known to have a crucial role in lamellipodia formation, cell spreading and migration. At present, the intracellular pathways that connect cell surface receptors to Rac activation are poorly characterized. It has been reported previously that integrin-mediated cell attachment induces activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in the absence of EGF. We demonstrate here that this activation is instrumental for integrin-dependent Rac activation. Thus, we found that cells in which EGFR activity had been inhibited failed to spread and form lamellipodia on fibronectin. Failure to spread coincided with inhibition of adhesion-induced GTP loading of Rac and also with inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)/Akt pathway. Subsequent studies demonstrated that an activated form of PI 3-kinase restored Rac GTP loading in the presence of EGFR inhibition, while a dominant-negative form of PI 3-kinase blocked Rac GTP loading in fibronectin-adherent cells. Our further functional studies identified Vav2, a known exchange factor for Rac, as a crucial downstream component in EGFR- and PI 3-kinase-dependent Rac activation upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Our results provide a mechanistic insight into integrin-dependent Rac activation, and identify a novel role for EGFR, PI 3-kinase and Vav2 in this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2039918907,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR) play an important role in the invasiveness of gliomas and other infiltrative tumors. In glioma cell lines and tumors, high grade correlates with increased expression of uPAR and uPA. We report here the downregulation of uPAR and uPA by delivery of antisense sequences of uPAR and uPA in a single adenoviral vector, Ad-uPAR-uPA (Ad, adenovirus). The bicistronic construct (Ad-uPAR-uPA) infected glioblastoma cell line had significantly reduced levels of uPAR, uPA enzymatic activity and immunoreactivity for these proteins when compared to controls. The Ad-uPAR-uPA infected cells showed a markedly lower level of invasion in the Matrigel invasion assays, and their spheroids failed to invade the fetal rat brain aggregates in the coculture system. Intracranial injection of SNB19 cells with the Ad-uPAR-uPA antisense bicistronic construct showed inhibited invasiveness and tumorigenicity. Subcutaneous injections of bicistronic antisense constructs into established tumors (U87 MG) caused regression of those tumors. Our results support the therapeutic potential of targeting the individual components of the uPAR-uPA system by using a single adenovirus construct for the treatment of glioma and other invasive cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2164525272,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are exposed to altered mechanical stress that may contribute to SMC migration in the development of atherosclerosis. Signal transduction pathways in SMCs activated by mechanical stress that instigate cell migration are undefined. Herein, we provide evidence that mechanical stress enhances SMC migration, which is mediated, at least in part, by protein kinase C (PKC)delta. When rat SMCs cultivated on a flexible membrane were subjected to cyclic strain stress (60 cycles/min, 5, 15, or 20% elongation), PKCdelta was translocated to the Triton-insoluble fraction, whereas PKCalpha was translocated to the membrane, which was confirmed by PKC kinase assays. Immunofluorescence and actin staining revealed a cytoskeleton translocation of PKCdelta in SMCs stimulated by cyclic strain. PKCdelta-deficient SMCs cultivated from PKCdelta-/- mice showed an abnormal cytoskeleton structure, which was related to a diminished phosphorylation of paxillin, focal adhesion kinase, and vinculin in response to mechanical stress. Mechanical stress enhanced SMC migration, which was diminished in PKCdelta-/- SMCs. Taken together, our data demonstrated that mechanical stress activates PKCdelta translocation to the cytoskeleton, which is related to decreased SMC migration and indicates that PKCdelta is a key signal transducer between mechanical stress and cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2116051210,"A2A adenosine receptors specifically found on striatal medium spiny neurons play a major role in sensory motor function and may also be involved in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. One hypothesis concerning Huntington's disease (HD) proposes that an imbalance of the cortico-striatal pathway, due to the mutation in the HD gene, leads to striatal vulnerability. An A2A receptor dysfunction has been previously demonstrated in striatal cells engineered to express mutant huntingtin. Here we tested whether a similar dysfunction (i.e., the binding and functional parameters of A2A adenosine receptors) is present in peripheral blood cells (platelets, lymphocytes, and neutrophils) of subjects carrying the mutant gene. This study involved 48 heterozygous and three homozygous patients compared with 58 healthy subjects. Moreover, we selected seven at-risk mutation carriers. A2A receptor density and function are substantially increased in peripheral blood cells from both patients and subjects at the presymptomatic stage. In the neutrophils of the three homozygous HD subjects receptor dysfunction was higher than in heterozygotes. These data indicate the existence of an aberrant A2A receptor phenotype in the peripheral blood cells of subjects carrying the HD mutation. Future studies will assess whether this parameter can be exploited as a peripheral biomarker of Huntington's disease."

Here we describe a single re-circulating flow, or microvortex, that can generate a maximum fluid rotational velocity of up to 12 m s(-1) and a corresponding radial acceleration in excess of 10(6)g. Such microvortices may be exploited in centrifugal microdevices to investigate the effects of high radial acceleration on biological and chemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2024837443,"SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, however, the function of SHP-2 in hematopoietic cell signaling is not well understood. Here we focus on the role of SHP-2 phosphatase in the signal transduction of interleukin (IL)-3, a cytokine involved in hematopoietic cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. We established immortalized SHP-2(-/-) hematopoietic cell pools and showed that IL-3-induced proliferative response was diminished in SHP-2(-/-) cells. Moreover, inhibition of the catalytic activity of SHP-2 in wild-type (WT) bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells and Ba/F3 cells by overexpression of catalytically inactive SHP-2 mutant suppressed their differentiative and proliferative responses to IL-3, demonstrating an important positive role for SHP-2 in IL-3 signal transduction. Further biochemical analyses revealed that IL-3-induced Jak/Stat, Erk, and PI3 kinase pathways in SHP-2(-/-) cells were impaired and reintroduction of WT SHP-2 into mutant cells partially restored IL-3 signaling. Interestingly, in catalytically inactive SHP-2-overexpressing Ba/F3 cells, although IL-3-induced activation of Jak2 and Erk kinases was reduced and shortened, PI3 kinase activation remained unaltered. Taken together, these results suggest that SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase plays multiple roles in IL-3 signal transduction, functioning in both catalytic-dependent and -independent manners in the Jak/Stat, Erk, and PI3 kinase pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2056021062,"Thyroid adenomas belong to the cytogenetically best investigated human epithelial tumors. Cytogenetic studies of about 450 benign lesions allow one to distinguish between different cytogenetic subgroups. Two chromosomal regions, that is, 19q13 and 2p21, are frequently rearranged in these tumors. Although 2p21 aberrations only account for about 10% of the benign thyroid tumors with clonal cytogenetic deviations, 2p21 rearrangements belong to the most common cytogenetic rearrangements in epithelial tumors due to the high frequency of these benign lesions. The 2p21 breakpoint region recently has been delineated to a region of 450 kbp, but the gene affected by the cytogenetic rearrangements still has escaped detection. Positional cloning and 3′ RACE–PCR allowed us to clone that gene which we will refer to as thyroid adenoma associated (THADA) gene. In cells from two thyroid adenomas characterized by translocations t(2;20;3) (p21;q11.2;p25) and t(2;7)(p21;p15), respectively, we performed 3′-RACE–PCRs and found two fusions of THADA with a sequence derived from chromosome band 3p25 or with a sequence derived from chromosome band 7p15. The THADA gene spans roughly 365 kbp and, based on preliminary results, encodes a death receptor-interacting protein."

https://openalex.org/W2079718030,"Endoglin is an integral membrane glycoprotein primarily expressed in the vascular endothelium, but also found on macrophages and stromal cells. It binds several members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta family of growth factors and modulates TGF-beta(1)-dependent cellular responses. However, it lacks cytoplasmic signaling motifs and is considered as an auxiliary receptor for TGF-beta. We show here that endoglin is expressed in mouse and human epidermis and in skin appendages, such as hair follicles and sweat glands, as determined by immunohistochemistry. In normal interfollicular epidermis, endoglin was restricted to basal keratinocytes and absent in differentiating cells of suprabasal layers. Follicular expression of endoglin was high in hair bulb keratinocytes, but decreased in parts distal from the bulb. To address the role of endoglin in skin carcinogenesis in vivo, Endoglin heterozygous mice were subjected to long-term chemical carcinogenesis treatment. Reduction in endoglin had a dual effect during multistage carcinogenesis, by inhibiting the early appearance of benign papillomas, but increasing malignant progression to highly undifferentiated carcinomas. Our results are strikingly similar to those previously reported for transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-beta(1) in the epidermis. These data suggest that endoglin might attenuate TGF-beta(1) signaling in normal epidermis and interfere with progression of skin carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2049716477,"Angiogenesis is regulated by the balance between angiogenic stimulators and inhibitors. Numerous reports have demonstrated that tumors induce aggressive angiogenesis by up-regulating the production of angiogenesis stimulating growth factors to overcome the baseline levels of endogenous inhibitors. However, the possibility of large differences in the host's responsiveness to angiogenic factors has been largely overlooked. Using the corneal micropocket neovascularization assay, we have observed >10-fold differences in responsiveness to either basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) among various mouse strains. The inheritance pattern observed for these traits supported a QTL (quantitative trait locus) approach to mapping the genes responsible for the differences in angiogenic responsiveness. To overcome variability in the assay, we used recombinant inbred lines to map this phenotype. In the BXD series of recombinant inbred mouse strains, we have mapped the regions responsible for regulating VEGF-induced angiogenesis using both composite interval mapping and multiple interval mapping. Both approaches link VEGF responsiveness to regions on chromosomes 2 (near D2Mit6) and 10 (near D10Mit20). Candidate angiogenesis-related genes in these regions include those for collagen XVIII/endostatin, matrix metalloproteinase 11, integrin beta2, prostaglandin D2 synthase, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W2099740899,"We previously reported that the activation of p21(WAF1/Cip1) transcription by histone deacetylase inhibitor apicidin was mediated through Sp1 sites and pointed to the possible participation of protein kinase C (PKC). In this study, we investigated the role and identity of the specific isoforms of PKC involved and identified phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) as an upstream effector in HeLa cells. Using an isoform-specific pharmacological inhibitor of PKC, a PKC epsilon dominant-negative mutant, and antisense oligonucleotide to inhibit PKC epsilon specifically, we found that among PKC isoforms, PKC epsilon was required for the p21(WAF1/Cip1) expression by apicidin. In addition to PKC epsilon, PI 3-kinase appeared to participate in the activation of p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter by apicidin, since inactivation of PI 3-kinase either by transient expression of dominant-negative mutant of PI 3-kinase or its specific inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, attenuated the activation of p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter and p21(WAF1/Cip1) protein expression by apicidin. Furthermore, membrane translocation of PKC epsilon in response to apicidin was blocked by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, indicating the role of PI 3-kinase as an upstream molecule of PKC epsilon in the p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter activation by apicidin. However, the p21(WAF1/Cip1) expression by apicidin appeared to be independent of the histone hyperacetylation, since apicidin-induced histone hyperacetylation of p21(WAF1/Cip1) promoter region was not affected by inhibition of PI 3-kinase and PKC, suggesting that the chromatin remodeling through the histone hyperacetylation alone might not be sufficient for the expression of p21(WAF1/Cip1) by apicidin. Taken together, these results suggest that the PI 3-kinase-PKC epsilon signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the expression of the p21(WAF1/Cip1) by apicidin."

In HO-1 homozygous myocardium, under aerobic conditions, HO-1 enzyme activity, HO-1 mRNA, and protein expression were not detected in comparison with aerobically perfused wild-type and heterozygous myocardium. In wild-type, HO-1 hetero- and homozygous hearts subjected to 20 min ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion, the expression of HO-1 mRNA, protein, and HO-1 enzyme activity was detected in various degrees. A reduction in the expression of HO-1 mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity in fibrillated wild-type and heterozygous myocardium was observed. In reperfused/nonfibrillated wild-type and heterozygous hearts, a reduction in HO-1 mRNA, protein expression, and HO-1 enzyme activity was not observed, indicating that changes in HO-1 mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity could be related to the development of VF. These changes were reflected in the HO-1-related endogenous CO production measured by gas chromatography. In HO-1 knockout ischemic/reperfused myocardium, all hearts showed VF, and no detection in HO-1 mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity was observed. Thus, interventions that are able to increase endogenous CO may prevent the development of VF."

https://openalex.org/W2059856261,"Inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein is essential for the G1/S transition during mammalian cell cycle progression. Although Rb is inactivated by phosphorylation by cyclins D and E and their associated kinases during cell cycle progression, we find that Rb is inactivated upon apoptotic stimulation by Fas through the mediation of p38 kinase, independent of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). Inactivation by p38 kinase coincided with increased phosphorylation of Rb leading to dissociation of E2F and increased transcriptional activity; such p38-mediated changes in Rb function occurred only during Fas stimulation but not mitogenic progression. p38 kinase targets Rb preferentially and had minimal effects on p107 and had no effect on p130 function. We also find that phosphorylation site mutants of Rb (PSM7LP and PSM9-Rb) that cannot be inactivated by cdks can be targeted by Fas and p38 kinase, suggesting that Rb inactivation by these kinases is biochemically and functionally distinct. It appears that Rb inactivation is achieved by different kinase cascades in response to mitogenic and apoptotic signals."
https://openalex.org/W1997161762,"To explain why mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-depleted or rho0 cells still keep a mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta(psi)m) in the absence of respiration, several hypotheses have been proposed. The principal and well accepted one involves a reverse of action for ANT combined to F1-ATPase activity. However, the existence of other putative electrogenic channels has been speculated. Here, using mRNA differential display reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on L929 mtDNA-depleted cells, we identified mtCLIC as a differentially expressed gene in cells deprived from mitochondrial ATP production. Mitochondrial chloride intracellular channel (mtCLIC), a member of a recently discovered and expanding family of chloride intracellular channels, is up-regulated in mtDNA-depleted and rho0 cells. We showed that its expression is dependent on CREB and p53 and is sensitive to calcium and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Interestingly, up- or down-regulation of mtCLIC protein expression changes Delta(psi)m whereas the chloride channel inhibitor NPPB reduces the Delta(psi)m in mtDNA-depleted L929 cells, measured with the fluorescent probe rhodamine 123. Finally, we demonstrated that purified mitochondria from mtDNA-depleted cells incorporate, in a NPPB-sensitive manner, more 36chloride than parental mitochondria. These findings suggest that mtCLIC could be involved in mitochondrial membrane potential generation in mtDNA-depleted cells, a feature required to prevent apoptosis and to drive continuous protein import into mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1982165622,"Increased COX-2 expression and elevated PGE2 have been associated with a poor prognosis in lung cancer. Cannabinoids have been known to exert some of their biological effects via modulation of prostaglandin production. We evaluated the impact of methanandamide on COX-2 expression, PGE2 production, and tumor growth in murine lung cancer. Methanandamide administration (5 mg/kg, four times/wk i.p.) resulted in an increased rate of tumor growth (P<0.01 compared with diluent treated controls). The CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists, SR141716 and SR144528, did not block the methanandamide-mediated increase in tumor growth. In vivo, methanandamide treatment increased the production of PGE2 at the tumor site as well as in splenocytes. Consistent with these results, methanandamide increased PGE2 and COX-2 levels in murine lung cancer cells in vitro via a cannabinoid receptor-independent mechanism. The COX-2-specific inhibitor, SC58236, abrogated methanandamide induction of PGE2 production in vitro and blocked methanandamide-enhanced tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, the p38/MAPK inhibitor, SB203528, and the p42/44 inhibitor, PD98059, blocked methanandamide-mediated induction of PGE2 and COX-2. These results suggest that methanandamide augments tumor growth by a cannabinoid receptor-independent pathway that is associated with the up-regulation of COX-2."
https://openalex.org/W2047313778,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein plays an important role in preventing cancer development by arresting or killing potential tumor cells. Downregulated p53 levels, or mutations within the p53 gene, leading to the loss of p53 activity, are found in many breast carcinomas. Here we demonstrate that the p53 gene is transcriptionally upregulated in the normal mouse mammary gland at midpregnancy. We show that the specific isoform nuclear factor 1-C2 (NF1-C2) plays an important role in this activation. Functional mutation of the NF1-binding site in the mouse p53 promoter resulted in a reduction of the gene expression to less than 30% in mammary epithelial cells. By the use of two powerful techniques, chromatin immunoprecipitation and oligonucleotide decoy, we verify the importance of NF1-C2 in p53 gene activation in vivo. These findings demonstrate a broader role for NF1-C2 in the mammary gland at midpregnancy, beyond its earlier reported activation of milk protein genes. We also demonstrate that NF1-A1 proteins are produced in the mouse mammary gland. However, due to their lower affinity to the NF1-binding site, these proteins are not involved in the transcriptional upregulation of p53 at midpregnancy. This paper constitutes the first report demonstrating the importance of NF1 proteins in the p53 gene activation in the mouse mammary gland. It is also the first time that p53 gene activation is coupled to a specific, endogenously expressed NF1 isoform."

To study the incidence of permanent activation of this receptor in tumorigenicity, a constitutively active mutant was generated by replacing residue Glu151 in the conserved E/DRY motif by Ala. Expression of the E151A-CCK2R mutant in NIH-3T3 cells causes ligand-independent activation of phospholipase C and ornithine decarboxylase, two enzymes critical for mitogenesis. Strikingly, the constitutive activity of this mutant was associated with dramatic alteration of NIH-3T3 cell morphology, enhanced cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, injection of cells expressing E151A-CCK2R in nude mice resulted in the development of large and rapidly growing tumors. By contrast, none of these effects was observed with cells expressing the wild-type CCK2R, indicating that the tumorigenic properties of the E151A-CCK2R mutant is the result of its constitutive activation. To date, this is the first report that provides evidence for the high tumorigenic effect of a constitutively active CCK2R mutant, thus raising a potential role of the CCK2R in human cancer."

The effect of roscovitine was mimicked by other CDK1, 2, 5, and 7 inhibitors but not by CDK4/6 and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway antagonists. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that roscovitine-specific intracellular targets, CDK1, 2, 5, and 7, were expressed in the organ of Corti and especially in Hensen's cells. Affinity chromatography studies showed a tight correlation between the protein levels of CDK1/2 and 5 and the rate of roscovitine-induced supernumerary cells in the organ of Corti. In addition, we demonstrated that basal CDK activity was higher and more roscovitine-sensitive at developmental stages that are selectively permissive for the emergence of supernumerary cells. These results suggest that CDKs are involved in the normal development of the organ of Corti and that, at least in E19 embryos, inhibition of CDKs is sufficient to trigger the differentiation of HCs and corresponding SCs, presumably from the Hensen's cell progenitors and/or from progenitors located in the greater epithelial ridge area."
