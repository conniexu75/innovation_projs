https://openalex.org/W2030260529,"I have listed some of the ways in which the lowland tropics are not such a warm and wonderful place for the farmer, some of the reasons why it may be unreasonable to expect him to cope with the problems, and some of the ways in which the temperate zones make his task more difficult. The tropics are very close to being a tragedy of the commons on a global scale (69, 103), and it is the temperate zone's shepherds and sheep who are among the greatest offenders (31). Given that the temperate zones have some limited amount of resources with which they are willing to repay the tropics, how can these resources best be spent? The first answer, without doubt, is education, and the incorporation of what is already known about the tropics into that education. Second should be the generation of secure psychological and physical resources for governments that show they are enthusiastic about the development of an SYTA. Third should be support of intensive research needed to generate the set of site-specific rules for specific, clearly identified SYTA's. The subject matter of youths' cultural programming is presumably determined by what they will need during the rest of their lives. A major component of this programming should be the teaching of the socioeconomic rules of a sustained-yield, nonexpanding economy, tuned to the concept of living within the carrying capacity of the country's or region's resources. Incorporating such a process into tropical school systems will cause a major upheaval, if for no other reason than that it will involve an evaluation of the country's resources, what standard of living is to be accepted by those living on them, and who is presently harvesting them. Of even greater impact, it will have to evaluate resources in terms of their ability to raise the standard of living by Y amount for X proportion of the people in the region, rather than in terms of their cash value on the world market. For such a change to be technologically successful, it will require a great deal of pantropical information exchange. This information exchange will cost a great deal of resource, not only in travel funds and support of on-site study, but in insurance policies for the countries that are willing to take the risk of trying to change from an exploitative agroecosystem to an SYTA. For such an experiment to be sociologically successful, it will require a complete change in tropical educational systems, from emphasizing descriptions of events as they now stand, to emphasizing analysis of why things happen the way they do. This will also be very expensive, not only in retreading the technology and mind-sets of current teaching programs, but in gathering the facts on why the tropics have met their current fate. There is a surfeit of biological and agricultural reports dealing with ecological experiments and generalities which suggest that such and such will be the outcome if such and such form of resource harvest is attempted. It is clear that human desiderata regarding a particular site are often radically different from the needs of the ""average"" wild animals and plants that formed the basis for such experiments and generalities. A finely tuned SYTA will come close to providing a unique solution for each region. The generalities that will rule it are highly stochastic. The more tropical the region, the more evenly weighted the suboutcomes will be, and thus the more likely each region will be to have a unique overall outcome. For example, it is easy to imagine four different parts of the tropics, each with the same kind of soil and the same climate, with four different, successful SYTA's, one based on paddy rice, one on shelterwood forestry, one on tourism, and one on shifting maize culture. A regional experiment station working holistically toward an SYTA is potentially one of the best solutions available. As currently structured, however, almost all tropical experiment stations are inadequate for such a mission. Most commonly they are structured around a single export crop such as coffee, sugar, rubber, cotton, cacao, or tea. A major portion of their budgets comes directly or indirectly from the industry concerned. This industry can hardly be expected to wish to see its production integrated with a sustained-yield system that charges real costs for its materials. When an experiment station is centered around a major food crop, such as rice or maize, the goal becomes one of maximizing production per acre rather than per unit of resource spent; this goal may often be translated into one of generating more people. More general experiment stations tend to be established in the most productive regions of the country and, therefore, receive the most funding. Such regions (islands, intermediate elevations, areas with severe dry seasons) need experiment stations the least because they can often be successfully farmed with only slightly modified temperate zone technologies and philosophies. The administrators of tropical experiment stations often regard their job as a hardship post and tend to orient their research toward the hand that feeds them, which is certainly not the farming communities in which they have been placed. The tropics do not need more hard cash for tractors; they need a program that will show when, where, and how hand care should be replaced with draft animals, and draft animals with tractors. The tropics do not need more randomly gathered, esoteric or applied agricultural research: they need a means to integrate what is already known into the process of developing SYTA's. The tropics do not need more food as much as a means of evaluating the resources they have and generating social systems that will maximize the standard of living possible with those resources, whatever the size. The tropics need a realistic set of expectations."

This variation is closely matched to the spectral energy in their mating calls, thus enabling them to respond preferentially to the calls of their local dialect."
https://openalex.org/W2019120190,"Large numbers of two species of mole crickets flew to loudspeakers playing the appropriate calling song outdoors. Mated females were more frequently captured than unmated ones, and males were 12 percent of the catch. Crickets of three other subfamilies were trapped as they flew to mole cricket songs resembling their own."
https://openalex.org/W2061456733,"For the present and the foreseeable future the following options appear to be either usable or worth further exploration: mausolea; disposal in mines of various sorts, and perhaps in ice; in situ melt; and further chemical separations. The options are interdependent. It is too early to assess disposal in space, and disposal in the oceans remains unsafe for lack of adequate knowledge. Table 3 is a summary of the main ideas for which we have worked out (sometimes uncertain) costs. For the short term, ultimate disposal in deep mines is the best-developed plan. However, the related concept of in situ melt has significant advantages and should be realistically appraised. Further chemical separation with subsequent recycling of the actinides in a LMFBR should be investigated and implemented, for it would be universally beneficial; on the other hand, additional removal of strontium and cesium does not seem attractive. Thus, for the near future we make the following recommendations: 1) Provide temporary storage facilities to ensure that the projected commercial high-level wastes do not become a public hazard. The AEC adopts this view, and has stated an intention to construct such facilities. But because of the capriciousness of man and nature, a workable ultimate disposal scheme must be developed soon. 2) Fund other ultimate disposal schemes at the same rate as the salt mine project-say $1 million a year or more-to sharpen the technological issues, so that a decision can be reached in the next few years. The schemes should include (i) in situ melt, and the variation with a central repository; (ii) burial in mines other than salt mines (including Antarctic rocks and permanent ice); (iii) further chemical separation of actinides and recycling actinides in a LMFBR. 3) Maintain liaison with the developing space shuttle technology to insure that no opportunity is lost. The AEC has a commitment to hold safety foremost in its waste management program, but budget considerations and management priorities have downgraded the program. Past funding levels and management emphasis have yet to produce, after a decade and a half, one operational long-term storage facility-a sign of both commendable caution and inadequate work. If nuclear power is to resolve our energy needs in the coming decades, its benefits should not be delayed for lack of a viable management program for high-level wastes."
https://openalex.org/W1993401838,"Palynologically productive localities have been found in the United States throughout the Newark Group basins, most of which had previously been assumed to be barren. Rich palynoflorules dominated by coniferous pollen of Circulina-Classopollis type, and well-preserved fossil fishes, including possible new semionotids, have been found in the Hartford basin. Palynological data indicate that the Newark Group has considerable time-stratigraphic range: Upper Triassic for the Cumnock Formation (North Carolina), the Vinita Beds (Virginia), and the upper New Oxford Formation (Pennsylvania), Rhaeto-Liassic for the Brunswick Formation (New Jersey), Portland Formation (Connecticut and Massachusetts), and the Shuttle Meadow Formation (Connecticut)."
https://openalex.org/W2008236064,"Separate and simultaneous determinations of aerial and aquatic gas exchange in the giant salamander, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis (Daudin) were made at 5 degrees , 15 degrees , and 25 degrees C. The aquatic respiration of this animal accounts for over 90 percent of the total volume of oxygen consumed and 97 percent of the total volume of carbon dioxide released at all temperatures. The lungs of these individuals are large transparent sacs which are poor respiratory organs; the lungs probably function more as hydrostatic structures than as gas exchangers. This animal is the largest aquatic vertebrate that lacks gills and yet utilizes almost exclusively an aquatic mode of respiration. Specialized cutaneous modifications, a unique body form, and a peculiar behavioral mechanism are of considerable adaptative significance, and confer to the skin the effectiveness of a veritable ""gill."""
https://openalex.org/W1974269278,"Two widely divergent morphotypes of both adult males and adult females were found in laboratory colonies of Plastosciara perniciosa in Hawaii. Extraordinary modification of all features except the genitalia, with associated behavioral differences, enables the micropterous morphotype to take maximum advantage of a stable larval habitat. Capabilities for migration from adverse habitats, dispersal, and maintenance of gene flow are retained in the macropterous morphotype."

https://openalex.org/W2020064682,"The only areas that are likely to have furnished the original stone for the Colossi of Memnon are near Cairo (Gebel el Ahmar), Aswan, and possibly Silsileh. Neutron activation analysis of samples from the colossi shows them to be distinctly different from samples obtained from the three known quarries near Aswan and from the quarries near Silsileh and Edfu, but very similar to samples obtained from Gebel el Ahmar. Petrographic analysis of colossi and quarry samples also provides strong evidence that the colossi came from Gebel el Ahmar. The blocks used by the engineers of Septimius Severus to reconstruct the north colossus were shown by neutron activation analysis to have originated from a deposit other than Gebel el Ahmar. The composition of these blocks conformed with samples taken from the quarries 8 and 9 km north of Edfu (the quartzite deposit closest to Thebes) and from the Aswan quarries. Petrographic analysis associated these reconstruction blocks with Edfu but not with Aswan. Neutron activation analysis of other artifacts in the area of the colossi indicates that they also came from Cairo rather than Aswan."

https://openalex.org/W2036437143,"Whereas, in most lines of agriculture over-production is so outstanding a phenomenon that curtailment is widely recommended by economists, precisely the opposite is the case in silviculture and forage production. America's wild crop of timber and of feed for livestock falls far short of the demand. Careful attention must be given to all the conditions surrounding the growth of these crops. Among the factors of major importance are the native animals of forest and range lands. Some are pests; others are beneficial. Most play mixed rôles. Efficient production of trees and forage necessitates thorough-going study of the life histories and ecology of all the predominants, both plants and animals. Many animals, especially fishes, birds and mammals, are themselves of extraordinary value for recreation, study, and as a source of income. In some instances the value of the animals on a given area may exceed that of forage or trees. The production of wild life should be more than an incident or by-product of forest and range management. The objective should be maximum continuing values from each area. Attainment of this objective necessitates additional information and increasingly enlightened administration. Research is the foundation of our present prosperity. It must be the corner-stone of future advance. ""The application of traditional methods will no longer suffice."" Biology must participate fully in the solution of the many problems involved."
