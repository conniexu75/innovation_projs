These approaches, however, have yet to end the 2014 outbreak of Ebola after its prolonged presence in West Africa. Here we show that a combination of monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), optimized from two previous antibody cocktails, is able to rescue 100% of rhesus macaques when treatment is initiated up to 5 days post-challenge. High fever, viraemia and abnormalities in blood count and blood chemistry were evident in many animals before ZMapp intervention. Advanced disease, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes, mucosal haemorrhages and generalized petechia could be reversed, leading to full recovery. ELISA and neutralizing antibody assays indicate that ZMapp is cross-reactive with the Guinean variant of Ebola. ZMapp exceeds the efficacy of any other therapeutics described so far, and results warrant further development of this cocktail for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2094379190,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are genomic regions that regulate gene expression. Here the authors provide a publicly available data set of exon-level eQTLs across the human brain. This includes many genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Germ-line genetic control of gene expression occurs via expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We present a large, exon-specific eQTL data set covering ten human brain regions. We found that cis-eQTL signals (within 1 Mb of their target gene) were numerous, and many acted heterogeneously among regions and exons. Co-regulation analysis of shared eQTL signals produced well-defined modules of region-specific co-regulated genes, in contrast to standard coexpression analysis of the same samples. We report cis-eQTL signals for 23.1% of catalogued genome-wide association study hits for adult-onset neurological disorders. The data set is publicly available via public data repositories and via http://www.braineac.org/ . Our study increases our understanding of the regulation of gene expression in the human brain and will be of value to others pursuing functional follow-up of disease-associated variants."
https://openalex.org/W1972019822,"Colorectal cancers (CRCs) often show a dense infiltrate of cytokine-producing immune/inflammatory cells. The exact contribution of each immune cell subset and cytokine in the activation of the intracellular pathways sustaining CRC cell growth is not understood. Herein, we isolate tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) from the tumor area and the macroscopically unaffected, adjacent, colonic mucosa of patients who underwent resection for sporadic CRC and show that the culture supernatants of TILs, but not of LPMCs, potently enhance the growth of human CRC cell lines through the activation of the oncogenic transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). Characterization of immune cell complexity of TILs and LPMCs reveals no differences in the percentages of T cells, natural killer T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and B cells. However, T cells from TILs show a functional switch compared with those from LPMCs to produce large amounts of T helper type 17 (Th17)-related cytokines (that is, interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, IL-21 and IL-22), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-6. Individual neutralization of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α or IL-6 does not change TIL-derived supernatant-driven STAT3 and NF-kB activation, as well as their proproliferative effect in CRC cells. In contrast, simultaneous neutralization of both IL-17A and TNF-α, which abrogates NF-kB signaling, and IL-22 and IL-6, which abrogates STAT3 signaling, reduces the mitogenic effect of supernatants in CRC cells. IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α and IL-6 are also produced in excess in the early colonic lesions in a mouse model of sporadic CRC, associated with enhanced STAT3/NF-kB activation. Mice therapeutically given BP-1-102, an orally bioavailable compound targeting STAT3/NF-kB activation and cross-talk, exhibit reduced colon tumorigenesis and diminished expression of STAT3/NF-kB-activating cytokines in the neoplastic areas. These data suggest that strategies aimed at the cotargeting of STAT3/NF-kB activation and interaction between them might represent an attractive and novel approach to combat CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2074425838,"Several features common to a Western lifestyle, including obesity and low levels of physical activity, are known risk factors for gastrointestinal cancers. There is substantial evidence suggesting that diet markedly affects the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Moreover, there is now unequivocal evidence linking dysbiosis to cancer development. However, the mechanisms by which high-fat diet (HFD)-mediated changes in the microbial community affect the severity of tumorigenesis in the gut remain to be determined. Here we demonstrate that an HFD promotes tumour progression in the small intestine of genetically susceptible, K-ras(G12Dint), mice independently of obesity. HFD consumption, in conjunction with K-ras mutation, mediated a shift in the composition of the gut microbiota, and this shift was associated with a decrease in Paneth-cell-mediated antimicrobial host defence that compromised dendritic cell recruitment and MHC class II molecule presentation in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. When butyrate was administered to HFD-fed K-ras(G12Dint) mice, dendritic cell recruitment in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues was normalized, and tumour progression was attenuated. Importantly, deficiency in MYD88, a signalling adaptor for pattern recognition receptors and Toll-like receptors, blocked tumour progression. The transfer of faecal samples from HFD-fed mice with intestinal tumours to healthy adult K-ras(G12Dint) mice was sufficient to transmit disease in the absence of an HFD. Furthermore, treatment with antibiotics completely blocked HFD-induced tumour progression, suggesting that distinct shifts in the microbiota have a pivotal role in aggravating disease. Collectively, these data underscore the importance of the reciprocal interaction between host and environmental factors in selecting a microbiota that favours carcinogenesis, and they suggest that tumorigenesis is transmissible among genetically predisposed individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2090661905,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, exposure of axons to Aβ causes pathogenic changes that spread retrogradely by unknown mechanisms, affecting the entire neuron. We found that locally applied Aβ1-42 initiates axonal synthesis of a defined set of proteins including the transcription factor ATF4. Inhibition of local translation and retrograde transport or knockdown of axonal Atf4 mRNA abolished Aβ-induced ATF4 transcriptional activity and cell loss. Aβ1-42 injection into the dentate gyrus (DG) of mice caused loss of forebrain neurons whose axons project to the DG. Protein synthesis and Atf4 mRNA were upregulated in these axons, and coinjection of Atf4 siRNA into the DG reduced the effects of Aβ1-42 in the forebrain. ATF4 protein and transcripts were found with greater frequency in axons in the brain of AD patients. These results reveal an active role for intra-axonal translation in neurodegeneration and identify ATF4 as a mediator for the spread of AD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1996018872,"A fundamental feature of immune systems is the ability to distinguish pathogenic from self and commensal elements, and to attack the former but tolerate the latter. Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas immune systems defend against phage infection by using Cas nucleases and small RNA guides that specify one or more target sites for cleavage of the viral genome. Temperate phages include viruses that can integrate into the bacterial chromosome, and they can carry genes that provide a fitness advantage to the lysogenic host. However, CRISPR-Cas targeting that relies strictly on DNA sequence recognition provides indiscriminate immunity both to lytic and lysogenic infection by temperate phages-compromising the genetic stability of these potentially beneficial elements altogether. Here we show that the Staphylococcus epidermidis CRISPR-Cas system can prevent lytic infection but tolerate lysogenization by temperate phages. Conditional tolerance is achieved through transcription-dependent DNA targeting, and ensures that targeting is resumed upon induction of the prophage lytic cycle. Our results provide evidence for the functional divergence of CRISPR-Cas systems and highlight the importance of targeting mechanism diversity. In addition, they extend the concept of 'tolerance to non-self' to the prokaryotic branch of adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2086578108,"It has been suggested that the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of macaques plays a fundamental role in sensorimotor decision-making. We examined the neural code in LIP at the level of individual spike trains using a statistical approach based on generalized linear models. We found that LIP responses reflected a combination of temporally overlapping task- and decision-related signals. Our model accounts for the detailed statistics of LIP spike trains and accurately predicts spike trains from task events on single trials. Moreover, we derived an optimal decoder for heterogeneous, multiplexed LIP responses that could be implemented in biologically plausible circuits. In contrast with interpretations of LIP as providing an instantaneous code for decision variables, we found that optimal decoding requires integrating LIP spikes over two distinct timescales. These analyses provide a detailed understanding of neural representations in LIP and a framework for studying the coding of multiplexed signals in higher brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2082020673,"Activation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor may underlie clinical resistance to inhibition of the anaplastic lymphoma receptor kinase in lung cancer. Crizotinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), shows marked activity in patients whose lung cancers harbor fusions in the gene encoding anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK), but its efficacy is limited by variable primary responses and acquired resistance. In work arising from the clinical observation of a patient with ALK fusion–positive lung cancer who had an exceptional response to an insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R)-specific antibody, we define a therapeutic synergism between ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors. Similar to IGF-1R, ALK fusion proteins bind to the adaptor insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and IRS-1 knockdown enhances the antitumor effects of ALK inhibitors. In models of ALK TKI resistance, the IGF-1R pathway is activated, and combined ALK and IGF-1R inhibition improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with this finding, the levels of IGF-1R and IRS-1 are increased in biopsy samples from patients progressing on crizotinib monotherapy. Collectively these data support a role for the IGF-1R–IRS-1 pathway in both ALK TKI–sensitive and ALK TKI–resistant states and provide a biological rationale for further clinical development of dual ALK and IGF-1R inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2045953361,"Synthetic lethality occurs when the inhibition of two genes is lethal while the inhibition of each single gene is not. It can be harnessed to selectively treat cancer by identifying inactive genes in a given cancer and targeting their synthetic lethal (SL) partners. We present a data-driven computational pipeline for the genome-wide identification of SL interactions in cancer by analyzing large volumes of cancer genomic data. First, we show that the approach successfully captures known SL partners of tumor suppressors and oncogenes. We then validate SL predictions obtained for the tumor suppressor VHL. Next, we construct a genome-wide network of SL interactions in cancer and demonstrate its value in predicting gene essentiality and clinical prognosis. Finally, we identify synthetic lethality arising from gene overactivation and use it to predict drug efficacy. These results form a computational basis for exploiting synthetic lethality to uncover cancer-specific susceptibilities."

Here, we report that c-di-GMP can assemble into a tetramer that mediates the effective dimerization of a transcription factor, BldD, which controls the progression of multicellular differentiation in sporulating actinomycete bacteria. BldD represses expression of sporulation genes during vegetative growth in a manner that depends on c-di-GMP-mediated dimerization. Structural and biochemical analyses show that tetrameric c-di-GMP links two subunits of BldD through their C-terminal domains, which are otherwise separated by ∼10 Å and thus cannot effect dimerization directly. Binding of the c-di-GMP tetramer by BldD is selective and requires a bipartite RXD-X8-RXXD signature. The findings indicate a unique mechanism of protein dimerization and the ability of nucleotide signaling molecules to assume alternative oligomeric states to effect different functions.

The findings indicate a unique mechanism of protein dimerization and the ability of nucleotide signaling molecules to assume alternative oligomeric states to effect different functions. In all domains of life, nucleotide-based second messengers allow a rapid integration of external and internal signals into fine-tuned regulatory pathways that control cellular responses to changing conditions. As a unifying theme, a basic second messenger control module consists of two distinct enzymes for synthesis and degradation of the second messenger and a nucleotide sensor that, upon ligand binding, interacts with a target to produce a cellular output (Hengge, 2009Hengge R. Principles of c-di-GMP signalling in bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). 3′, 5′-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP), which is not produced in archaea or eukaryotes, was first discovered as an allosteric effector of cellulose synthase in Gluconacetobacter xylinus and is now recognized as one of the most important and widespread second messengers in bacteria. c-di-GMP is synthesized from two molecules of GTP by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs), which are characterized by active site GGDEF motifs (A-site) (Paul et al., 2004Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U.

The majority of active DGCs also carry a so-called inhibitory or I-site motif, RxxD, which is involved in feedback inhibition (Christen et al., 2006Christen B. Christen M. Paul R. Schmid F.

USA. 2006; 103: 6712-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The enzymatically active domains involved in c-di-GMP turnover are often associated with diverse sensory domains, thus enabling cells to adjust second messenger levels in response to different environmental stimuli (Hengge, 2009Hengge R. Principles of c-di-GMP signalling in bacteria.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The binding of c-di-GMP to effector proteins impacts diverse processes such as adhesion, virulence, motility, and biofilm formation in unicellular, flagellated bacteria (Römling et al., 2013Römling U.

The only c-di-GMP-responsive transcription factor for which structural information is available and hence c-di-GMP binding is understood is VpsT, which is a member of the well-studied FixJ-LuxR-CsgD family of response regulators. The VpsT structure revealed a characteristic response regulator fold and a W(F/L/M)(T/S)R c-di-GMP-binding motif (Krasteva et al., 2010Krasteva P.V. Fong J.C. Shikuma N.J. Beyhan S. Navarro M.V. Yildiz F.H. Sondermann H. Vibrio cholerae VpsT regulates matrix production and motility by directly sensing cyclic di-GMP.Science. 2010; 327: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Notably, in all known structures of c-di-GMP-binding effector proteins or enzymes, the c-di-GMP is bound either as a monomer or intercalated dimer. Biophysical studies suggest the possibility of higher order oligomeric forms of c-di-GMP, but they have yet to be observed in any biological context (Gentner et al., 2012Gentner M. Allan M.G. Zaehringer F. Schirmer T. Grzesiek S.

Soc. 2012; 134: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While the roles played by c-di-GMP in controlling cellular processes in unicellular bacteria are becoming clear, the function(s) of c-di-GMP in multicellular, nonmotile bacteria such as Streptomyces are unknown. The complex Streptomyces life cycle involves two distinct filamentous cell forms: the growing or vegetative hyphae and the reproductive or aerial hyphae, which differentiate into exospores for dispersion through a massive synchronous septation event (Flärdh and Buttner, 2009Flärdh K. Buttner M.J. Streptomyces morphogenetics: dissecting differentiation in a filamentous bacterium.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In the model species Streptomyces venezuelae, there are three GGDEF proteins, two proteins with HD-GYP domains, and five proteins containing both a GGDEF and an EAL domain (Figure 1A). Altered expression of the GGDEF proteins, CdgA and CdgB, and deletions of the EAL proteins, RmdA and RmdB, have a significant impact on Streptomyces growth progression, suggesting that c-di-GMP plays a role in controlling developmental processes in multicellular bacteria (den Hengst et al., 2010den Hengst C.D.

Interestingly, cdgA and cdgB have recently been identified as direct regulatory targets of the developmental master regulator BldD (den Hengst et al., 2010den Hengst C.D. Tran N.T. Bibb M.J. Chandra G. Leskiw B.K. Buttner M.J. Genes essential for morphological development and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor are targets of BldD during vegetative growth.Mol.

Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 3100-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutations in the bld loci block the formation of aerial hyphae, resulting in a “bald” phenotype, and also affect the production of antibiotics (McCormick and Flärdh, 2012McCormick J.R. Flärdh K. Signals and regulators that govern Streptomyces development.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2012; 36: 206-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). BldD sits at the top of the regulatory cascade controlling development, serving to repress expression of sporulation genes during vegetative growth (den Hengst et al., 2010den Hengst C.D. Tran N.T. Bibb M.J. Chandra G. Leskiw B.K. Buttner M.J. Genes essential for morphological development and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor are targets of BldD during vegetative growth.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In Streptomyces coelicolor, BldD controls the expression of at least 167 genes, including 42 genes (∼25% of the regulon) that encode regulatory proteins (Elliot et al., 2001Elliot M.A. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Leskiw B.K. BldD is a direct regulator of key developmental genes in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).Mol.

Microbiol. 2010; 78: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Among these BldD targets are many genes known to play critical roles in Streptomyces development, including other bld regulators (e.g., bldA, bldC, bldH/adpA, bldM, and bldN), several whi (white) regulators required for the differentiation of aerial hyphae into spores (e.g., whiG and whiB), and genes encoding critical components of the cell division and chromosome segregation machineries such as FtsZ, SsgA, SsgB, and the DNA translocase SffA (den Hengst et al., 2010den Hengst C.D.

Microbiol. 2009; 12: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). How BldD activity is regulated, however, has been unknown. Here we show that BldD is a c-di-GMP-binding effector protein, thus revealing a link between c-di-GMP signaling and the development of multicellular bacteria. Specifically, structural and biochemical analyses show that the second messenger c-di-GMP activates BldD DNA binding by driving a unique form of dimerization that is mediated by a tetrameric form of c-di-GMP. The c-di-GMP tetramer performs its oligomerization function by adjoining two BldD C-terminal domain (CTD) protomers, the polypeptide chains of which are separated by ∼10 Å. BldD recognizes the c-di-GMP tetramer using a bipartite RXD-X8-RXXD c-di-GMP interaction signature sequence from each subunit. Thus, tetrameric c-di-GMP acts as a small-molecule dimerizing agent that controls the DNA-binding activity of BldD, leading to repression of the BldD regulon of sporulation genes during vegetative growth, thereby controlling the hypha-to-spore transition in multicellular bacteria. To gain insight into the cellular processes controlled by c-di-GMP in streptomycetes, we overexpressed either the active DGC CdgB from S. coelicolor (Tran et al., 2011Tran N.T. Den Hengst C.D. Gomez-Escribano J.-P. Buttner M.J. Identification and characterization of CdgB, a diguanylate cyclase involved in developmental processes in Streptomyces coelicolor.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 3100-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or the active PDE YhjH from E. coli (Pesavento et al., 2008Pesavento C. Becker G. Sommerfeldt N. Possling A. Tschowri N. Mehlis A. Hengge R. Inverse regulatory coordination of motility and curli-mediated adhesion in Escherichia coli.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2434-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Strikingly, overexpression of both CdgB and YhjH blocked the generation of aerial mycelium by S. venezuelae (Figure 1B). However, scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) revealed that, whereas overexpression of CdgB blocked development, resulting in a classical bald phenotype, overexpression of the PDE YhjH in fact promoted sporulation, but the colonies appeared bald to the naked eye because aerial mycelium formation had been bypassed (Figure 1C). As judged by heat resistance, the spores made by the YhjH overexpression strain were as robust as those of the wild-type (WT) (Figure S1A available online). Moreover, overexpression of catalytically inactive versions of YhjH or CdgB had no effect on S. venezuelae development (Figure S1B). These data suggest that intracellular levels of c-di-GMP influence the timing of development. In particular, they suggest that increased c-di-GMP levels delay differentiation, arresting the colonies in the vegetative growth stage, whereas decreased levels of the second messenger accelerate development, favoring sporulation. S. venezuelae has no PilZ domain-containing proteins, and no putative c-di-GMP-binding effector proteins have so far been identified in the Streptomyces genus. Thus, to address the mechanism by which S. venezuelae senses c-di-GMP to control sporulation, we sought to identify c-di-GMP effector proteins involved in development. To selectively enrich putative c-di-GMP-binding proteins from S. venezuelae cell extracts, we performed an affinity pull-down assay using a c-di-GMP capture compound (Nesper et al., 2012Nesper J. Reinders A. Glatter T. Schmidt A. Jenal U. A novel capture compound for the identification and analysis of cyclic di-GMP binding proteins.J. Proteomics. 2012; 75: 4874-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Captured proteins were identified by tryptic mass spectrometry fingerprinting. Remarkably, the developmental master regulator BldD was repeatedly recovered in our c-di-GMP-based capture compound experiments. BldD is an 18 kDa DNA-binding protein (Elliot and Leskiw, 1999Elliot M.A. Leskiw B.K. The BldD protein from Streptomyces coelicolor is a DNA-binding protein.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6832-6835PubMed Google Scholar) consisting of two distinct domains connected by a flexible linker (Figure 2A). The N-terminal domain is the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and has a xenobiotic response element (XRE) helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif (Kim et al., 2006Kim I.K. Lee C.J. Kim M.K. Kim J.M. Kim J.H. Yim H.S. Cha S.S. Kang S.O. Crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of BldD, a central regulator of aerial mycelium formation in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 1179-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The BldD CTD harbors a largely helical fold with no known function (Kim et al., 2014Kim J.M. Won H.S. Kang S.O. The C-terminal domain of the transcriptional regulator BldD from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) constitutes a novel fold of winged-helix domains.Proteins. 2014; 82: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To probe the interaction between BldD and c-di-GMP further and to identify the c-di-GMP-binding domain, we used differential radial capillary action of ligand assays (DRaCALA) (Roelofs et al., 2011Roelofs K.G. Wang J. Sintim H.O. Lee V.T. Differential radial capillary action of ligand assay for high-throughput detection of protein-metabolite interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 15528-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). DRaCALA allows the visualization of protein-bound radiolabeled ligand as a concentrated spot after the application of the protein-ligand mixture onto nitrocellulose. Using this assay, we confirmed that full-length (FL) BldD (expressed as an N-terminally His6-tagged protein) from both S. venezuelae (Figures 2B and S2B) and S. coelicolor (data not shown) bind 32P-labeled c-di-GMP. Importantly, the DRaCALA assays demonstrated that the previously uncharacterized CTD of BldD functions as the c-di-GMP-binding domain (Figure 2B). Further, excess unlabeled c-di-GMP, but not GTP, competed with the labeled c-di-GMP for binding to FL BldD and to BldD-CTD. Thus, these data reveal that the CTD of the key developmental regulator BldD is a c-di-GMP-binding domain.Figure S2CdgB Overexpression Has No Phenotypic Effect on a bldD Mutant, c-di-GMP Binding Is Required for BldD Activity In Vivo, and Motifs 1 and 2 Are Both Required for c-di-GMP Binding In Vitro, Related to Figures 3 and 5Show full caption(A) Scanning electron micrographs showing that overexpression of CdgB has no effect on the phenotype of the bldD mutant and that an allele of bldD encoding a protein defective in c-di-GMP binding (with the DGR-X8-DQDR mutation) cannot complement a bldD mutant.

USA. 2011; 108: 15528-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) for c-di-GMP binding. Using global chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray analysis (ChIP-chip), we previously identified the complete BldD regulon in S. coelicolor, showing that it encompasses ∼167 transcription units (den Hengst et al., 2010den Hengst C.D. Tran N.T. Bibb M.J. Chandra G. Leskiw B.K. Buttner M.J. Genes essential for morphological development and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor are targets of BldD during vegetative growth.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Through MEME-based sequence analysis of all the promoter regions directly targeted by BldD, we defined a 13 bp pseudo-palindromic sequence, 5′-TNAC(N)5GTNA-3′, designated the BldD box, which functions as a specific binding sequence for BldD (den Hengst et al., 2010den Hengst C.D. Tran N.T. Bibb M.J. Chandra G. Leskiw B.K. Buttner M.J. Genes essential for morphological development and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor are targets of BldD during vegetative growth.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that the BldD box was conserved between S. coelicolor and S. venezuelae for most key BldD target promoters (den Hengst et al., 2010den Hengst C.D. Tran N.T. Bibb M.J. Chandra G. Leskiw B.K. Buttner M.J. Genes essential for morphological development and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor are targets of BldD during vegetative growth.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further, BldD from S. coelicolor and S. venezuelae contain an identical DBD and differ by only two residues in the DBD-CTD linker and five residues in the CTD, suggesting that BldD function is broadly conserved between the two species. Having shown that BldD binds c-di-GMP, we tested the effect of c-di-GMP on BldD DNA binding. Radiolabeled S. venezuelae DNA fragments encompassing the promoter regions of two well-characterized BldD target genes, bldM and whiG, including the bioinformatically identified BldD box (Figure 2C), were used as target DNAs in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) (Figure 2D). The fixed concentration of BldD used in these assays (0.6 μM) was insufficient to elicit a DNA mobility shift. However, the addition of increasing concentrations of c-di-GMP (0.25–1.75 μM) strongly induced BldD binding to both the tested promoter regions (Figure 2D). To confirm and extend these results into cells, we manipulated the levels of c-di-GMP in S. venezuelae and monitored the effect on BldD binding to the bldM and whiG promoters in vivo using ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq). The degree of BldD binding was assayed at a single time point in WT S. venezuelae and the WT overexpressing either the DGC CdgB or the PDE YhjH (the strains whose phenotypes are described above). Consistent with the in vitro EMSA data, overexpression of the DGC enhanced ChIP-seq peak height at the BldD target promoters relative to the WT control (Figure 2E). Conversely, overexpression of the PDE lowered ChIP-seq peak heights at BldD target promoters relative to the WT (Figure 2E). These data demonstrate that c-di-GMP enhances the binding of BldD to the BldD box, stimulating BldD-mediated repression of its target regulon. Thus, it is not BldD, but a BldD-(c-di-GMP) complex, that serves to turn off sporulation genes during vegetative growth. The opposing effects of the overexpression of the DGC CdgB and the PDE YhjH suggested that high levels of c-di-GMP retard sporulation and low levels of c-di-GMP accelerate sp"

https://openalex.org/W2164505583,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent cancer with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Tumorigenesis has been linked with macrophage-mediated chronic inflammation and diverse signalling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. The precise role of EGFR in HCC is unknown, and EGFR inhibitors have shown disappointing clinical results. Here we discover that EGFR is expressed in liver macrophages in both human HCC and in a mouse HCC model. Mice lacking EGFR in macrophages show impaired hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas mice lacking EGFR in hepatocytes unexpectedly develop more HCC owing to increased hepatocyte damage and compensatory proliferation. Mechanistically, following interleukin-1 stimulation, EGFR is required in liver macrophages to transcriptionally induce interleukin-6, which triggers hepatocyte proliferation and HCC. Importantly, the presence of EGFR-positive liver macrophages in HCC patients is associated with poor survival. This study demonstrates a tumour-promoting mechanism for EGFR in non-tumour cells, which could lead to more effective precision medicine strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2033077654,"Contractile myoepithelial cells dominate the basal layer of the mammary epithelium and are considered to be differentiated cells. However, we observe that up to 54% of single basal cells can form colonies when seeded into adherent culture in the presence of agents that disrupt actin–myosin interactions, and on average, 65% of the single-cell-derived basal colonies can repopulate a mammary gland when transplanted in vivo. This indicates that a high proportion of basal myoepithelial cells can give rise to a mammary repopulating unit (MRU). We demonstrate that myoepithelial cells, flow-sorted using two independent myoepithelial-specific reporter strategies, have MRU capacity. Using an inducible lineage-tracing approach we follow the progeny of myoepithelial cells that express α-smooth muscle actin and show that they function as long-lived lineage-restricted stem cells in the virgin state and during pregnancy. Myoepithelial cells considered terminally differentiated are now shown by Stingl and colleagues to have stem cell properties in vitro, to repopulate a mammary gland on transplantation and to behave as stem cells by lineage tracing."

Here, we report function and mechanisms of miR-181 family in myeloid differentiation and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aberrant overexpression of all the miR-181 family members (miR-181a/b/c/d) was detected in French–American–British M1, M2 and M3 subtypes of adult AML patients. By conducting gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that miR-181a inhibits granulocytic and macrophage-like differentiation of HL-60 cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) by directly targeting and downregulating the expression of PRKCD (which then affected the PRKCD-P38-C/EBPα pathway), CTDSPL (which then affected the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein) and CAMKK1. The three genes were also demonstrated to be the targets of miR-181b, miR-181c and miR-181d, respectively. Significantly decreases in the expression levels of the target proteins were detected in AML patients. Inhibition of the expression of miR-181 family members owing to Lenti-miRZip-181a infection in bone marrow blasts of AML patients increased target protein expression levels and partially reversed myeloid differentiation blockage. In the mice implanted with AML CD34+ HSPCs, expression inhibition of the miR-181 family by Lenti-miRZip-181a injection improved myeloid differentiation, inhibited engraftment and infiltration of the leukemic CD34+ cells into the bone marrow and spleen, and released leukemic symptoms. In conclusion, our findings revealed new mechanism of miR-181 family in normal hematopoiesis and AML development, and suggested that expression inhibition of the miR-181 family could provide a new strategy for AML therapy."

Here we show that the RSC chromatin remodeling complex recruits budding yeast Scc2-Scc4 to broad nucleosome-free regions, which the cohesin loader helps to maintain. Consequently, inactivation of either the cohesin loader or the RSC complex has similar effects on nucleosome positioning, gene expression and sister chromatid cohesion. These results show an intimate link between local chromatin structure and higher-order chromosome architecture. Our findings pertain to the similarities between two severe human disorders, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, which is caused by alterations in the human cohesin loader, and Coffin-Siris syndrome, which results from alterations in human RSC complex components.

Within a single lineage, intermediate precursors initially do not divide and generate only one neuron; subsequently, precursors divide, but their Notch(ON) progeny systematically die through Reaper activity, whereas later, their Notch(OFF) progeny die through Hid activity. These mechanisms dictate how the tOPC produces neurons for three different optic ganglia. We conclude that temporal patterning generates neuronal diversity by specifying both the identity and survival/death of each unique neuronal subtype."

Amplification of the MYCN oncogene, which occurs in approximately 20-25% of human neuroblastomas, is the most prominent genetic marker of high-stage disease. The availability of valid preclinical in vivo models is a prerequisite to develop novel targeted therapies. We here report on the generation of transgenic mice with Cre-conditional induction of MYCN in dopamine β-hydroxylase-expressing cells, termed LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre. These mice develop neuroblastic tumors with an incidence of >75%, regardless of strain background. Molecular profiling of tumors revealed upregulation of the MYCN-dependent miR-17-92 cluster as well as expression of neuroblastoma marker genes, including tyrosine hydroxylase and the neural cell adhesion molecule 1. Gene set enrichment analyses demonstrated significant correlation with MYC-associated expression patterns. Array comparative genome hybridization showed that chromosomal aberrations in LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre tumors were syntenic to those observed in human neuroblastomas. Treatment of a cell line established from a tumor derived from a LSL-MYCN;Dbh-iCre mouse with JQ1 or MLN8237 reduced cell viability and demonstrated oncogene addiction to MYCN. Here we report establishment of the first Cre-conditional human MYCN-driven mouse model for neuroblastoma that closely recapitulates the human disease with respect to tumor localization, histology, marker expression and genomic make up.

We exploit the relatively large paramagnetic susceptibility of these hemozoin particles, which induce substantial changes in the transverse relaxation rate of proton nuclear magnetic resonance of RBCs, to infer the 'parasite load' in blood. Using an inexpensive benchtop 0.5-Tesla MRR system, we show that with minimal sample preparatory steps and without any chemical or immunolabeling, a parasitemia level of fewer than ten parasites per microliter in a volume below 10 μl of whole blood is detected in a few minutes.

https://openalex.org/W2026077675,"Helicobacter pylori infection causes gastric cancer, the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. More than half of the world’s population is infected, making universal eradication impractical. Clinical trials suggest that antibiotic treatment only reduces gastric cancer risk in patients with non-atrophic gastritis (NAG), and is ineffective once preneoplastic lesions of multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) have occurred. Therefore, additional strategies for risk stratification and chemoprevention of gastric cancer are needed. We have implicated polyamines, generated by the rate-limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), in gastric carcinogenesis. During H. pylori infection, the enzyme spermine oxidase (SMOX) is induced, which generates hydrogen peroxide from the catabolism of the polyamine spermine. Herein, we assessed the role of SMOX in the increased gastric cancer risk in Colombia associated with the Andean mountain region when compared with the low-risk region on the Pacific coast. When cocultured with gastric epithelial cells, clinical strains of H. pylori from the high-risk region induced more SMOX expression and oxidative DNA damage, and less apoptosis than low-risk strains. These findings were not attributable to differences in the cytotoxin-associated gene A oncoprotein. Gastric tissues from subjects from the high-risk region exhibited greater levels of SMOX and oxidative DNA damage by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, and this occurred in NAG, MAG and IM. In Mongolian gerbils, a prototype colonizing strain from the high-risk region induced more SMOX, DNA damage, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma than a colonizing strain from the low-risk region. Treatment of gerbils with either α-difluoromethylornithine, an inhibitor of ODC, or MDL 72527 (N1,N4-Di(buta-2,3-dien-1-yl)butane-1,4-diamine dihydrochloride), an inhibitor of SMOX, reduced gastric dysplasia and carcinoma, as well as apoptosis-resistant cells with DNA damage. These data indicate that aberrant activation of polyamine-driven oxidative stress is a marker of gastric cancer risk and a target for chemoprevention."
https://openalex.org/W2141285014,"Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that mediate signal transduction in a variety of tissues. Despite their importance, the signalling cascades that regulate cilium formation remain incompletely understood. Here we report that prostaglandin signalling affects ciliogenesis by regulating anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT). Zebrafish leakytail (lkt) mutants show ciliogenesis defects, and the lkt locus encodes an ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCC4). We show that Lkt/ABCC4 localizes to the cell membrane and exports prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a function that is abrogated by the Lkt/ABCC4T804M mutant. PGE2 synthesis enzyme cyclooxygenase-1 and its receptor, EP4, which localizes to the cilium and activates the cyclic-AMP-mediated signalling cascade, are required for cilium formation and elongation. Importantly, PGE2 signalling increases anterograde but not retrograde velocity of IFT and promotes ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings lead us to propose that Lkt/ABCC4-mediated PGE2 signalling acts through a ciliary G-protein-coupled receptor, EP4, to upregulate cAMP synthesis and increase anterograde IFT, thereby promoting ciliogenesis. Zhong and colleagues report that zebrafish leakytail (Lkt) promotes ciliogenesis by exporting prostaglandin E2 to upregulate cAMP synthesis. A human orthologue of Lkt, ABCC4, is also important for ciliogenesis in human retinal pigment epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975828432,"Homologous recombination (HR) is required for faithful repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Defects in HR repair cause severe genomic instability and challenge cellular viability. Paradoxically, various cancers are HR defective and have apparently acquired characteristics to survive genomic instability. We aimed to identify these characteristics to uncover therapeutic targets for HR-deficient cancers. Cytogenetic analysis of 1143 ovarian cancers showed that the degree of genomic instability was correlated to amplification of replication checkpoint genes ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) and CHEK1. To test whether genomic instability leads to increased reliance on replication checkpoint signaling, we inactivated Rad51 to model HR-related genomic instability. Rad51 inactivation caused defective HR repair and induced aberrant replication dynamics. Notably, inhibition of Rad51 led to increased ATR/checkpoint kinase-1 (Chk1)-mediated replication stress signaling. Importantly, inhibition of ATR or Chk1 preferentially killed HR-deficient cancer cells. Combined, our data show that defective HR caused by Rad51 inhibition results in differential sensitivity for ATR and Chk1 inhibitors, implicating replication checkpoint kinases as potential drug targets for HR-defective cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2007786003,"We previously characterized the link between WNT7A and the progression of ovarian cancer. Other groups have identified FGF1 as a relevant risk factor in ovarian cancer. Here, we show a linkage between these two signaling pathways that may be exploited to improve treatment and prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. High expression of WNT7A and FGF1 are correlated in ovarian carcinomas and poor overall patient survival. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that WNT7A/β-catenin signaling directly regulates FGF1 expression via TCF binding elements in the FGF1-1C promoter locus. In vitro gene manipulation studies revealed that FGF1 is sufficient to drive the tumor-promoting effects of WNT7A. In vivo xenograft studies confirmed that the stable overexpression of WNT7A or FGF1 induced a significant increase in tumor incidence, whereas FGF1 knockdown in WNT7A overexpressing cells caused a significant reduction in tumor size. Niclosamide most efficiently abrogated WNT7A/β-catenin signaling in our model, inhibited β-catenin transcriptional activity and cell viability, and increased cell death. Furthermore, niclosamide decreased cell migration following an increase in E-cadherin subsequent to decreased levels of SLUG. The effects of niclosamide on cell functions were more potent in WNT7A-overexpressing cells. Oral niclosamide inhibited tumor growth and progression in an intraperitoneal xenograft mouse model representative of human ovarian cancer. Collectively, these results indicate that FGF1 is a direct downstream target of WNT7A/β-catenin signaling and this pathway has potential as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. Moreover, niclosamide is a promising inhibitor of this pathway and may have clinical relevance."
https://openalex.org/W1970489775,"Proper microtubule nucleation during cell division requires augmin, a microtubule-associated hetero-octameric protein complex. In current models, augmin recruits γ-tubulin, through the carboxyl terminus of its hDgt6 subunit to nucleate microtubules within spindles. However, augmin’s biochemical complexity has restricted analysis of its structural organization and function. Here, we reconstitute human augmin and show that it is a Y-shaped complex that can adopt multiple conformations. Further, we find that a dimeric sub-complex retains in vitro microtubule-binding properties of octameric complexes, but not proper metaphase spindle localization. Addition of octameric augmin complexes to Xenopus egg extracts promotes microtubule aster formation, an activity enhanced by Ran–GTP. This activity requires microtubule binding, but not the characterized hDgt6 γ-tubulin-recruitment domain. Tetrameric sub-complexes induce asters, but activity and microtubule bundling within asters are reduced compared with octameric complexes. Together, our findings shed light on augmin’s structural organization and microtubule-binding properties, and define subunits required for its function in organizing microtubule-based structures. The augmin complex is needed for centrosome-independent microtubule nucleation. Reconstitution and characterization of the human augmin complex by Kapoor and colleagues reveal its architecture and microtubule-binding properties."
https://openalex.org/W2026797136,"The abundances of elements in stars are a critical clue to their origins. Observed star-to-star variations in logarithmic abundance within an open cluster are typically only $\sim 0.01-0.05$ over many elements, significantly smaller than the variation of $\sim 0.06-0.3$ seen in the interstellar medium from which the stars form. It is unknown why clusters are so homogenous, and whether homogeneity should also prevail in regions of lower star formation efficiency that do not produce bound clusters. Here we report adaptive mesh simulations using passively-advected scalars in order to trace the mixing of chemical elements as star-forming clouds form and collapse. We show that turbulent mixing during cloud assembly naturally produces a stellar abundance scatter at least ~5 times smaller than that in the gas, sufficient to fully explain the observed chemical homogeneity of stars. Moreover, mixing occurs very early, so that regions with efficiencies $\varepsilon \sim 10\%$ are nearly as well-mixed as those with $\varepsilon\sim 50\%$. This implies that even regions that do not form bound clusters are likely to be well-mixed, and enhances the prospects for using chemical tagging to reconstruct dissolved star clusters via their unique chemical signatures."

Compound 18A inhibits HIV-1 infection by blocking some of these conformational changes. Binding to the primary receptor, CD4, triggers conformational changes in the metastable HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer ((gp120-gp41)3) that are important for virus entry into host cells. These changes include an 'opening' of the trimer, creation of a binding site for the CCR5 co-receptor and formation and/or exposure of a gp41 coiled coil. Here we identify a new compound, 18A (1), that specifically inhibits the entry of a wide range of HIV-1 isolates. 18A does not interfere with CD4 or CCR5 binding, but it inhibits the CD4-induced disruption of quaternary structures at the trimer apex and the exposure of the gp41 HR1 coiled coil. Analysis of HIV-1 variants with increased or reduced sensitivity to 18A suggests that the inhibitor can distinguish distinct conformational states of gp120 in the unliganded Env trimer. The broad-range activity and observed hypersensitivity of resistant mutants to antibody neutralization support further investigation of 18A."

https://openalex.org/W2062739115,"Stu2 is the budding yeast member of the XMAP215/Dis1 family of microtubule polymerases. It is essential in cell division, allowing proper spindle orientation and metaphase chromosome alignment, as well as spindle elongation during anaphase. Despite Stu2 having a phenotype that suggests it promotes microtubule growth, like the other members of the XMAP215/Dis1 family, previous studies with purified Stu2 indicate only that it antagonizes microtubule growth. One potential explanation for these contradictory findings is that the assays were performed with mammalian brain tubulin, which may not be the right substrate to test the activity of Stu2 given that yeast and brain tubulins are quite divergent in sequence and that the vertebrate tubulins are subject to many post-translational modifications. To test this possibility, we reconstituted the activity of Stu2 with purified budding yeast tubulin. We found that Stu2 accelerated microtubule growth in yeast tubulin by severalfold, similar to the acceleration reported for XMAP215 in porcine brain tubulin. Furthermore, Stu2 accelerated polymerization in yeast tubulin to a much greater extent than in porcine brain tubulin, and the concentration of Stu2 required to reach 50% maximum activity in yeast tubulin was nearly 2 orders of magnitude lower than that in porcine brain tubulin. We conclude that Stu2 is a microtubule polymerase, like its relatives, and that its activity is considerably higher in yeast tubulin compared with mammalian brain tubulin.

The founding member of this family, XMAP215, is required for rapid microtubule growth in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and accelerates elongation of the fast-growing plus ends of microtubules by up to 8-fold in the presence of purified bovine brain tubulin (7.Gard D.L. Kirschner M.W. A microtubule-associated protein from Xenopus eggs that specifically promotes assembly at the plus end.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2203-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Tea1, the Aspergillus nidulans homolog of XMAP215, accelerates the growth of porcine brain microtubules to a similar extent as XMAP215 (8.Takeshita N. Mania D. Herrero S. Ishitsuka Y. Nienhaus G.U.

Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 5400-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Stu2, the budding yeast homolog of this family, is required for elongation of the mitotic spindle during anaphase (9.Severin F. Habermann B. Huffaker T. Hyman T. Stu2 promotes mitotic spindle elongation in anaphase.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), as well as for spindle orientation and metaphase chromosome alignment (10.Kosco K.A. Pearson C.G. Maddox P.S. Wang P.J. Adams I.R. Salmon E.D. Bloom K. Huffaker T.C. Control of microtubule dynamics by Stu2p is essential for spindle orientation and metaphase chromosome alignment in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2870-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking the TOG1 domain of Stu2 exhibit shorter cytoplasmic microtubules and shorter spindles (11.Al-Bassam J. van Breugel M. Harrison S.C. Hyman A. Stu2p binds tubulin and undergoes an open-to-closed conformational change.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), consistent with Stu2 promoting microtubule growth. However, studies with purified Stu2 have shown that it slows, rather than accelerates, elongation of microtubules grown in brain tubulin (12.van Breugel M. Drechsel D. Hyman A. Stu2p, the budding yeast member of the conserved Dis1/XMAP215 family of microtubule-associated proteins is a plus end-binding microtubule destabilizer.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these authors reported that Stu2 also promotes catastrophe, the transition of growing microtubules to shrinking ones, which often correlates with slower growth rates. One interpretation of these results is that not all members of the XMAP215/Dis1 family are polymerases and that the shared protein domains, notably the TOG domains (13.Ayaz P. Ye X. Huddleston P. Brautigam C.A. Rice L.M.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2741-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), may have divergent activities. An alternative explanation for the difference in Stu2 and XMAP215 activities is that mammalian brain tubulin may not be the right substrate to test the activity of Stu2 given that yeast and brain tubulins are quite divergent in sequence and that the vertebrate tubulins are subject to many post-translational modifications (see “Discussion”). To test this possibility, we reconstituted the polymerization activity of Stu2 with budding yeast tubulin. We used two Stu2 constructs: the N-terminally His6-tagged full-length protein (Stu2) and the same protein with C-terminal spacer (AAEFM) followed by enhanced GFP (Stu2-GFP). Sf+ cells were transfected with the baculovirus encoding Stu2 or Stu2-GFP and harvested by centrifugation at 1300 rpm for 15 min. The pellets were dissolved in cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm MgATP, and protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 10 µg/ml antipain, 5 µg/ml chymotrypsin, 20 µg/ml as l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 µg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 µg/ml TAME (N-p-Tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride), 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 µm E64)). Normally, 4 ml of lysis buffer was used per 1 g of pellet. The crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences HiTrap SP HP). The column was washed with cation buffer (6.7 mm HEPES, 6.7 mm MES, 6.7 mm NaOAc (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 µm MgATP, and protease inhibitors), and the protein was washed with cation buffer and then with cation buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and eluted from the column with cation buffer containing 350 mm NaCl. This fraction was loaded onto a Ni2+-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences HisTrap HP). The column was washed with imidazole buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 µm ATP, and protease inhibitors) and then with imidazole buffer containing 70 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with imidazole buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were pooled, aliquoted, and snap-frozen in liquid N2. Protein was stored at −80 °C. XMAP215 was purified as described previously (24.Brouhard G.J. Stear J.H. Noetzel T.L. Al-Bassam J.

Porcine brain tubulin was purified as described previously (15.Gell C. Friel C.T. Borgonovo B. Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A. Howard J. Purification of tubulin from porcine brain.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 777: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cycled tubulin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or rhodamine (TAMRA (5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester), Invitrogen) as described by Hyman et al. (16.Hyman A. Drechsel D. Kellogg D. Salser S. Sawin K. Steffen P. Wordeman L. Mitchison T. Preparation of modified tubulins.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 478-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). GMP-CPP2-stabilized microtubules were grown as described (17.Hunter A.W. Caplow M. Coy D.L. Hancock W.O. Diez S. Wordeman L. Howard J.

Cell. 2003; 11: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Budding yeast tubulin was purified from strain BJ2168. The culture was collected at an exponential phase of growth (A600 = 1), and the pellet was resuspended in buffer (0.7 ml of buffer/liter of cells) containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 µg/ml pepstatin A, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin. The cells were then dropped into liquid nitrogen, giving cryo-beads. The beads were processed by grinding in a Retsch ZM 200 grinder, yielding a final powder lysate that was stored at −80 °C. This lysate was used for purification of tubulin with the TOG column as described previously (18.Widlund P.O. Podolski M. Reber S. Alper J. Storch M. Hyman A.A. Howard J. Drechsel D.N. One-step purification of assembly-competent tubulin from diverse eukaryotic sources.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Dynamic microtubule assays using rhodamine-labeled seeds and dynamic (Alexa Fluor 488-labeled or unlabeled) extensions were performed as described previously (19.Gell C. Bormuth V. Brouhard G.J. Cohen D.N. Diez S. Friel C.T. Helenius J. Nitzsche B. Petzold H. Ribbe J. Schäffer E. Stear J.H. Trushko A. Varga V. Widlund P.O. Zanic M. Howard J. Microtubule dynamics reconstituted in vitro and imaged by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy.Methods Cell Biol. 2010; 95: 221-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The imaging buffer consisted of BRB80 (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8) supplemented with 40 mm glucose, 40 µg/ml glucose oxidase, 16 µg/ml catalase, 0.1 mg/ml casein, 1% DTT, 1 mm GTP, and 50 mm KCl (unless stated otherwise). In total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy experiments, images were acquired every 5 or 10 s with an Andor iXon camera on a Zeiss inverted microscope with a Zeiss alpha FLUAR 100×/1.45 oil objective. An objective heater was used to heat the sample to 35 °C (brain tubulin) or 28 °C (yeast tubulin). Static assays were performed in the same way as the dynamic assays, except that Alexa Fluor 488-labeled tubulin was not used in this case, and GTP was not added to the imaging buffer. Images were collected either every 10 s or every 100 ms (in streaming mode). In differential interference contrast (DIC) experiments, we used the setup described previously (20.Bormuth V. Howard J. Schäffer E. LED illumination for video-enhanced DIC imaging of single microtubules.J. Microsc. 2007; 226: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by making kymographs from acquired images using Fiji software, which were then used to measure the parameters of microtubule dynamics. Growth rate was determined by measuring the change in length of a microtubule over time. Catastrophe frequency was expressed as the number of catastrophes over the total time of microtubule growth. To investigate the activity of Stu2, we first performed experiments using porcine brain tubulin. Stable microtubules were grown from porcine brain tubulin, 25% of which was labeled with rhodamine, in the presence of GMP-CPP, a slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog (21.Hyman A.A. Salser S. Drechsel D.N. Unwin N. Mitchison T.J. Role of GTP hydrolysis in microtubule dynamics: information from a slowly hydrolyzable analogue, GMP-CPP.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These stable microtubules were bound to the surface of a coverslip using anti-rhodamine antibodies and imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A). To investigate the effect of Stu2 on microtubule growth, 7 µm 10% Alexa Fluor 488-labeled porcine brain tubulin and various concentrations of unlabeled Stu2 were added. Microtubule growth and the transition between the growing and shrinking phases were quantified from the kymographs (Fig. 1B). Increasing the concentration of Stu2 increased the microtubule growth rate at the plus end by 2.4-fold from 0.448 ± 0.010 µm/min (mean ± S.E., n = 91) in control experiments with tubulin to only 1.071 ± 0.034 µm/min (mean ± S.E., n = 121) with 500 nm Stu2 (Fig. 1C, left panel). Approximately 200 nm Stu2 was required to reach 50% of this increase in growth rate. A similar acceleration of growth was observed at the minus end: Stu2 increased the growth rate from 0.131 ± 0.007 µm/min (mean ± S.E., n = 22) with tubulin alone to 0.342 ± 0.011 µm/min with 500 nm Stu2 (mean ± S.E., n = 79). Thus, Stu2 is a microtubule polymerase, like its Xenopus relative XMAP215 and its Aspergillus relative Tea1, although the acceleration of growth by Stu2 is only ∼2-fold less than the 8-fold increase observed for the other proteins. Stu2 had a small effect on catastrophe (Fig. 1C, right panel). In the absence of Stu2, the catastrophe rate at the plus end was 0.119 ± 0.013 min−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 79). This rate increased slightly but significantly at intermediate Stu2 concentrations (0.162 ± 0.022 min−1 at 100 nm and 0.168 ± 0.022 min−1 at 200 nm) but then decreased to control levels at 500 nm. At the minus end, Stu2 slightly inhibited catastrophe. The effect of Stu2 was similar to that of XMAP215 and Tea 1, which increased catastrophe at the plus end by 2.6- and 2.7-fold, respectively, at 200 nm (8.Takeshita N. Mania D. Herrero S. Ishitsuka Y. Nienhaus G.U. Podolski M. Howard J. Fischer R. The cell-end marker TeaA and the microtubule polymerase AlpA contribute to microtubule guidance at the hyphal tip cortex of Aspergillus nidulans to provide polarity maintenance.J.

Synergy between XMAP215 and EB1 increases microtubule growth rates to physiological levels.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Based on these effects on the growth rate and catastrophe frequency (and assuming the model of Ref. 23.Verde F. Dogterom M. Stelzer E. Karsenti E. Leibler S. Control of microtubule dynamics and length by cyclin A- and cyclin B-dependent kinases in Xenopus egg extracts.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), Stu2 is expected to increase the mean length at which microtubules catastrophe at the plus end from 3.8 µm (0 Stu2) to 8.9 µm (500 nm Stu2), similar to the measured values of 3.5 ± 0.4 µm (0 Stu2, mean ± S.E., n = 79) to 8.2 ± 0.9 µm (500 nm Stu2, mean ± S.E., n = 78). We used a GFP-tagged construct to directly observe Stu2 interactions with microtubules. Stu2-GFP has a weak polymerase activity with porcine brain tubulin. The addition of 100 nm Stu2-GFP caused a modest increase in microtubule growth rate in 10 µm tubulin from 0.386 ± 0.050 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 9) to 0.485 ± 0.081 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 20). This rate increase was similar to that induced by the same concentration of unlabeled Stu2 (Fig. 1C). During dynamic assays in the presence of unlabeled tubulin, Stu2-GFP bound to the plus end of growing microtubules with higher affinity than the seed or the extension (Fig. 2A). At low concentrations of Stu2 (≪1 nm), single molecules of Stu2-GFP were observed to bind to and diffuse on the microtubule surface; other Stu2 molecules were observed to bind stably near both microtubule ends (Fig. 2B). At lower salt concentrations, Stu2-GFP bound much more strongly to the microtubule lattice (Fig. 2C). In BRB80 without extra KCl, GMP-CPP-stabilized microtubules were decorated with Stu2-GFP along their whole length; furthermore, under these conditions, Stu2-GFP accelerated the depolymerization of these stable microtubules by 10-fold from the spontaneous rate of 0.0046 ± 0.0023 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 18) to 0.058 ± 0.014 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 35; p < 0.0001 by a t test). At 7 µm porcine brain tubulin, no rescues were observed; in the presence of 500 nm Stu2, the rescue rate increased to 0.54 ± 0.09 min−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 36 rescues). However, rescues were still relatively infrequent. At 500 nm Stu2, only 46% of the shrinking plus ends rescued; this is expected to increase the microtubule length at catastrophe by a factor of <2. After characterizing the interaction of Stu2 with porcine brain tubulin, we studied its interaction with the conspecific budding yeast tubulin purified from strain BJ2168 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because the yield was low (18.Widlund P.O. Podolski M. Reber S. Alper J. Storch M. Hyman A.A. Howard J. Drechsel D.N. One-step purification of assembly-competent tubulin from diverse eukaryotic sources.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we had insufficient protein for fluorescent labeling. We therefore used DIC microscopy to visualize the microtubules extending from GMP-CPP-stabilized porcine tubulin seeds. We made two other changes in the assays conditions. First, we performed the experiments at 28 °C, which is more appropriate for physiological conditions of budding yeast proteins. Second, we used a lower concentration of yeast tubulin than brain tubulin because yeast tubulin polymerizes at lower concentrations than mammalian tubulin, as reported previously (25.Davis A. Sage C.R. Wilson L. Farrell K.W. Purification and biochemical characterization of tubulin from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8823-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26.Barnes G. Louie K.A. Botstein D. Yeast proteins associated with microtubules in vitro and in vivo.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 29-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Stu2 increased the elongation rate of microtubules grown in 5 µm yeast tubulin by 5-fold from 0.26 ± 0.04 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 36) to 1.26 ± 0.14 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 37) in the presence of 125 nm Stu2 (Fig. 3, A and C). The Michaelis-Menten fit to these data gave a Km of 22.7 ± 5.5 nm (mean ± S.E.) and a Vmax of 1.51 ± 0.10 µm/min (mean ± S.E.). Thus, Stu2 accelerated growth in yeast tubulin to a greater degree than in porcine brain tubulin. Furthermore, this acceleration of growth occurred at much lower Stu2 concentrations, 23 nm for half-maximal acceleration for yeast tubulin compared with ∼200 nm for mammalian tubulin. For example, 5 nm Stu2 was sufficient to double the growth rate of yeast microtubules, whereas nearly 500 nm Stu2 was needed to double the growth rate of porcine microtubules (Fig. 1). There was also a difference between yeast and mammalian tubulins at tubulin concentrations that gave the same basal growth rates. At 9 µm porcine tubulin, 125 nm Stu2 increased the growth rate by only 20% from 0.27 ± 0.08 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 29) to 0.32 ± 0.09 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 13) (Fig. 3, B and C). By comparison, 125 nm Stu2 increased the growth rate of yeast tubulin by 470% to 1.23 ± 0.15 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 37). In addition to increasing growth rate, Stu2 also decreased the catastrophe frequency of yeast microtubules (Fig. 3D). In the absence of Stu2, the catastrophe frequency was 0.272 ± 0.018 min−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 240 catastrophes), and this rate decreased to 0.116 ± 0.033 min−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 12 catastrophes) in the presence of 125 nm Stu2. Based on these effects on the growth rate and catastrophe frequency (and again assuming the model of Ref. 23.Verde F. Dogterom M. Stelzer E. Karsenti E. Leibler S. Control of microtubule dynamics and length by cyclin A- and cyclin B-dependent kinases in Xenopus egg extracts.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), Stu2 is expected to increase the mean length at which yeast microtubules undergo catastrophe at the plus end from 0.96 µm (0 Stu2) to 10.8 µm (125 nm Stu2), similar to the measured values of 1.3 ± 0.2 µm (0 Stu2, mean ± S.E., n = 28) and 11.5 ± 3.3 µm (125 nm Stu2, mean ± S.E., n = 12). Thus, Stu2 promotes the growth of yeast microtubules, increasing mean length by 10-fold through its combination of polymerase and anti-catastrophe activities. No rescues were observed. Having found that Stu2 is a strong polymerase of its conspecific tubulin, we asked whether XMAP215 is also a stronger polymerase of vertebrate tubulin over yeast tubulin. To the contrary, we found that XMAP215 is also a strong polymerase of yeast tubulin. When we introduced increasing amounts of XMAP215 and 5 µm budding yeast tubulin to GMP-CPP-stabilized seeds and visualized the formation of dynamic microtubules using DIC microscopy at 28 °C (Fig. 4, A and B), we observed a large increase in yeast microtubule growth rates. Namely, the growth rate increased by 13-fold from 0.26 ± 0.07 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 198) observed with yeast tubulin alone to 3.45 ± 0.87 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 45) in the presence of 125 nm XMAP215. Consistent with previous reports (22.Zanic M. Widlund P.O. Hyman A.A. Howard J. Synergy between XMAP215 and EB1 increases microtubule growth rates to physiological levels.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24.Brouhard G.J. Stear J.H. Noetzel T.L. Al-Bassam J. Kinoshita K. Harrison S.C. Howard J. Hyman A.A. XMAP215 is a processive microtubule polymerase.Cell. 2008; 132: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), XMAP215 caused an 9-fold increase in porcine microtubule growth rates, increasing the growth rate from 0.32 ± 0.08 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 106) in the absence of XMAP215 to 2.87 ± 1.25 µm/min (mean ± S.D., n = 18) in the presence of 125 nm XMAP215. These results show that XMAP215 increases the polymerization rates of both yeast and porcine tubulins to similar extents. However, the Michaelis-Menten fits to these curves reveal different Km values, indicating that XMAP215 is more active on porcine tubulin than on yeast tubulin (Km for porcine brain tubulin = 2.13 ± 0.56 nm, which is considerably lower than that for yeast tubulin, Km = 17.35 ± 3.22 nm). XMAP215 doubled the catastrophe frequency of porcine microtubules from 0.192 ± 0.033 min−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 33) in the control experiment to 0.377 ± 0.047 min−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 66) in the presence of 125 nm XMAP215 (Fig. 4C). In contrast, when yeast tubulin was used, the addition of 125 nm XMAP215 halved the catastrophe frequency from 0.375 ± 0.050 min−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 56) to 0.165 ± 0.029 min−1 (mean ± S.E., n = 32). No rescues were observed with or without XMAP215. We found that Stu2 stimulates the growth of microtubules polymerizing in the presence of budding yeast tubulin. The maximum stimulation of 5-fold is similar to that of the evolutionarily related proteins XMAP215 and Tea1. Thus, Stu2 is a microtubule polymerase, like the other members of the XMAP215/Dis1 family. The polymerase activity of purified Stu2 occurs at concentrations similar to those found in cells (80 nm) (27.Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.-K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar) and accounts for some of the observed phenotypes during mitosis. For example, anaphase microtubule elongation is impaired in both Stu2-depleted and Stu2-ΔTOG1 mutant cells (9.Severin F. Habermann B. Huffaker T. Hyman T. Stu2 promotes mitotic spindle elongation in anaphase.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10.Kosco K.A. Pearson C.G. Maddox P.S. Wang P.J. Adams I.R.

The effects of Stu2 depletion on the dynamics of cytoplasmic microtubules (10.Kosco K.A. Pearson C.G. Maddox P.S. Wang P.J. Adams I.R. Salmon E.D. Bloom K. Huffaker T.C. Control of microtubule dynamics by Stu2p is essential for spindle orientation and metaphase chromosome alignment in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2870-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) are not easily reconciled with our in vitro results, suggesting that interactions of Stu2 with other MAPs may be involved. We could not confirm earlier results showing that Stu2 inhibits, rather than promotes, elongation of mammalian brain microtubules (12.van Breugel M. Drechsel D. Hyman A. Stu2p, the budding yeast member of the conserved Dis1/XMAP215 family of microtubule-associated proteins is a plus end-binding microtubule destabilizer.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although Stu2 is a weak polymerase in the presence of porcine brain tubulin and requires high Stu2 concentrations, it nevertheless promoted microtubule growth under all conditions that we tested. A key finding was that Stu2 has higher polymerase activity on budding yeast tubulin than on porcine brain tubulin. Although the α- and β-tubulins are highly evolutionarily conserved families of proteins, there are considerable differences between budding yeast and mammalian tubulins at both the gene and protein levels that might lead to this difference in Stu2 activity. Budding yeast has two α-tubulin genes and one β-tubulin gene (28.Neff N.F. Thomas J.H. Grisafi P. Botstein D.

Cell Biol. 1986; 6: 3711-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas vertebrates have six α-tubulin genes and seven β-tubulin genes (30.Ludueña R.F. Multiple forms of tubulin: different gene products and covalent modifications.Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within α- and β-tubulins, the sequence identity between yeast and mammalian proteins is only 70–75%, with large differences at their C termini. Post-translational modifications of vertebrate tubulins lead to additional tubulin complexity at the protein level (31.Janke C. Bulinski J.C. Post-translational regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton: mechanisms and functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). These post-translational modifications occur mostly on the C termini of α- and β-tubulins, sites that are recognized by many regulators of microtubule dynamics (31.Janke C. Bulinski J.C. Post-translational regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton: mechanisms and functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 32.Sirajuddin M. Rice L.M. Vale R.D. Regulation of microtubule motors by tubulin isotypes and post-translational modifications.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), including XMAP215 (24.Brouhard G.J. Stear J.H. Noetzel T.L. Al-Bassam J. Kinoshita K. Harrison S.C. Howard J. Hyman A.A. XMAP215 is a processive microtubule polymerase.Cell. 2008; 132: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the case of bovine brain tubulin, these different gene products and post-translational modifications give rise to up to 21 different tubulin species that are distinguishable on an isoelectric focusing gel (33.Williams Jr., R.C. Shah C. Sackett D. Separation of tubulin isoforms by isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH gradient gels.Anal. Biochem. 1999; 275: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34.Field D.J.

U.S.A. 1984; 81: 4041-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) Thus, there are many potential molecular mechanisms that could give rise to the differences in activity of Stu2 on the different sources of tubulin. XMAP215 also differentiated between tubulins: although the maximum enhancement of growth was in the same range for yeast and porcine tubulins, less XMAP215 was needed to give a half-maximal promotion on porcine tubulin compared with yeast tubulin. This provides additional evidence for differences between yeast and brain tubulins. The lower concentration of XMAP215 required to accelerate growth may reflect a higher affinity of XMAP215 for the end of porcine microtubules; once at the end, however, the growth acceleration is similar. Interestingly, under the conditions that we tested, XMAP215 was a stronger polymerase than Stu2 on both tubulins, enhancing the growth rates of yeast and porcine tubulins by 13- and 9-fold, respectively, compared with enhancements of 5- and 2-fold by Stu2. Stu2 decreased the catastrophe frequency of yeast microtubules but had little effect on the catastrophe frequency of porcine microtubules. Interestingly, XMAP215 also decreased catastrophe in yeast tubulin but increased catastrophe in porcine tubulin. This is another difference in regulation by MAPs between yeast and porcine tubulins. It is possible that these effects reflect the inherent differences in polymerization dynamics of these two tubulin types. Stu2 shares many properties with XMAP215. Both accelerate microtubule growth and inhibit catastrophe, both preferentially bind microtubule ends over lattice, both diffuse on the lattice, and both accelerate depolymerization of stable microtubules when there is no free tubulin in solution. There are, however, some differences. As reported above, Stu2 can bind to the minus end, where it accelerates microtubule growth, which is not observed for XMAP215 (24.Brouhard G.J. Stear J.H. Noetzel T.L. Al-Bassam J. Kinoshita K. Harrison S.C. Howard J. Hyman A.A. XMAP215 is a processive microtubule polymerase.Cell. 2008; 132: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Another possible difference between Stu2 and XMAP215 is that the former increased the rate of transition from shrinking to growing (rescue). By contrast, rescues have not been reported for XMAP215 (and we also saw no rescues under our experimental conditions). In summary, our results demonstrate that differences between yeast and mammalian tubulins can give rise to differential activities of interacting proteins, such as previously reported for kinesin (35.Alonso M.C.

https://openalex.org/W2074897052,"Polo family kinase 4 (Plk4) is required for mitotic progression, and is haploinsufficient for tumor suppression and timely hepatocyte polarization in regenerating liver. At the same time, recent evidence suggests that Plk4 expression may have a role in clinical cancer progression, although the mechanisms are not clear. Here we identify a gene expression pattern predictive of reduced motility in Plk4(+/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and validate this prediction with functional assays of cell spreading, migration and invasion. Increased Plk4 expression enhances cell spreading in Plk4(+/-) MEFs and migration in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, and increases invasion by DLD-1 colon cancer cells. Plk4 depletion impairs invasion of wild-type MEFs and suppresses invasion by MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Cytoskeletal reorganization and development of polarity are impaired in Plk4-deficient cells that have been stimulated to migrate. Endogenous Plk4 phosphorylated at the autophosphorylation site S305 localizes to the protrusions of motile cells, coincident with the RhoA GEF Ect2, GTP-bound RhoA and the RhoA effector mDia. Taken together, our findings reveal an unexpected activity of Plk4 that promotes cell migration and may underlie an association between increased Plk4 expression, cancer progression and death from metastasis in solid tumor patients."
https://openalex.org/W1971590084,"Membrane overexpression of ErbB-2/HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase (membrane ErbB-2 (MErbB-2)) has a critical role in breast cancer (BC). We and others have also shown the role of nuclear ErbB-2 (NErbB-2) in BC, whose presence we identified as a poor prognostic factor in MErbB-2-positive tumors. Current anti-ErbB-2 therapies, as with the antibody trastuzumab (Ttzm), target only MErbB-2. Here, we found that blockade of NErbB-2 action abrogates growth of BC cells, sensitive and resistant to Ttzm, in a scenario in which ErbB-2, ErbB-3 and Akt are phosphorylated, and ErbB-2/ErbB-3 dimers are formed. Also, inhibition of NErbB-2 presence suppresses growth of a preclinical BC model resistant to Ttzm. We showed that at the cyclin D1 promoter, ErbB-2 assembles a transcriptional complex with Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and ErbB-3, another member of the ErbB family, which reveals the first nuclear function of ErbB-2/ErbB-3 dimer. We identified NErbB-2 as the major proliferation driver in Ttzm-resistant BC, and demonstrated that Ttzm inability to disrupt the Stat3/ErbB-2/ErbB-3 complex underlies its failure to inhibit growth. Furthermore, our results in the clinic revealed that nuclear interaction between ErbB-2 and Stat3 correlates with poor overall survival in primary breast tumors. Our findings challenge the paradigm of anti-ErbB-2 drug design and highlight NErbB-2 as a novel target to overcome Ttzm resistance."

This paper studies the fertility desires and their rationales, of slum-dwelling Kenyan men and women living with HIV/AIDS who know their serostatus, but have different antiretroviral therapy treatment statuses. It addresses two research questions: How do people living with HIV/AIDS consider their future fertility? What factors contribute to an explanation of fertility desires among people living with HIV/AIDS. Methods A mixed methods study (survey [n = 513] and in-depth interviews [n = 41]) with adults living with HIV/AIDS living in Nairobi slums was conducted in 2010. Regression analyses assess independent relationships between fertility desires and socio-demographic factors. Analyses of in-depth interviews are used to interpret the statistical analyses of fertility desires. Results Our analyses show that fertility desires are complex and ambivalent, reflecting tensions between familial and societal pressures to have children versus pressures for HIV (re-)infection prevention. More than a third (34%) of men and women living with HIV expressed future fertility desires; however, this is significantly lower than in the general population. Factors independently associated with desiring a child among people living with HIV/AIDS were age, sex, number of surviving children, social support and household wealth of the respondent. Discussion Increasing access to ART is changing the context of future childbearing for people living with HIV/AIDS. Prevailing values mean that, for many people living with HIV/AIDS, having children is seen as necessary for a “normal” and healthy adult life. However, the social rewards of childbearing conflict with moral imperatives of HIV prevention, presenting dilemmas about the “proper” reproductive behaviour of people living with HIV/AIDS. The health policy and service delivery implications of these findings are explored."

https://openalex.org/W2087331306,"Autophagy is a catabolic process that has been implicated both as a tumor suppressor and in tumor progression. Here, we investigate this dichotomy in cancer biology by studying the influence of altered autophagy in Drosophila models of tissue overgrowth. We find that the impact of altered autophagy depends on both genotype and cell type. As previously observed in mammals, decreased autophagy suppresses Ras-induced eye epithelial overgrowth. In contrast, autophagy restricts epithelial overgrowth in a Notch-dependent eye model. Even though decreased autophagy did not influence Hippo pathway-triggered overgrowth, activation of autophagy strongly suppresses this eye epithelial overgrowth. Surprisingly, activation of autophagy enhanced Hippo pathway-driven overgrowth in glia cells. These results indicate that autophagy has different influences on tissue growth in distinct contexts, and highlight the importance of understanding the influence of autophagy on growth to augment a rationale therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2137654068,"Aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is linked to tumor progression, metastasis and poor survival rates. Here we report the role of Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4) in the regulation of NSCLC cell invasiveness and tumor metastasis. CIP4 was highly expressed in a panel of NSCLC cell lines and normal lung epithelial cell lines. Stable knockdown (KD) of CIP4 in lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells, expressing wild-type EGFR, led to increased EGFR levels on the cell surface and defects in sustained activation of Erk kinase in H1299 cells treated with EGF. CIP4 localized to leading edge projections in NSCLC cells, and CIP4 KD cells displayed defects in EGF-induced cell motility and invasion through extracellular matrix. This correlated with reduced expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in CIP4 KD cells compared with control. In xenograft assays, CIP4 silencing had no effect on tumor growth but resulted in significant defects in spontaneous metastases to the lungs from these subcutaneous tumors. This correlated with reduced expression of the Erk target gene Zeb1 and the Zeb1 target gene MMP-2 in CIP4 KD tumors compared with control. CIP4 also enhanced rates of metastasis to the liver and lungs in an intrasplenic experimental metastasis model. In human NSCLC tumor sections, CIP4 expression was elevated greater than or equal to twofold in 43% of adenocarcinomas and 32% of squamous carcinomas compared with adjacent normal lung tissues. Analysis of microarray data for NSCLC patients also revealed that high CIP4 transcript levels correlated with reduced overall survival. Together, these results identify CIP4 as a positive regulator of NSCLC metastasis and a potential poor prognostic biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma."

To date, there is no cure for cirrhosis-associated intestinal mucosal lesion and ulcer. This study aimed to investigate the effect of oxymatrine on intestinal epithelial barrier function and the underlying mechanism in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced cirrhotic rats. Thirty CCl4-induced cirrhotic rats were randomly divided into treatment group, which received oxymatrine treatment (63 mg/kg), and non-treatment group, which received the same dose of 5% glucose solution (vehicle). The blank group (n = 10 healthy rats) received no treatment. Terminal ileal samples were collected for histopathological examination. The expression level of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 in ileal tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The gene and protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in ileal tissues were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Additionally, plasma endotoxin level was determined. In comparison to the blank group, a significant alteration in the morphology of intestinal mucosal villi in the non-treatment group was observed. The intestinal mucosal villi were atrophic, shorter, and fractured, and inflammatory cells were infiltrated into the lamina propria and muscular layer. Besides, serious swell of villi and loose structure of mucous membrane were observed. Oxymatrine reversed the CCl4-induced histological changes and restored intestinal barrier integrity. Moreover, oxymatrine reduced the protein expression level of NF-κB p65, TNF-α, and IL-6, which were elevated in the vehicle-treated group. In addition, the serum endotoxin level was significantly decreased after oxymatrine treatment in CCl4-induced cirrhotic rats. The results indicate that oxymatrine improves intestinal barrier function via NF-κB-mediated signaling pathway and may be used as a new protecting agent for cirrhosis-associated intestinal mucosal damage."

In contrast to conclusions reported previously, the second product of the HspB reaction was shown to be succinate, with isotope labeling experiments providing direct evidence that the newly introduced oxygen atom of succinate is derived from H2O.

Ubiquitination of human TPP1 also had no detectable effects on known protein interactions of TPP1 with TIN2, POT1, the CTC1-STN1-TEN1 complex, and telomerase. However, the close proximity of USP7 and telomerase binding sites on TPP1 suggest possible cross-talks. In addition, we found that TPP1 is degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. Prevention of TPP1 ubiquitination prolonged TPP1 half-life ∼ 2-fold from 45 to 90 min, and remarkably, proteasome inhibition prompted complete stability of TPP1. This indicates that the proteasome destabilizes TPP1 through both direct and indirect pathways possibly involving TPP1-interacting proteins. Altogether, our work identifies novel regulatory circuits that contribute to TPP1 stability and function."

https://openalex.org/W2167482206,"Low birth weight and rapid postnatal growth increases risk of cardiovascular-disease (CVD); however, underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that rats exposed to a low-protein diet in utero that underwent postnatal catch-up growth (recuperated) have a programmed deficit in cardiac coenzyme Q (CoQ) that was associated with accelerated cardiac aging. It is unknown whether this deficit occurs in all tissues, including those that are clinically accessible. We investigated whether aortic and white blood cell (WBC) CoQ is programmed by suboptimal early nutrition and whether postweaning dietary supplementation with CoQ could prevent programmed accelerated aging. Recuperated male rats had reduced aortic CoQ [22 d (35±8.4%; P<0.05); 12 m (53±8.8%; P<0.05)], accelerated aortic telomere shortening (P<0.01), increased DNA damage (79±13% increase in nei-endonucleaseVIII-like-1), increased oxidative stress (458±67% increase in NAPDH-oxidase-4; P < 0.001), and decreased mitochondrial complex II-III activity (P<0.05). Postweaning dietary supplementation with CoQ prevented these detrimental programming effects. Recuperated WBCs also had reduced CoQ (74±5.8%; P<0.05). Notably, WBC CoQ levels correlated with aortic telomere-length (P<0.0001) suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker of vascular aging. We conclude that early intervention with CoQ in at-risk individuals may be a cost-effective and safe way of reducing the global burden of CVDs.–Tarry-Adkins, J. L., Fernandez-Twinn, D.

https://openalex.org/W1978269886,"Emerging evidence suggests that functional γ-aminobutyric acid B receptors (GABABRs) are expressed by astrocytes within the mammalian brain. GABABRs are heterodimeric G-protein-coupled receptors that are composed of R1/R2 subunits. To date, they have been characterized in neurons as the principal mediators of sustained inhibitory signaling; however their roles in astrocytic physiology have been ill defined. Here we reveal that the cytoplasmic tail of the GABABR2 subunit binds directly to the astrocytic protein glutamine synthetase (GS) and that this interaction determines the subcellular localization of GS. We further demonstrate that the binding of GS to GABABR2 increases the steady state expression levels of GS in heterologous cells and in mouse primary astrocyte culture. Mechanistically this increased stability of GS in the presence of GABABR2 occurs via reduced proteasomal degradation. Collectively, our results suggest a novel role for GABABRs as regulators of GS stability. Given the critical role that GS plays in the glutamine-glutamate cycle, astrocytic GABABRs may play a critical role in supporting both inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W1970335026,"Hepatic cells are major sites of dengue virus (DENV) replication and liver injury constitutes a characteristic of severe forms of dengue. The role of hepatic cells in dengue pathogenesis is not well established, but since hepatocytes are the major source of plasma proteins, changes in protein secretion by these cells during infection might contribute to disease progression. Previously, we showed that DENV infection alters the secretion pattern of hepatic HepG2 cells, with α-enolase appearing as one of the major proteins secreted in higher levels by infected cells. ELISA analysis demonstrated that DENV infection modulates α-enolase secretion in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but has no effect on its gene expression and on the intracellular content of the protein as assessed by PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. Two-dimensional western blots showed that both intracellular and secreted forms of α-enolase appear as five spots, revealing α-enolase isoforms with similar molecular weights but distinct isoeletric points. Remarkably, quantification of each spot content revealed that DENV infection shifts the isoform distribution pattern of secreted α-enolase towards the basic isoforms, whereas the intracellular protein remains unaltered, suggesting that post-translational modifications might be involved in α-enolase secretion by infected cells. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying α-enolase secretion by hepatic cells and its relationship with the role of liver in dengue pathogenesis. In addition, preliminary results obtained with plasma samples from DENV-infected patients suggest an association between plasma levels of α-enolase and disease severity. Since α-enolase binds plasminogen and modulates its activation, it is plausible to speculate the association of the increase in α-enolase secretion by infected hepatic cells with the haemostatic dysfunction observed in dengue patients including the promotion of fibrinolysis and vascular permeability alterations."
https://openalex.org/W2078043669,"A phase of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) precedes most forms of neurodegenerative dementia. Many definitions of MCI recommend the use of test norms to diagnose cognitive impairment. It is, however, unclear whether the use of norms actually improves the detection of individuals at risk of dementia. Therefore, the effects of age- and education-norms on the validity of test scores in predicting progression to dementia were investigated.Baseline cognitive test scores (Syndrome Short Test) of dementia-free participants aged ≥65 were used to predict progression to dementia within three years. Participants were comprehensively examined one, two, and three years after baseline. Test scores were calculated with correction for (1) age and education, (2) education only, (3) age only and (4) without correction. Predictive validity was estimated with Cox proportional hazard regressions. Areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated for the one-, two-, and three-year intervals.82 (15.3%) of initially 537 participants, developed dementia. Model coefficients, hazard ratios, and AUCs of all scores were significant (p<0.001). Predictive validity was the lowest with age-corrected scores (-2 log likelihood = 840.90, model fit χ2 (1) = 144.27, HR = 1.33, AUCs between 0.73 and 0.87) and the highest with education-corrected scores (-2 log likelihood = 815.80, model fit χ2 (1) = 171.16, HR = 1.34, AUCs between 0.85 and 0.88).The predictive validity of test scores is markedly reduced by age-correction. Therefore, definitions of MCI should not recommend the use of age-norms in order to improve the detection of individuals at risk of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2133522245,"Pathogenesis of primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) is unclear, but pathogenic relationship to keratinocyte apoptosis has been implicated. We have previously identified galectin-7, actin, and cytokeratins as the major constituents of PLCA. Determination of the amyloidogenetic potential of these proteins by thioflavin T (ThT) method demonstrated that galectin-7 molecule incubated at pH 2.0 was capable of binding to the dye, but failed to form amyloid fibrils. When a series of galectin-7 fragments containing β-strand peptides were prepared to compare their amyloidogenesis, Ser(31)-Gln(67) and Arg(120)-Phe(136) were aggregated to form amyloid fibrils at pH 2.0. The rates of aggregation of Ser(31)-Gln(67) and Arg(120)-Phe(136) were dose-dependent with maximal ThT levels after 3 and 48 h, respectively. Their synthetic analogs, Phe(33)-Lys(65) and Leu(121)-Arg(134), which are both putative tryptic peptides, showed comparable amyloidogenesis. The addition of sonicated fibrous form of Ser(31)-Gln(67) or Phe(33)-Lys(65) to monomeric Ser(31)-Gln(67) or Phe(33)-Lys(65) solution, respectively, resulted in an increased rate of aggregation and extension of amyloid fibrils. Amyloidogenic potentials of Ser(31)-Gln(67) and Phe(33)-Lys(65) were inhibited by actin and cytokeratin fragments, whereas those of Arg(120)-Phe(136) and Leu(121)-Arg(134) were enhanced in the presence of Gly(84)-Arg(113), a putative tryptic peptide of galectin-7. Degraded fragments of the galectin-7 molecule produced by limited trypsin digestion, formed amyloid fibrils after incubation at pH 2.0. These results suggest that the tryptic peptides of galectin-7 released at neutral pH, may lead to amyloid fibril formation of PLCA in the intracellular acidified conditions during keratinocyte apoptosis via regulation by the galectin-7 peptide as well as actin and cytokeratins."
https://openalex.org/W2064559242,"The molecular mechanism that maintains the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is not well understood but may be reflected in complex biological networks. However, there have been few studies on the effects of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation during the development of ESCs from the perspective of computational systems biology. In this study, we analyzed the topological properties of the “core” pluripotency transcription factors (TFs) OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG in protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs). Further, we identified synergistic interactions between these TFs and microRNAs (miRNAs) in PPINs during ESC development. Results show that there were significant differences in centrality characters between TF-targets and non-TF-targets in PPINs. We also found that there was consistent regulation of multiple “core” pluripotency TFs. Based on the analysis of shortest path length, we found that the module properties were not only within the targets regulated by common or multiple “core” pluripotency TFs but also between the groups of targets regulated by different TFs. Finally, we identified synergistic regulation of these TFs and miRNAs. In summary, the synergistic effects of “core” pluripotency TFs and miRNAs were analyzed using computational methods in both human and mouse PPINs."
