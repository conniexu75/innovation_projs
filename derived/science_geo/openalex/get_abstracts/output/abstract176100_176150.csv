https://openalex.org/W1982030391,"Plants can have positive effects on each other. For example, the accumulation of nutrients, provision of shade, amelioration of disturbance, or protection from herbivores by some species can enhance the performance of neighbouring species. Thus the notion that the distributions and abundances of plant species are independent of other species may be inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for understanding species coexistence and diversity. But there have been no large-scale experiments designed to examine the generality of positive interactions in plant communities and their importance relative to competition. Here we show that the biomass, growth and reproduction of alpine plant species are higher when other plants are nearby. In an experiment conducted in subalpine and alpine plant communities with 115 species in 11 different mountain ranges, we find that competition generally, but not exclusively, dominates interactions at lower elevations where conditions are less physically stressful. In contrast, at high elevations where abiotic stress is high the interactions among plants are predominantly positive. Furthermore, across all high and low sites positive interactions are more important at sites with low temperatures in the early summer, but competition prevails at warmer sites."
https://openalex.org/W2013222950,"A sensitive approach based on electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry has been employed to profile membrane lipid molecular species in Arabidopsis undergoing cold and freezing stresses. Freezing at a sublethal temperature induced a decline in many molecular species of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) but induced an increase in phosphatidic acid (PA) and lysophospholipids. To probe the metabolic steps generating these changes, lipids ofArabidopsis deficient in the most abundant phospholipase D, PLDα, were analyzed. The PC content dropped only half as much, and PA levels rose only half as high in the PLDα-deficient plants as in wild-type plants. In contrast, neither PE nor PG levels decreased significantly more in wild-type plants than in PLDα-deficient plants. These data suggest that PC, rather than PE and PG, is the majorin vivo substrate of PLDα. The action of PLDα during freezing is of special interest because Arabidopsis plants that are deficient in PLDα have improved tolerance to freezing. The greater loss of PC and increase in PA in wild-type plants as compared with PLDα-deficient plants may be responsible for destabilizing membrane bilayer structure, resulting in a greater propensity toward membrane fusion and cell death in wild-type plants.

Knowing how lipid molecular species change and how the changes are generated is important to the understanding of membrane and cell functions. Detailed study of membrane lipid changes, however, has been technically challenging because of the complexity of lipid molecular species and analytical procedures. Recently, an approach based on electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS)1 has been developed to comprehensively analyze lipid composition in animal and yeast cells (1Han X.

Expansion of this approach to plants, which harbor unique lipids, such as galactosylglycerolipids, should greatly facilitate the understanding of lipid functions in plant growth, development, and stress responses.Plant stress caused by freezing has been an area of intensive research for many years, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms of freezing injury and tolerance are not well understood (10Thomashow M.F. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 11Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

The best documented freezing injury occurs at the membrane level. One major form of freezing damage is due to the formation of lipid hexagonal II phase in regions where the plasma membrane and the chloroplast envelope are closely apposed (13Steponkus P.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 543-584Crossref Google Scholar, 14Steponkus P.L. Webb M.S. Somero G. Osmond B. Water and Life: Comparative Analysis of Water Relationships at the Organismic, Cellular and Molecular Level. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1992: 338-362Crossref Google Scholar). Changes in membrane lipid composition occur when plants are exposed to freezing temperatures (15Yoshida S. Sakai A. Plant Physiol. 1974; 53: 509-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid hydrolysis has been proposed to be mainly responsible for the change, but the role of lipid hydrolysis in freezing injury and tolerance is not clear.In plants, several lipolytic enzymatic activities have been described, including phospholipase D (PLD), phospholipase C, phospholipase A, nonspecific acyl hydrolase, and galactolipases. PLD, which hydrolyzes phospholipids to phosphatidic acid (PA) and free head groups, is particularly abundant. Arabidopsis has multiple PLD genes that are categorized as PLDα, β, γ, δ, and ζ. PLDs display different requirements for Ca2+, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, pH, and free fatty acids and also some difference in substrate selectivity (16Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Pappan K. Austin-Brown S. Chapman K.D. Wang X. Arch. Biochem.

Thus, individual PLDs in the cell may be activated differently, hydrolyze different lipid species, and have unique functions. PLDα, the most common plant PLD, has been abrogated genetically inArabidopsis by introducing a PLDα antisense gene (16Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Fan L. Zheng S. Wang X. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2183-2196PubMed Google Scholar). The combination of lipid profiling and specific genetic alterations promises to be a powerful approach to defining the in vivoactivity and cellular roles of specific hydrolytic enzymes.In this study, an automated ESI-MS/MS strategy is established to profile quantitatively the molecular species of plant lipids and to determine the lipid changes in Arabidopsis after cold acclimation and freezing at sublethal temperature. Comparative lipid profiling of wild-type and PLDα-deficient plants leads to definition of the in vivo substrate(s) and the contribution of the most abundant PLD isoform to the freezing-induced lipid changes. PLDα-abrogated Arabidopsis displays an enhanced tolerance to freezing. Understanding the in vivo action of PLDα in freezing allows us to suggest a mechanism for the improved freezing tolerance of PLDα-deficient plants.DISCUSSIONThis study shows that ESI-MS/MS allows rapid analysis of the composition of plant membrane lipids that include MGDG and DGDG, the unique and abundant glycolipids in photosynthetic membranes. In combination with analysis of the acyl distribution by fragment analysis, a very complete picture of the composition of membrane glycerolipids was obtained. The easy sample preparation and relatively short analysis time permit massive profiling of membrane lipid changes triggered by external or internal challenges.Because PLDα activity depends on pH, calcium concentration, and the presence of nonsubstrate lipids, questions have arisen about the identity of the in vivo substrates of PLDα. PLDα is active in vitro either at neutral pH with millimolar levels of Ca2+ or under acidic conditions with micromolar Ca2+ and the substrate in vesicles containing PE and polyphosphoinositides (29Pappan K. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Comparative lipid profiling of wild-type and PLDα-deficient Arabidopsis demonstrates that PC is the major in vivo substrate for PLDα during freezing-induced activation. This confirms in vitro data that showed that PC is hydrolyzed preferentially as compared with PE (17Pappan K. Austin-Brown S. Chapman K.D. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).PLD is a major family of lipolytic enzymes in plants, and five types of PLD activities have been described. The loss of PLDα reduced the freezing-induced increase of PA by more than 50% (5.0 nmol/mg dry weight) and reduced the freezing-induced loss of PC to a similar extent (5.6 nmol/mg dry weight), demonstrating that PLDα is a key enzyme catalyzing the decline of PC during freezing. These data show that application of ESI-MS/MS-based lipid profiling to a biological system in which there are defined alterations of genes affecting lipid metabolism is a particularly powerful approach to defining the metabolic processes that generate the lipid changes.The detailed ESI-MS/MS-based analysis also provides information as to whether any specific molecular lipid molecular species are preferentially metabolized and as to whether particular reactions occur. We found a slight tendency in both wild-type and PLDα-deficient plants to leave 34:2 PC and PE species unhydrolyzed. It is unclear whether this represents a preference of a hydrolytic enzyme(s) for more unsaturated species or whether these species are somewhat inaccessible to hydrolytic enzymes, perhaps because of an asymmetric distribution of acyl species across the lipid bilayers of the plant cell membranes. The appearance in the frozen plants of 34:6 PA, which contains acyl species that are found otherwise only in galactolipids, particularly in MGDG, suggests that some PA is formed by phosphorylation of diacylglycerol produced by hydrolysis of MGDG.The difference in membrane lipid compositions in response to freezing of wild-type and PLDα-deficient Arabidopsis and the change in freezing tolerance caused by this alteration indicate that cellular membranes are important in stress responses. Indeed, the best documented freezing injury occurs at the membrane level (10Thomashow M.F. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 13Steponkus P.L. Annu. Rev.

A. 1998; 95: 14570-14575Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Workers in the Steponkus laboratory have demonstrated three types of freezing injury. In expansion-induced lysis, which typically occurs at −2 to −4 °C, water leaves the cells, resulting in dehydration and high osmolality inside the cells. When thawing occurs, water quickly enters the cell, resulting in lysis. At about −4 to −10 °C, many plants undergo damage caused by freeze-induced lamellar-to-hexagonal II phase transitions between the plasma membrane and the chloroplast envelope membranes; this damage is brought on by dehydration of the membrane lipids. Below −10 °C, the damage is typically due to other mechanisms, including fracture jump lesions in membranes. In Arabidopsis, the incidence of expansion-induced lysis has been shown to be very low, and injury in nonacclimated Arabidopsis is primarily associated with formation of the hexagonal II phase (33Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).Typically, under field conditions, plants acclimate to the cold at low temperatures above freezing before they are subjected to freezing temperatures. As demonstrated in this work and by others, in cold acclimation, the amount of unsaturated fatty acyl groups in membrane lipids is increased (33Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 34Lynch D.V. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Uemura M. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 479-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and the amount of most membrane glycerolipids typically is increased (36Yoshida S. Contributions from the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Series B. Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan1974: 1Google Scholar, 37Novitskaya G.V. Mashchanova D.D. Appl. Biochem. Microbiol. 1983; 18: 471-476Google Scholar, 38Alberdi M. Fernandez J. Cristi R. Romero M. Ross D. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 2467-2471Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Such lipid changes reduce, and in some cases may eliminate, the propensity of cellular membranes to undergo freezing-induced nonbilayer phase formation (33Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar,39Fujiokawa S. Steponkus P.L. Cryobiology. 1990; 27: 665-666Google Scholar). Sugawara and Steponkus (40Sugawara Y. Steponkus P.L. Cryobiology. 1992; 27: 667Google Scholar) also demonstrated the importance of lipid composition to freezing tolerance by showing that the addition of di18:2-PC to the plasma membranes of nonacclimated rye protoplasts by fusion with liposomes resulted in a reduced propensity of the plasma membrane to participate in freeze-induced formation of the hexagonal phase. These data indicate that membrane lipid composition can have a profound impact on the tendency of a membrane lipid bilayer to undergo a transition to the nonbilayer hexagonal II phase.Our data demonstrate that the increase in lipolytic activities during freezing alters membrane lipid composition. Although early studies suggested that PLD activity could be involved in freezing-induced lipid hydrolysis (15Yoshida S. Sakai A. Plant Physiol. 1974; 53: 509-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of PLD in freezing injury and tolerance is unknown. The present results show that PLDα causes PC hydrolysis, and that upon freezing of wild-type plants, PC is hydrolyzed to a greater extent than PE or PG. The molar ratio of PC/PE in wild-type plants tends to drop (from 1.68 ± 0.05 to 1.48 ± 0.19) after freezing, whereas the amount of PA is increased 6-fold. Because unsaturated PEs have a strong propensity to form hexagonal phases (41Cullis P.R. DeKruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 399-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar) and PA has tendency to form hexagonal II phase in the presence of Ca2+ (42Verleij A.J. DeMaagd R. Leunissen-Bijvelt J. DeKruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 684: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), these compositional alterations are likely to lead to the formation of a nonbilayer lipid phase. Localized transformation of a membrane lipid bilayer into a nonbilayer structure compromises membrane integrity and cell function. In contrast, in PLDα-deficient plants, PC, a bilayer-stabilizing lipid, is hydrolyzed to a much lesser extent than in wild-type plants, and the PC/PE ratio increases from 1.66 ± 0.09 to 2.11 ± 0.23 during freezing, whereas PA levels increase to about half the level of frozen wild-type plants. Combined, the alterations that occur in PLDα-deficient plants are less likely to induce nonbilayer phase formation than those that occur in wild-type plants. Indeed, measurements of membrane competency show that more ion leakage occurred in leaves of wild-type plants than in the leaves of PLDα-deficient plants. We propose that the reduced levels of PC and increased levels of PA in wild-typeArabidopsis membranes promote nonbilayer phase formation that leads to cell death. These results suggest that PLDα and PC hydrolysis play key roles in freezing injury and point to a new avenue for improving freezing tolerance.

At about −4 to −10 °C, many plants undergo damage caused by freeze-induced lamellar-to-hexagonal II phase transitions between the plasma membrane and the chloroplast envelope membranes; this damage is brought on by dehydration of the membrane lipids. Below −10 °C, the damage is typically due to other mechanisms, including fracture jump lesions in membranes. In Arabidopsis, the incidence of expansion-induced lysis has been shown to be very low, and injury in nonacclimated Arabidopsis is primarily associated with formation of the hexagonal II phase (33Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).Typically, under field conditions, plants acclimate to the cold at low temperatures above freezing before they are subjected to freezing temperatures. As demonstrated in this work and by others, in cold acclimation, the amount of unsaturated fatty acyl groups in membrane lipids is increased (33Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 34Lynch D.V. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 761-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Uemura M. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 479-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and the amount of most membrane glycerolipids typically is increased (36Yoshida S. Contributions from the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Series B. Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan1974: 1Google Scholar, 37Novitskaya G.V. Mashchanova D.D. Appl. Biochem.

Such lipid changes reduce, and in some cases may eliminate, the propensity of cellular membranes to undergo freezing-induced nonbilayer phase formation (33Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar,39Fujiokawa S. Steponkus P.L. Cryobiology. 1990; 27: 665-666Google Scholar). Sugawara and Steponkus (40Sugawara Y. Steponkus P.L. Cryobiology. 1992; 27: 667Google Scholar) also demonstrated the importance of lipid composition to freezing tolerance by showing that the addition of di18:2-PC to the plasma membranes of nonacclimated rye protoplasts by fusion with liposomes resulted in a reduced propensity of the plasma membrane to participate in freeze-induced formation of the hexagonal phase. These data indicate that membrane lipid composition can have a profound impact on the tendency of a membrane lipid bilayer to undergo a transition to the nonbilayer hexagonal II phase.Our data demonstrate that the increase in lipolytic activities during freezing alters membrane lipid composition. Although early studies suggested that PLD activity could be involved in freezing-induced lipid hydrolysis (15Yoshida S. Sakai A. Plant Physiol. 1974; 53: 509-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of PLD in freezing injury and tolerance is unknown. The present results show that PLDα causes PC hydrolysis, and that upon freezing of wild-type plants, PC is hydrolyzed to a greater extent than PE or PG. The molar ratio of PC/PE in wild-type plants tends to drop (from 1.68 ± 0.05 to 1.48 ± 0.19) after freezing, whereas the amount of PA is increased 6-fold. Because unsaturated PEs have a strong propensity to form hexagonal phases (41Cullis P.R. DeKruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 399-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar) and PA has tendency to form hexagonal II phase in the presence of Ca2+ (42Verleij A.J. DeMaagd R. Leunissen-Bijvelt J. DeKruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 684: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), these compositional alterations are likely to lead to the formation of a nonbilayer lipid phase. Localized transformation of a membrane lipid bilayer into a nonbilayer structure compromises membrane integrity and cell function. In contrast, in PLDα-deficient plants, PC, a bilayer-stabilizing lipid, is hydrolyzed to a much lesser extent than in wild-type plants, and the PC/PE ratio increases from 1.66 ± 0.09 to 2.11 ± 0.23 during freezing, whereas PA levels increase to about half the level of frozen wild-type plants. Combined, the alterations that occur in PLDα-deficient plants are less likely to induce nonbilayer phase formation than those that occur in wild-type plants. Indeed, measurements of membrane competency show that more ion leakage occurred in leaves of wild-type plants than in the leaves of PLDα-deficient plants. We propose that the reduced levels of PC and increased levels of PA in wild-typeArabidopsis membranes promote nonbilayer phase formation that leads to cell death. These results suggest that PLDα and PC hydrolysis play key roles in freezing injury and point to a new avenue for improving freezing tolerance. This study shows that ESI-MS/MS allows rapid analysis of the composition of plant membrane lipids that include MGDG and DGDG, the unique and abundant glycolipids in photosynthetic membranes. In combination with analysis of the acyl distribution by fragment analysis, a very complete picture of the composition of membrane glycerolipids was obtained. The easy sample preparation and relatively short analysis time permit massive profiling of membrane lipid changes triggered by external or internal challenges. Because PLDα activity depends on pH, calcium concentration, and the presence of nonsubstrate lipids, questions have arisen about the identity of the in vivo substrates of PLDα. PLDα is active in vitro either at neutral pH with millimolar levels of Ca2+ or under acidic conditions with micromolar Ca2+ and the substrate in vesicles containing PE and polyphosphoinositides (29Pappan K. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Comparative lipid profiling of wild-type and PLDα-deficient Arabidopsis demonstrates that PC is the major in vivo substrate for PLDα during freezing-induced activation. This confirms in vitro data that showed that PC is hydrolyzed preferentially as compared with PE (17Pappan K. Austin-Brown S. Chapman K.D. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). PLD is a major family of lipolytic enzymes in plants, and five types of PLD activities have been described. The loss of PLDα reduced the freezing-induced increase of PA by more than 50% (5.0 nmol/mg dry weight) and reduced the freezing-induced loss of PC to a similar extent (5.6 nmol/mg dry weight), demonstrating that PLDα is a key enzyme catalyzing the decline of PC during freezing. These data show that application of ESI-MS/MS-based lipid profiling to a biological system in which there are defined alterations of genes affecting lipid metabolism is a particularly powerful approach to defining the metabolic processes that generate the lipid changes. The detailed ESI-MS/MS-based analysis also provides information as to whether any specific molecular lipid molecular species are preferentially metabolized and as to whether particular reactions occur. We found a slight tendency in both wild-type and PLDα-deficient plants to leave 34:2 PC and PE species unhydrolyzed. It is unclear whether this represents a preference of a hydrolytic enzyme(s) for more unsaturated species or whether these species are somewhat inaccessible to hydrolytic enzymes, perhaps because of an asymmetric distribution of acyl species across the lipid bilayers of the plant cell membranes. The appearance in the frozen plants of 34:6 PA, which contains acyl species that are found otherwise only in galactolipids, particularly in MGDG, suggests that some PA is formed by phosphorylation of diacylglycerol produced by hydrolysis of MGDG. The difference in membrane lipid compositions in response to freezing of wild-type and PLDα-deficient Arabidopsis and the change in freezing tolerance caused by this alteration indicate that cellular membranes are important in stress responses. Indeed, the best documented freezing injury occurs at the membrane level (10Thomashow M.F. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 13Steponkus P.L. Annu. Rev.

In expansion-induced lysis, which typically occurs at −2 to −4 °C, water leaves the cells, resulting in dehydration and high osmolality inside the cells. When thawing occurs, water quickly enters the cell, resulting in lysis. At about −4 to −10 °C, many plants undergo damage caused by freeze-induced lamellar-to-hexagonal II phase transitions between the plasma membrane and the chloroplast envelope membranes; this damage is brought on by dehydration of the membrane lipids.

https://openalex.org/W2067117198,"The I kappa B kinase (IKK), consisting of the IKK1 and IKK2 catalytic subunits and the NEMO (also known as IKK gamma) regulatory subunit, phosphorylates I kappa B proteins, targeting them for degradation and thus inducing activation of NF-kappa B (reviewed in refs 1, 2). IKK2 and NEMO are necessary for NF-kappa B activation through pro-inflammatory signals. IKK1 seems to be dispensable for this function but controls epidermal differentiation independently of NF-kappa B. Previous studies suggested that NF-kappa B has a function in the growth regulation of epidermal keratinocytes. Mice lacking RelB or I kappa B alpha, as well as both mice and humans with heterozygous NEMO mutations, develop skin lesions. However, the function of NF-kappa B in the epidermis remains unclear. Here we used Cre/loxP-mediated gene targeting to investigate the function of IKK2 specifically in epidermal keratinocytes. IKK2 deficiency inhibits NF-kappa B activation, but does not lead to cell-autonomous hyperproliferation or impaired differentiation of keratinocytes. Mice with epidermis-specific deletion of IKK2 develop a severe inflammatory skin disease, which is caused by a tumour necrosis factor-mediated, alpha beta T-cell-independent inflammatory response that develops in the skin shortly after birth. Our results suggest that the critical function of IKK2-mediated NF-kappa B activity in epidermal keratinocytes is to regulate mechanisms that maintain the immune homeostasis of the skin."

One group consisted of four genes, three of which encoded active glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductases (DHARs). Two DHARs were predicted to be cytosolic, whereas the other contained a chloroplast targeting peptide. The DHARs were also active as thiol transferases but had no glutathione conjugating activity. Unlike most other GSTs, DHARs were monomeric. The other class of GST comprised two genes termed the Lambda GSTs (GSTLs). The recombinant GSTLs were also monomeric and had glutathione-dependent thiol transferase activity. One GSTL was cytosolic, whereas the other was chloroplast-targeted. When incubated with oxidized glutathione, the putative active site cysteine of the GSTLs and cytosolic DHARs formed mixed disulfides with glutathione, whereas the plastidic DHAR formed an intramolecular disulfide.

Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). In plants, all the GSTs described to date are dimers composed of 25-kDa subunits, and on the basis of sequence similarity and gene organization, they appear to have evolved from a common ancestral GST into four distinct classes, namely the Phi, Tau, Zeta, and Theta GSTs (2Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Walbot V. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The two largest classes are the plant-specific Phi and Tau GSTs. Both classes have major roles in herbicide detoxification (3Marrs K.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 127-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 4Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Cobb A.H. Kirkwood R.C. Herbicides and Their Mechanisms of Action. Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, UK2000: 38-71Google Scholar). In addition, these GSTs have less well characterized roles in endogenous metabolism including functioning as glutathione peroxidases counteracting oxidative stress (5Cummins I. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant J. 1999; 18: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 6Roxas V.P. Smith R.K. Allen E.R. Allen R.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) and also acting as flavonoid-binding proteins (7Mueller L.A. Goodman C.D. Silady R.A. Walbot V. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), stress signaling proteins (8Loyall L. Uchida K. Braun S. Furuya M. Frohnmeyer H. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1939-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and regulators of apoptosis (9Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29207-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In contrast, the smaller Zeta and Theta classes of GSTs are also found in animals and fungi, indicating conserved and essential functions for these enzymes in all eukaryotes. Thus, Zeta GSTs in Arabidopsis, animals, and fungi catalyze the glutathione-dependent isomerization of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate, an essential step in the catabolism of tyrosine (10Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas Theta class GSTs act as potent glutathione peroxidases detoxifying organic hydroperoxides formed during oxidative stress (2Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Walbot V. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Cumulatively, these studies point to a functional divergence in the GST superfamily in plants in which individual GSTs use GSH as either a co-substrate or co-enzyme in catalysis. Significantly, all four classes of plant GSTs identified to date contain a conserved serine residue within their active site which is central to stabilizing the charged thiolate form of GSH used to drive conjugation and peroxidase and isomerase reactions (11Labrou N.E. Mello L.V. Clonis Y.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this respect, although the reactions driven by these enzymes are diverse, their mechanism of catalysis remains essentially conserved (12Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). While searching the Arabidopsis data bases for other members of the extended GST family, we have identified genes encoding GST-like proteins, which contain the conserved GSH binding domain, but where the active site serine residue is replaced with cysteine. Because the cysteine residue cannot serve the same catalytic role as a serine residue at the active site, this suggests that these new members of the plant GST family may have evolved functions that employ an alternative reaction mechanism to that used by the four GST classes previously identified. To test this hypothesis we have cloned and expressed the members of these two additional types of the extended GST family inArabidopsis, and we assayed the enzyme activity of the recombinant proteins. In the course of these studies we have determined that the active site cysteine of these novel GSTs forms transient mixed disulfides with GSH, and we propose that this reaction is involved in their catalytic function, which relates to counteracting oxidative stress. We also report on the regulation of the respective genes following exposure of Arabidopsis plants to conditions invoking chemical and redox stress. For chemical induction studies, Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia) seedlings were grown for 19 days as root cultures in 60 ml of sterile media (13Reiter R.S. Young R.M. Scolnik P.A. Koncz C. Chua N.-H. Schell J. Methods in Arabidopsis Research. World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1992: 170-190Crossref Google Scholar). Chemical treatments were added to the media in 0.6 ml of sterile water containing 100 mm GSH (pH 7), 100 mm l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), 100 mmascorbate, or 100 mmt-butyl hydroperoxide (BHP). Xenobiotic treatments were added in 0.6 ml of ethanol containing 40 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), 20 mmfluorodifen, 10 mm dichlormid, 10 mmNAA, or 10 mm 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Control treatments consisted of 0.6 ml of solvent carrier only. After a 24-h treatment, the plants were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C pending analysis. The combined root and shoot tissue of 3-week-oldArabidopsis (Columbia) plants were used as the source RNA for cDNA synthesis (10Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). AtGST sequences were amplified from cDNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR using Taq DNA polymerase and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, with the combinations of specific primers detailed in Table I. ForAtDHAR4 and AtGSTL2, the 5′ primers were designed to allow expression of the mature polypeptides without their putative transit peptides. The purified products were ligated intoNcoI/BamHI-digested pET-11d (Novagen) for expression in Escherichia coli. The coding sequences of theAtDHARs were also subcloned into the expression vector pET24 by PCR using the respective DHARna and DHARn-his primers (Table I) to generate the C-His-tagged fusions (10Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of DHAR1-his was carried out by PCR using oligonucleotide primers containing the required mutations. To express the recombinant proteins, cultures of E. coli harboring the pET constructs were treated at mid-log phase with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and after 3 h harvested and lysed by ultrasonication. Lysates from the bacteria transformed with pET-11d were applied onto GSH affinity columns (14Dixon D.P. Cummins I. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), whereas His-tagged proteins from pET24 transformed E. coliwere recovered by nickel affinity chromatography (10Dixon D.P.

The recombinant GSTs were further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a 1 ml of UNO Q1 (Bio-Rad) column eluted with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, containing a linearly increasing concentration of NaCl (0–0.5m; total volume 25 ml) at 1 ml/min. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and gel permeation chromatography as described previously (10Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem.

To quantify the abundance of each mRNA, each cDNA template (1 μl) was used in a 20-μl PCR using Taq DNA polymerase in the presence of 45 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 11 mmammonium sulfate, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 7mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 μm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm of each dNTP. Actin1 primers (each 0.2 μm) were used together with primers (each 0.5 μm) for the GST gene to be amplified (Table I). For each set of primers, a PCR master mix was used to minimize differences between reactions for different templates, with each reaction run in duplicate. Following amplification (28–30 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s), products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantified using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc 2000 system with supplied Quantity One analysis software. Actin1 primers amplified a product of about 530 nucleotides, whereas the GST primer sets detailed (Table I) amplified a product of about 650 nucleotides, with the similar size of the amplification products selected to minimize differences between primer sets. Control reactions using a range of template concentrations confirmed that for each set of primers, the ratio of PCR products derived from actin and GST was independent of template concentration and that quantification was reliable. The identity of each PCR product was then confirmed by sequencing. GST activity toward CDNB, glutathione peroxidase activity toward cumene hydroperoxide (15Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the GSH-dependent dechlorination of dichloroacetic acid (10Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were determined as described previously. Thiol transferase activity toward 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HED) was measured in 0.1 mTris-Cl, pH 7.8, containing 0.25 mm NADPH, 1 mmGSH, 0.6 units/ml glutathione reductase, and 2 mm EDTA and was performed at 30 °C. After a 3-min equilibration with 0.7 mm HED, enzyme was added, and the resulting decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to NADPH oxidation (ε = 6.2 mm−1·cm−1) was recorded. DHAR assays were performed over 60 s at 30 °C and contained 90 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 5 mmGSH, and 0.5 mm DHA. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 265 nm due to the formation of ascorbate (ε = 14.0 mm−1·cm−1), after correcting for spontaneous DHA reduction (16Hossain M.A. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1984; 25: 85-92Google Scholar). In the case where ascorbate was added to the assays, DHAR activity was determined from the rate of GSH oxidation by adding 1.25 units/ml glutathione reductase and 0.2 mg/ml NADPH. The coupled oxidation of NADPH was then determined from the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm over 60 s. To determine the effect of S-glutathionylation and S-alkylation on enzyme activities, purified recombinant GSTs were incubated for 10 min on ice with or without 1 mm oxidized GSH (GSSG). The enzyme preparations were then treated with or without 10 mmiodoacetamide (10 min, 4 °C). Following desalting using a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove any GSSG and iodoacetamide, and protein preparations were assayed for enzyme activity. Samples (200 μl) of recombinant proteins (0.5 mg/ml) dissolved in 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, were treated at 4 °C for 30 min with either 2 mm DTT or 2 mm GSSG. To ensure that adducts formed were due to mixed disulfide formation, an additional GSSG-treated sample was then treated with 20 mm DTT at 4 °C for 30 min to release GSH. Proteins were desalted into 0.4 ml of 2 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, using a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), and an equal volume of acetonitrile/formic acid (100:1, v/v) was added. The protein sample was then injected directly into a Micromass LCT time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer, using electrospray ionization (ESI) at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Operating in positive ion mode, mass spectrometry (MS) data were collected in the mass range 500–2000 Da and analyzed using the supplied MassLynx software, with multiply charged peaks deconvoluted using the MaxEnt1 plugin after calibration with horse heart myoglobin. Trypsin digests were performed in 1 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50% v/v acetonitrile at 37 °C, using sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega), and analyzed by MS as described for the parent polypeptides. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on polypeptide sequences aligned with ClustalW (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) using PHYLIP (Phylogeny inference package, J. Felsenstein, Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle). PROTDIST was used to calculate evolutionary distance between sequences and NEIGHBOR (using the UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) method of clustering) to calculate the tree. The strategy adopted in the current study was to use proteins that have been ascribed recently to be outlying members of the GST superfamily in vertebrates and to look for sequences showing similarity in the Arabidopsis genome. In the first screen, the sequence of the recently reported human Omega class GST (hGSTO1) was used (18Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In a BLAST search, thehGSTO1 polypeptide sequence identified a sequence (GenBankTM accession number AB037970) in rice (Oryza sativa) encoding a protein with dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) activity (19Urano J. Nakagawa T. Maki Y. Masumura T. Tanaka K. Murata N. Ushimaru T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subsequent searches of theArabidopsis genome data base with the rice DHAR identified four related sequences, which on alignment showed between 60 and 70% identity with the rice gene. The Arabidopsis genes were named dhar1, dhar2, dhar3, and dhar4, encoding the putative proteins AtDHAR1, AtDHAR2, AtDHAR3, and AtDHAR4, respectively (Fig. 1). Thedhar1 and dhar2 sequences were well represented in the Arabidopsis EST data bases. In contrast, nodhar4 ESTs were identified, and only one dhar3EST was found. Significantly, although the dhar1, -2, and -3 genes possessed two introns in conserved positions, the dhar4 gene contained no predicted introns, suggesting it was a pseudogene. The sequences ofAtDHAR1, AtDHAR2, and AtDHAR4 encoded polypeptides of 213, 213, and 217 amino acid residues, respectively, with respective predicted molecular masses of 23.6, 23.4, and 23.9 kDa. Unlike the other AtDHARs, the deduced polypeptide sequence for AtDHAR3 contained an N-terminal polypeptide extension (Fig. 1). Analysis of this extension using TargetP (20Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3560) Google Scholar, 21Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar) suggested that it contained a 42-residue transit peptide, which would targetAtDHAR3 to the chloroplast or possibly to the mitochondrion. The BLAST search with hGSTO1 also identified the proteins In2-1 in maize (22Hershey H.P. Stoner T.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Cla30 in wheat (23Theodoulou F.L. Clark I.M. Pallett K.E. Hallahan D.L. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), which resemble GSTs but lack GSH conjugating activity toward xenobiotics (24McGonigle B. Keeler S.J. Lau S.-M.C. Koeppe M.K. O'Keefe D.P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1105-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). BLAST searches with In2-1 and Cla30 sequences as queries showed that they were more similar to mammalian Omega GSTs than to the other classes of plant GSTs. However, although In2-1 and Cla30 shared a similar active site motif (CPFA) with the Omega GSTs (18Board P.G. Coggan M. Chelvanayagam G. Easteal S. Jermiin L.S. Schulte G.K. Danley D.E. Hoth L.R. Griffor M.C. Kamath A.V. Rosner M.H. Chrunyk B.A. Perregaux D.E. Gabel C.A. Geoghegan K.F. Pandit J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24798-24806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), their overall sequences were sufficiently divergent to put these genes into a separate class that we have termed the Lambda (L) GSTs. Searching the Arabidopsis data base with theIn2-1 sequence identified two closely related Lambda GST genes, gstl1 and gstl2. The proteins corresponding to these predicted coding sequences were termedAtGSTL1 and AtGSTL2, respectively (Fig.2). The gstl1 gene was present on BAC F9G14 (GenBankTM accession number AL162973) and was also represented by an EST (GenBankTM accession numberAI995850). However, the annotated genomic clone was missing one intron when compared with the EST sequence. The corrected gene sequence contained 8 introns and a single open reading frame encoding a 27.2-kDa polypeptide composed of 237 amino acid residues (Fig. 2). The other gene, gstl2, was present on BAC T15C9 (GenBankTMaccession number AL132970). The gene had 8 putative introns that gave an mRNA with a single open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 292 residues (Fig. 2). Comparison of AtGSTL1 withAtGSTL2 showed the two polypeptide sequences to be very similar, but the AtGSTL2 contained a long N-terminal extension. Analysis (20Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3560) Google Scholar, 21Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar) showed that this extension was most likely a transit peptide, probably targeting AtGSTL2 to the chloroplast. Following processing, the resulting matureAtGSTL2 polypeptide was composed of 237 amino acid residues and had a predicted molecular mass of 27.0 kDa. The coding sequences of dhar1, -2, -3, and -4 were amplified by PCR using combinations of specific primers. All four genes were successfully amplified from cDNA prepared from total RNA isolated from wholeArabidopsis plants, although dhar4 gave a much less abundant product than that obtained with the other primer combinations, and may have been amplified from contaminating genomic DNA. The products were initially cloned into pET-11d to give the respective pET-DHARn constructs and then were sequenced. pET-DHAR1 and pET-DHAR3 had deduced polypeptide sequences identical to those predicted from the genomic sequences of dhar1 and dhar3, respectively. The deduced sequence of pET-DHAR2 contained 1 amino acid substitution compared with that anticipated from published genomic and EST sequences such as GenBankTMaccession number NM_106182. The pET-DHAR4 sequence contained four mis-sense substitutions compared with GenBankTM accession number NM_123018 (A to G at base 175, T to C at base 280, G to A at base 349, and A to G at base 560). The AtDHAR2 substitution was later shown to be a PCR-induced error. However, the four substitutions in AtDHAR4 most likely arose from minor differences in the gene sequences of different Arabidopsisecotypes. The AtDHAR1 nucleotide sequence was identical to the coding sequence of GenBankTM accession number AY039590, and the AtDHAR3 sequence was identical (except for a silent substitution of T for A at base 159) to bases 106–759 of GenBankTM accession number AF301597. The sequence substitutions were not corrected in the initial attempts to express the pET constructs in E. coli, and following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the crude bacterial lysates were analyzed for polypeptide composition by SDS-PAGE and for enzyme activity. As compared with extracts fromE. coli harboring the empty pET construct, bacteria expressing pET-AtDHAR1 and pET-AtDHAR3 accumulated appreciable amounts of recombinant polypeptides of 23 and 27 kDa, respectively. Expression of pET-AtDHAR2 and pET-AtDHAR4 resulted in the accumulation of large quantities of insoluble polypeptide, with a mass of around 24 kDa in each case. After correcting for the low levels of endogenous enzyme activity due to the GSTs in E. coli, no conjugating activity toward CDNB or glutathione peroxidase activity toward cumene hydroperoxide could be determined in any of the soluble fractions from the recombinantE. coli. Crude cell-free extracts from theAtDHAR1 and AtDHAR3 preparations showed considerable GSH-dependent DHAR activity (between 2 and 4 microkatals·mg−1 protein), whereas in extracts from bacteria harboring the pET vector alone, DHAR activity could not be determined above the chemical rate. In the bacteria expressingAtDHAR2, DHAR enzyme activity could just be determined in the soluble fraction (10 nanokatals·mg−1 of protein) demonstrating the presence of minor amounts of soluble active protein. However, no DHAR activity could be determined in the soluble fraction from the bacteria expressing AtDHAR4. In view of the difficulty in obtaining AtDHAR4 in soluble form and the uncertain status of dhar4 as an expressed gene, further characterization of this recombinant protein was not undertaken. Attempts to purify the recombinant DHAR polypeptides from crude bacterial lysates by GSH affinity chromatography proved unsuccessful, so the AtDHAR1, AtDHAR2, and AtDHAR3 sequences were sub-cloned into the C-terminal His tag expression vector pET-24 to give pET24-DHAR1, pET24-DHAR2, and pET24-DHAR3, respectively. For pET24-DHAR2, the AtDHAR2 sequence was re-isolated by PCR, and its fidelity with the coding sequence of GenBankTMaccession number NM_106182 confirmed. Expression of pET24-DHAR1, pET24-DHAR2, and pET24-DHAR3 resulted in the production of the soluble polypeptides AtDHAR1-his, AtDHAR2-his, and AtDHAR3-his, respectively, all of which migrated as 26-kDa polypeptides when analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The His-tagged proteins were individually purified by nickel affinity chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography, and their purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and ESI-TOF MS (Fig. 3). The purified His-tagged recombinant proteins had high DHAR activities (Table II). None of the purified enzymes showed detectable GSH conjugating activity toward standard xenobiotic GST substrates such as CDNB, 4-nitrobenzyl chloride, and benzyl isothiocyanate (14Dixon D.P. Cummins I. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The DHARs also showed no activity as dichloroacetic acid dehalogenases or glutathione peroxidases. However, when assayed with the model substrate HED, the AtDHARs all possessed thiol transferase activity (Table II). This activity was greatest after pre-incubating the HED with GSH for 3 min, suggesting the enzyme used the spontaneously formed 2-mercaptoethanol-glutathione disulfide as substrate, rather than HED itself. When assayed as either a DHAR or thiol transferase, AtDHAR2-his was considerably less stable than the other enzymes, rapidly losing activity in solution at 4 °C or following precipitation with ammonium sulfate. As a result this enzyme was not characterized further with respect to physical properties and enzyme activities. To determine whether the recombinant DHARs were monomers or multimeric proteins, the purified proteins were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. With both AtDHAR1-his and AtDHAR3-his, protein and DHAR activity eluted as a single peak with molecular masses of 29 and 32 kDa determined, respectively (data not shown). It was concluded that the AtDHARs were monomeric proteins, and under the conditions used for chromatography, we were unable to obtain any evidence that these polypeptides associated together to form multimers. The purified recombinant AtDHAR-his fusions were then subjected to kinetic analysis. AtDHAR1-his had an apparentKM(DHA) of 0.26 mm, whereasAtDHAR3-his had a KM(DHA) of 0.50 mm. Both enzymes had a low affinity for GSH when assayed with 0.5 mm DHA, with an apparentKM(GSH) of about 10 mm in both cases. The kinetics of AtDHAR1-his were then examined in more detail. The enzyme appeared to conform to Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to each substrate, suggesting that the rate-limiting step(s) required 1 molecule of DHA and 1 molecule of GSH. Tests for product inhibition showed that ascorbic acid was not inhibitory at concentrations of up to 5 mm, even when low concentrations of DHA or GSH were used. In contrast, the co-reaction product GSSG gave uncompetitive inhibition with respect to DHA, with 2.5 mmGSSG reducing DHAR activity by 73% when assayed in the presence of 1.25 mm GSH. GSSG showed more complex inhibition with respect to GSH, giving rise to strong positive co-operativity with this substrate when added at 2.5 mm.Table IIEnzyme activities associated with purified recombin"

These antagonistic regulatory functions demonstrate that Peri plays a major role in lipid storage and mobilization. Although the ADRP is less well studied, biochemical studies indicate a role for ADRP in lipid trafficking from lung lipofibroblasts to type 2 epithelial cells for surfactant biosynthesis (14Schultz C.J.

Collectively, we termed these PAT proteins, wherePeri, ADRP, and TIP47 define the core of the family (15Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Further, two PAT subdomains were described; PAT-1 defines the high identity N-terminal region, and PAT-2 defines the more distal region of lesser similarity (15Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The conserved splice site junctions between murine ADRP and Drosophila LSD-1 genes emphasize the evolutionary relationships among diverse gene family members (15Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). TIP47 was originally identified by its ability to interact with the MPR/IGF-IIR. However, the sequence similarities between TIP47 and ADRP (15Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 17Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) prompted a re-examination of the subcellular localization of TIP47 (18Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Indeed, LSD association was detected using antibodies to TIP47 (18Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), but unfortunately the data were inconclusive. The α-TIP47 antibody used also demonstrated cross-reactivity with the related ADRP, a bona fide lipid storage droplet protein (19Barbero P. Buell E. Zulley S. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24348-24351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we have examined the subcellular localizations of PAT family proteins TIP47, LSD1 from Dictyostelium, and LSD-1 and -2 from Drosophila. Using two new reagents, GFP-tagged TIP47 and a TIP47-specific antibody, we have confirmed the ability of TIP47 to co-localize with lipid storage droplets. Finally, we have demonstrated that LSD1 of Dictyostelium and LSD-1 and -2 ofDrosophila also co-localize in vivo with lipid storage droplets in mammalian tissue culture cells and, for LSD-1 and -2, in cells of Drosophila fat bodies. Full-length cDNA constructs were fused in-frame with the 3′ end of eGFP in pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) or pUAST (20Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The coding sequences of murine PeriA and murine ADRP(NM007408) were obtained from previously existing clones (15Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Eisinger D.P. Serrero G. Genomics. 1993; 16: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Murine TIP47 (AI892835) cDNA was obtained from the IMAGE consortium (ID no. 571955). Dictyostelium LSD1 (AU061427) cDNA (SLE217) was obtained from the DictyosteliumcDNA project (21Morio T. Urushihara H. Saito T. Ugawa Y. Mizuno H. Yoshida M. Yoshino R. Mitra B.N., Pi, M. Sato T. Takemoto K. Yasukawa H. Williams J. Maeda M. Takeuchi I. Ochiai H. Tanaka Y. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Drosophila LSD-1 (AF357214) and LSD-2 (AY060242) cDNA were isolated by RT-PCR using MMLV reverse transcriptase (CLONTECH) and Deep Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) from adultDrosophila head RNA. Expression of full-length eGFP, GFP-Peri, GFP-ADRP, GFP-TIP47, GFP-LSD-1, GFP-LSD-2, and GFP-LSD1 proteins in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was confirmed by Western blotting using α-GFP. Full-length human TIP47 (O60664) and human ADRP (adipophilin, Q99541) proteins were also expressed in CHO cells. (Accession numbers are from GenBankTM.) Two unique sequences, MSADGAEADGSTQ and NQKQLQGPEKEPPK, of human TIP47 were selected to generate peptides for antibody production. These are highly divergent regions that have no sequence similarity to ADRP or other proteins in the non-redundant data base of GenBankTM. The corresponding sequences from human ADRP are MASVAVDPQPSVV and KRSIGYDDTDESHC. The peptides were cross-linked to KLH and used collectively as antigens in rabbits. The antibodies were affinity-purified to peptide NQKQLQGPEKEPPK of human TIP47. Western blotting confirmed specificity for human TIP47 (see Fig.4). CHO fibroblasts were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 3 × 105 cells per well in 50-mm diameter culture dishes attached with a coverslip. All cells were cultured in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Intracellular neutral lipid storage was increased by the addition of oleic acid coupled to bovine serum albumin (1Heid H.W. Schnolzer M. Keenan T.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). CHO fibroblasts were transfected with 2 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Cells were then cultured overnight at 5 × 105 cells per well in a 50-mm diameter culture dish attached with a coverslip. Transgenic Drosophila were produced by P-element-mediated transformation using the bipartite GAL4/UASsystem (22Andrews J. Levenson I. Oliver B. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 207: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Brand A.H. Manoukian A.S. Perrimon N. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 635-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Expression of UAS::transgenes was directed by hs::GAL4 following 1 h of heat shock at 37 °C and a 3-h recovery at 25 °C. CHO and HeLa cells and Drosophilaembryos were treated with 400 nm Nile Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 5 min. Neutral lipid droplets were visualized by confocal laser microscopy (LSM 510, Zeiss). HeLa cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min and blocked prior to immunostaining. Primary rabbit anti-human TIP47 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were added sequentially to the fixed cells in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin and 28.5 mg/ml Chrompure goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The samples were stained with 8 pm Nile red in buffer containing 0.1% saponin and 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 1 min. Images were obtained by confocal laser microscopy using a ×63 water objective lens. CHO cells were grown, transfected, lipid loaded, and lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μmAEBSF, and 1 mm benzamidine by five passages through a 25-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 ×g at 4 °C. for 10 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 18.46% sucrose and centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The buoyant fraction was adjusted to 1.5 ml with lysis buffer. 1 μl of sample was mixed with 1 μl of 80 pm Nile Red in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and mounted to a glass slide with 4 μl of 80% glycerol in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The prepared slide was viewed by confocal laser microscopy using a ×63 water objective lens. PAT proteins were identified previously in an NCBI search (15Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Their PAT domain sequences (see Ref.15Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) were aligned using ClustalW with the PAM350 matrix provided in the MacVector 7.1 program package. A schematic, unrooted tree was predicted by neighbor-joining methodology. Numbers at the branch nodes represent bootstrap values (as percentages) obtained in 1000 replications. s3–12 is an adipocyte protein with a repeating 33-mer element that shares similarity with the PAT family (24Scherer P.E. Bickel P.E. Kotler M. Lodish H.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For the alignment, s3–12 was manually deleted of all but two 33-mer repeats (see Ref. 15Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Human caveolin 1 and human β-actin were included in the unrooted tree. We had previously identified (15Lu X. Gruia-Gray J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) PAT family proteins in representative species as diverse as vertebrates, Drosophila, and Dictyostelium that are related to Peri and ADRP. Sequence analyses based upon neighbor-joining comparisons now confirm separate vertebrate groupings for Peri, ADRP, and TIP47. A novel murine family member, PAT1, was also identified. Although the Drosophilaand Dictyostelium proteins are more distantly related, they demonstrate clear PAT group association (Fig.1). The subcellular localization of TIP47 has been controversial (18Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 19Barbero P. Buell E. Zulley S. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24348-24351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TIP47 was originally identified in a screen for proteins that interact with the MPR/IGF-IIR (17Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Subsequently, antibodies to TIP47 were shown to detect protein at lipid droplet surfaces (18Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), but because these antibodies cross-reacted with ADRP, it was not possible to assert unequivocally that TIP47 exhibits lipid droplet co-localization (19Barbero P. Buell E. Zulley S. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24348-24351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have used two approaches to resolve this controversy. First, to circumvent potential issues of antibody cross-reactivity we visualized TIP47 localization in fusion with GFP. Second, we also generated antibodies to human TIP47 that were directed against peptide sequences that are absent from human ADRP (i.e. adipophilin). CHO cells expressing GFP-TIP47 were grown with oleic acid to increase intracellular neutral lipid stores. Cells expressing GFP-Peri and GFP-ADRP served as positive controls, and cells expressing unfused eGFP served as a negative control. The cells were stained with Nile Red to visualize the clustered neutral lipid droplets (Fig.2). Images are centered upon clusters of the intracellular neutral lipid droplets and surrounding areas of cytosol. eGFP showed broad and diffuse fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm with clear exclusion from the lipid droplets (Fig. 2). Conversely, GFP-Peri and GFP-ADRP localized exclusively with the surfaces of lipid storage droplets. No overt fluorescence was detected in other compartments (Fig. 2). Confocal cross-sections of lipid droplet clusters showed characteristic rings of Peri and ADRP localization in contact with these neutral lipid stores (Fig. 2). GFP-TIP47 fluorescence was more complex than for eGFP, GFP-Peri, or GFP-ADRP (Fig. 2). TIP47 appears to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm. However, unlike that observed for eGFP, GFP-TIP47 fluorescence also appears to be associated with the lipid droplets. Indeed, definitive rings of GFP-TIP47 fluorescence are discerned above the general cytoplasmic background. The merged Nile Red and GFP images reveal the distinct accumulation of TIP47 around the lipid droplets with the apparent ring structures that are typical in cross-sectional views of protein localization at the surface of lipid droplets. This fluorescence pattern is not the result of simple exclusion from the lipid droplet, because no ring structures were observed in similar views of cells expressing only eGFP (Fig. 2). To further confirm the lipid droplet association of GFP-TIP47, we isolated neutral lipid droplets from these CHO cells and followed the fluorescence of eGFP, GFP-Peri, and GFP-TIP47 (Fig. 3). Images of isolated droplets from GFP-Peri- and GFP-TIP47-expressing cells were effectively indistinguishable, clearly demonstrating the close association of TIP47 at the droplet surface. eGFP did not co-isolate with the lipid droplets. These data indicate that GFP-TIP47 can associate closely with the lipid droplet surface, but they do not exclude an ability of TIP47 to interact with other subcellular components or structures (see Refs. 17Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 19Barbero P. Buell E. Zulley S. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24348-24351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that GFP-TIP47 localization may not accurately reflect the targeting of native protein (see Ref. 25Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), we examined the intracellular association of endogenous TIP47 by immunofluorescence with antibodies selective for human TIP47. TIP47 and ADRP are closely related in sequence. Accordingly, we selected peptides of human TIP47 that are not related to sequences in human ADRP for antigen production and for affinity purification. Affinity-purified antibodies to human TIP47 only recognized a single protein, of ∼45 kDa, in HeLa cells (Fig. 4A). However, TIP47 and ADRP proteins are both ∼45 kDa. We, therefore, expressed human TIP47 and human ADRP to high levels in CHO cells and probed for cross-reactivity of TIP47 antibody with ADRP. As seen in Fig. 4B, the affinity-purified antibody to human TIP47 only recognized protein in the TIP47-expressing CHO cells and not in the CHO cells that express high levels of human ADRP. Thus, the affinity-purified antibody has strong specificity for human TIP47. We then used the affinity-purified antibody to human TIP47 to examine subcellular localization of endogenous TIP47 in HeLa cells. The small lipid droplets characteristic of HeLa cells were clearly evident by Nile Red fluorescence, and TIP47 was found predominantly in very close juxtaposition (Fig. 5). We did not observe the strong, diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of TIP47 that was apparent when full-length TIP47 was highly expressed as a GFP fusion in CHO cells. Nonetheless, the GFP-TIP47 fusion experiments in conjunction with other reports (17Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 19Barbero P. Buell E. Zulley S. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that TIP47 may be multifunctional, potentially trafficking proteins and/or lipids among several compartments. Perhaps different environmental parameters alter the relative distribution of TIP47 among various intracellular compartments. TIP47 would not be unique in its ability to associate with LSD and non-LSDs, depending upon the physiological state of the cell (26Barbero P. Bittova L. Pfeffer S.R. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6344-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To determine whether lipid droplet localization is a general quality of the more diverged PAT protein members, we examined the intracellular targeting of Drosophila LSD-1 and -2 and ofDictyostelium LSD1 in CHO cells as fusions with GFP. All of the proteins showed selective localization of fluorescence to the lipid droplet surface that was exclusive of any other compartment (Fig.6). Fluorescent GFP rings were in close apposition with the neutral lipids. These data indicate that lipid droplet targeting is characteristic of PAT family proteins and that sites for their recruitment are highly conserved despite their effective separation through nearly one billion years of evolution. We also examined the localization of Drosophila LSD-1 and -2 proteins in their endogenous environment. TransgenicDrosophila were generated that expressedGFP-LSD-1 or -2 genes driven with aGAL4-inducible promoter. The GAL4 transcriptional regulatory protein was induced by heat shock response. The GFP-LSD-1 (Fig.7) and -2 proteins (not shown) were clearly shown to associate with lipid droplets within cells of larval (first instar) fat bodies, as evidenced by the rings of GFP fluorescence surrounding the large lipid droplets in these cells. These data confirm that LSD-1 and -2 proteins can associate specifically with lipid droplets in a native environment, as well as in mammalian CHO cells. In summary, the PAT protein family has ancient progenitors that define a novel protein targeting component for association with intracellular lipid storage droplets. A common sequence and/or structural element among these proteins is necessary and sufficient for this functional conservation even within exogenous cellular environments. Further, structure/function studies of Peri demonstrate its essential role in lipid storage droplet deposition and mobilization (9Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V.

Nonetheless, the confirmation that the distantly related PAT proteins of Drosophila and Dictyostelium also possess the essential structural elements for LSD targeting emphasizes this functional characteristic. Directed and complementary studies using both mammalian and non-mammalian systems will be required to dissect the molecular mechanisms that are a fundamental property of this important protein family. We greatly appreciate the efforts of theDictyostelium cDNA project in Japan and the BerkeleyDrosophila Genome Project and gratefully acknowledge access to unpublished communications from Drs. Dawn Brasaemle and Nat Wolins. We are indebted to members of the Londos and Kimmel labs for continuous support and discussions, with particular acknowledgment to Drs. John Tansey and Carole Sztalryd.

Growth factors of the epidermal growth factor family are known to target key genes that in turn may affect the homeostasis of lung mucosae. Our aim was to study the regulation of the 11p15 mucin genes both at the promoter and protein levels to assess whether their altered expression may represent a key event during lung carcinogenesis. Studies were performed in the mucoepidermoid NCI-H292 lung cancer cell line. Cell treatment with epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) resulted in a dramatic increase of MUC2 and MUC5ACmRNAs levels, promoter activity, and apomucin expression, whereas those of MUC5B and MUC6 were unchanged. pGL3 deletion mutants of MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC5B promoters were constructed and used in transient transfection assays to characterize EGF- and TGF-α-responsive regulatory regions within the promoters. They were located in the −2627/−2097 and −202/−1 regions of MUC2 and MUC5AC promoters, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that transcription factor Sp1 not only binds and activatesMUC2 and MUC5AC promoters but also participates to their EGF- and TGF-α-mediated up-regulation. We also show that Sp3 is a strong inhibitor of 11p15 mucin gene transcription. In conclusion, MUC2 and MUC5AC are two target genes of EGFR ligands in lung cancer cells, and up-regulation of these two genes goes through concomitant activation of the EGFR/Ras/Raf/Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase-signaling pathway and Sp1 binding to their promoters.

In conclusion, MUC2 and MUC5AC are two target genes of EGFR ligands in lung cancer cells, and up-regulation of these two genes goes through concomitant activation of the EGFR/Ras/Raf/Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase-signaling pathway and Sp1 binding to their promoters. epidermal growth factor EGF receptor extracellular signal-regulated kinase reverse transcriptase transforming growth factor-α tumor necrosis factor-α glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase kilobases Mucins have been postulated to be important molecules in maintaining epithelium homeostasis in inflammatory diseases and cancer in that they are large O-glycoproteins expressed either at the cell surface or as secreted molecules to form a protective gel. Mucin genes MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC6 are clustered on the p15 arm of chromosome 11 (1) and encode large secreted O-glycoproteins that participate in mucus formation and epithelium protection (2Porchet N. Buisine M.-P. Desseyn J.-L. Moniaux N. Nollet S. Degand P. Pigny P. Van Seuningen I. Laine A. Aubert J.-P. J. Soc. Biol. 1999; 193: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Van klinken B.J. Dekker J. Büller H.A. Einerhand A.W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G613-G627PubMed Google Scholar). However, their precise biological role as key genes during sequential steps of lung carcinogenesis has yet to be proven. In the surface epithelium of the respiratory tract, MUC5ACis exclusively expressed in mucus-secreting goblet cells, whereasMUC1 and MUC4 are expressed in all epithelial cells. MUC5B is prominent in the mucous cells of the submucosal glands, and MUC2 is weakly expressed in both cell types (4Audié J.-P. Janin A. Porchet N. Copin M.-C. Gosselin B. Aubert J.-P. J. Histochem.

In epithelial lung diseases this pattern of expression is altered and has been correlated to poor prognosis of the tumor (invasiveness, metastasis) (7Ho J.J.L. Kim Y.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). For example, aberrant expression ofMUC6 in bronchiopulmonary adenocarcinoma, loss of expression of MUC5AC and MUC5B in epidermoid carcinoma, and a strong expression of the four 11p15 mucin genes in bronchioalveolar carcinoma was recently described (5Copin M.-C. Devisme L. Buisine M.-P. Marquette C.H. Wurtz A. Aubert J.-P. Gosselin B. Porchet N. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Growth factors are thought to be involved in goblet cell production because hypersecretory diseases are associated with abnormal epithelial cell growth and differentiation, and epithelium wounding leads to repair and remodeling processes (8Davies D.E. Polosa R. Puddicombe S.M. Richter A. Holgate S.T. Allergy. 1999; 54: 771-783PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Nadel and co-workers (9Takeyama K. Dabbagh K. Lee H.-M. Agusti C. Lausier J.A.

They showed that MUC5AC mRNA expression was increased after ligand binding to the EGFR and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Positive correlation between EGFR and MUC5AC expression and localization in goblet cells of human bronchi is also in favor of the activation of a series of events involving EGFR followed by activation of MUC5AC expression in lung cells (11Takeyama K. Fahy J.V. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, these studies only focused on MUC5AC, whereas it has been shown by our laboratory that the expression of the other 11p15 mucin genes is also impaired in lung diseases (5Copin M.-C. Devisme L. Buisine M.-P. Marquette C.H. Wurtz A. Aubert J.-P. Gosselin B. Porchet N. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Copin M.-C. Buisine M.-P. Devisme L.

Moreover, despite these promising studies, no data regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for mucin gene regulation at the promoter level are available. Their identification remains a big challenge but is mandatory if one wants to demonstrate whether mucins are indeed key molecules in carcinogenesis.

All of them are flanked by TATA boxes, and upstream cis-elements that confer cell-specific expression to the genes were described.MUC2 promoter is GC-rich over a very long stretch (4 kb) and, as expected, was shown to be regulated by ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 (12Gum Jr., J.R.

MUC5B promoter is characterized by two transcription units (15Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13586-13596Google Scholar). The proximal unit is also regulated by Sp1/Sp3 factors, whereas the distal unit is under the regulation of ATF/CREB transcription factors. The promoter of MUC5AC is only known over 1.4 kb (14Li D. Gallup M. Fan N. Szymkowski D.E. Basbaum C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6812-6820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is characterized by putative binding sites for Sp1, AP-2, and NF-κB transcription factors and key cis-elements, yet to be described, operate within 4 kb upstream of the transcription start site (14Li D.

Our aim in the laboratory is to better understand transcriptional regulation of 11p15 mucin genes to propose new therapeutic targets in epithelial diseases (inflammation and cancer) (18Van Seuningen I. Pigny P. Perrais M. Porchet N. Aubert J.-P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: 1216-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, regulation of the four 11p15 mucin genes MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC6 was studied for the first time simultaneously at the mRNA, promoter, and protein levels. We focused on EGF- and TGF-α-mediated regulation of these genes due to the importance of these growth factors both during lung development (19Ruocco S. Lallemand A. Tournier J.M. Gaillard D. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and carcinogenesis (8Davies D.E. Polosa R. Puddicombe S.M. Richter A. Holgate S.T. Allergy. 1999; 54: 771-783PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, because it was previously shown for other genes, such as gastrin (20Merchant J. Shiotani A. Mortensen E.R. Shumaker D.K. Abraczinskas D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6314-6319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or apolipoprotein A-I (21Zheng X.-L. Matsubara S. Diao C. Hollenberg M.D. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13822-13829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), that Sp1 may participate to EGF-mediated up-regulation of the target gene, we looked at the Sp1 effect on mucin gene regulation. We demonstrate that among the four 11p15 mucin genes only MUC2 and MUC5AC are regulated at the transcriptional (promoter activity and mRNA levels) and protein levels by EGF and TGF-α and that the activated signaling pathway goes through Ras/Raf/ERK kinases. Finally, we show that Sp1 not only transactivates MUC2 and MUC5AC transcription but also participates in their up-regulation by EGF and TGF-α. Human pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line NCI-H292 was cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 water-jacketed incubator in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), Hepes (25 mm), and sodium pyruvate (1 mm). At confluence, cells were incubated for 24 h with EGF (recombinant human EGF, 25 ng/ml), TGF-α (recombinant human TGF-α, 20 ng/ml), TNF-α (recombinant human TNF-α, 40 ng/ml), or EGF plus TNF-α or TGF-α plus TNF-α. In inhibition studies, cells were pretreated for 30 min with tyrphostin AG1478 (10 μm,Calbiochem), radicicol (10 μm), PD98059 (30 μm), or U0126 (10 μm, Promega) before adding the growth factors of interest. To inhibit protein synthesis or transcription, cells were pretreated for 30 min with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) or actinomycin D (1 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) before adding the growth factors. Inhibition of Sp1 binding was carried out by preincubating cells for 24 h with mithramycin A (100 nm) before adding the growth factors. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Confluent cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline before fixation of the pellet in 4% formaldehyde, and embedding in paraffin. 3-μm sections were prepared, and morphological analysis was done after hematoxylin-eosin-safran/Astra blue staining. Pretreatment and immunostaining of the sections were performed as described before (22Copin M.-C. Buisine M.-. P Leteurtre E. Marquette C.H. Porte H. Aubert J.-P. Gosselin B. Porchet N. Hum.

The MUC5B-pGL3 deletion mutants (2140, 1599, 1596, 1896) covering 2044 nucleotides upstream of the first ATG were previously described in Van Seuningen et al. (15Van Seuningen I. Perrais M. Pigny P.

MUC2 promoter was obtained by running PCR on the cosmid clone ELO19 isolated from a pWE15 library previously used in the laboratory to isolate the MUC5AC gene (27Buisine M.-P. Desseyn J.-L.

PCR was carried out with 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Qiagen) without 5× Q buffer in the reaction mixture as follows: 15 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C and then 15 min at 72 °C.

Internal deletion mutants (MUC2 (1852, 2214, and 1824) and MUC5AC (2144, 2189, and 2113)) were generated by PCR using pairs of primers bearing specific restriction sites at their 5′ and 3′ ends (Table I). PCR products were digested, gel-purified (Qiaquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen), and subcloned into the pGL3 Basic vector (Promega) that had been previously cut with the same restriction enzymes. All clones were sequenced on both strands on an automatic LI-COR sequencer (ScienceTec, Les Ulis, France) using infrared-labeled RV3 and GL2 primers (Promega).

Total cell extracts were prepared after a 48-h incubation at 37 °C using 1× reagent lysis buffer (Promega) as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual. Total protein content in the extract (4 μl) was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method in 96-well plates as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual (Pierce).

Gels were vacuum-dried and autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C. Expression of 11p15 mucin genes was studied by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig.1, NCI-H292 cells expressMUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC5B mRNAs, whereas MUC6 mRNA is not detected (lane 1). Because NCI-H292 cells are described as a mucoepidermoid cell line, we looked at CK7 and mucin expression by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies (Fig. 2). CK7, a marker characteristic of a glandular phenotype, is expressed in 100% of the cells (Fig. 2B). MUC2 (Fig. 2C) and MUC5AC (Fig. 2D) apomucins are expressed in 20 and 2–5% of the cells, respectively. MUC5B and MUC6 apomucins were not detected in these cells (not shown). In Alcian blue-stained cells, a few grains of secretion could be detected (Fig. 2A). In conclusion, mucoepidermoid NCI-H292 cells express MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC5B at the mRNA level, but only MUC2 and MUC5AC apomucins are translated and expressed in the cells.FIG. 2Study of the expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC apomucins in NCI-H292 cells and effect of TGF-α on their expression by immunohistochemistry.

By RT-PCR (Fig. 1), we show that treatment of the cells with EGF (lane 2) or TGF-α (lane 3) results in a dramatic increase of MUC2 and MUC5AC mRNA levels. Because EGFR is known to be up-regulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, which is increased in hypersecretory diseases (8Davies D.E. Polosa R. Puddicombe S.M. Richter A. Holgate S.T. Allergy. 1999; 54: 771-783PubMed Google Scholar), the synergistic effect between TNF-α and EGF or TGF-α was tested. TNF-α up-regulates MUC2 and MUC5AC expression level (lane 4), but no synergistic effect was observed between TNF-α and EGF (lane 5) or TGF-a (lane 6). The different treatments had no effect on MUC5BmRNA levels in these cells, and MUC6, which is not expressed in this cell line, was not induced either. The up-regulation of MUC2 and MUC5AC mRNA levels was confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 2E, a dramatic increase in MUC2 apomucin expression was observed as 90–100% of the TGF-α-treated cells express MUC2 compared with 20% in untreated cells (Fig.2C). MUC5AC expression increased to 30% (Fig.2F) when only a few cells were stained in untreated cells (Fig. 2D). No staining was observed with anti-MUC5B and anti-MUC6 antibodies (data not shown). The same results were obtained when cells were treated with EGF. We can, thus, conclude that MUC2 and MUC5AC up-regulation by EGF and TGF-α in NCI-H292 cells most likely involve regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional level. To do that, we first undertook to identify the regulatory regions within the promoters that are responsive to EGF and TGF-α. For these studies, a panel of deletion mutants covering promoter regions of MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC5B were constructed in promoterless pGL3 basic vector. Cells were then transfected with the different deletion mutants and treated with the growth factor of interest in the same conditions as in Fig. 1. Regarding MUC2 promoter (Fig.3A), EGF and TGF-α selectively increased luciferase activity of the longest fragment, which covers the −2627/−1 region of MUC2 promoter (1852; 3- and 2.5-fold activation, respectively). No effect was seen on fragments covering the −2096/+27 (2214) and −947/−1 (1824) regions, indicating that the −2627/−2097 region of MUC2 promoter is necessary to observe a response to EGF or TGF-α. RegardingMUC5AC promoter (Fig. 3B), EGF and TGF-α increased luciferase activity of the three fragments tested (2–3-fold activation). The region −202/−1 is thus sufficient to get a response, but cooperative elements are present further upstream (−1366/−487) since a significant increase is observed when using the longest deletion mutant (compare black bars with gray bars). Having shown that treatment of NCI-H292 cells with TNF-α resulted in an increase of MUC2 and MUC5AC mRNA levels (Fig. 1, lane 4), we also looked at its effect on their promoters. As shown in Figs. 3, A and B, TNF-α did not have any significant effect of MUC2 and MUC5AC promoter activity. As expected, no synergistic effect between TNF-α and EGF or TGF-α was observed on either promoter, thus confirming RT-PCR results (see Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6). Finally, the different treatments had no effect on the two promoters of MUC5B (proximal and distal, Fig.3C), those results being in agreement with RT-PCR data (see Fig. 1). From these studies it can be concluded that EGF and TGF-α activate MUC2 and MUC5AC promoter activity and that responsive elements are present in the −2627/−2097 and −1366/−1 regions of MUC2 and MUC5AC promoters, respectively. In the experiments that follow we, thus, focused our work on the regulation of these two genes. To further identify the intracellular mechanisms used by EGFR ligands and TNF-α that lead to a higher expression of MUC2 and MUC5AC in NCI-H292 cells, a 30-min pretreatment with actinomycin D, a transcriptional inhibitor, or cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, before exposure to EGF, TGF-α, or TNF-α, was applied. As shown in Fig. 4, no effect of actinomycin D and cycloheximide is seen on the basal level ofMUC2 or MUC5AC mRNAs in these cells (lanes 1–3). On the other hand, actinomycin D treatment completely blocked the EGF-, TGF-α-, and TNF-α-mediated up-regulation of MUC2 and MUC5AC (lanes 6, 9, and 12). In the same conditions, cycloheximide had no effect (lanes 5, 8, and 11). Thus, these data indicate that EGF, TGF-α, and TNF-α increase MUC2 and MUC5AC expression at the transcriptional level and that activation does not require de novo protein synthesis. To determine which signaling pathway is induced by EGF or TGF-α, three pharmacological agents were used in inhibition studies. Tyrphostin AG1478 is a selective inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, radicicol selectively depletes cells in Raf kinase (33Soga S. Kozawa T. Narumi H. Akinaga S. Irie K. Matsumoto K.

To identify components of non-lipoprotein-mediated sterol uptake, we utilized strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that accumulate exogenous sterol due to a neomorphic mutation in the transcription factor, UPC2. Two congenic upc2-1strains, differing quantitatively in aerobic sterol uptake due to a modifying mutation in the HAP1 transcription factor, were compared using DNA microarrays. We identified 9 genes as responsive toUPC2 that were also induced under anaerobiosis, when sterol uptake is essential. Deletion mutants in these genes were assessed for sterol influx in the upc2-1 background. UPC2itself was up-regulated under these conditions and was required for aerobic sterol influx. Deletion of the ATP-binding cassette transporters YOR011w (AUS1) orPDR11, or a putative cell wall protein encoded byDAN1, significantly reduced sterol influx. Sodium azide and vanadate inhibited sterol uptake, consistent with the participation of ATP-binding cassette transporters. We hypothesized that the physiological role of Aus1p and Pdr11p is to mediate sterol uptake when sterol biosynthesis is compromised.

In mammalian cells, the processes that control the supply of this commodity are precisely regulated, primarily at the transcriptional level. Although the endogenous synthesis and storage (as ester) of cholesterol are critical aspects of this homeostasis, it is the uptake of exogenous cholesterol that presents the greatest challenge to this equilibrium. The endocytosis of cholesterol-containing low density lipoprotein particles by the low density lipoprotein receptor or the selective uptake of cholesteryl ester from high density lipoproteins by the scavenger receptor type BI are transcriptionally regulated events (1Krieger M.

This phenomenon is referred to as aerobic sterol exclusion (9Lorenz R.T. Parks L.W. Lipids. 1991; 26: 598-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, when sterol biosynthesis is compromised, for example by anaerobic growth, sterol uptake is required for viability (10Gollub E.G. Trocha P. Liu P.K. Sprinson D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

For this reason, studies of sterol influx in yeast have primarily employed sterol auxotrophs or mutants in heme synthesis which accumulate sterol from the media when grown aerobically (11Lorenz R.T. Rodriguez R.J. Lewis T.A. Parks L.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 981-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

We therefore conducted a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of normal and upc2-1 mutant strains grown under aerobic conditions. By virtue of this expression profiling, we have identified a subset of 9 genes regulated by UPC2 and induced by anaerobiosis that are putative components of free sterol influx.

https://openalex.org/W2130628767,"The Rad51 nucleoprotein filament mediates DNA strand exchange, a key step of homologous recombination. This activity is stimulated by replication protein A (RPA), but only when RPA is introduced after Rad51 nucleoprotein filament formation. In contrast, RPA inhibits Rad51 nucleoprotein complex formation by prior binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but Rad52 protein alleviates this inhibition. Here we show that Rad51 filament formation is simultaneous with displacement of RPA from ssDNA. This displacement is initiated by a rate-limiting nucleation of Rad51 protein onto ssDNA complex, followed by rapid elongation of the filament. Rad52 protein accelerates RPA displacement by Rad51 protein. This acceleration probably involves direct interactions with both Rad51 protein and RPA.

Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like RecA protein, Rad51 protein binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to form the functional presynaptic complex, which mediates DNA strand exchange (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). However, unlike RecA protein, Rad51 protein readily binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and the binding to dsDNA strongly inhibits DNA strand exchange (6Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Therefore, not unexpectedly, the binding of Rad51 protein to dsDNA present as secondary structure in ssDNA severely limits DNA strand exchange (7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). For this reason, Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange depends strongly on a ssDNA-binding protein to eliminate DNA secondary structure. RPA, which is a heterotrimeric ssDNA-binding protein (8Heyer W.-D. Rao M.R.S. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2321-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), greatly stimulates DNA strand exchange by Rad51 protein, provided that RPA is added to a preexisting complex of Rad51 protein and ssDNA (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). However, RPA will inhibit DNA strand exchange when it is allowed to bind ssDNA before Rad51 protein. Previously, we offered an interpretation for this dichotomous role of RPA in Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange (7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). According to this view, RPA aids DNA strand exchange by disrupting DNA secondary structure, which is an impediment to presynaptic complex formation. However, because RPA and Rad51 protein both compete for these same ssDNA binding sites, RPA can also be an impediment to presynaptic complex formation. Nevertheless, when the molecular ratios of Rad51 protein and RPA to ssDNA are appropriate (2–3 nucleotides per Rad51 protein and 10–20 nucleotides per RPA), the steady-state product of this competitive process is a uniform Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex with little DNA secondary structure. Based on this model, after disruption of DNA secondary structure, RPA is expected to be displaced by Rad51 protein. Previously, however, we did not directly demonstrate the release of RPA from ssDNA. Purified yeast Rad52 protein has DNA binding activity (10Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and it also interacts with both Rad51 protein and RPA (1Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 11Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies show that Rad52 protein has at least two activities important to recombination. One activity is the stimulation of Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange (12Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 13Shinohara A. Ogawa T.

Both Rad52 protein-RPA and Rad52 protein-Rad51 protein interactions are necessary for stimulation. This stimulatory function of Rad52 protein, however, is revealed under conditions where RPA inhibits Rad51 protein activity:i.e. when RPA is bound to ssDNA prior to Rad51 protein. Therefore, it was hypothesized that Rad52 protein acts by stimulating the displacement of RPA by Rad51 protein (14New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The second activity of Rad52 protein is the annealing of complementary ssDNA (10Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This activity is consistent with the importance of this protein in the ssDNA annealing pathway of double strand break repair (16Ivanov E.L. Sugawara N. Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Genetics. 1996; 142: 693-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast Rad52 protein can also anneal ssDNA that is complexed with yeast RPA, due to a specific interaction with RPA (11Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which Rad52 protein stimulates DNA strand exchange is not clear. Because Rad52 protein stimulates DNA strand exchange when RPA is prebound to ssDNA, Rad52 might simply displace RPA from the ssDNA, permitting Rad51 protein to bind. In this paper, we examine the fate of RPA during presynaptic complex formation. Our results indicate that Rad52 protein alone cannot displace RPA from ssDNA. Instead, Rad52 protein forms a co-complex with the RPA-ssDNA complex, and it recruits the Rad51 protein onto ssDNA, and then Rad51 protein displaces RPA. Our results also reveal the dynamic nature of the complex protein exchange and assembly process that underlies DNA recombination. Poly(dT) was purchased from AmershamBiosciences.

For the standard reaction, 10 μm ssDNA, 5 μm Rad51 protein, and 1 μm RPA were added in the indicated order to buffer (final volume of 120 μl) containing 2.5 mm ATP, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 256 μm NADH, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm KCl, and 30 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5). The hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH, which results in a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The decrease of absorbance was monitored every 25 s by a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The instantaneous rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the rate of change in absorbance based on 5 or 6 time points using the following formula: rate of A340 decrease (s−1) × 9880 = rate of ATP hydrolysis (μm/min). For Fig. 2, we used 2.4 mm magnesium acetate instead of 5 mm, because the displacement was slower and the result was more apparent under these conditions (data not shown). RPA has an intrinsic fluorescence that is quenched when it binds to ssDNA (19Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rad51 protein, which has no tryptophan residue, has much lower fluorescence (∼50-fold lower per molecule than RPA), and it does not change upon DNA binding (data not shown). Although Rad52 protein has ∼40% of the fluorescence of RPA, the fluorescence is unchanged by interaction with either ssDNA, Rad51, or RPA (data not shown). Therefore, the dissociation of RPA from ssDNA in the presence of Rad51 protein can be monitored in real time by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence quenching of RPA. Reactions were done in a quartz cuvette containing 300 or 400 μl of buffer containing 2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm KCl, and 30 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) at 37 °C. RPA (1 μm), ssDNA (10 μm), and Rad51 protein (5 μm) were added in the order indicated. Between each addition of protein or DNA, the components were allowed to equilibrate for 1.5–2 min. When indicated, Rad52 protein (1 μm) was added to the reaction mixture ∼30 s after the addition of Rad51 protein. Throughout the reaction, the fluorescence of RPA was continuously monitored with an SLM8000 spectrofluorimeter set to excitation and emission wavelengths of 284 and 345 nm, respectively. The bandwidth for excitation and emission was 1 and 4 nm, respectively. The percentage of RPA that was displaced from ssDNA was calculated from the fluorescence value relative to free RPA. The contributions of Rad51 and Rad52 proteins to the fluorescence were subtracted. Proteins were mixed with 10 μm32P-labeled synthetic 100-mer ssDNA in the indicated order and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of buffer containing 30 mm K-MOPS (pH 7.3), 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP (when indicated). When more than one protein was present, the samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C between each addition, and for 15 min after the addition of the last protein. After the reaction, samples were analyzed by one of the following electrophoresis methods. For “conventional” electrophoresis, samples were mixed with 5 or 10 μl of loading buffer A (50% glycerol and 0.1% bromphenol blue in TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 1 mmEDTA)) and separated with 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer. Alternatively, electrophoresis was conducted in the presence of ATP and Mg2+; samples were mixed with 10 μl of the loading buffer B (50% glycerol, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mmmagnesium acetate, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) and separated with 6% polyacrylamide gel in 20 mm KCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm ATP, and 45 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3). For both methods, retardation of the labeled ssDNA was detected using an Amersham Biosciences Storm 840 PhosphorImager with Image-QuaNT software. The protein content of complexes detected in the gel mobility shift experiments was analyzed in the following way. Gel pieces containing protein-ssDNA complexes were excised and cut into smaller pieces, and then radioactivity was quantified by Cerenkov counting to measure the amount of ssDNA in each sample. Based on the relative radioactivity, the number of pieces used for SDS-PAGE were adjusted so that all samples had the same radioactivity. That enabled comparison of the amount of protein present, normalized to the ssDNA content. The gel pieces (approximate volumes of 10–50 μl) were then mixed with 50 μl of TE buffer and 20 μl of SDS loading buffer (350 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 6% 2-mercaptoethanol, 36% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and incubated for 3 h at room temperature and then 4 min at 100 °C. Samples, including gel pieces and buffer, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted from excised gel pieces overnight into 0.5 ml of TE buffer containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature. After reducing the volume to ∼50–100 μl by vacuum concentration, 2 μl of the eluates were spotted on DEAE paper, and relative amounts of ssDNA were quantified by measuring the radioactivity using an Amersham Biosciences Storm 840 PhosphorImager and Image-QuaNT software. Western blotting analysis, using 12% SDS-PAGE, was performed with anti-RPA rabbit polyclonal antibody. As standards, the indicated amounts of RPA were also loaded on the gel. The amount of protein in each sample was determined from the relative intensity of the protein band to the standards, measured using Image-QuaNT software. Previously, we suggested that RPA eliminates DNA secondary structure, which impedes presynaptic complex formation by Rad51 protein (7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Since RPA competes with Rad51 protein for binding to ssDNA, we also proposed that bound RPA must be removed from the ssDNA to permit contiguous presynaptic filament formation. Experimentally, the competitive nature of RPA is most clearly manifest by preforming an RPA-ssDNA complex and then introducing Rad51 protein; in this situation, Rad51 protein must displace the RPA from the ssDNA to form a presynaptic complex, and activation of Rad51 protein function is slow (Fig.1A, RPA-firstprocess). On the other hand, if Rad51 protein is added to native ssDNA that is free of RPA, it makes a discontinuous presynaptic complex that is interrupted by Rad51 protein-dsDNA regions; the addition of RPA stimulates presynaptic complex formation relatively quickly (Fig.1A, Rad51-first process). To better understand the nature of presynaptic complex formation in the presence of RPA, we examined the time course of filament formation by each process. The binding of Rad51 protein to ssDNA was measured by monitoring the ATP hydrolysis that accompanies formation of a Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex (Fig. 1B), from which the rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated (Fig. 1C). When Rad51 protein was added to a preformed RPA-ssDNA complex, ATP hydrolysis did not occur instantly. Rather, the ATP hydrolysis rate increased gradually and reached a steady state (2.6 μm/min) ∼30 min after the addition of Rad51 protein (Fig. 1, B and C, RPA-first). Without RPA, the discontinuous Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex showed a slower ATP hydrolysis (1.2 μm/min; Fig. 1B, Rad51-first) before the addition of RPA. When RPA was added to this Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex (Fig. 1, B and C, Rad51-first), the ATP hydrolysis rate increased relatively instantly. In the Rad51-first process, 70% of the increase in ATP hydrolysis rate occurred in less than 2 min, whereas it took ∼15 min in the RPA-first process. In parallel with the ATPase assays that measured the Rad51 protein-ssDNA binding status, we also measured the DNA binding status of RPA by fluorescence spectroscopy. RPA has an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence that is quenched by binding to ssDNA (19Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, the change in fluorescence reflects a change of the RPA-ssDNA binding status. We performed experiments similar to those in Fig.1C, except that we monitored the intrinsic fluorescence of RPA (Fig. 1D). As expected, when Rad51 protein was added to an RPA-ssDNA complex, RPA was released from the ssDNA slowly (Fig.1D, RPA-first) and reached a plateau level ∼30 min after the addition of Rad51 protein. On the other hand, when RPA was added to a Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex, almost all of the RPA remained unbound throughout the measurement (Fig. 1D, Rad51-first). For both RPA-first and Rad51-first processes, the time courses for RPA release coincided with the time courses for Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex formation that were measured by monitoring ATP hydrolysis. These results indicate that Rad51 protein displaces RPA from ssDNA upon formation of the presynaptic filament. In addition, the RPA-first process is slower than the Rad51-first process. These characteristics can explain why RPA has opposite effects on Rad51 protein-mediated functions, which depend on the order of protein-ssDNA complex formation. This behavior of RPA is similar to that of E. coli SSB protein with regard to RecA protein function; displacement of SSB protein by RecA protein is faster for the RecA-first than for the SSB-first process (23Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J.C. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Formation of the RecA nucleoprotein filament is initiated by a rate-limiting nucleation of the protein-DNA complex, followed by cooperative elongation of the filament (25Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Chabbert M. Cazenave C. Helene C.

The different rates of RPA displacement in Rad51-first and RPA-first processes suggest that the rate-limiting step in the RPA-first process for RPA displacement is nucleation of the Rad51-ssDNA complex rather than elongation of the filament. To confirm this possibility, we varied the amount of RPA that was prebound to ssDNA, and then Rad51 protein was added to start the displacement reaction (Fig.2). In this experiment, we used poly(dT) instead of pBluescript ssDNA to eliminate any complications arising from DNA secondary structure, since Rad51 protein will bind to both the ssDNA and dsDNA regions. Because the Rad51 protein-dsDNA complex shows much less ATPase activity than the Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex (7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the ATP hydrolysis rate with native ssDNA would not be proportional to the amount of Rad51 protein that bound the DNA. In contrast, by using poly(dT), the ATPase activity will be proportional to formation of the Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex. When Rad51 protein was added to various subsaturating RPA-poly(dT) complexes (Fig. 2A, left four curves), the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis was rapidly attained; however, when Rad51 protein was added to saturated RPA-ssDNA complexes (Fig. 2A, right four curves), a markedly slower increase in ATP hydrolysis occurred. Under the latter saturating conditions, the rate of ATP hydrolysis even after 60 min of incubation was about 30% of that without RPA and was still increasing slowly. The ATPase activities at 10 min after reaction initiation (Fig. 2B) show that concentrations of RPA greater than 0.9 μm precipitously reduced ATP hydrolysis. This concentration of RPA coincides with the concentration required to saturate the poly(dT) (∼20 nucleotides per RPA (7Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)). A slightly lower concentration (0.8 μm) of RPA showed a rather limited reduction of ATP hydrolysis (less than 40%) compared with that of the saturated RPA-poly(dT) complex, although ∼90% of ssDNA would be covered by RPA at this concentration. This suggests that the rate-limiting step for displacement at saturating RPA concentrations is the nucleation of Rad51 protein on the RPA-ssDNA complex. Once nucleation occurs, the kinetic curves show that Rad51 protein quickly displaces RPA from ssDNA, presumably by its cooperative assembly along ssDNA. However, in contrast to RecA protein, the distinction between the nucleation and growth phases for Rad51 protein is smaller. Rad52 protein stimulates DNA strand exchange by Rad51 protein under conditions where RPA is bound to ssDNA before Rad51 protein (11Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 12Sung P. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). To examine whether this stimulation is due to an accelerated displacement of RPA, we tested the effect of Rad52 protein on both ATP hydrolysis and the displacement of RPA from ssDNA by Rad51 protein. As expected, in the presence of Rad52 protein, the rate of Rad51 protein-dependent ATP hydrolysis increased faster than in the absence of Rad52 protein (Fig.3A). Similarly, the displacement of RPA from ssDNA by Rad51 protein was accelerated by Rad52 protein (Fig. 3B). We also examined whether Rad52 protein itself could displace RPA from ssDNA in the absence of Rad51 protein. When Rad52 protein was added to a RPA-ssDNA complex in the absence of Rad51 protein, no RPA displacement was observed (Fig.3B, +Rad52 (no Rad51)). These results show that Rad52 protein alone does not displace RPA from ssDNA, but rather, it facilitates Rad51 protein to do so. We also analyzed the effect of Rad52 protein on RPA displacement at various concentrations of Rad51 protein (Fig.4). At all concentrations, Rad52 protein stimulated displacement. At the lower concentrations of Rad51 protein (stoichiometric relative to ssDNA concentration or lower; Figs. 3A and 4, A, B, and E–G), the stimulation was clear throughout the reaction period; at the higher concentrations of Rad51 protein, stimulation was more modest (Fig. 4, C, D, and E–G). The final rate of ATP hydrolysis, when the Rad51 protein concentration exceeds that needed to saturate the ssDNA, was approximately the same in the presence and the absence of Rad52 protein, supporting the idea that Rad52 protein does not stimulate the ATPase activity of Rad51 protein beyond that of the fully contiguous Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex. These results indicate that the Rad52 protein-mediated stimulation of Rad51 protein function is caused by an acceleration of the loading of Rad51 protein onto an RPA-ssDNA complex with the concomitant release of RPA from the ssDNA. Rad52 protein-mediated stimulation of DNA strand exchange is species-specific (14New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Rad52 protein cannot stimulate the reaction either if RPA is replaced by E. coliSSB protein or if Rad51 protein is replaced by E. coli RecA protein. To test whether this species specificity is caused by the specific acceleration of Rad51 protein-ssDNA complex formation by Rad52 protein, we next examined the effect of Rad52 protein on presynaptic complex formation by E. coli RecA and SSB proteins. When Rad51 protein was added to SSB-ssDNA complexes, the ATP hydrolysis rate increased gradually to a plateau level in 40 min (Fig.5A, −Rad52), showing that SSB protein can be displaced by Rad51 protein from ssDNA. Rad52 protein, however, did not affect the time course of SSB displacement by Rad51 protein, showing that the stimulation by Rad52 protein is species-specific (Fig. 5A, +Rad52). When RecA protein was added to an RPA-ssDNA complex, RecA protein also displaced RPA from ssDNA (Fig. 5B, −Rad52). However, Rad52 protein did not stimulate but rather blocked displacement (Fig. 5B, +Rad52). This result is consistent with our previous report, which showed that Rad52 protein inhibits DNA strand exchange by RecA protein and RPA (14New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Rad52 protein also slowed SSB displacement by RecA protein (Fig.5C), suggesting that Rad52 protein inhibits either DNA binding or ATP hydrolysis by RecA protein by an unknown mechanism. We also examined the effect of various Rad52 protein concentrations on presynaptic complex formation, using all combinations of homologous and heterologous proteins. Experiments such as those shown in Fig. 5, A–C, were performed, and the relative ATPase activity at 5 min after the addition of Rad51 protein was plotted against the concentration of Rad52 protein (Fig. 6), because both stimulation and inhibition were clear at this early stage of the displacement. Rad52 protein stimulated the ATP hydrolysis activity of Rad51 protein only when RPA was used. The optimum Rad52 protein concentration for the stimulation (∼0.5 μm) was similar to the concentration of RPA, which was bound to ssDNA. This suggests that a stoichiometric co-complex of Rad52 protein and RPA on ssDNA is involved in the displacement. The displacement of SSB protein by Rad51 protein was not affected at any concentration of Rad52 protein. RecA-mediated displacement of both RPA and SSB protein was inhibited by Rad52 protein in a concentration-dependent manner. These results confirm the need for cognate, species-specific interactions in the Rad52 protein-mediated stimulation of presynaptic complex formation. In the experiments presented so far, we analyzed both ATP hydrolysis by Rad51 protein to follow its binding to ssDNA and the fluorescence of RPA to follow its binding to DNA. Although each method detects the respective status of which protein was bound to ssDNA, neither provides any information regarding the interaction of Rad52 protein with the RPA-ssDNA complex. Because T4 phage UvsY protein and E. coliRecO protein, which are functional homologues of Rad52 protein, can form a co-complex with the gp32-ssDNA complex and the SSB protein-ssDNA complex, respectively (30Hashimoto K. Yonesaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4883-4888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was of special interest to test whether Rad52 protein could also produce a co-complex with the RPA-ssDNA complex. Therefore, we examined the binding of Rad52 protein to RPA-ssDNA complexes using a gel mobility shift assay. Incubation of RPA and 100-mer ssDNA produced an RPA-ssDNA complex"
https://openalex.org/W2055846126,"When matter is cooled from high temperatures, collective instabilities develop among its constituent particles that lead to new kinds of order. An anomaly in the specific heat is a classic signature of this phenomenon. Usually the associated order is easily identified, but sometimes its nature remains elusive. The heavy fermion metal URu(2)Si(2) is one such example, where the order responsible for the sharp specific heat anomaly at T(0) = 17 K has remained unidentified despite more than seventeen years of effort. In URu(2)Si(2), the coexistence of large electron electron repulsion and antiferromagnetic fluctuations leads to an almost incompressible heavy electron fluid, where anisotropically paired quasiparticle states are energetically favoured. Here we develop a proposal for the nature of the hidden order in URu(2)Si(2). We show that incommensurate orbital antiferromagnetism, associated with circulating currents between the uranium ions, can account for the local fields and entropy loss observed at the 17 K transition. We make detailed predictions for the outcome of neutron scattering measurements based on this proposal, so that it can be tested experimentally."

Plasmids carrying the FEEL-1 or FEEL-2 cDNA under control of anEF-1α promoter (in the pEAK8 vector) or mock pEAK8 vector were transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) (7Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Transient expression of gene activity was tested at 48 h after the start of transfection. Stable expression of FEEL-1 or FEEL-2 cDNAs was obtained by transfecting pcDNA3-based constructs (containing the neomycin resistance gene) into parental CHO-K1 cells as described (7Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this case, 72 h after transfection, cells were passaged 1:50 into selective medium containing 0.2 mg/ml G418. Cells resistant to G418 were subcloned by limiting dilution. Expression of FEEL-1 or FEEL-2 by individual clones of cells was determined by cellular association of DiI-Ac-LDL and by measuring fluorescence intensity. Murine monoclonal antibodies were produced using either CHO cells expressing SREC (CHO-SREC) or CHO cells expressing FEEL-1 (CHO-FEEL-1) as an immunizer. Approximately 2 × 105 cells were resuspended in 200 μl of saline and injected into female BALB/c mice intraperitoneally. Two days after the final injection, the spleen was removed for fusion with P3X63-Ag8.653 cells using polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Spent media of the primary cultures were screened by cellular enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay using parental CHO-K1, CHO-SREC, or CHO-FEEL-1 cells. The isotype of the selected monoclonal antibodies was determined by IsoStrip mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the monoclonal antibodies were purified on protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Bioscience) (for anti-FEEL-1 clone FE-1-1 and FE-1-2) and ImmunoPure Plus immobilized protein L (Pierce) (for anti-SREC clone SR-4 and SR-15) column chromatography. CHO-FEEL-1 or CHO-FEEL-2 cells grown to confluency in 24-well plates were incubated with 1.25–20 μg/ml DiI-Ac-LDL at 4 °C for 2 h. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 200 μg/ml Ac-LDL and subtracted from the data. The CHO-FEEL-1 cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml DiI Ac-LDL at 4 °C for 2 h in the presence of various inhibitors at 200 μg/ml. LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was prepared as described previously (7Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). HDL was obtained from INTRACEL. Acetylation of LDL was achieved by the addition of acetic anhydride, whereas oxidation was carried out by incubating at 200 μg/ml LDL in 5 mm CuSO4 for 24 h at 37 °C according to a previously described method (7Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To quantify the amount of DiI-Ac-LDL, cells were washed twice with Ham’s F-12 medium, washed with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS, and then washed twice with PBS and solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 590/35 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 530/25 nm employing a fluorescence multiplate reader (CytoFluorII, PerSeptive Biosystems). CHO cells transiently transfected with either FEEL-1 or FEEL-2 cDNA in the pEAK8 vector were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml DiI-Ac-LDL or 30 μg/ml BioParticles® Escherichia coliBODIPY® FL conjugate or BioParticles® Staphylococcus aureus BODIPY® FL conjugate (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After solubilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, cellular association of DiI-Ac-LDL or BioParticles® fluorescent bacteria was measured by its fluorescence intensity at 530/25 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 485/20 nm (for BioParticles® fluorescent bacteria) employing a fluorescence multiple plate reader (CytoFluorII, PerSeptive Biosystems). RT-PCR analyses were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions using MTC™ cDNA panels (human I, human II, human immune, and human blood fractions, CLONTECH) or cDNAs derived from poly(A)+ RNA prepared from cultured human primary cells employing the SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). As FEEL-1-specific primers, 5′-AGCTTGCCTAGAGCTCAT-3′ and 5′-CAGCCGCTCATGGACACC-3′ were employed, and as FEEL-2-specific primers, 5′-TTTTTCCTTTCTGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-CATCCGGGCACTTGACTC-3′ were employed. The phenotypic effect of the inhibition of FEEL-1 on vascular remodeling was tested by in vitro tube formation assay using the Matrigel™ basement membrane matrix (BD Labware). HUVECs were trypsinized and counted, and then 2.5 × 104 cells were plated onto a 96-well plate with each well containing 100 μl of the Matrigel basement membrane matrix in the presence of 30 μg/ml anti-FEEL-1 monoclonal antibody, anti-SREC monoclonal antibody, or isotype control IgG1 (Sigma) and cultured for 16 h. To quantify the extent of capillary-like tube formation, photographs were taken on a Zeiss Axiovert 25 inverted phase microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera (C5810, Hamamatsu color chilled 3 CCD camera, Japan). Images were captured using Adobe PhotoShop, and areas surrounded by tube network were quantified using Image Gauge software (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To determine the contribution of SREC (7Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) to the activity of scavenger receptor in endothelial cells, the effect of monoclonal antibodies against SREC (SR-4 and SR-15) on the receptor-mediated uptake of DiI-Ac-LDL was initially examined. Although the antibodies employed significantly inhibited the uptake of DiI-Ac-LDL in CHO-SREC, only slight inhibition was observed in HUVECs (data not shown). These results suggest the presence of another scavenger receptor in endothelial cells. The expression cloning of another scavenger receptor was then conducted in the presence of monoclonal antibody against SREC. As a result, several cDNA clones were identified, and nucleotide sequencing revealed that they were all CD36 andLIMPII Analogous-1/scavengerreceptor class B type-I(CLA-1/SR-BI) cDNA (12Calvo D. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18929-18935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since CLA-1/SR-BI is also known as an HDL receptor, we examined the effect of HDL on the scavenger receptor activity in HUVECs but found no significant inhibition of the activity (data not shown). We again attempted to clone a novel scavenger receptor in the presence of both monoclonal antibodies against SREC and HDL to reduce the possibility of encountering SREC and CLA-1/SR-BI cDNA clones during expression cloning. Finally, only one pool was obtained, and we cloned a single plasmid DNA. Sequence analysis of the clone indicated that it encodes a novel type I membrane protein (2570 amino acids) (Fig. 1A) that has a unique domain structure organization. It has 7 fasciclin (Fas-1), 16 EGF-like, 2 laminin-type EGF-like, and 1 link domain near the transmembrane region (Fig. 1B). Based on these domain structures, we temporarily named it FEEL-1 (fasciclin,EGF-like-, laminin-type EGF-like, andlink domain-containing scavenger receptor-1). The data base search revealed a match with functionally uncharacterized human cDNA, KIAA0246 from KG-1 cells (GenBankTM accession number D87433) (14Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Miyajima N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and stabilin-1 cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number AJ275213) and sequence from the human genome sequencing projects, chromosome 3p21.1-9 (GenBankTMaccession number AC006208). Data base analysis also suggested the presence of a paralogous gene (15Wuilmart C. Urbain J. J. Immunogenet. (Oxf.). 1976; 3: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) of FEEL-1 (GenBankTM accession number AL133021, cDNA DKFZp434E0321). Then a full-length cDNA of this paralogous gene was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that it contained a domain organization similar to that of FEEL-1, and we named it FEEL-2 (Fig.1B). It has 7 fasciclin (Fas-1), 15 EGF-like, 2 laminin-type EGF-like, and 1 link domain near the transmembrane region (Fig.1B). The overall amino acid sequence identity of FEEL-2 with FEEL-1 is 39.8%, and 1023 amino acids are identical between FEEL-1 and FEEL-2 (Fig. 1A). The fasciclin (Fas-1) domain is originally found in fasciclin I that is expressed on subsets of axon pathways during neuronal development in the grasshopper (16Bastiani M.J. Harrelson A.L. Snow P.M. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1987; 48: 745-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and Fas-1-containing molecules such as βig-h3 and periostin (17Horiuchi K. Amizuka N. Takeshita S. Takamatsu H. Katsuura M. Ozawa H. Toyama Y. Bonewald L.F. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) have been reported to function as adhesion molecules. It was recently shown that the Fas-1 domain of the transforming growth factor-β-induced gene product, βig-h3, also contributed to corneal epithelial cell adhesion through interaction with α3β1 integrin (18Kim J.E. Kim S.J. Lee B.H. Park R.W. Kim K.S. Kim I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30907-30915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The link domain is a hyaruronan-binding region found in vertebrate proteins that are involved in the assembly of the extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and migration (19Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 15: 286-296Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The EGF-like domain includes six cysteine residues that have been shown (in EGF) to be involved in disulfide bond formation. One-half of the amino acid sequence of laminin contains consecutive repeats of about 60 amino acids that include eight conserved cysteine residues (21Abe Y. Odaka M. Inagaki F. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11150-11157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The N-terminal of this domain (laminin-type EGF-like (LE) domain) is remotely similar to that of the EGF-like domain. In addition to laminins, the domain is also found in agrin, perlecan, netrins, and the EGF receptor (21Abe Y. Odaka M. Inagaki F. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11150-11157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Rupp F. Payan D.G. Magill-Solc C. Cowan D.M. Scheller R.H.

Cell. 1994; 12: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of these EGF-like domains is still obscure, a certain EGF-like domain was shown to mediate homophilic or heterophilic protein-protein interaction. Therefore, it is conceivable that FEEL-1 can interact with various proteins through its domains. To elucidate the physiological or pathological functions of FEEL-1, it is necessary to identify and characterize the proteins that interact with FEEL-1. As for the intracellular domain, it should be mentioned here that intracellular amino acid sequences, namely NPVF and NPLY, found in FEEL-1 and FEEL-2, respectively, serve as an endocytosis signal of DiI-Ac-LDL. The role of these motifs in the endocytosis of DiI-Ac-LDL will be reported elsewhere. After the screening of the human spleen cDNA library, an alternatively spliced variant that encodes the soluble form of FEEL-1 was cloned, and its exon and intron junction were determined by comparison with genomic DNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AC006208). Whether this alternatively spliced form of FEEL-1 is expressed in tissues is not yet known. However, it is conceivable that such a receptor in soluble form modulates the pathophysiological function of FEEL-1 by competing with the ligands (25Schleiffenbaum B. Spertini O. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 26Gentz R. Hayes A. Grau N. Fountoulakis M. Lahm H-W. Ozmen L. Garotta G. Eur. J.

The binding of DiI-Ac-LDL was assessed following incubation of the CHO-FEEL-1 or CHO-FEEL-2 cells with DiI-Ac-LDL. Saturation binding of DiI-Ac-LDL was observed at 4 °C (Fig.2A). Scatchard analysis (Fig.2A, insets) showed the presence of a single class of receptors, and the calculated Kd was 6.9 and 6.6 μg/ml DiI-Ac-LDL for FEEL-1 and FEEL-2, respectively (∼13 nm DiI-Ac-LDL), which is comparable with the value for scavenger receptors on HUVECs (29van Hinsbergh V.W. Havekes L. Emeis J.J. van Corven E. Scheffer M. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 547-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted here that the binding activity of the FEEL-1-expressing cell was rather low when compared with that of FEEL-2 expressing cells. It seems that overexpression of FEEL-1 is not favorable to the isolation of stable transformants of FEEL-1 in CHO cells. To determine the contribution of FEEL-1 to the cellular association of DiI-Ac-LDL with endothelial cells (HUVECs), the effect of monoclonal antibodies against FEEL-1 was examined. Specificity of the antibodies employed (FE-1-1 and FE-1-2) was confirmed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, the FE-1-1 monoclonal antibody recognized an ∼250-kDa band corresponding to the expected molecular mass of FEEL-1 in CHO-FEEL-1 cells but not in control CHO cells. The same result was obtained by using the FE-1-2 monoclonal antibody (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2C, both antibodies significantly inhibited the association of DiI-Ac-LDL to CHO-FEEL-1. Treatment of HUVECs with the antibodies also caused a significant reduction in the degree of DiI-Ac-LDL association. These results suggest that FEEL-1 is one of the major receptors of DiI-Ac-LDL in HUVECs. To further characterize the binding properties of the FEEL-1, the receptor activity was measured in the presence of various materials known as type I and type II macrophage scavenger receptor inhibitors (Fig. 3). As in the case of macrophage scavenger receptor and SREC examined for comparison, unlabeled Ac-LDL as well as dextran sulfate, but not native lipoproteins such as LDL and HDL, reduced the binding of DiI-Ac-LDL on the cells to the basal level. Ox-LDL partially reduced the binding of DiI-Ac-LDL on the cells. These results show that the FEEL-1 has a binding specificity similar to those of the scavenger receptors expressed in HUVECs. RT-PCR analysis employing specific sets of primers revealed that the expressions of FEEL-1 and FEEL-2 in human tissues were rather restricted, and high expression levels were observed in the spleen and lymph node. On the other hand, only FEEL-1 was expressed in mononuclear cells, particularly CD14+ cells (monocytes) (Fig.4A). Moreover, FEEL-1 is also expressed in endothelial cells such as HUVECs, human coronary arterial endothelial cells, and human brain microvascular endothelial cells, but no expression of FEEL-2 was detected in the endothelial cells tested (Fig. 4B). Since some scavenger receptors that are expressed in endothelial cells and macrophages are known to bind to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and play a role in host defense and immune response following bacterial infection (30Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 24l: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 31Shimaoka T. Kume N. Minami M. Hayashida K. Sawamura T. Kita T. Yonehara S. J. Immunol. 2001; 15: 5108-5114Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we examined the interaction of bacterial particles with FEELs expressed in CHO cells. As shown in Fig.5A, a fluorescence photomicrograph clearly indicated that both FEELs could bind to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Quantitative analysis (Fig.5B) confirmed the binding of bacteria to both FEELs. To confirm the direct interaction between FEEL-1 and bacteria, the effect of the FE-1-1 antibody was examined, and we found that the addition of the antibody caused a decrease in the binding of S. aureusto the CHO cells that were transiently expressing FEEL-1. These results suggested that they might play a role in the defense against bacterial infection. In this context, FEEL-1 expressed in monocytes may play a role in the antibacterial activity of the cells. The presence of Fas-1 domains in FEELs reminded us of the interaction of the receptor with some molecules in the extracellular matrix. Therefore, we examined the phenotypic effect of the inhibition of FEEL-1 on in vitro vascular remodeling using the Matrigel tube formation assay. HUVECs were plated onto a 96-well plate with each well containing 100 μl of Matrigel in the presence of either the anti-FEEL-1 monoclonal antibody (FE-1-1) or the isotype control IgG1 and cultured for 16 h. As shown in Fig.6A, Western blot analysis indicated that the antibody employed (FE-1-1) recognized one protein band prepared from HUVECs. Phase-contrast photomicrographs showing capillary formation on a Matrigel basement membrane matrix indicated a marked reduction in the degree of cell-cell interaction in anti-FEEL-1 monoclonal antibody-treated cultures (Fig. 6B), and the quantified area surrounded by capillary-like tube structures of anti-FEEL-1 monoclonal antibody-treated cultures was larger than isotype control IgG1-treated cultures (Fig. 6C), indicating that the antibody facilitate the in vitro angiogenesis. We also examined the effect of the anti-SREC monoclonal antibody (SR-4), which was shown to inhibit the SREC-mediated DiI-Ac-LDL uptake, on the tube formation, but no effect was detected (Fig. 6B). Since this Matrigel basement membrane matrix tube formation assay has been used to demonstrate the roles of various growth factors, its receptors, and adhesion molecules such as various integrins in angiogenesisin vitro (32Kubota Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Lawley T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), it is possible that FEEL-1 can modulate the tube formation by interaction with these factors. Further studies are required to elucidate the contribution of FEEL-1 in capillary-like tube formation. In summary, we cloned and characterized for the first time the novel scavenger receptors, human FEEL-1 and FEEL-2. Since several investigators reported that the stimulation of scavenger receptors in endothelial cells induces the expression of proteins related to vascular functions (33Boulanger C.M. Tanner F.C. Bea M.L. Hahn A.W. Werner A. Luscher T.F. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S., Lu, P. Marcel Y.L.

Med. 2001; 7: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), determination of the physiological ligand for FEELs will provide a new insight into the pathological function of scavenger receptors. As mentioned in the text, FEEL-1 is identical with stabilin-1 first identified as MS-1 antigen (35Goerdt S. Walsh L.J. Murphy G.F. Pober J.S. J. Cell.

It was reported that the antigen is a specific marker of alternatively activated macrophages with increased angiogenic potential (37Kodelja V. Muller C. Tenorio S. Schebesch C. Orfanos C.E. Goerdt S.

Using live cell imaging and two photon microscopy, we report that overexpression of CyPD desensitizes HEK293 and rat glioma C6 cells to apoptotic stimuli.

Finally, in glutathioneS-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, we demonstrate that CyPD binding to the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), which is considered to be the core component of the mPTP, is not affected by the loss of PPIase activity.

Pharmacotherapy. 1991; 11: 142S-148SPubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are thought to be important for protein folding (18Gothel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol.

Acta. 1997; 1351: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although its specific physiological function remains largely unknown, CyPD is considered critical for the opening of the mPTP (20Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Qian T. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Cascio W.E. Trost L.C. Nishimura Y. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), blocks the mPTP at concentrations similar to those needed to inhibit the enzymatic activity of CyPD. This suggested that the PPIase activity was a necessary step in the opening of the mPTP (22Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 23McGuinness O. Yafei N. Costi A. Crompton M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cyclophilins bind CsA via a conserved hydrophobic pocket, which is critical for PPIase activity (24Kallen J. Spitzfaden C. Zurini M.G. Wider G. Widmer H. Wuthrich K. Walkinshaw M.D. Nature. 1991; 353: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Ke H. Mayrose D. Cao W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1993; 361: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, early models of CsA inhibition of the permeability transition suggested that CsA acted as a pseudo-substrate of CyPD that prevented it from interacting with the mPTP. However, the addition of CsA was shown not to disrupt the binding of CyPD and ANT (27Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In addition, Scorranoet al. (28Scorrano L. Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported that CsA inhibited mPTP opening, whereas diethylpyrocarbonate (DPC) induced mPTP opening. Because both CsA and DPC inhibit PPIase activity, the authors argued that CyPD must regulate the mPTP independently of this enzymatic activity. In this manuscript, we examine the role of CyPD in the regulation of cell death. Overexpression of CyPD was used to ascertain its physiological function in response to oxidative stress and staurosporin-induced cell death. Two-photon imaging was employed to reduce photo-bleaching of fluorophores and photo-toxicity in live cells, which was important for the prolonged imaging periods in our experiments. The collapse of ΔΨ and the loss of membrane integrity were monitored to assess the initiation of cell death (29Lemasters J.J. Nieminen A.L. Qian T. Trost L.C. Elmore S.P. Nishimura Y. Crowe R.A. Cascio W.E. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Herman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 30Huser J. Blatter L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In contrast to the current view of CyPD acting as a key accessory protein that sensitizes the mPTP to opening, we demonstrate that overexpression of CyPD delays both the onset of ΔΨ collapse under oxidative stress and the loss of membrane integrity induced by staurosporin. The protective effect of CyPD was dependent on its PPIase activity as demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, under resting conditions, the ΔΨ was significantly higher in cells overexpressing CyPD. Taken together, these data suggest that CyPD is an important factor with functional consequences in the regulation of programmed cell death. The coding fragment of rat CyPD cDNA (gift of Dr. Halestrap, University of Bristol, UK) was amplified using a forward primer, 5′-cgggatccatgctagctctgcgctgcgg-3′, containing a BamHI site and a reverse primer, 5′-agtctctagaggctgtgacttagctcaactg-3′, containing an XbaI site. The PCR product was subcloned into theXenopus expression vector pGEM-HNb between theBamHI and XbaI sites (31John L.M. Mosquera-Caro M. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The CyPD coding region was subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) between the BamHI and XbaI sites. All restriction enzymes are from Life Technologies (Rockville, MD). CyPD R96G and H167Q mutants were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using plasmid pGEM-HNb-CyPD as template. The forward primer for the R96G mutant was 5′-ccttccacggggtcatcccagccttcatgtgcc-3′ and the reverse complement primer was 5′-ggcacatgaaggctgggatgaccccgtggaagg-3′. The forward primer for the H167Q was 5′-ggctggatggcaagcaagttgtgtttggccatg-3′ and the reverse complement primer was 5′-catggccaaacacaacttgcttgccatccagcc-3′. Both mutants were subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo(+) between the BamHI and XbaI sites. To generate the GST-CyPD fusion vector, the CyPD fragment was subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) betweenBamHI and NotI sites from pGEM-HNb-CyPD vector. The CyPD-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) fusion fragment was engineered by a two-stage fusion PCR strategy. First, full-length coding regions of CyPD and EYFP were amplified in two separate reactions. The 3′ primer for CyPD had 21 bp of the 5′ of EYFP, and the 5′ primer for EYFP contained 20 bp of the 3′ of CyPD. These complementary sequences were annealed in the second PCR stage to generate the CyPD plus EYFP fusion fragment. The CyPD stop codon was removed from the PCR primers. A BamHI site was attached to the forward primer of CyPD, and an XbaI site was added to the reverse primer of EYFP. The fusion PCR fragment was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo(+) between BamHI and XbaI sites. The CyPD and EYFP bicistronic expression vector was generated by digesting pGEM-HNb-CyPD vector with SmaI and NotI. The CyPD fragment was subsequently subcloned into pIRES-EYFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) betweenEcoRV and NotI sites. The rat ANT1 cDNA (gift of Dr. Y. Shinohara, University of Tokushima, Japan) was subcloned into the pGEM-HNb vector by PCR with a forward primer, 5′-actgcccgggatgggggatcaggctttgagc-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-cggaattcttacacatattttttgatctcatcatac-3′. An SmaI site was attached to the 5′-end of the forward primer, and anEcoRI site was attached to the 5′-end of the reverse primer. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pGEM-HNb betweenSmaI and EcoRI sites. All vectors were automatically sequenced by the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio sequencing core facility to demonstrate correct engineering. The oligonucleotides used were purchased from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 200 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Cells were subcultured 1:10 by incubating in 0.05% Trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) for 5 min when they were 70% confluent. DNA was transfected into cells by LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After 72 h of transfection, HEK293 cells were trypsinized and transferred from a six-well dish to a 100-mm dish with medium containing 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Surviving cells were grown for 2–3 weeks, and symmetrical colonies were marked under a microscope. A grease boundary was drawn around marked colonies. A solution of 5 μl of 0.05% Trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA was briefly applied to the colony, and the cell suspension was transferred to 96-well plates. 24 colonies were picked for each construct to examine their protein expression level. Cells transiently expressing CyPD-EYFP were transferred to a 35-mm dish with a coverslip bottom 24 h after transfection and allowed to re-attach for another 24 h. Five minutes prior to imaging, the growth medium was replaced with recording buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 50 nm tetramethyl rhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at room temperature. Fluorescent images were acquired using an Olympus Fluoview 300 confocal microscope with a 40× oil objective (numerical aperture (N.A.) = 1.35) at zoom 5. CyPD-EYFP was excited at 488 nm and fluorescence was detected between 510 and 550 nm. TMRE was excited at 568 nm, and fluorescence was detected beyond a 585-nm long pass barrier filter. A Focht Chamber System 2 (FCS2, Bioptechs Inc., Butler, PA) was used for time-lapse two-photon imaging. Cells were transferred to the FCS2 coverslips 24 h prior to each experiment and maintained in the cell culture incubator. The chamber system was subsequently assembled and mounted on an Olympus Fluoview 300 confocal microscope customized for two-photon excitation and external photo-multiplier detection. Chamber temperature was maintained at 37 °C during imaging, and cells were constantly perfused with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm l-glutamine, 200 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 nmTMRE, and 100 μmtert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) at 15 ml/h. TMRE was excited at 820 nm using a Ti-sapphire Coherent Mira 900 laser pumped with a 5-watt Verdi laser (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Laser intensity was attenuated with a neutral-density filter wheel such that no significant photo-bleaching of TMRE was observed during a 24-h recording period. Signal was collected through an Olympus 60× oil objective (N.A. = 1.4) at zoom 1. For CyPD and EYFP bicistronic expression, the FCS2 chamber was mounted on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope adapted for two-photon imaging. EYFP was excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected through a 505- to 550-nm band pass barrier filter. PI was excited at 543 nm and emission was collected through a 560-nm long pass filter. TMRE was excited at 820 nm, and emission was collected through a 565- to 615-nm barrier filter. Confocal and two-photon imaging was performed in two tracks alternating in the line-by-line mode. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were collected simultaneously with either the PI or TMRE track. Signal was collected through a Zeiss 63× oil objective (N.A. = 1.4) at zoom 1. Once an EYFP-positive cell was identified, 488-nm excitation was turned off, and only the TMRE/PI and DIC signals were acquired in the single-track setting. Image analysis was performed using the public domain program ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) and the software ANALYZE (Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN). PPIase activity was estimated according to Kofron et al. (32Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colon-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST-CyPD or GST (10 nm final concentration) was pre-equilibrated with buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Immediately before assaying activity, chymotrypsin (60 mg/ml in 1 mm HCl, final concentration 6 mg/ml, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added. The PPIase substrate I (Calbiochem) was dissolved in the solvent trifluoroethanol with LiCl (470 mm) to a 3 mm stock concentration. The PPIase substrate I was added to the reaction to give a final concentration of 75 nm. Absorption at 380 nm was measured in a BioSpec-1601 Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). Reactions with no PPIase were used as background controls. Western blot procedures were essentially performed as previously described (33John L.M. Lechleiter J.D. Camacho P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, cells were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μm pepstatin A, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.2 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 900 × gfor 5 min to separate the nuclei. The concentration of total protein was determined by the BCA assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For SDS-PAGE, 10 μg of total protein was loaded per lane. CyPD was detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-CyPD antibody (Pocono Rabbit Farm & Laboratory, Inc., Canadensis, PA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) was used and visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Goat polyclonal anti-actin antibody sc-1615 and donkey anti-goat IgG sc-2304 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used to show the equal loading of proteins. BL21(DE3) bacteria transformed with pGEX-4T-2-CyPD construct were grown until a 0.6 OD at 600 nm was reached. Isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce GST-CyPD expression for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested and lysed by sonication in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm EDTA. Bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 22,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. Binding of GST or GST fusion protein to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was performed at 4 °C for 1 h followed by three washes with equilibration buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm EDTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Elution of bound protein was performed in equilibration buffer with 15 mm glutathione. Preparation of synthetic mRNAs and in vitro translations were performed as previously described (34Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Cell. 1995; 82: 765-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,35Roderick H.L. Lechleiter J.D. Camacho P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1235-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, mRNAs were diluted to 0.1 μg/μl and translated for 45 min in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) supplemented withl-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Binding of in vitro translated ANT1 to GST-CyPD fusion proteins was performed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, at room temperature for 1 h, followed by three washes in equilibration buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. Proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. CyPD is thought to be an accessory protein that controls the opening of the mPTP in response to apoptosis-inducing factors (36Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Because CsA is known to bind CyPD and, thereby, reduce the probability of mPTP opening, we hypothesized that overexpression of CyPD would increase sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress. Our approach to test this hypothesis was 2-fold. First, we tested whether cells overexpressing CyPD exhibited the correct targeting of this protein to the mitochondria. For this purpose, we created a fusion protein consisting of CyPD tagged with EYFP at its COOH-terminal and then transiently transfected this construct into HEK293 cells. A cell expressing CyPD-EYFP is presented in Fig.1A. When cells expressing this fusion protein were also labeled with the mitochondrial marker TMRE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), we found that CyPD-EYFP was correctly targeted to the mitochondria (Fig. 1A). The second step in our experimental design was to create stable cell lines overexpressing wild type CyPD (non-tagged). A Western blot analysis of CyPD expression in one of these cells lines is presented in Fig. 1B. The physiological effects of CyPD overexpression were tested in this stable cell line and compared with a control cell line, expressing vector alone. Oxidative stress was induced by exposure to t-BuOOH and measured by monitoring the ΔΨ (37Nieminen A.L. Byrne A.M. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1286-C1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded on glass coverslips and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Plated cells were initially labeled with TMRE (50 nm) in a culture incubator for 5 min. The glass coverslip was then sealed in a closed perfusion chamber, and the cells were imaged on a two-photon confocal microscope for 12 h. Two-photon imaging was used to simultaneously excite the membrane potential indicator TMRE and to produce a DIC image. An overlay of both the DIC image and the TMRE-labeled mitochondria is presented in Fig. 1C. Throughout the course of the experiment, a complete z section (six images in 1-μm steps) of the cells was taken every 5 min. The cells were then monitored for ΔΨ collapse, which was measured by the loss of TMRE fluorescence. Simultaneous imaging with DIC optics insured that a loss of fluorescence was not due to a change in the focal plane or to the loss of the cell. Spatial-temporal stacks were created with only a single image from each z section (Fig. 1D). The chosen image from each z section was selected on the basis of brightest TMRE fluorescence, which generally coincided with the middle image. These data reveal that cells overexpressing CyPD maintain their mitochondrial membrane potentials in the presence of t-BuOOH for significantly longer periods of time compared with cells expressing vector alone (p < 0.0005, t test). A histogram of the average time of ΔΨ collapse is presented in Fig. 1E. The average time until the ΔΨ collapsed for CyPD-overexpressing cells was 9.9 ± 0.3 h (n = 69 cells, pooled from four separate experiments). The average time until ΔΨ collapsed was 6.2 ± 0.1 h in control cells expressing vector alone (n = 85 cells, pooled from five separate experiments). We conclude from these data that overexpression of CyPD significantly prolongs the time until ΔΨ collapses. Thus, rather than sensitizing cells to oxidative stress, CyPD appears to significantly protect the cells. CsA is a well-established inhibitor of mPTP opening (38Bernardi P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Because the action of CsA on mPTP is thought to be mediated by CsA binding to CyPD, we examined how CsA exposure affected the collapse of ΔΨ in response to oxidative stress. HEK293 cells were plated on glass coverslips, labeled with TMRE, sealed in the perfusion chamber, and imaged as described above. In addition, cells were pre-treated with CsA (10 μm) for 30 min and then continuously perfused with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing CsA (10 μm), TMRE (50 nm), and t-BuOOH (100 μm). Under these experimental conditions, we found that the average time for ΔΨ to collapse in CsA treated cells was 20.5 ± 0.1 h (n = 52 cells, pooled from two experiments) (Fig. 2). In comparison, the average time to ΔΨ collapse in control cells (vehicle only) exposed to t-BuOOH was 6.2 ± 0.1 (n = 54, pooled from two experiments). Because it is known that CsA also has non-mitochondrial targets that can affect cell viability (39Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar), we also tested how the immunosuppressant FK506 affected the collapse of ΔΨ in response to oxidative stress. FK506 is an immunosuppressant that, like CsA, prevents activation of calcineurin. However, FK506 has no effect on mitochondria (40Kay J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Pre-treatment of cells with FK506 (1 μm, 30 min) had no protective effect on the collapse of ΔΨ in cells exposed to t-BuOOH (Fig. 2). The average time to ΔΨ collapse was 6.0 ± 0.1 h (n = 58 cells, pooled from two experiments). We conclude from these data that CsA inhibits the collapse of ΔΨ when cells are exposed to oxidative stress. However, the effects of CsA are unlikely to be mediated by calcineurin inhibition, because treatment of cells with FK506 did not affect the collapse of ΔΨ. To determine whether the protective effect of CyPD on ΔΨ collapse was dependent on the cell-type, we re-examined the effects of CyPD overexpression in another cell line. Rat C6 glioma cells were transiently transfected with a bicistronic vector for independent expression of CyPD and EYFP (see “Materials and Methods”). Cells were allowed to express the proteins for 48 h, and positively transfected cells were identified by EYFP fluorescence (Fig. 3A, left panels). Plated cells were then labeled with TMRE, treated with t-BuOOH, and imaged as described above. Consistent with our findings in the HEK293 cells, we found that C6 glioma cells overexpressing CyPD maintained their ΔΨ for significantly longer periods than non-transfected cells when exposed to t-BuOOH (Fig. 3A, upper panels). C6 glioma cells transfected with the bicistronic vector containing EYFP alone exhibited no significant difference from control, non-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, lower panels). The average time until the ΔΨ collapsed in the presence of t-BuOOH was 2.2 ± 0.1 h in control, non-transfected cells (n = 10 experiments); 3.5 ± 0.2 h in CyPD and EYFP expressing cells (n = 5 experiments) and 2.2 ± 0.1 h for EYFP alone expressing cells (n = 5 experiments) (Fig. 3B). We conclude from these data that, under oxidative stress, overexpression of CyPD prolongs the time until ΔΨ collapses in both HEK293 and rat C6 glioma cells, suggesting that it might be a generalized mechanism operating in many cell types. To determine whether CyPD protects cells against other apoptotic stimuli, the effects of CyPD overexpression were examined in staurosporin-treated cells. To induce cell death, rat C6 glioma cells were treated with 1 μm staurosporin for 6 h. Apoptosis was confirmed by staining the cells with Annexin V-FITC (Molecular Probes), which detects phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Phosphatidylserine flips to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane preceding the loss of membrane integrity and is an early indication of apoptosis (41van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Co-staining with propidium iodide (PI, Molecular Probes) identified those cells with compromised plasma membrane integrity and that had progressed through apoptosis (Fig. 4A). These data demonstrate that staurosporin induces apoptosis in these cells. To test whether CyPD confers protection under these conditions, rat C6 glioma cells were transiently transfected with the bicistronic vector for independent expression of CyPD and EYFP. Plated cells were treated with staurosporin in the presence of PI and imaged as described above following 48 h of expression. Positively transf"
https://openalex.org/W1998411300,"Abstract Despite the importance of the stress-activated protein kinase pathways in cell death and survival, it is unclear how stressful stimuli lead to their activation. In the case of heat shock, the existence of a specific mechanism of activation has been evidenced, but the molecular nature of this pathway is undefined. Here, we found that Ask1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), an upstream activator of the stress-activated protein kinase p38 during exposure to oxidative stress and other stressful stimuli, was also activated by heat shock. Ask1 activity was required for p38 activation since overexpression of a kinase dead mutant of Ask1, Ask1(K709M), inhibited heat shock-induced p38 activation. The activation of Ask1 by oxidative stress involves the oxidation of thioredoxin, an endogenous inhibitor of Ask1. A different activation mechanism takes place during heat shock. In contrast to p38 induction by H2O2, induction by heat shock was not antagonized by pretreatment with the antioxidantN-acetyl-l-cysteine or by overexpressing thioredoxin and was not accompanied by the dissociation of thioredoxin from Ask1. Instead, heat shock caused the dissociation of glutathioneS-transferase Mu1-1 (GSTM1-1) from Ask1 and overexpression of GSTM1-1-inhibited induction of p38 by heat shock. We concluded that because of an alternative regulation by the two distinct repressors thioredoxin and GSTM1-1, Ask1 constitutes the converging point of the heat shock and oxidative stress-sensing pathways that lead to p38 activation."

Clinically, the disease progresses through distinct phases referred to as chronic or stable, accelerated, and blast. The chronic or stable phase of the disease is characterized by excess numbers of myeloid cells that differentiate normally. Within an average of 4–6 years, the disease transforms through an “accelerated phase” to an invariably fatal acute leukemia, also known as blast crisis. Disease progression is likely due to the accumulation of molecular abnormalities that lead to a progressive loss of the capacity for terminal differentiation of the leukemic clone (1Faderl S.

Med. 1999; 340: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). A variety of experimental evidence has established Bcr-Abl, the product of the (9:22) translocation that produces the Philadelphia chromosome as the causative agent of chronic myelogenous leukemia (3Daley G.Q.

Nature. 1990; 344: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The critical role of this constitutively activated tyrosine kinase in the survival of the leukemic clone has been validated by the development and significant clinical activity of STI571, a specific inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (5Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar). Clinical studies with STI571 have demonstrated a durable response in patients in the chronic phase of the disease, whereas most responding patients in blast phase relapse despite continued therapy (6Druker B.J.

Recent investigations suggest that one of the most common mechanisms of relapse is a mutation of amino acid 315 of the Abl kinase domain, a predicted site of contact between an STI571-related compound and the ATP binding site of the Abl kinase (8Gorre M.E.

However, additional study centers have reported that kinase domain mutations may occur at additional sites (10Hochhaus A. Kreil S. Corbin A., La Rosee P. Lahaye T. Berger U. Cross N.C. Linkesch W.

To examine a broader spectrum of sites of mutation that might be observed in clinical materials, we have generated numerous mutations in the Abl kinase domain based on three models of STI571 bound to the Abl kinase domain and assessed these mutant kinases for sensitivity to STI571. The Abl kinase domain consisting of c-Abl amino acids 220–498 was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGEX KG (Amersham Biosciences). A hemagglutinin (12CA5) antibody recognition tag was inserted at the 5′ end of the Abl kinase domain sequence both as an Abl phosphorylation site and for detection of protein expression. All mutations within the kinase domain were constructed using polymerase chain reaction amplification of the Abl kinase pGEX KG plasmid with primers containing appropriate point mutations. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)1 fusion proteins of the Abl kinase domain mutations as well as wild type Abl kinase were generated by inducing exponentially growing transformed DH5α bacteria with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d. The cells were lysed via sonication in MT phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNa2H2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. The GST-Abl kinase mutants were purified from the lysate by binding to glutathione-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed twice with 0.5 m LiCl, thrice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and once with Abl kinase wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2). Bound protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. All Abl kinase proteins and mutations were expressed and purified in this manner. 500 ng of bound protein was used in each kinase reaction. Kinase reactions were performed in 30 μl of Abl kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μm sodium vanadate, 1 μm dithiothreitol, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)). STI571 was dissolved in 3% Me2SO prior to addition to the kinase reaction. The Abl kinase mutations were incubated with concentrations of STI571 ranging from 0 to 1 μm for 10 min, after which 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (111 nm total ATP) was added and the kinase reaction allowed to proceed for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS loading dye, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Abl autophosphorylation signal intensity was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Protein preparation and kinase assay conditions were the same as described for the IC50 determination in the absence of STI571. ATP was added to final concentrations ranging from 20 to 100 nm, and the kinase reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min. As indicated by time-course analysis of wild type Abl (data not shown) the reaction rate of the kinase is linear for reaction times <60 min; therefore, 32P incorporation over a 30-min period of time is proportional to the initial rate of reaction. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above, and signal intensity was quantitated. The ATP concentrations resulting in 50% maximum signal ([ATP]50% maximum signal) for wild type Abl and each of the mutations that showed a change in STI571 sensitivity were determined from the slope and y-intercept of double reciprocal plots of 1/[ATP] versus 1/signal. ATP affinities were determined from the average of four experimental repeats. As the graphs to determine kinetic parameters represent several experiments and signal intensity cannot be easily converted into molar 32P incorporation or normalized between separate gels, absolute Vmax values cannot be reported in the context of this assay. Instead, relativeVmax values of wild type Abl and the mutants were determined by comparing the relative signal intensity of the proteins at 100 nm ATP. RelativeVmax values were calculated using the average ATP affinities in the following equation: Vmax = signal[ATP] = 100 nm(([ATP]50% maximum signal/[ATP]) + 1) with the values reported relative to wild type Abl = 1.0. Gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) for 4 h at 0.45 A. The membrane was blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TBS (10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) at 25 °C for 1 h. The GST-Abl kinase domain mutations were detected by incubation overnight with an anti-Abl kinase domain antibody, Ab-2 (Santa Cruz) at 2 μg/ml in TBST (TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20). Antibody interaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence with a lumi-imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Identical procedures were used for all immunoblots unless specified. Co-crytallization of the Abl kinase domain with an STI571-related 2-phenylaminopyrimidine Abl-specific inhibitor identified a number of amino acid residues within the ATP binding pocket predicted to contact the inhibitor (Fig.1A) (9Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). The potential STI571 contact points are illustrated in Fig. 1B. They include hydrogen bonds with Thr-315, Met-290, Glu-286, Lys-271, and the peptide backbone at Asp-381 and Met-318, as well as hydrophobic interactions with Ile-313, Phe-382, Val-256, Tyr-253, and Leu-370. Mutations were generated to eliminate the potential for hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions between Abl and STI571 (Table I). To determine the necessity of the wild type residue to STI571 function, we analyzed mutations that would remove the potential functionality of the original amino acid side chain. Some of the mutations require single amino acid substitutions that might be observed in patients. Additional mutations require two nucleotide changes and therefore may not represent likely amino acid substitutions to be seen in patient material. From this information we could speculate about the likelihood that the site would be a target for resistance. As Met-318 and Asp-381 are predicted to form hydrogen bonds with STI571 via the peptide backbone, mutations at these sites would not be informative. The relative IC50 values of the mutations at fixed ATP concentrations are summarized in Table I. Consistent with previous reports, the IC50 value for wild type Abl kinase was 0.025 μm in this assay (Fig.2A). K271R was previously reported as a kinase-inactive mutation. Additionally, E286L, M290A, and I313G were kinase-inactive suggesting that many sites involved in STI571 binding are also critical for ATP binding and kinase activity. Mutation of L370G did not change the sensitivity to STI571. In contrast, both T315V and T315I demonstrated a decreased sensitivity to STI571. The IC50 value of the T315V mutation averaged to 0.30 μm, ∼10-fold higher than that of wild type Abl kinase (Fig. 2B), whereas T315I showed no significant inhibition at STI571 concentrations 200-fold higher than the IC50 value of wild type Abl kinase. The decreased sensitivity of these mutations to STI571 is consistent with the crystal structure predictions that illustrate a critical hydrogen bond between the secondary amino group of the inhibitor and the T315 side chain.Table IIC50 values of Abi mutants based on the crystal structurePotential contact sitesMutationsSensitivity to STI571ATP affinity: [ATP]50% maximum signalRelativeVmaxWTIC50= 0.025 μm62 nm1.00Tyr-253PheIC50 = 1.8 μm115 nm1.01Val-256GluKinase-inactiveLys-271ArgKinase-inactiveGlu-286LeuKinase-inactiveMet-290AlaKinase-inactiveIle-313GluKinase-inactiveThr-315ValIC50= 0.30 μm38 nm0.28IleIC50 > 5.0 μm37 nm0.61Leu-370GlySame as WT Open table in a new tab FIG. 2IC50 values of wild type Abl kinase and the T315V mutation.A, kinase assays performed in duplicate produced an IC50 value of 0.025 μm for STI571 binding to wild type Abl.

Equal protein loading is demonstrated by anti-Abl immunoblots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the residues analyzed are within the ATP binding pocket of the enzyme, the kinetic parameters for ATP binding were determined in the absence of STI571 to examine the effects of these mutations on ATP binding and the overall function of the Abl kinase. ATP affinity was determined for wild type Abl and each of the mutations that demonstrated a decreased sensitivity to STI571 (Fig.3A). RelativeVmax values were also determined (Fig.3B). Because gel-based assays that measure signal intensity rather than molar phosphate incorporation were used in this kinetic analysis, relative Vmax values of the mutations and not absolute Vmax values are reported here. ATP affinities and relative Vmax values are summarized in Table I. Both the T315V and T315I mutations demonstrate a 2-fold increase in their ATP affinities relative to wild type, suggesting that these mutations may not only eliminate a critical hydrogen bond with STI571 but also increase the affinity of ATP binding relative to STI571, contributing to resistance. TheVmax values of both Thr-315 mutations are lower than the wild type enzyme, with T315V retaining only 28% of its kinase activity and the T315I mutation retaining 61% of its kinase activity. Regardless of a decrease in kinase activity, the significant decrease in sensitivity of mutations at Thr-315 to STI571 make this residue a likely target for clinical resistance, consistent with a mutation seen in resistant patients (8Gorre M.E.

Additionally, the Y253F mutation showed a decreased sensitivity to STI571 with an IC50 value of 1.8 μm, 72-fold higher than wild type Abl kinase. This result is also consistent with the crystal structure that predicts Tyr-253 to be a critical STI571 contact point. The Y253F mutation demonstrated an identicalVmax value to wild type; however, it showed a 2-fold decrease in ATP affinity, suggesting that this residue functions in ATP binding as well as STI571 binding. The huge increase in the IC50 value of this mutation, therefore, suggests a decrease in the binding affinity for STI571, making it also a likely candidate for clinical resistance as seen in patient samples (11Hochhaus A. Kreil S. Muller M.C. Lahaye T. La Rosee P. Corbin A.S. Schoch C. Cross N.C.P. Berger U. Rieder H. Druker B.J. Gschaidmeier H. Hehlmann R. American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting.

Prior to the availability of the crystal structure of Abl, the published crystal structures of other kinase domains were used to generate computer models of STI571 binding to Abl. We generated numerous Abl kinase domain mutations based on amino acid residues that were identified as potential contact points of STI571 in these models. Following the publication of the Abl crystal structure, the mutation data were analyzed to determine whether their activity could be fit to the published Abl kinase domain structure. A computer model of Abl based on the crystal structure of the Src family member Lck was initially analyzed (12Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Mutations of the predicted contact points from the Lck-based model were made to the corresponding residues in either Src or Fms. The rationale for the selected substitutions was that mutation of sites in Abl to the homologous residues in Src or Fms could confer upon Abl the STI571 insensitivity of the other kinases, thereby explaining the high selectivity of the inhibitor for Abl. The IC50 values of the mutations are summarized in Table II. The majority were either kinase-inactive or displayed no change in STI571 sensitivity. These results support predictions from the crystal structure that suggests that topological differences rather than amino acid sequence differences in the ATP binding pockets of the Abl kinase and the Src family kinases are responsible for the specificity of STI571. Interestingly, mutation of A380T raised the IC50for STI571 binding 10-fold over that of wild type Abl kinase. A kinetic analysis of the A380T mutation shows a 2-fold decrease in theVmax relative to wild type Abl and little change in the ATP affinity (Table II). This suggests that the decrease in sensitivity to STI571 is due to a decreased affinity for the inhibitor with little effect on ATP binding. Although this residue is not a predicted contact point in the Schindler et al. model (9Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar) the adjacent residue Asp-381 forms a critical hydrogen bond with STI571. Because the mutation of Ala-380 to the smaller glycine did not alter the sensitivity to STI571 (data not shown), it is likely that a slightly larger residue either introduces steric effects or small conformational changes in the binding surface accounting for the decreased sensitivity. An alternative explanation for the decreased sensitivity of the A380T mutation is that Ala-380 makes van der Waals interactions with Phe-382, another residue that directly contacts STI571. Thus, the A380T mutation would be predicted to alter the conformation of the ATP binding pocket by disrupting this interaction. Regardless, all of the predictions from the Lck kinase can be explained by the Abl crystal structure.Table IIIC50 values of Abl mutants based an Lck computer model of inhibitor bindingPotential contact sitesMutationsSensitivity to STI571ATP affinity: [ATP]50% maximum signalRelativeVmaxWTIC50= 0.025 μm62 nM1.00Leu-248AlaKinase-inactiveTyr-320LysSame as WTAsn-322SerSame as WTGlu-373AsnSame as WTHis-375LeuKinase-inactiveAla-380CysSame as WTThrIC50 = 0.34 μm59 nM0.48LeuKinase-inactive Open table in a new tab A third model of STI571 binding to the Abl kinase was extrapolated from computer modeling of the structure of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) (Fig. 4A) (13Mohammadi M. McMahon G. Sun L. Tang C. Hirth P. Yeh B.K. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). In this model STI571 binds to the active form of Abl kinase in reverse orientation relative to that seen in the Schindler et al.model (9Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Despite this, several of the predicted contact points are similar to those predicted from the crystal structure (Fig.4B), including Val-256 and Leu-370. However, several new potential contact points are identified including Glu-258, Met-318, and Leu-248 (Fig. 4B). Mutations of these residues were examined for their sensitivity to STI571 and summarized in Table III. As with many of the previous mutations, several were kinase-inactive indicating the necessity of these residues for ATP binding to the Abl kinase. Interestingly, E258G demonstrated an IC50 value of 0.18 μm, 8-fold higher than that of wild type Abl. There are several possible explanations for this result. The model based on STI571 binding to the FGFR suggests that the hydrogen bonding capabilities of Glu-258 may be critical to interactions between STI571 and Abl. This model is also consistent with our data that STI571 is capable of inhibiting the activated form of Abl (data not shown). The problem with the FGFR model, however, is that it cannot adequately explain other mutations generated above, specifically the Thr-315 mutations. In the Schindleret al. model, Glu-258 is 8 Å from the closest atom of the STI571-related compound (9Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Although this is not close enough to effectively interact with the inhibitor, Glu-258 is directly adjacent to Phe-317 and Leu-248, both of which have hydrophobic interactions with STI571. Mutation of Glu-258 might alter the conformation of these residues, which could alter the conformation of the binding pocket. This mutation showed a large decrease in Vmax, indicating that a high percentage may be in an inactive state, and an ATP affinity that was slightly higher than wild type Abl, suggesting that rather than a reduction of STI571 affinity, the increased affinity of the mutation for ATP is capable of overcoming the potency of the inhibitor. This explanation is consistent with the modest yet noticeable increase in IC50. Thus, it is not necessary to postulate an alternative binding mode of STI571 to the Abl kinase to account for our mutational data.Table IIIIC50 values of Abl mutants based on an FGFR model of inhibitor binding.Potential contact sitesMutationsSensitivity to STI571ATP affinity: [ATP]50% maximum signalRelativeVmaxWTIC50= 0.025 μm62 nm1.00Leu-248AlaKinase-inactiveVal-256GlyKinase-inactiveGlu-258GlyIC50= 0.18 μm42 nm0.18Met-318AlaKinase-inactiveLeu-370GlySame as WT Open table in a new tab Some common themes seem to emerge from this data. It is clear that many of the predicted contact points between STI571 and the Abl kinase are essential to ATP binding and that mutation of these residues produces a kinase-inactive protein. Thus, these mutations are unlikely to produce clinical resistance. It is also possible that mutation of these residues introduces structural instability that leads to kinase inactivity. This would indicate that they are unlikely mutations for clinical resistance; however, more conservative amino acid substitutions might, in some instances, yield different results. An example of this is apparent in the results from an array of mutations of Ala-380. While A380T decreased the sensitivity to STI571, A380L was kinase-inactive, suggesting that only a conservative change at that site is tolerated. It is possible that additional relevant mutations could be identified through analysis of different amino acid substitutions in some of the sites described in this study. Despite this, there are predicted contact points that do render the kinase less sensitive to STI571. Two of these, Thr-315 and Tyr-253, predicted by the Schindler et al. (9Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar) model, have been found as an acquired mutation in patients who developed resistance to STI571 (8Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science. 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar, 11Hochhaus A. Kreil S. Muller M.C. Lahaye T. La Rosee P. Corbin A.S.

Peschel C. Duyster J. Lancet. 2002; 359: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). There are, however, additional residues in the Abl kinase, not immediately obvious from the crystal structure that, when mutated, result in decreased sensitivity to STI571 and therefore may be clinically relevant. In a recent report, a mutation at amino acid 255 was found in one of 32 patients who were resistant to STI571, whereas no mutations at residue 315 were found (10Hochhaus A. Kreil S. Corbin A., La Rosee P. Lahaye T. Berger U. Cross N.C. Linkesch W. Druker B.J. Hehlmann R. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Corneo G. D'Incalci M. Science. 2001; 293: 2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although amino acid 255 is not a predicted contact point in any of the models presented above, in the FGFR and Schindleret al. models this amino acid is immediately adjacent to 256, a predicted site of contact. The decreased sensitivity to STI571 caused by mutation at this residue may be due to alterations in the STI571 binding surface induced by mutation of a residue adjacent to a contact point. Our data suggests that residues in close proximity to the predicted points of contact may also alter the sensitivity of Abl to STI571, possibly due to subtle structural alterations that either decrease the affinity for STI571 or increase the affinity of Abl for ATP. One such mutation is exemplified by the mutation at amino acid 255, present in a patient with clinical resistance to STI571. Our data also suggests that mutations in the Abl kinase domain other than those currently reported are likely to be observed and that these mutations are likely to be more diverse than originally described. Many of the STI571-insensitive mutations also demonstrated a reduction in kinase activity. We hypothesize that STI571-resistant mutations may exist in patients prior to therapy and that they are selected for by treatment with STI571. The decrease in kinase activity of the T315I mutation, for example, suggests that in the absence of STI571, the mutation would confer no growth advantage and therefore would not be readily observed in untreated patients. Under selective pressure from STI571 therapy, however, it would emerge as a predominant clone. This result is consistent with a failure to detect kinase domain mutations in patients prior to STI571 therapy and may explain why an initial response to STI571 prior to the development of resistance is common in patients with kinase domain mutations (8Gorre M.E.

A number of study centers have already identified an array of acquired mutations in clinically resistant patients beyond those initially identified (10Hochhaus A. Kreil S. Corbin A., La Rosee P.

Until further data is obtained on a larger group of patients, we advocate sequencing of the entire kinase domain to screen for mutations in patients who develop resistance to STI571. It is also imperative that mutations identified in clinical samples are analyzed for their sensitivity to STI571 to clarify their role in development of drug resistance. As we learn more about which mutations frequently confer STI571 resistance in patients, new specific inhibitors can be targeted against STI571-resistant variations of Abl to combat the difficulty of drug resistance in disease treatment. We thank Maria Schumacher for assistance with data analysis, Kara Johnson and Stephanie Willis for helpful discussions, and John Kuriyan and Bhushan Nagar for providing information about the Abl crystal structure."

Deuterium-labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol was injected into two healthy volunteers, and the apparent half-life was found to be 64 and 60 h, respectively. We have determined earlier the half-lives for 7α-, 27-, and 24-hydroxycholesterol to be ∼0.5, 0.75, and 14 h, respectively. Patients treated with certain antiepileptic drugs have up to 20-fold increased plasma concentrations of 4β-hydroxycholesterol. The apparent half-life of deuterium-labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol in such a patient was found to be 52 h, suggesting that the high plasma concentration was because of increased synthesis rather than impaired clearance. 4β-Hydroxycholesterol was converted into acidic products at a much slower rate than 7α-hydroxycholesterol in primary human hepatocytes, and 4β-hydroxycholesterol was 7α-hydroxylated at a slower rate than cholesterol by recombinant human CYP7A1. CYP7B1 and CYP39A1 had no activity toward 4β-hydroxycholesterol. These results suggest that the high plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol is because of its exceptionally slow elimination, probably in part because of the low rate of 7α-hydroxylation of the steroid.

The apparent half-life of deuterium-labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol in such a patient was found to be 52 h, suggesting that the high plasma concentration was because of increased synthesis rather than impaired clearance. 4β-Hydroxycholesterol was converted into acidic products at a much slower rate than 7α-hydroxycholesterol in primary human hepatocytes, and 4β-hydroxycholesterol was 7α-hydroxylated at a slower rate than cholesterol by recombinant human CYP7A1. CYP7B1 and CYP39A1 had no activity toward 4β-hydroxycholesterol. These results suggest that the high plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol is because of its exceptionally slow elimination, probably in part because of the low rate of 7α-hydroxylation of the steroid. The findings are discussed in relation to a potential role of 4β-hydroxycholesterol as a ligand for the nuclear receptor LXR. cytochrome P450 gas chromatography mass spectrometry liver X receptor 4β-Hydroxycholesterol is one of the quantitatively most important oxysterols in human circulation (1Bodin K.

We have recently shown that it is formed by the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)1 (1Bodin K. Bretillon L. Aden Y. Bertilsson L. Broomé U. Einarsson C. Diczfalusy U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38685-38689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments showed that the formation of this oxysterol by human liver microsomes was relatively slow. The high plasma levels of the oxysterol are therefore surprising, and we hypothesized that this may be a consequence of slow metabolism. Therefore, in this work, we determined the rate of elimination of deuterium-labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol from plasma. Oxysterols are generally degraded to bile acids, and the rate-limiting step in this conversion is the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the 7α-position of the steroid. Alternative pathways for bile acid biosynthesis start with oxidation of the steroid side chain by CYP27A1 and CYP46. Therefore, we have studied the possibility that these cytochromes are active toward 4β-hydroxycholesterol. The metabolism of 4β-hydroxycholesterol was studied in human primary hepatocytes, control, and transfected cells and by incubations with recombinant enzymes. In addition, fecal samples from three untreated subjects and one subject treated with carbamazepine were analyzed for 4β-hydroxylated bile acids. Based on these experiments, we present evidence that 4β-hydroxycholesterol has an unusually long half-life in plasma and that this is the result of slow elimination, particularly slow 7α-hydroxylation that is the rate-limiting step for further conversion into bile acids. The following materials were purchased: Qiagen OneStep reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen); pcDNA4/HisMax© vector, version A and One Shot Top 10F′ competent cells (Invitrogen); poly-d-lysine, (BD PharMingen); and HEK 293 cells (Catalog number CRL-1573, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Two oligonucleotide primers for reverse transcription-PCR were synthesized using the ExpediteTM nucleic acid synthesis system followed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification (CyberGene AB, Novum Research Park, Sweden): CYP39A1fo/EcoRI, 5′-CGGAATTCCGTGCTTCTGGAAGGTGCTGG-3′, and CYP39A1rv/XhoI, 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGCCTGGTCCTTGTGAGGCC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 18–36 and 1480–1464, respectively, in the cDNA). The primers contained 5′ overhangs with an EcoRI restriction site in the forward primer and anXhoI site for the reverse primer. The complete cDNA for 24-hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylase for transfection was produced by reverse transcription-PCR from human total RNA prepared from liver tissue utilizing the QuickPrep Total RNA Extraction Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA was inserted into a linearized pcDNA4/HisMax vector and propagated into One Shot Top 10F′ competent cells. From the recovered clones, the cDNA was sequenced to completion to confirm the cDNA sequence and certify that it was correctly inserted so that the reading frame was maintained. Hexadeuterium-labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol, tritium-labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol (specific radioactivity 75,000 cpm/μg), and tritium-labeled 7α-hydroxycholesterol (specific radioactivity 0.5 × 106 cpm/μg) were synthesized as described previously (2Breuer O.

Biochem. 1969; 8: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 4β,7α-dihydroxycholesterol was synthesized as described previously (4Lasalvia M. Musumeci D. Piccialli V. Sica D. J. Chem. Res. 1998; : 2988-2995Google Scholar). Cholesta-4,6-dien-3β-ol (11 mg) dissolved in 1.0 ml of acetone was mixed with 0.8 mg of methyltrioxorhenium and 100 μl of 30% H2O2(w/w). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The remaining H2O2 was decomposed with a few spatula tips of MnO2. The suspension was filtered and evaporated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 5 ml of diethyl ether and washed twice with 1 ml of H2O. The ether phase was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated under N2. The mass spectrum of the trimethylsilyl ether derivative of cholest-5-ene-3β,4β,7α-triol showed the expected peaks atm/z 619 (M − 15), 544 (M − 90), 529 (M − 90–15), 455 (M − 90–89), 415, 349, and 325. Deuterium-labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol (500 μg) was dissolved in ethanol and mixed with human serum albumin (Biovitrum Plasma Products) and physiological sodium chloride solution (0.9% w/v). The mixture was administered intravenously in a first experiment to a healthy male volunteer 60 years of age (body mass index 25) and in a second experiment to a healthy female volunteer 64 years of age (body mass index 24). Blood samples were taken before and at specific time points after the administration. Deuterium labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol (500 μg) was administered under the same conditions as described above to a female volunteer 49 years of age (body mass index 25) who was treated for epilepsy with carbamazepine (600 + 750 mg/day) during the last 10 years. The deuterium enrichment in blood samples was monitored by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in selected ion monitoring mode with the same instrumentation and conditions as previously described but without the addition of internal standards (1Bodin K.

Fecal samples were obtained from three healthy male volunteers, ages 29, 50, and 60 (body mass index of 22, 23, and 25 with plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentrations of 31, 37, and 17 ng/ml). In addition, one sample was obtained from a female volunteer 49 years of age (body mass index 25) treated with carbamazepine for >10 years. Her plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol concentration was 468 ng/ml. Hepatocytes were isolated from human liver tissue obtained from patients undergoing a liver resection because of liver tumors. The cells were isolated according to a two-step perfusion technique with EGTA and collagenase (Type XI, Sigma) solutions as described previously (5Li A.P. Roque M.A. Beck D.J. Kaminski D.L. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1992; 14: 139-146Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The hepatocytes were cultured in 6-cm dishes, which had been precoated with 200 μl of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm Matrigel containing 3 ml of culture medium (William E medium supplemented with glutamine (292 μg/ml)), insulin (2 international milliunits/ml), penicillin G sodium (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and gentamycin (85 μg/ml). The hepatocytes were cultured for 4 days without any additions. On the fourth day, the hepatocytes were incubated with 4 μg of tritium-labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol (3 × 103 cpm) and in parallel with 4 μg of tritium-labeled 7α-hydroxycholesterol (2 × 106 cpm). The substrates were dissolved in 10 μl of ethanol. After the addition of substrates, the incubation was continued for 48 h in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Hepatocytes and medium were analyzed as described previously (6Björkhem I. Andersson U. Ellis E. Alvelius G. Ellegård L. Diczfalusy U. Sjövall J. Einarsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37004-37010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After incubation, the medium was hydrolyzed at 120 °C for 18 h with 6 g of potassium hydroxide dissolved in 12 ml of 50% ethanol. After hydrolysis, a two-step extraction was performed. The first extraction isolated neutral steroids by adding 80 ml of physiological sodium chloride solution, 80 ml of 50% ethanol, and 100 ml of diethyl ether. The ether phase was transferred into a round bottom flask and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and dissolved in 3 ml of methanol. The water phase containing bile acids was acidified with 15 ml of 6 m hydrochloric acid and extracted with 100 ml of diethyl ether. The ether phase was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in 3 ml of methanol. An aliquot from each fraction was mixed with scintillation mixture (Lumasafe, Lumac, Groningen, The Netherlands) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Model 1414 Winspectral, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). HEK 293 cells (ATCC, CRL 1573) were cultured as described previously (6Björkhem I. Andersson U. Ellis E. Alvelius G. Ellegård L. Diczfalusy U. Sjövall J. Einarsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37004-37010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but without Geneticin. At 70% confluence, the cells were depleted of cholesterol by incubating with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma) (15 mg/ml) for 45 min in serum-free medium with bovine charcoal-stripped and delipidated (C-1696, Sigma). Thereafter, the substrate, 20 μg of 4β-hydroxycholesterol or 20 μg of 27-hydroxycholesterol, dissolved in 20 μl of ethanol was added. The cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At a confluence of 60%, 293 cells were transfected with a mixture of 60 μl of TfxTM20 (Promega), 10 μg of cDNA of CYP46, and 2.93 ml of medium prewarmed to 37 °C (6Björkhem I. Andersson U. Ellis E.

Thereafter, an additional 12 ml of complete medium was added. After 48 h of culturing, the cells were selected with 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin (Sigma) and incubated for 48 h with 20 μg of 4β-hydroxycholesterol or 20 μg of 27-hydroxycholesterol dissolved in 20 μl of ethanol. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The medium was supplemented withl-glutamine, d-glucose (1000 mg/liter), sodium pyruvate (catalog number 31885-023, Invitrogen), heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (5% v/v, Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/ml, 100 μg/ml, respectively, Invitrogen). The cells were plated out on polylysine-coated dishes (5 μg/cm2), and when the cells had reached a confluence of 80–90%, they were transfected with 10 μg of purified pcDNA4/HisMax vector containing the 24-hydroxycholesterol 7α-hydroxylase cDNA by using the Tfx20 Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Control cells were transfected with the same amount of vector without insert. The cells were then cultured for another 48 h in 18 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium withl-glutamine supplemented with 2% delipidated fetal calf serum (Sigma) and 20 μg of either 24-hydroxycholesterol or 4β-hydroxycholesterol (dissolved in 20 μl of ethanol). Cells and medium were sonicated three times for 20 s. Thereafter, the cells and medium were extracted by adding 2 ml of 20% NaCl and 85 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The organic phase was evaporated and dissolved in 1 ml of toluene and then purified on a silica column (International Sorbent Technology, Mid Glamorgan, United Kingdom). The column was activated by the addition of 2 ml of hexane prior to the addition of sample (in 1 ml of toluene). Thereafter, the column was washed with 8 ml of 0.5% isopropyl alcohol in hexane, and the oxysterols were eluted with 5 ml of 50% isopropyl alcohol. The eluate was evaporated and derivatized to trimethylsilyl ether derivatives by treatment with pyridine/hexamethyldisilazane/trimethylchlorosilane (3:2:1) (v/v/v) at 60 °C for 30 min and analyzed by GC-MS in full scan mode. 100 μl of recombinant human CYP7A1 (190 pmol) was gently mixed with 30 μl of microsomal NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase, 5 μl of Triton X-100 (10% solution), 740 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 5 μg of substrate (4β-hydroxycholesterol or cholesterol) dissolved in 25 μl of acetone, and 1 mg of NADPH dissolved in 100 μl of buffer. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) (7Norlin M. Toll A. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1629-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 33 μl of recombinant human CYP27A1 (0.5 nmol) was mixed with 950 μl of buffer (40 mm KPO4, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4), 0.5 μl (1.5 nmol) of adrenodoxin, 12 μl (1.5 nmol) of adrenodoxin reductase, 10 μg of substrate (4β-hydroxycholesterol or cholesterol) dissolved in 10 μl of ethanol, and 0.8 mg of NADPH dissolved in 10 μl of buffer (40 mm KPO4, pH 7.4). After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 5 ml chloroform/methanol (2:1) (8Pikuleva I.A. Babiker A. Waterman M.R. Björkhem I. J. Biol.

Microsomes (Supersomes®) expressing recombinant human CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 were purchased from Gentest (Woburn, MA). Microsomes containing human CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 (50 μl, 50 pmol) were pre-incubated for 5 min with 100 nmol of cholesterol dissolved in 10 μl of 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and 390 μl of buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Finally, 0.5 mg of NADPH dissolved in 50 μl of buffer was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 120 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of methanol (1Bodin K. Bretillon L. Aden Y.

CYP7A1 and CYP27A1 metabolites were extracted by adding 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 1 ml of physiological sodium chloride solution to the test tube. The test tube was whirl-mixed and centrifuged. The organic phase was transferred to a new test tube evaporated under N2, and the residue was trimethylsilyl-derivatized. CYP27A1 metabolites were converted into methyl esters with trimethylsilyldiazomethane prior to sialylation. 4β-Hydroxycholesterol was determined in incubations with CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 as described previously (1Bodin K.

All of the incubations were analyzed by full scan GC-MS with the exception of incubations with recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, which were analyzed by GC-MS in selected ion monitoring mode. In a round bottom flask, 0.1 g of feces suspended in 1 ml of H2O was evaporated to dryness under vacuum in a rotary evaporator. Thereafter, the samples were subjected to solvolysis and subsequent hydrolysis. Solvolysis was performed at 40 °C for 1 h by adding 4 ml of 2 mHCl in ethanol/acetone (9:1). After solvolysis, the pH was adjusted to 7 with 1 m NaOH, and the mixture was dried in a rotary evaporator. The residue was dissolved in 8 ml of 4 mNaOH/methanol (1:1), and the hydrolysis was performed for 16 h at 80 °C (9Murai T. Mahara R. Kurosawa T. Kimura A. Tohma M. J. Chromatogr. 1997; 691: 13-22Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The following extraction was performed as described earlier under “Experimental Procedures,” with the exception that the residue was methylated and trimethyl-silylated. Bile acids in feces were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The gas chromatograph was a Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II Plus equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-μm phase thickness) connected to an HP 5972 mass selective detector with a HP 7673A automatic sample injector. The oven temperature was as follows: 180 °C for 1 min, 20 °C/min to 220 °C, and then 3.5 °C/min to 290 °C where the temperature was kept for 27 min. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Splitless injection was used (1 μl), and the detector temperature was 280 °C. The detector transfer line temperature was set to 270 °C. The mass spectrometer was used in the full scan mode (m/z 100 − 700), and the electron ionization energy was 70 eV. These studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of Karolinska Institutet at Huddinge University Hospital (Huddinge, Sweden). To study the elimination of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in human circulation, hexadeuterated 4β-hydroxycholesterol was administered intravenously to three volunteers. One of them had been treated with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine for more than 10 years. This drug has been shown to increase the concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation (1Bodin K. Bretillon L. Aden Y. Bertilsson L. Broomé U. Einarsson C. Diczfalusy U. J. Biol.

The half-lives for 4β-hydroxycholesterol were calculated from the linear (elimination) part of the curves, assuming first order kinetics.

Open table in a new tab 4β-Hydroxycholesterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol were incubated with primary human hepatocytes to study the metabolism into bile acids. The metabolism of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in primary human hepatocytes was found to be extremely slow. Only 4% of the added 4β-hydroxycholesterol was converted to polar products under the experimental conditions used. These polar products were recovered in the bile acid containing phase after extraction. Parallel incubations with 7α-hydroxycholesterol resulted in 59% conversion to bile acids, 70–90% of which corresponded to cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid (6Björkhem I. Andersson U. Ellis E.

Control 293 cells expressing high endogenous activity of CYP7B1 (oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase) (12Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Björkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Whereas the added 27-hydroxycholesterol was completely converted into its 7α-hydroxylated metabolite, no conversion was observed when 4β-hydroxycholesterol was incubated with the cells. CYP46-transfected 293 cells converted 17% of the added 4β-hydroxycholesterol into a polar metabolite. This metabolite was analyzed by GC-MS as trimethylsilyl ether, and the following ions (m/z) were recorded: 634 (M), 544 (M − 90), 501 (M − 90–43), 454 (M − 2 × 90), 364 (M − 3 × 90), 159, and 145. The fragmentation pattern is consistent with 24-hydroxylated 4β-hydroxycholesterol. Control 293 cells did not 24-hydroxylate 4β-hydroxycholesterol. 293 Cells transfected with CYP39A1 converted 1.4% of the added 24-hydroxycholesterol into 7α,24-dihydroxycholesterol. The identity of the product was confirmed by GC-MS (7Norlin M. Toll A. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1629-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When incubated under the same conditions with 4β-hydroxycholesterol, no significant conversion was observed (<0.1% conversion). Cholesterol and 4β-hydroxycholesterol were incubated in parallel with recombinantcholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Approximately 8% 4β-hydroxycholesterol and 17% cholesterol was 7α-hydroxylated, corresponding to turnover numbers of 0.087 and 0.184 nmol/min × nmol cytochrome P450, respectively. To verify the identity of the 4β-hydroxycholesterol metabolite, 4β,7α-dihydroxycholesterol was synthesized (4Lasalvia M. Musumeci D. Piccialli V. Sica D. J. Chem. Res. 1998; : 2988-2995Google Scholar). The retention times on GC-MS (13.9 min) and mass spectra were identical for the 4β-hydroxycholesterol metabolite and synthetic 4β,7α-dihydroxycholesterol (Fig.2). Recombinant CYP27A1 was found to convert 4β-hydroxycholesterol into 4β,27-dihydroxycholesterol and metabolize it further into the corresponding acid. The products 4β,27-dihydroxycholesterol and the corresponding acid were converted into trimethylsilyl ether and trimethylsilyl ether-methyl ester, respectively, and analyzed by GC-MS. In the analysis of the 27-hydroxylated product, major ions were recorded at (m/z) 634 (M), 544 (M − 90), 505 (M − 129), 454 (M − 2 × 90), and 415 (M − 129–90). This fragmentation pattern is consistent with that expected for the trimethylsilyl ether of 4β,27-dihydroxycholesterol. In the analysis of the methylated acid, prominent ions were found with (m/z 590 (M), 500 (M − 90), 462 (M − 129), 410 (M − 2 × 90), and 371 (M − 129–90). This mass spectrum is consistent with the structure of the trimethylsilyl ether of methyl-3β,4β-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid. The conversion of 4β-hydroxycholesterol into 27-oxygenated products was 50%. When cholesterol was incubated under the same conditions, the degree of 27-oxygenation was 27%. The corresponding turnover numbers were 0.41 and 0.22 nmol/min × nmol cytochrome P450, respectively. Incubation of cholesterol with recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 resulted in the formation of 4β-hydroxycholesterol, and the relative rates of conversion were 100, 5,6, and 2.8%, respectively, and the turnover numbers were 7.9, 0.44, and 0.22 pmol/min × nmol cytochrome P450. Feces from the female volunteer treated with carbamazepine was analyzed for bile acids by GC-MS. A small peak in the total ion chromatogram with a retention time of 26.0 min that constituted 0.56% total bile acids had ions (m/z) at 623 (M − 15), 548 (M − 90), 458 (M − 2 × 90), 433 (M − 90–115), 417 (M − 90–115-15), 369 (M − (2 × 90)-89), 343 (M − (2 × 90)-115), 329 (M − (2 × 90)-129), 253 ,147, and 129 (Fig. 3). The mass spectrum is similar to a previously published spectrum of 3,4β,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid (as methyl ester, trimethylsilyl ether) (13Dumaswala R. Setchell K.D.R. Zimmer-Nechemias L.

With respect to the ion atm/z 369, the loss of 89 mass units is characteristic for two vicinal trimethylsiloxy groups (13Dumaswala R. Setchell K.D.R. Zimmer-Nechemias L. Iida T. Goto J. Nambara T. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ion atm/z 417 (probably formed by a loss of one trimethylsiloxy group and one 131-fragment from the molecular ion) is highly characteristic for 4β-hydroxylated bile acids (13Dumaswala R. Setchell K.D.R. Zimmer-Nechemias L. Iida T. Goto J. Nambara T. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The feces from three healthy volunteers were analyzed for bile acids, and in one sample, the same 4β-hydroxylated bile acid was found (constituting 0.37% total bile acids), whereas the concentration in the remaining two samples from the healthy volunteers was below the detection limit. In the present investigation, deuterium-labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol was injected into volunteers to determine the elimination rate from the circulation. An exceptionally long half-life of ∼2–3 days was found for 4β-hydroxycholesterol compared with the oxysterols 7α-, 27-, and 24-hydroxycholesterol for which the half-lives have been determined to be 0.5–12 h (10Björkhem I.

Lütjohann D. von Bergmann K. Wennmalm Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 70-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous in vitro experiments indicated a slow rate of formation for 4β-hydroxycholesterol (1Bodin K. Bretillon L. Aden Y. Bertilsson L. Broomé U. Einarsson C. Diczfalusy U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38685-38689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). If the rate of formation is slow also in vivo, the long half-life could be expected to be the result of slow metabolism of the oxysterol. This was further investigated in primary human hepatocytes and by the use of normal and transfected cells as well as recombinant human cytochromes CYP7A1 and CYP27A1, enzymes known to metabolize oxysterols. Primary human hepatocytes efficiently converted 7α-hydroxycholesterol to bile acids, whereas only a small fraction of 4β-hydroxycholesterol was metabolized into polar products. This finding was in accordance within vitro experiments with recombinant CYP7A1 where 4β-hydroxycholesterol was 7α-hydroxylated at a rate only half of that of cholesterol. Cultured 293 cells with a high endogenous CYP7B1 activity efficiently 7α-hydroxylated 27-hydroxycholesterol, whereas 4β-hydroxycholesterol was not converted at all. These experiments indicate that 4β-hydroxycholesterol undergoes the rate-limiting 7α-hydroxylation step much slower than cholesterol. It is possible that the 4β-hydroxyl group in some way impairs the 7α-hydroxylation reaction. The enzymatic hydroxylation of the steroid side chain was not impaired, because 4β-hydroxycholesterol was 27-oxygenated by recombinant CYP27A1 at almost twice the rate compared with cholesterol, and incubations with 293 cells transfected with CYP46 resulted in a rapid conversion into a 24-hydroxylated metabolite. Because CYP46 is expressed exclusively in brain in humans (14Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), 24-hydroxylation cannot be a quantitatively important pathway for elimination of 4β-hydroxycholesterol but may be of local importance in the brain. The different metabolic pathways investigated are outlined in Fig.4. The size of the pool of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in equilibrium with the administered deuterium-labeled material can be estimated from the dilution of the administered labeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol. The extrapolation of the elimination curves for the two healthy volunteers to time zero (Fig. 1) gives ratios of2H6/2H0 of 0.45 and 0.29, respectively, of circulating 4β-hydroxycholesterol. As 500 μg of the deuterium-labeled material was infused in the volunteers, the pools of unlabeled 4β-hydroxycholesterol were apparently 1.1 and 1.7 mg, respectively. The half-lives for 4β-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation in the two volunteers were determined to be 64 and 60 h, respectively. This corresponds to an elimination of ∼0.2 and 0.3 mg/day, respectively. Assuming that 4β-hydroxycholesterol is quantitatively converted into bile acids, a maximum of ∼0.3 mg/day would be formed. Because the normal production of bile acids is around 400 mg/day (15Miettinen T.A. Gylling H. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 153: 241-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), <0.1% of this pool can be expected to be derived from such a hypothetical pathway. Such a small amount would not be detectable with the methodology normally used. In a patient with maximally up-regulated CYP3A4, the formation of 4β-hydroxylated bile acids could be expected to be up to 20-fold higher. In view of this, it is interesting that the patient treated with antiepileptics studied here had a content of one specific 4β-hydroxylated bile acid in feces corresponding to ∼0.6% total bile acids. When this bile acid was measured in feces from three healthy volunteers with normal plasma 4β-hydrocholesterol concentrations, it was identified in one of the volunteers, whereas the concentration in feces from the other two volunteers was below the detection limit. The 4β-hydroxylated bile acid constituted ∼0.4% total bile acids, excluding 4β-hydroxylation of cholesterol as a major pathway for formation of the 4β-hydroxylated bile acid identified. Thus, the major pathway for the formation of 4β-hydroxylated bile acids remains to be determined. At the present state, the possibility must be considered that CYP3A4 may have some 4β-hydroxylase activity toward another intermediate in bile acid synthesis. Because the high plasma concentrations of 4β-hydroxycholesterol in patients treated with some antiepileptic drugs are the result of increased synthesis and not impaired metabolism, 4β-hydroxycholesterol may reflect the CYP3A4 activity in vivo. Thus, this cholesterol metabolite is a potential clinical marker for CYP3A4 activity. Oxysterols have been suggested to be ligands for the nuclear receptors LXRα and LXRβ (16Janowski B.A. Willy P.J.

Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Although 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol concentrations are surprisingly stable over time, plasma levels of 4β-hydroxycholesterol may rapidly increase up to 20-fold following the induction of CYP3A4 by various drugs (1Bodin K. Bretillon L. Aden Y. Bertilsson L. Broomé U. Einarsson C. Diczfalusy U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38685-38689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). If 4β-hydroxycholesterol activates LXR also in vivo, this could be one of the mechanisms behind the disturbances in lipid metabolism often seen after treatment of patients with antiepileptic or neuroleptic drugs. In conclusion, the elimination rate of 4β-hydroxycholesterol from the human circulation was found to be exceptionally slow compared with other oxysterols. This slow rate of elimination may at least in part be because of slow 7α-hydroxylation, which is the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis. A 4β-hydroxylated bile acid was identified in feces from healthy volunteers and from a patient with epilepsy with a high plasma concentration of 4β-hydroxycholesterol. The levels of the fecal 4β-hydroxylated bile acid were similar in the patient and in the healthy volunteer, making it unlikely that 4β-hydroxylation of cholesterol by CYP3A4 is a major pathway for the formation of fecal 4β-hydroxylated bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W2008063990,"We have recently reported the chondrogenic effect of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in high density cultures of the mouse multipotent mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cell line and have shown the functional requirement of the cell-cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin in BMP-2-induced chondrogenesis<i>in vitro</i> (Denker, A. E., Nicoll, S. B., and Tuan, R. S. (1995) <i>Differentiation</i> 59, 25–34; Haas, A. R., and Tuan, R. S. (1999) <i>Differentiation</i> 64, 77–89). Furthermore, BMP-2 treatment also results in an increased protein level of β-catenin, a known N-cadherin-associated Wnt signal transducer (Fischer, L., Haas, A., and Tuan, R. S. (2001)<i>Signal Transduction</i> 2, 66–78), suggesting functional cross-talk between the BMP-2 and Wnt signaling pathways. We have observed previously that BMP-2 treatment up-regulates expression of Wnt-3A in high density cultures of C3H10T1/2 cells. To assess the contribution of Wnt-3A to BMP-2-mediated chondrogenesis, we have generated C3H10T1/2 cell lines overexpressing Wnt-3A and various forms of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), an immediate cytosolic component of the Wnt signaling pathway, and examined their response to BMP-2. We show that overexpression of either Wnt-3A or kinase-dead GSK-3β enhances BMP-2-mediated chondrogenesis. Furthermore, Wnt-3A overexpression results in decreases in both N-cadherin and GSK-3β protein levels, whereas Wnt-3A as well as kinase-dead GSK-3β overexpression increase total and nuclear levels of both β-catenin and LEF-1. Direct cross-talk between Wnts and BMP-2 was also indicated by the up-regulated interaction between β-catenin and SMAD-4 in response to BMP-2. These results suggest that Wnt-3A acts in a manner opposite to that of other Wnts, such as Wnt-7A, which were previously identified as inhibitory to chondrogenesis, and is the first BMP-2-regulated, chondrogenesis-enhancing member of the Wnt family."

Phorbol esters such as PMA1function as tumor promoters and have been reported to modulate diverse cellular responses such as gene transcription, cellular growth and differentiation, programmed cell death, the immune response, and receptor desensitization through protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways. PMA can substitute for diacylglycerol, the endogenous activator of PKC, and it has been used as a model agent to study the mechanisms utilized by growth factors, hormones, and cytokines to regulate growth and differentiation of cells (9Nishizuka Y.

However, detailed analysis of the downstream signaling pathways involved in PMA/PKC-induced up-regulation ofMUC2 has not been done. One well studied mode of PKC-mediated signaling involves transmission of signals from PKC to mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). MAPK activation by PMA has been reported to occur via both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent pathways: PC-12 rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (19Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S.

Thus, the involvement of Ras in signaling processes initiated by PMA appears to be cell type- dependent and specifically determined by which signaling pathways have been activated and/or the cell's repertoire of kinases. HM3 human colon cancer cell line contains the most common K-rasmutation type found in colorectal cancers, the glycine to aspartate mutation at codon 12. Because many growth factors and cytokines utilize Ras-dependent signaling pathways, this cell line serves as a model system for studying alterations in gene expression that occur in the progression of colorectal cancers. In this study we show that PMA stimulates expression of theMUC2 gene in HM3 cells through activation of PKC. SuchMUC2 up-regulation is Ras- and Raf-dependent, requires activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and ultimately involves activation of a nuclear factor, NF-κB.

The cells were harvested and luciferase activities were measured using dual LuciferaseTM Reporter Assay System (Promega) with the Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescent Laboratory). Firefly luciferase activity measurements were normalized with respect to pRLO Renilla luciferase activity to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Inhibitor experiments using stably transfected HM3M2 cells were carried out similarly with overnight serum starvation, 1 h of inhibitor pretreatment, and then 4 h of PMA treatment. Promoter activity was assessed using the Luciferase Assay Kit from Promega. Data is presented graphically as the average of four replicates from a representative experiment with standard deviation provided by error bars and statistical significance determined by Student’s t test with confidence levels indicated in the figure legends. After various treatments, total cell lysates were prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm pyrophosphate. The protein concentration of supernatant was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid-based BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), which was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mm Tris-HCl with 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), probed with specific primary antibodies, washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween, and then probed with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the Renaissance kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Ref. 29Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford Assay method (Bio-Rad). A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the humanMUC2 promoter region from −1458 to −1430 (5′-CGTCCTTGGGTTTCCCCAGGGCTAGTGC-3′) was prepared by annealing forward and reverse primers and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Mutated versions of the same probe were also used, where MT3 = 5′-CGTCCTTGGGTTGAATAAGGGCTAGTGC-3′ (27Li J.-D. Feng W. Gallup M. Kim J.-H. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were incubated with radiolabeled probe for 20 min in a solution containing 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 10 mmHEPES-KOH at pH 7.9, 210 mm NaCl, 0.75 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 12.5% glycerol before separation on a 4% (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel in Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. Specificity of protein binding to radiolabeled oligonucleotides was demonstrated by addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabelled competing oligonucleotide. For supershift assays, antibodies specific for p50, p65, or c-Rel subunits of NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 30 min on ice. PMA increased MUC2 mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner with the peak effect at 4 h (Fig. 1A). Densitometric analysis revealed that PMA caused a 4-fold increase in mRNA levels after 4 h at 0.5 μm concentration (Fig. 1B). In addition, PMA up-regulated transcriptional activity of the MUC2 luciferase reporter in HM3M2 cells in a dose-dependent manner up to 0.5 μm (Fig.1C). Transiently transfectedMUC2 promoter deletion constructs all showed significant (p < 0.001) increases in activity upon treatment with PMA (Fig. 2). As reported previously (26Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), constructs containing sequence up-stream of base −1308 were significantly more active than smaller constructs. The −1628/+19 construct was chosen for further experiments as it exhibited the highest level of PMA responsiveness. Bisindolylmaleimide I is a highly selective cell-permeable PKC inhibitor that acts as a competitive inhibitor for the ATP-binding site of PKC. 0.1 μm bisindolylmaleimide inhibited PMA induction of MUC2 promoter activity by 80% (Fig.3A). Another specific inhibitor of PKC, calphostin C, also inhibited PMA-inducedMUC2 promoter activation by ∼80%. RT-PCR was used to confirm that bisindolylmaleimide and calphostin C also caused a reduction in endogenous MUC2 transcript levels (Fig.3B). It should be noted that in these experiments RT-PCR provides a less sensitive measurement of the effects of PMA and inhibitors due to the relatively high levels of MUC2 in untreated cells, resulting from the stable nature of theMUC2 transcript (26Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). KT5720, a potent specific inhibitor of PKA, did not inhibit the induced up-regulation of MUC2promoter activity or message (Fig. 3). Similarly, Src-tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (0.5 μm) had no significant effect (p < 0.05) on MUC2 promoter activity. PP3, a negative control for PP2, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase inhibitor also failed to inhibit PMA-induced MUC2up-regulation. Thus, PKC inhibitors were able to block the up-regulation of MUC2 promoter activity, suggesting that this kinase is responsible for PMA-induced MUC2up-regulation. To investigate the role of MEK, we used PD98059 and U0126 to selectively block the activity of MEK. These inhibitors completely blocked MUC2 induction by PMA (Fig.4A) and reduced the level of endogenous MUC2 transcript, estimated using RT-PCR (Fig. 4B). SB203580, a highly specific and cell-permeable inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, failed to inhibit theMUC2 promoter activity induced by PMA (Fig. 4A). AG126, an inhibitor of ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation also significantly inhibited PMA-induced MUC2 up-regulation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Because pp90rsk is a possible downstream effector of ERK1/2 signaling, dominant-negative pp90rsk was tested for its ability to block PMA-stimulated MUC2 promoter activation (Fig.4D). Surprisingly, no inhibition was observed. Results shown are representative of four independent experiments. The results obtained using MAP kinase inhibitors were confirmed with Western blots using antibodies to phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK. Fig. 5 shows that both ERK1 (p44) and especially ERK2 (p42) were phosphorylated within 10 min of PMA treatment. p38 was shown to be constitutively phosphorylated in this cell line and slightly affected by PMA (not observed in all experiments). SAPK/JNK, which typically occurs as multiple bands due to alternate splicing of long (p54) and short (p46) forms, exhibits some basal phosphorylation, but this was unaffected. Lysates from PD98059-treated cells served as a control showing no effect on p38 or JNK but inhibiting ERK phosphorylation. Transient transfections with dominant-negative MEK significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited basal and PMA-stimulated activity of the MUC2 promoter. On the other hand, transfection with wild-type MEK activated the MUC2promoter in the absence of PMA, and this activation was not significantly augmented by the addition of PMA (Fig.6A). Transient co-transfections with dominant-negative Raf completely blocked PMA-mediated MUC2 induction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). MUC2 promoter reporter co-transfections using wild-type Ha-Ras did not affect transcriptional activities, with or without addition of PMA. On the other hand, dominant-negative N17Ras inhibited both MUC2promoter activation by PMA and basal promoter activity as well. v-Ha-Ras induced a 5-fold increase in MUC2 transcription rate, similar to levels observed upon PMA treatment. When HM3 cells transfected with v-Ha-Ras were also treated with PMA, a significant (p < 0.001) synergistic effect was observed (Fig. 6C). CAPE, an inhibitor of NF-κB activation, completely blocked the induction of MUC2 by PMA (Fig.7A). This result was confirmed using RT-PCR to estimate changes in endogenous MUC2transcript levels (Fig. 7A, inset). In EMSA, nuclear extracts from untreated HM3 cells failed to exhibit binding of the transcription factor to the NF-κB oligonucleotide probe. However, nuclear extracts from PMA-treated cells contained a protein that bound to the probe and was displaced by the addition of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide. Incorporation of a mutation within the NF-κB consensus site (MT3) produced an oligonucleotide that failed to block binding to the labeled oligonucleotide, indicating the specificity of the interaction of the transcription factor. Addition of the p65 antibody caused this band to supershift (Fig. 7B). Addition of p50 antibody seemed to have little effect in this experiment, but in other experiments a slight decrease in the intensity of the band was observed upon addition of the p50 antibody, indicating a possible interaction. Thus it appears that the p65 subunit is involved withMUC2 up-regulation by PMA, but involvement of the p50 subunit remains to be demonstrated. Antibody to c-Rel failed to cause a supershift. A luciferase reporter vector (TK-LUC) containing the thymidylate kinase minimal promoter inserted downstream from the NF-κB site of MUC2 (−1528/−1307) was activated by PMA (Fig. 7C), indicating that the NF-κB binding site in this region functions as an enhancer of MUC2 transcription. In this study, we first determined that PMA increasedMUC2 message levels in HM3 cells. The transcriptional activity of a MUC2 −2864/+19 promoter/reporter construct stably transfected into HM3 human colon cancer cell line HM3M2 was similarly increased by PMA, indicating that PMA-induced up-regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. We also determined that PMA treatment was able to significantly up-regulate transcription from allMUC2 deletion constructs containing the previously identified proximal Sp1/CACCC box element(s). The greatest promoter activities, however, were observed for larger constructs (−1308/+19, −1628/+19, and −2864/+19). The −1628/+19 construct was chosen for further experiments because of its high basal activity and because it contained two cis elements previously determined to be functional, namely the Sp1/CACCC box and the NF-κB sites (26Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,27Li J.-D. Feng W. Gallup M. Kim J.-H. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To identify the signaling pathways involved in PMA-mediatedMUC2 up-regulation, the effects of various chemical inhibitors and dominant-negative expression vectors on PMA-stimulatedMUC2 transcription were measured. A schematic summary our findings is shown in Fig. 8. As expected, PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I and calphostin C blockedMUC2 up-regulation by PMA, indicating that PKC activation by phorbol ester is directly responsible for the induction ofMUC2 promoter activity. The induction of MUC2transcription by PMA was not suppressed by either PKA inhibitor KT5720 or by Src type tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2. The slight, significant up-regulation by both KT5720 and EGF receptor kinase inhibitor PP3 are consistent with relief of feedback inhibition of Raf by PKA (30Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). PP3 is used as a negative control for PP2; however, the failure of PP3 to inhibit PMA-stimulated up-regulation also indicates that EGF receptor transactivation via PMA-induced shedding of EGF likely does not occur. The apparent lack of involvement of Src type tyrosine kinases is in contrast to previous results obtained using the same cell line, which showed that lipopolysaccharide-induced MUC2 up-regulation was Src-dependent. This indicates that PKC phosphorylation of Raf circumvents the requirement for Src-mediated phosphorylation of Raf. PKC-mediated activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway has been well studied, but the exact nature and order of events leading to Raf activation remain to be fully elucidated, involving phosphorylation reactions catalyzed by several kinases, conformational changes, and translocation to the plasma membrane by Ras (30Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative N17Ras is a membrane-associated H-Ras with an asparagine-to-serine substitution at codon 17, yielding a Ras protein with a high affinity for GDP. The resulting N17Ras-GDP complex is thought to function as a dominant-negative inhibitor of Ras activation through sequestration of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor(s) required for normal GDP release from the (inactive) Ras-GDP complex (31Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 32Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The ability of N17Ras to inhibit PMA-mediated Raf activation has been reported to be cell line-dependent (19Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 20Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J.

Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the case of HM3 cells, co-transfection with the dominant-negative mutant N17Ras was able to inhibit basal as well as PMA-stimulated MUC2 transcription. Thus Raf activation requires interaction with activated Ras and phosphorylation by PMA-activated PKC. In addition, dominant-negative Raf very effectively inhibited MUC2 transcriptional activity induced by PMA. This inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent fashion, demonstrating that Raf, along with Ras, participates in MUC2 transcriptional activation by PMA and that both are required. Ras is thought to activate a number of signaling pathways, including the Raf/MEK/ERK MAP kinase pathway, the MEKK/SEK/JNK pathway, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/NF-κB pathway, a p120GAP/p190/Rac/NF-κB pathway, and a Raf/MEKK1/IκK/IκB/NF-κB pathway (30Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 33Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

To identify relevant events downstream from Raf and, in particular, to identify which MAP kinase pathways were involved in MUC2 expression, various kinase inhibitors were tested for their ability to reduce MUC2 transcription. Specific inhibitors of MEK (PD98059, U0126) completely inhibited basal as well as PMA-induced MUC2. To confirm the involvement of MEK in mediating the effects of PMA, we co-transfected wild-type and dominant-negative forms of MEK with the −1628/+19MUC2 promoter construct and showed that PMA induction ofMUC2 transcriptional activity was inhibited by dominant-negative MEK. These findings indicate that the induction ofMUC2 transcriptional activity by PMA is MEK-dependent. Additionally, AG126, which is an inhibitor of ERK2 phosphorylation, caused a significant decrease inMUC2 transcriptional activity. Western blots using antibodies specific for phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK showed that ERK1/2 is rapidly phosphorylated in response to PMA treatment. We were not able to demonstrate any PMA effect on SAPK/JNK. p38 was shown to be constitutively activated in this cell line, and it showed a small increase in phosphorylation upon by PMA treatment in some experiments. However, the SB203580 inhibitor of p38 did not affectMUC2 transcriptional activity, indicating that p38 is not required for stimulation of MUC2 transcription. This is an important observation because it has been shown that p38 is a downstream kinase responsible for Raf-independent Ras activation of NF-κB (36Norris J.L. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13841-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Inhibition of basal MUC2 transcription by N17Ras indicates that there is some basal activation of Ras and downstream effectors, which may derive from the fact that HM3 cells express mutant G12D K-Ras. This glycine-to-aspartate mutant form of K-Ras is the most common form found in colorectal carcinomas, occurring more frequently than the more intensely studied G12V mutant forms. The G12D K-Ras has been reported to be less active than the G12V forms and, consequently, has biological and biochemical properties intermediate to the wild-type and G12V isoforms (37Al-Mulla F. Milner-White E.J. Going J.J. Birnie G.D. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that N17Ras will only inhibit wild-type but not oncogenic Ras forms; the latter, because of their very low GTPase activity, remain in the active GTP-bound form and thus do not rely on exchange factors for reactivation. However, the ability of N17Ras to inhibit basal MUC2 transcription suggests that the G12D K-Ras form, because of its 4-fold higher GTPase activity (37Al-Mulla F. Milner-White E.J. Going J.J. Birnie G.D. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), is susceptible to inhibition by N17Ras. The occurrence of the G12D K-Ras mutation in HM3 cells may be expected to produce a low-level activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and the resulting basal MUC2 expression. Dominant-negative mutants of both Raf and MEK, as well as MEK inhibitors PD98059 and UO126, negatively affected basal as well as PMA-up-regulated MUC2transcription, consistent with low-level constitutive activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Lending further support for this possibility is the observation of low-level phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in Western blots of lysates from untreated HM3 cells. Transfection with activated (G12V) v-H-Ras produced an up-regulation of MUC2 transcription. The ability of PMA to further up-regulate MUC2 transcription in the presence of v-H-Ras suggests that there may be further activation of the endogenous, functionally distinct K- and N-Ras isoforms or that oncogenic v-H-Ras is capable of activating MUC2-responsive pathways that are not activated by wild-type Ras. Many (>50) different proteins, including transcription factors and kinases, have been identified as downstream targets of ERK1/2, including S6 kinase p90rsk and EGF receptor, as well as transcription factors such as Elk-1, Ets1, c-Myc, and signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (30Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 33Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Whereas dominant-negative pp90rsk was previously shown to inhibit MUC2 transcription stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (27Li J.-D. Feng W. Gallup M. Kim J.-H. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), we were unable to demonstrate the same effect on PMA-induced transcription. This indicates that events downstream of ERK1/2 may be different for lipopolysaccharideversus PMA. Thus, whereas pp90rsk was proposed to mediate lipopolysaccharide-stimulated NF-κB activation (27Li J.-D. Feng W. Gallup M. Kim J.-H. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), it appears that pp90rsk is not responsible for PMA-mediated activation of NF-κB. Further experiments are required to confirm and elucidate this point. Recently, ERK2 has been reported to phosphorylate Sp1 (38Merchant J.L., Du, M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A functional Sp1 binding site was previously identified in the proximal region of the MUC2 promoter between bases −94 and −65 (26Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In our analysis of the effect of PMA on MUC2 deletion constructs, this region also appears to confer PMA responsiveness. As well as Sp1, a number of other unidentified proteins also bound to this −94/−65 oligonucleotide, giving a complex pattern in EMSA (26Gum J.R. Hicks J.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, using this same oligonucleotide we were unable to detect any differences between PMA-treated and -untreated cells. 2H.-W. Lee, D.-H. Ahn, S. C. Crawley, J.-D. Li, J. R. Gum, Jr., C. B. Basbaum, N. Q. Fan, D. E. Szymkowski, S.-Y. Han, B. H. Lee, M. H. Sleisenger, and Y. S. Kim, unpublished results. It is possible that this region of the promoter is important but that PMA-induced up-regulation involves increased transcriptional activity of Sp1 or other nuclear factors that are already bound to this proximal region of the MUC2 promoter. Further experiments are required to identify the PMA-responsive, ERK-activated MUC2 promoter elements. Transcription factor NF-κB plays a crucial role in the regulation of numerous genes involved in the inflammatory response and control of cell death. Activation of NF-κB is mediated through phosphorylation, ubiquination, and subsequent degradation of inhibitor IκB. This enables the free NF-κB dimer (p50/p65) to translocate to the nucleus and activate target genes (39Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). The ultimate upstream mediators of NF-κB activation, for example the IκB kinase complex and its activating kinases, are still in the process of being identified. The transcriptional activity of NF-κB is also enhanced directly by phosphorylation at various sites on both subunits. The kinases responsible for these phosphorylations may include Ras, PKA, and PKC. These enzymes and the consequences of phosphorylations at multiple sites are currently being elucidated (39Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar, 40Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). MUC2 was previously shown to be up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide via Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/pp90rsk/NF-κB in lung epithelial cells (27Li J.-D. Feng W. Gallup M. Kim J.-H. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). CAPE, an inhibitor of NF-κB translocation, reduced endogenous as well as PMA-up-regulated MUC2 transcription, indicating that NF-κB is also involved in MUC2 transcription induced by PMA. Furthermore, EMSAs using an oligonucleotide containing the previously identified MUC2 NF-κB site demonstrated that nuclear extracts from PMA-treated HM3 cells gave more intense bands than nuclear extracts from untreated cells. Finally, the transcriptional competence of the NF-κB cis element was demonstrated using promoter-reporter constructs containing the same region of theMUC2 promoter from bases −1528 to −1307 inserted upstream of the minimal thymidylate kinase promoter. Because pp90rsk was not shown to be involved in MUC2 up-regulation, NF-κB is likely activated via another Ras-activated pathway, such as Raf/MEKK1/IκK/IκB or Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/IκK/IκB. In conclusion, we demonstrate that treatment of HM3 cells with PMA results in activation of PKC, stimulating the ERK MAP kinase pathway and up-regulating MUC2 in a Ras- and Raf-dependent manner. NF-κB was also shown to be directly involved in MUC2 up-regulation by PMA. In contrast to previous work on MUC2 transcription using lipopolysaccharide as an inducer, the effects of PMA are independent of Src and pp90rsk and are complicated by the involvement of other, proximal cis elements within the MUC2 promoter.

Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Most of the channels cloned and characterized so far from the TRPC subfamily and also the vanilloid receptors TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV4 have only a moderate selectivity for Ca2+ over monovalent cations. Functional characterization of the recently cloned ECaC subfamily of cation channels (2Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Hartog A. van de Graaf S.F. van Os C.H. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. J. Biol.

This subfamily is restricted to two homologous members, namely ECaC1 and ECaC2 (previously named calcium transporter 1 (CaT1)). These novel Ca2+ channels are implicated in hormonal-regulated active Ca2+ transport in epithelia-like kidney and small intestine. Both channels consist of six transmembrane-spanning domains including a putative pore-forming region between transmembrane segments 5 and 6. Genomic analysis shows that ECaC1 and ECaC2 originate from two genes juxtaposed on human chromosome 7q35 and mouse chromosome 6 (5Müller D. Hoenderop J.G. Merkx G.F. van Os C.H. Bindels R.J.

We have recently described that ECaC1 and ECaC2 share several functional properties but also functional differences (8Hoenderop J.G.J. Vennekens R. Müller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.M.

When heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, both ECaC members function as highly Ca2+-selective channels that are constitutively open (10Nilius B. Vennekens R. Prenen J.

Both channels have the same Eisenman X permeation sequence for monovalent cations, the same single channel conductance in the absence of extracellular divalent cations, and display anomalous mole fraction behavior. Monovalent cation currents through ECaC are blocked by extracellular Mg2+ with an IC50 of 200 μm (−80 mV) and by extracellular Ca2+ with an IC50between 0.2 and 2 μm (−80 mV) (10Nilius B. Vennekens R.

Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that also intracellular Mg2+ blocks both channels in a voltage-dependent manner (15Voets T. Prenen J. Fleig A. Vennekens R. Watanabe H. Hoenderop J.G.J. Bindels R.J.M. Droogmans G. Penner R. Nilius B. J. Biol.

ECaC1 and ECaC2 are inhibited by intracellular Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, with an IC50 of 200 nm (8Hoenderop J.G.J. Vennekens R. Müller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.M. Nilius B. J. Physiol.

Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Ruthenium Red is so far the most potent blocker of both channels; however, ECaC1 is significantly more sensitive compared with ECaC2 with IC50 values of 120 nm and 9 μm, respectively (8Hoenderop J.G.J. Vennekens R. Müller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.M. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 16Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G.J. Bindels R.J.M. Droogmans G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are essential differences between ECaC1 and ECaC2. ECaC1 and ECaC2 show in the presence of extracellular Ca2+a fast initial inactivation at negative membrane potentials. However, this inactivation is much slower for ECaC1 (8Hoenderop J.G.J. Vennekens R. Müller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.M. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar) in comparison with ECaC2. Also with Ba2+ as the charge carrier, ECaC2 inactivates much slower and more complete than ECaC1 (8Hoenderop J.G.J. Vennekens R. Müller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.M. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This last feature is the most pronounced kinetic difference between ECaC1 and ECaC2. The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the structural determination of ECaC1 and ECaC2, which are responsible for the differences in channel kinetics. To this end, chimeras were constructed from N and C termini and intracellular loops of these channels heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells and subsequently studied by patch clamp analysis. Surprisingly, the N and C termini of both channels are not responsible for the distinctive kinetic differences between ECaC1 and ECaC2. However, we identified a region in the intracellular linker between transmembrane domains 2 and 3 (TM2 and TM3) that determines the initial current decay and the degree of inactivation. The entire open reading frame from mouse ECaC2/CaT1 was cloned as aEcoRI fragment from pSPORT-mECaC2 in the pCINeo/IRES-GFP vector. This bicistronic expression vector pCINeo/IRES-GFP/ECaC2 was used to co-express ECaC2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). The entire open reading frame from rbECaC1 was cloned as aPvuII-BamHI fragment in the pCINeo/IRES-GFP vector as described previously (12Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To exchange the ECaC1 N terminus for the ECaC2 N terminus, a unique BspEI site has been incorporated at amino acid position Ser221-Tyr222 without affecting the amino acid composition. The N terminus of ECaC1 was cloned as a NheI-BspEI fragment into the ECaC2 expression vector, resulting in a chimeric transcript ECaC1-N2, and vice versa for ECaC2, resulting in ECaC2-N1. A similar strategy was applied to swap the C-terminal tails by introducing a unique BsiWI site at amino acid position Arg615-Ser616. TheNheI-BsiWI fragments were exchanged, resulting in ECaC1-C2 and ECaC2-C1, respectively. Subsequently, using the introduced restriction sites, chimeric transcripts were constructed containing the ECaC1 core protein with the N- and C-terminal tail of ECaC2 (ECaC1-N2C2) and the ECaC2 core protein with the N- and C-terminal tail of ECaC1 (ECaC2-N1C1). Finally, the four discriminating amino acids in the intracellular loop between TM2 and TM3 of ECaC2 (L409V, V411A, T412S, and F414Y) were mutated according to the ECaC1 sequence and vice versa by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (12Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). All of the constructed transcripts were verified by sequence analysis. HEK 293 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) human serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 2 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 10% (v/v) CO2. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the pCINeo/IRES-GFP/rbECaC1 or pCINeo/IRES-GFP/mECaC2 vector using methods as described previously (12Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M.

Transfected cells were visually identified in the patch clamp setup. GFP was excited at a wavelength between 425 and 475 nm. A 495-nm dichroic mirror was used for GFP, and the emitted light was passed through a 500-nm long pass filter for GFP. The ECaC1/ECaC2-expressing cells were identified by their green fluorescence, and GFP-negative cells from the same batch of cells were used as controls. Electrophysiological methods have been described previously in detail (11Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol.

Whole-cell currents were measured with an EPC-9 (sampling rate 0.2 ms, 8-pole Bessel filter 10 kHz, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany) or an L/M-EPC-7 (List Elektronics, Darmstadt, Germany) using ruptured patches. Electrode resistances were between 2 and 5 megohms, and capacitance and access resistance were monitored continuously. A ramp protocol consisting of linear voltage ramps changing from −100 to +100 mV within 400 ms was applied every 5 s. To study inactivation and the much slower current decay with Ca2+ as the charge carrier in a single protocol, we have applied 3-s voltage steps to −100 mV from a holding potential of +20 or +70 mV. Fast inactivation was assessed by the time for 10% decay of the current, the slower run down by the time constant of a monoexponential fit to the current during the last 1.5 s of the step. Current densities expressed per unit membrane capacitance were calculated from the current at −80 mV during the ramp protocols. The standard extracellular solution (Krebs-Ringer phosphate solution) contained (in mm) 150 NaCl, 6 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH. The concentration of Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, or Mn2+ was varied between 1 and 30 mm as indicated in the text. Nominally free Ca2+ concentration was estimated at 10 μm. Ca2+-free solutions were buffered by 5 mm EGTA at a free [Ca2+] below 1 nm as calculated by the CaBuf program (G. Droogmans, ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/cabuf.zip). To inhibit monovalent cation currents, 150 mm NaCl was replaced with an equimolar amount of NMDG-Cl. The standard internal (pipette) solution contained (in mm) 20 CsCl, 100 Cs-aspartate, 1 MgCl2, 10 BAPTA, 4 Na2ATP, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, adjusted with CsOH. Cells were kept in a nominally Ca2+-free medium to prevent Ca2+ overload and exposed for maximum of 5 min to a Krebs-Ringer phosphate solution containing 1.5 mmCa2+ before sealing the patch pipette to the cell. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the case of significance (p < 0.01), individual groups were compared by Student's t test. Experimental data were fitted to a monoexponential function using the fitting routine of the WinASCD program (G. Droogmans). Dose-inhibition data were fitted to a dose response function using Origin software version 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northhampton, MA). Inactivation of ECaC1 and ECaC2 currents with Ca2+ or Ba2+ as the charge carrier at negative potentials revealed the most striking functional difference between both channels. Fig. 1, A and B, shows representative current traces during a voltage step to −100 mV in solutions with all monovalent cations substituted by NMDG+. Therefore, inward currents were carried by either Ca2+ or Ba2+. The initial rapid phase of inactivation of ECaC2 assessed from the time to 10% current decay was significantly faster than that of ECaC1 (Fig. 1C). The late decay of the current assessed from the time constant of a monoexponential fit to the last 1.5 s of the voltage step to −100 mV was not significantly different between the two channels (Fig.1D). If Ba2+ was used as the charge carrier, the time to 10% inactivation for ECaC1 was only modestly prolonged compared with the Ca2+ current (Fig. 1E). However, for ECaC2, these differences were significantly more pronounced (Fig. 1F) as is obvious from Fig. 1, insets in A and B, which shows the currents normalized to the peak values with Ca2+ as the charge carrier. Time to 10% inactivation was 112 ± 14 ms (n = 41) for Ca2+ currents through ECaC1 and 169 ± 21 ms (n = 15) for Ba2+currents. The same measurements for ECaC2 resulted in 45 ± 5 ms (n = 24) for Ca2+ and 830 ± 95 ms (n = 17) for Ba2+. The kinetic difference between both channels can be more impressively described by the ratio between these times, t10%,Ca/t10%,Ba, which was 0.66 for ECaC1 but 0.05 for ECaC2. The ratio of the Ca2+ and Ba2+ current densities was also significantly different between ECaC1 (0.69 ± 0.05 (n = 12)) and ECaC2 (0.39 ± 0.03 (n = 15)). The N-terminal tails of ECaC1 (N1) and ECaC2 (N2), which share 81.3% homology, were exchanged to identify the structural determinants for the functional differences between these two channels. Fig.2 shows typical traces of the inactivation of Ca2+ and Ba2+ currents for both chimeras. For ECaC1-N2, the chimera in which the ECaC1 N terminus was substituted by that of ECaC2, the time for 10% inactivation of the Ca2+ current remained long (210 ± 55 ms, n = 6) as is typical for ECaC1 (Fig. 2A) (see Fig. 4 for a summary of the analysis). In contrast, the time for 10% inactivation of the Ba2+ current was prolonged compared with that of wild-type ECaC1 (313 ± 79 ms, n = 6) but was still much shorter than that of ECaC2. The kinetic coefficient, t10%,Ca/t10%,Ba, was nearly identical to ECaC1. The ratioIBa/ICa was 1.03 ± 0.12 (n = 6, same cells). This ratio reflects the ECaC1 more than the ECaC2 phenotype. However, Ba2+ currents through this chimera were significantly larger compared with ECaC1.FIG. 4Summary of the fast decay by swapping of the N and C termini between ECaC1 and ECaC2. A, the time to 10% inactivation with 30 mm Ca2+ as the charge carrier (data for ECaC1 shown on top and ECaC2 onbottom). All data are from between 4 and 41 cells.B, ratio of the time to 10% inactivation for Ca2+ and Ba2+(t10%Ca/t10%Ba).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The phenotype of ECaC2-N1 obtained by exchanging the N terminus of ECaC2 for that of ECaC1 was very similar to that of wild-type ECaC2. However, the decay of the Ba2+ current is significantly slower compared with the Ca2+ current (Fig. 2B). The time to 10% decay of the Ca2+ current was not significantly altered compared with wild-type ECaC2 (69 ± 11, n = 9), whereas the Ba2+ current is again prolonged (529 ± 136, n = 9). The ratioIBa/ICa was 0.45 ± 0.08 (n = 7, values only from the same cells) and not significantly different from wild-type ECaC2. Because the exchange of the N-terminal tails did not affect the inactivation kinetics of the ECaC channel, we exchanged their C-terminal tails, which display a homology of 61%. It is obvious from the current traces in Fig. 2C that the time course of inactivation of the ECaC1-C2 chimera in which the ECaC1 C terminus is substituted by the complete C-terminal tail of ECaC2 is not significantly different from wild-type ECaC1 (t10%,Ca = 230 ± 49, n = 9, and t10%,Ba = 379 ± 66, n = 10). However, the ratioIBa/ICa was significantly increased to 1.15 ± 0.17 (n = 8) compared with wild-type ECaC1. Similarly, the kinetic properties of ECaC2-C1 obtained by replacing the ECaC2 C terminus with the C-terminal tail of ECaC1 were identical to those of wild-type ECaC2 (Fig. 2D). The time to 10% inactivation was 35 ± 7 ms (n = 11) for Ca2+ currents and 918 ± 112 ms (n= 12) for Ba2+ currents. Similarly, theIBa/ICa ratios were not significantly different, i.e. 0.43 ± 0.04 (n = 10) for ECaC2-C1 compared with 0.49 for the wild type. In the next experiment, the effects of exchanging both N and C termini were studied. Fig. 3 summarizes the obtained results. The time to 10% inactivation of both Ca2+ and Ba2+ currents was significantly prolonged if ECaC1 contained both the N and the C termini of ECaC2 (t10%,Ca = 512 ± 167 ms, n = 6, and t10%,Ba = 825 ± 182 ms, n = 4). However, as for all chimeras, the differences between the kinetics of the Ca2+ and Ba2+ currents were small (t10%,Ca/t10%,Ba = 0.62), and the fast initial phase of inactivation was lacking (Fig. 3, A and B). TheIBa/ICa ratio of 1.06 ± 0.09 (n = 4, same cells) was increased but matched again the ECaC1 rather than the ECaC2 phenotypes. As for the other chimeras, the fast component of inactivation and the large differences in kinetics of the Ca2+ and Ba2+currents were conserved whether the N- and the C-terminal tail of ECaC2 was exchanged with those of ECaC1 (t10%,Ca = 94 ± 18 ms, n = 5, and t10%,Ca/t10%,Ba = 678 ± 87 ms, n = 5) (Fig. 3, C and D). The ratio between the Ba2+ and Ca2+ currents, IBa/ICa, was 0.56 ± 0.08 (n = 5, same cells) and similar to the ECaC2 phenotype. Both chimeras exhibit similar expression levels, i.e. the density of the monovalent cation current in the absence of divalent cations at −80 mV was −692 ± 46 pA/pF (n = 8) for ECaC1-N2C2 and −827 ± 114 pA/pF (n = 6) for ECaC2-N1C1. Fig. 4 summarizes the data concerning the initial fast inactivation. The time to 10% decay of the Ca2+ current for all ECaC1 chimeras ranged between 100 and 500 ms. For ECaC2 and its chimeric proteins, the 10% current decay occurred in <100 ms (Fig. 4A). The initial decay of Ba2+ currents was slower than that of the Ca2+currents. The ratio of the time to 10% decay of the Ca2+current and the Ba2+ current (t10%,Ca/t10%,Ba) ranged between 0.5 and 0.9 for ECaC1 and its corresponding chimeras and was < 0.25 for ECaC2 and the corresponding chimeras. The fraction of open channels at the end of a 3-s hyperpolarizing step expressed as the ratio of the current densities at the end of the pulse and the peak current was similar for all of the chimeras and for both charge carriers. This ratio, which scatters substantially and also depends on the size of the current (8Hoenderop J.G.J. Vennekens R. Müller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.M. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar), was <15% at the end of the pulse (Fig. 5), suggesting that the swapping of the N and C termini did not significantly affect the inactivation behavior. Therefore, the exchange of either or both N and C termini between ECaC1 and ECaC2 did not change severely the inactivation kinetics of the wild-type channel, indicating that other domains or even the core structure may determine the discriminating inactivation kinetics of ECaC1 and ECaC2. Because the exchange of the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal tails did not affect the phenotype of the channel kinetics, we replaced the intracellular linker between TM2 and TM3 (ICL1ECac1 for the ECaC1 linker and ICL1ECaC2 for the ECaC2 linker). Intriguingly, the inactivation properties of the ECaC2 channel were drastically affected by substitution of its first intracellular loop with that of ECaC1 (Fig. 6). Panel A shows the main kinetic features of ECaC2 including fast initial inactivation, delayed inactivation with Ba2+ as the charge carrier, dramatic differences in the time to 10% inactivation between Ca2+ and Ba2+ currents, and a smaller current density of Ba2+ compared with the Ca2+currents. The inactivation of both Ca2+ and Ba2+ currents was delayed in the loop1 ECaC2/ICL1ECac1 chimera (Fig. 6, B and C). In addition, the fraction of channels inactivated at the end of the 3-s pulse was much less in ECaC2− compared with wild-type ECaC2 (Fig. 6D), indicating a defect of ECaC2 inactivation in this chimeric protein. The times to 10% inactivation were 929 ± 150 ms (n = 11) for Ca2+ and 2878 ± 40 ms (n = 8) for Ba2+. In this analysis, the t10% of the current that did not inactivate at all was set at 3 s, which is identical to the step duration. Thus, these quantitative data even represent an underestimation. The ratio between Ba2+ and Ca2+ current, IBa/ICa, was 0.36 ± 0.03 (n = 9, same cells), reflecting the ECaC2 phenotype. Similar results were obtained with 10 mmBa2+ and Ca2+ as the charge carrier (data not shown, n = 12). Whether the opposite chimera, the first intracellular loop of ECaC2, ICL1ECaC2, was introduced in ECaC1 (chimera ECaC1/ICL1ECaC2), no dramatic changes were observed, although it displayed some features of the ECaC2 phenotype. Fig. 6E showed the kinetic behavior of this chimera. In contrast to wild-type ECaC1, the initial inactivation was significantly accelerated, e.g. from 112 ± 14 ms (n= 41) to 15 ± 3 ms (n = 9) for ECaC1/ICL1ECaC2 (Fig. 6F). This value is much closer to ECaC2 (45 ± 5 ms, n = 24). Also in contrast to ECaC1, which does not strongly differentiate during the initial phase of inactivation between Ca2+ and Ba2+, the ECaC1/ICL1ECaC2 chimera has now a strikingly delayed time to 10% inactivation for Ba2+ as compared with Ca2+ (130 ± 25 ms, n = 8). The ratio between both times, t10%,Ca/t10%,Ba was 0.18 ± 0.05, which was closer to the ECaC2 than to the ECaC1 phenotype. In addition, the ratio between the peak Ba2+ and Ca2+ currents, IBa/ICa was 0.47 ± 0.06, which is intermediate between the ECaC1 and ECaC2 phenotypes. The fraction of channels, which are open at the end of the 3-s step, was dramatically changed in the ECaC2/ICL1ECaC1 chimera. However, the same change from ECaC2 to ECaC1 resulted again in the ECaC2 phenotype. The inactivation of the Ca2+ currents was nearly complete in both ECaC1 and ECaC2 (0.05 ± 0.02, n = 12, and 0.06 ± 0.03, n = 10). The inactivation of Ba2+ currents through ECaC2 was diminished as compared with ECaC1 (0.13 ± 0.03, n= 10, for ECaC2 and 0.07 ± 0.01, n = 10, for ECaC1). Similar data were measured for the ECaC1/ICL1ECaC2chimera, e.g. 0.11 ± 0.03 (n = 8) for Ba2+ and 0.030 ± 0.004 (n = 9) for Ca2+. Thus, the kinetic behavior of this chimera further supports the essential role of the intracellular linker between TM2 and TM3 as a critical determinant of the kinetic behavior of the ECaC channels. To identify the amino acid residues, which might be crucial for this dramatic change in phenotype, we have exchanged the divergent residues in TM2-TM3 of ECaC2 by the corresponding amino acids from the TM2-TM3 loop in ECaC1, i.e. L409V, V411A, T412S, and F414Y (Fig.7). The effects of swapping the entire TM2-TM3 loop are depicted at the top rows of the four panels. The mutations at positions 409, 411, and 412 cause a significant delay of the initial decay of the Ca2+ current and a more pronounced prolongation of the inactivation of the Ba2+ current. These mutations resulted in a highly significant decrease of inactivation assessed from the ratio between the current at the end of the pulse and the peak current. An exchange of Phe-414 into a tyrosine had no effect. These data indicate that the N-terminal part of this intracellular linker is critically involved in controlling ECaC2 inactivation. This study demonstrates that the intracellular loop between TM2 and TM3, particularly Leu-409, Val-411, and Thr-412, determines the initial rapid inactivation kinetics of ECaC1 and ECaC2, whereas the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal tails do not contribute significantly. Voltage-operated Ca2+ channels contain in the N and C termini major determinants of the inactivation process (17Kepplinger K.J. Kahr H. Forstner G. Sonnleitner M. Schindler H. Schmidt T. Groschner K.

(Lond.). 2001; 530: 35-45Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Likewise, the N and C termini of the ECaCs contain many putative regulatory domains including protein kinase C and calmodulin-activating kinase phosphorylation sites, postsynaptic density protein, Disc large tumor suppressor, Zonula occludens protein motifs, and ankyrin repeats (2Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

It has been recently shown that the human isoform CaT-L is highly homologous to ECaC2 and inactivates in a Ca2+-dependent manner via a multiphasic process. This process is characterized by a rapid Ca2+-dependent phase followed by a Ca2+-CaM-dependent phase (24Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The calmodulin-dependent inactivation can be counteracted by the phosphorylation of a protein kinase C site in the C terminus (24Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the proposed calmodulin binding site in human CaT-L is not conserved, and also the protein kinase C site, which counteracts Ca2+-dependent inactivation in CaT-L, is not present in ECaC1. Therefore, the swapping of the C termini of both ECaC channels could further evaluate such a mechanism. The cytoplasmic tails of ECaC1 and ECaC2 were exchanged, and the chimeric proteins expressed in HEK 293 cells were studied by patch clamp analysis. Surprisingly, the swapping of the entire intracellular N and C termini did not basically alter the inactivation kinetics of ECaC1 and ECaC2. Of note, Suzuki et al. (25Suzuki M. Ishibashi K. Ooki G. Tsuruoka S. Imai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in the C terminus, the Q579H mutation in ECaC1 and the corresponding H587Q mutation in ECaC2 play a role in the inactivation process. However, in this latter study, the inactivation process was not studied in detail, and the information on the fast and subsequent slower inactivation process is lacking. However, this study indicates that the cytoplasmic tails of ECaC1 and ECaC2 are not responsible for the difference in inactivation behavior of both channels. A detailed comparison of the intracellular loops of ECaC1 and ECaC2 demonstrated that the domain between TM3 and TM4 is identical, whereas the loop between TM2 and TM3 contains four conserved amino acid differences (26Hoenderop J.G.J. Müller D. Suzuki M. van Os C.H. Bindels R.J.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Chimeras were constructed in which the discriminating TM2-TM3 loop was exchanged. A subsequent electrophysiological analysis demonstrated that the characteristic fast inactivation of the ECaC2 current was absent in the ECaC2/ICL11 chimera and therefore mimicked the inactivation kinetics of ECaC1. The point mutations of the discriminating four amino acids revealed that Leu-409, Thr-412, and to a lesser extent Val-411 but not Phe-414 convey the molecular determinants of the fast inactivation process occurring in ECaC2. Importantly, this observation is further substantiated by the finding that transferring the ECaC2 TM2-TM3 linker to ECaC1 resulted in a shift of the kinetic phenotype of ECaC1 toward ECaC2. Especially, the inactivation of ECaC1 is accelerated, and the kinetic discrimination between Ca2+ and Ba2+ is accentuated. Interestingly, this critical motif is not present in other channel proteins and does not resemble the classical calmodulin-binding domain. Interestingly, we have identified a short stretch of amino acids that is involved in the fast inactivation of ECaC2 when Ca2+ is the charge carrier. This situation is similar to Ca2+-dependent inactivation of L-type α1C Ca2+ channels (27Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 28Zühlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30794-30802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In the study by Pitt et al. (29Pitt G.S. Zühlke R.D. Hudmon A. Schulman H. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30794-30802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), it has been shown that Ca2+-dependent inactivation requires the tethering of the Ca2+ sensor calmodulin to an effector region, which is supported by other stretches of amino acids. These stretches contain putative calmodulin-binding sequences. It is intriguing to speculate a similar role for the linker identified here. This linker is a critical motif, which is not present in other channel proteins. It does not resemble the classical calmodulin-binding domain but might contain a new calmodulin binding sequence or another inactivation mechanism, including interaction with another Ca2+ sensor, could be operative. Another distinctive feature of both Ca2+ channels is that the ratio of Ba2+ and Ca2+ currents, IBa/ICa, through both channels is different (8Hoenderop J.G.J. Vennekens R. Müller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J.M. Nilius B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar), e.g. the ratio is significantly larger for ECaC1 than for ECaC2. This ratio may result from a smaller single channel conductance for Ba2+ than for Ca2+ for ECaC2 in comparison with ECaC1 or a decreased open probability of ECaC2 if Ba2+ is the charge carrier. This feature is again conserved for all chimeras including the loop chimera. The current ratio for all chimeras with the ECaC1 core was in a range between 0.69 and 1.15, whereas for all chimeras with the ECaC2 core, the ratio scattered between 0.39 and 0.56. This feature is also not changed by the translocation of the first intracellular linker and the mutations within this linker. This conserved behavior indicates that the mechanism by which both channels differentially discriminate between Ba2+ and Ca2+ is not located in the swapped domains and rather may be related to other region of the channels including the pore. In conclusion, the present observations suggest that the residues Leu-409, Val-411, and Thr-412 present in the intracellular loop between TM2 and TM3 determine the fast inactivation of ECaC2. The ECaC2 residues may form part of an inactivation gate receptor region, and the definition of the state-dependent events may elucidate the molecular interactions important for gating transitions among closed, open, and inactivated states of the epithelial Ca2+channel.

However, the molecular mechanism of the intracellular actions of SPP remains unclear. Here we have cloned a novel sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1)-binding protein, RPK118, by yeast two-hybrid screening. RPK118 contains several functional domains whose sequences are homologous to other known proteins including the phox homology domain and pseudokinase 1 and 2 domains and is shown to be a member of an evolutionarily highly conserved gene family. The pseudokinase 2 domain of RPK118 is responsible for SPHK1 binding as judged by yeast two-hybrid screening and immunoprecipitation studies. RPK118 is also shown to co-localize with SPHK1 on early endosomes in COS7 cells expressing both recombinant proteins. Furthermore, RPK118 specifically binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) by acting both as an extracellular agonist and an intracellular messenger (3Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The extracellular effects of SPP are mediated by the recently identified endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) receptors, novel members of the G-protein-coupled heptahelical receptor family (4Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For example, the binding of SPP to HEK293 cells stably expressing EDG-1 induced the inhibition of cAMP accumulation and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner (5Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the following findings were important clues to a specific intracellular action of SPP. First, the activation of various plasma membrane receptors such as the platelet-derived growth factor (6Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 7Bornfeldt K.E. Graves L.M. Raines E.W. Igarashi Y. Wayman G. Yamamura S. Yatomi Y. Sidhu J.S. Krebs E.G. Hakomori S. Ross R. J.

Nature. 1996; 380: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) was found to rapidly increase intracellular SPP production through the stimulation of SPHK. Second, microinjected SPP mobilized Ca2+ from the internal stores of cells that had been pretreated with pertussis toxin to inactivate Gi- or Go-coupled receptor signaling (9Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Alemany R. Laser K.T. Neumann E. Zhang C. Schmidt M. Rauen U. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2830-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Third, the manipulation of intracellular SPP content in yeast cells, which lack a cell surface receptor for SPP, by the overexpression or deletion of genes that encode SPHK has revealed an important role for SPP in yeast survival and proliferation during exposure to heat or nutrient-deprivation stress. However, the intracellular site of action of SPP remains unknown. The present studies were designed to determine the intracellular site of action of SPP by identifying molecules interacting with sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1) using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Here we have identified a novel evolutionarily conserved SPHK1-binding protein, RPK118. Molecular and biochemical characteristics of this new molecule are described herein. Full-length mouse sphingosine kinase-1a cDNA (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTMaccession no. AF068748) was cloned into pGBKT7 (CLONTECH) in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The bait was transformed into the yeast strain AH109 together with the rat brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the pGADT7 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (CLONTECH). DNA from positive clones was prepared from yeast and transformed into competent DH5α (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) according to standard protocols. From partial RPK118 cDNA sequence information, a complete human RPK118 cDNA was obtained (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession no.AB070706) by using a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) method as described (10Sarkar S. Miwa N. Kominami H. Igarashi N. Hayashi S. Okada T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 599-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the total human brain cDNA reverse transcribed from fetal human brain mRNA (Invitrogen). The full-length RPK118, a PSK2 fragment, or RPKΔPSK were each subcloned into mammalian expression vector pCMV5 with a FLAG-epitope tag to express N-terminal FLAG-tagged fusion proteins in mammalian cells. RPK118 was also cloned into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) for N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused expression. For the transient expression studies, COS7 cells were grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes to ∼70% confluency. The cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA per dish using 12 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were grown for 36–48 h and then assayed. COS7 cells transiently expressing both FLAG-RPK118 and influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-SPHK1 were lysed in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 1% (w/v) Brij 97 (Sigma) and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were carried out as described (10Sarkar S. Miwa N. Kominami H. Igarashi N. Hayashi S. Okada T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 599-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) and the anti-HA antibody (Roche). COS7 cells expressing FLAG-RPK118 or FLAG-ribosomal S6 kinase 3 (RSK3) were lysed in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors). FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody M2 beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed and measured for in vitroprotein kinase activity without or with 250 μm S6 peptide (Upstate Biotechnology) as described (11Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The incorporation of32P into the S6 peptide absorbed on P-81 paper was determined by Cerenkov counting. For autophosphorylation, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by quantification using a Fujix Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film). Poly(A)+RNA blots containing 1 μg of poly(A)+RNA per lane from multiple human tissues (CLONTECH) were hybridized with the32P-labeled 900-bp BamHI fragment of pCMV5-human RPK118. Hybridization was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Bands were visualized using a Fujix Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000. Transfected COS7 cells were seeded on coverslips (Nalge Nunc) at a density of 106 cells ml−1, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C, washed three times, and incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C. Microscopy was performed with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC1024). For double staining, control scans confirmed that no bleed-through was detectable under the condition used. No signal was obtained if the first antibody was omitted. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rat or anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). The early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-RPK118 generated in the Sf9 cell expression system as described previously (10Sarkar S. Miwa N. Kominami H. Igarashi N. Hayashi S. Okada T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 599-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was further purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The purified GST-RPK118 was used to probe bovine serum albumin-blocked nitrocellulose filters (Echelon Research Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT) on which various phospholipids had been spotted. The filters were washed, and GST-RPK118 bound to the filters was detected using the anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences). In an effort to identify proteins that may participate in the recruitment of SPHK to the right destination where intracellular SPP will accumulate, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA library using full-length mouse SPHK1 cDNA as bait. Four independent clones encoding amino acid sequences almost identical to the C-terminal region of a previously reported “human ribosomal S6 kinase” gene product (RSK52) with a calculated molecular mass of 52kDa (12Zhang H., Yu, L. Mao N., Fu, Q., Tu, Q. Gao J. Zhao S. Genomics. 1999; 61: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) were isolated (Fig. 1A). We assumed that the four clones are parts of a rat homologue of human RSK52. We then isolated the human RSK52 gene from fetal human brain cDNA and used it for transient transfection studies. However, for unknown reasons we failed to express this human RSK52 protein when the cDNA encoding human RSK52 was transfected into COS7 cells (data not shown). Upon further analysis, this sequence turned out to be incomplete because of a frameshift misreading. We have determined the full-length sequence of the cDNA by using the 5′-RACE method (Fig. 1B). The identified 3201-bp cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a novel 1066 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 118 kDa. By using the BLAST algorithm, we have identified four domains homologous to previously characterized proteins including a phox homology (PX) domain (13Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), a Saccharomyces cerevisiaeEnd13/Vps4, sorting nexin 15, andEmericella nidulansPalB-homology (ESP) domain (14Phillips S.A. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Haft C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5074-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and pseudokinase 1 (PSK1) and 2 (PSK2) domains (Fig.2, and see below). The PX domain, the function of which is as yet unknown, is an evolutionarily conserved sequence that is present in a number of proteins with diverse functions, including proteins involved in vesicular trafficking (15Cheever M.L.

The ESP domain, whose function is also unclear at present, may be involved in the association of the Vps4p protein with endosomal membranes (19Babst M. Wendland B. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2982-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of RPK118 contains two conserved sequences arranged in tandem that show homology to the regions essential for the catalytic activity of RSK3 (20Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). The first sequence (residues 340–426) corresponds to the kinase subdomains I to V (Fig.3A), whereas the second sequence (residues 906–1066) corresponds to the kinase subdomains VIA to XI (Fig. 3B) with a large unrelated insert between the sequences (Fig. 1B). The GXGXXG motif essential for ATP binding in the first sequence, which corresponds to the kinase subdomain I of RSK3, and the DFG motif important for conferring Mg2+ sensitivity to the enzyme in the second sequence, which corresponds to the kinase subdomain VII of RSK3, were both mutated as shown in Fig. 3, A and B, suggesting that the protein is defective in phosphotransferase activity. Indeed, the immunoprecipitated 118-kDa protein showed no kinase activity toward either itself or the exogenous substrate despite good expression of the 118-kDa protein and fair kinase activity of RSK3 (Fig. 4, A and B), confirming its structural parameters (Fig. 3). Therefore, we have designated these regions of homology as the PSK1 and PSK2 domains, respectively, after pseudo-kinase. We have also termed this protein as RPK118 after theribosomal S6 kinase-like protein with twoPSK domains. A data base search identified orthologues of RPK118 in Drosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating that RPK118is a member of a novel and highly conserved gene family (Fig.2). These cDNA sequences were from putative open reading frames identified from D. melanogaster and C. elegans. A comparison of these sequences reveals the presence of all characteristic homology domains including the PX, ESP, PSK1, and PSK2 domains in these homologues. There also exists a human gene encoding a putative protein, RPK60 (with the ESP, PSK1, and PSK2 domains but devoid of a PX domain), which was originally reported as an “unknown kinase” (GenBankTM accession no. AAD30182) and whose function is currently unknown.Figure 2Domain structure of RPK118 and its related homologues. Various homology domains of human RPK118, its orthologues in D. melanogaster (NCBI accession numberAAF55518) and C. elegans (NCBI accession number CAB01572), and a human protein RPK60 (NCBI accession number AAD30182) are schematically represented.

A representative of three separate experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The tissue distribution of RPK118 mRNA in human tissues was analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 5). RPK118 was ubiquitously distributed among various tissues tested with the highest levels of mRNA detected in the skeletal muscle, brain, heart, placenta, kidney, and liver. Next, the binding results obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening were further confirmed by documenting the interaction between RPK118 and SPHK1 directly. We conducted immunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG-RPK118, FLAG-PSK2 fragment, another deletion mutant FLAG-RPKΔPSK that is devoid of the C-terminal half of the sequence (from residues 314 to 1066, including the PSK1 and PSK2 domains), and HA-SPHK1. These epitope-tagged proteins were expressed in COS7 cells, and the interaction of these proteins was analyzed. HA-SPHK1 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-RPK118 (Fig. 6). The FLAG-PSK2 fragment also interacted with SPHK1, confirming the results from yeast two-hybrid analyses that show that the binding site for SPHK1 is localized within the PSK2 domain of RPK118 (Fig.1A). FLAG-RPKΔPSK showed no interaction with SPHK1.Figure 6Interaction between RPK118 and SPHK1.The association of the RPK118, RPKΔPSK, or PSK2 fragment with SPHK1 was assessed by immunoprecipitation analyses. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with various combinations of FLAG-RPK118, FLAG-PSK2 fragment, FLAG-RPKΔPSK, and HA-SPHK1 as indicated. After cell lysis, FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with the anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody as indicated. Data presented are a typical result from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated the interaction of RPK118 with SPHK1 in intact cells using immunofluorescence techniques. For the characterization of subcellular localization of RPK118, we constructed RPK118 fused with GFP. The utility of GFP-RPK118 was verified by demonstrating co-localization of GFP-RPK118 and FLAG-RPK118 in COS7 cells expressing both proteins. These proteins distributed diffusely in the cytosol and in some small dot-like or ring-shaped structures where the proteins showed exact co-localization (Fig. 7,A–C, arrows). In contrast, GFP itself was distributed diffusely throughout COS7 cells expressing GFP vector alone (data not shown). When EEA1, an endogenous marker of early endosomes, was immunostained, EEA1 displayed good co-localization with GFP-RPK118 (Fig. 7, D–F, arrows), indicating that the RPK118-positive dot-like or ring-shaped structures were in fact early endosomes. Next, when GFP-RPK118 and HA-SPHK1 were expressed simultaneously in COS7 cells, GFP-RPK118 was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm (except nuclei) and also in putative early endosomes (Fig. 7G). A similar pattern was observed when this protein alone was expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 7,A–D), whereas HA-SPHK1 was distributed in a fine reticular pattern in the cytoplasm with early endosomal distribution (Fig. 7H). Some but not all endosomal structures were co-labeled both with GFP-RPK118 and HA-SPHK1 (Fig. 7I, arrows). The dot-like or ring-shaped endosomal localization pattern of RPK118 may not be a consequence of high levels of the protein expression, because this pattern was also observed in the cells expressing the protein at a relatively low level (data not shown). Interestingly, in the cells expressing HA-SPHK1 but not GFP-RPK118 (Fig. 7H, arrowhead), HA-SPHK1 staining with putative early endosomal structures was hardly observed. To demonstrate the direct involvement of RPK118 in the recruitment of SPHK1 to the early endosomes, the effect of PSK2 (an SPHK1-binding fragment of RPK118 as suggested by Figs. 1A and 6) on SPHK1 distribution was tested. When the PSK2 fragment was expressed together with GFP-RPK118 and HA-SPHK1 in COS7 cells, HA-SPHK1 was distributed both in the cytoplasm and the peripheral area without any endosomal labeling (Fig. 7L), leaving the staining pattern of GFP-RPK118 almost unchanged (Fig. 7K). Thus, the PSK2 fragment may function as a dominant negative by competing with RPK118 for SPHK1 binding. These results clearly demonstrate the importance of RPK118 in the recruitment of SPHK1 to early endosomes. Recent observations that proteins containing the PX domain specifically recognize PtdIns (3Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem.

J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar)P through its PX domain. To study the phosphoinositide binding specificities of RPK118, we employed a dot-blot overlay assay. As shown in Fig.8, RPK118 exhibited specific binding to PtdIns (3Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar)P compared with other phosphoinositides. RPK118 interacted weakly with phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate but not at all with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. A deletion mutant, RPK118ΔPX, which lacks the PX domain of RPK118, failed to bind to PtdIns (3Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar)P on the filters (data not shown). We have shown here that a newly identified protein, RPK118, can bind to and co-localize with SPHK1 in COS7-cells. The PSK2 domain of RPK118 is required for binding to SPHK1 as demonstrated by the results from immunoprecipitation analyses (Fig. 6) as well as yeast two-hybrid screening (Fig. 1A). The overexpression of RPK118 in COS7 cells did not cause any change in the intracellular content of SPP with repeated experiments, and RPK118 binding to SPHK1 did not alter the enzymatic activity of SPHK1 in vitro (data not shown), suggesting that RPK118 may function only as an adaptor molecule for SPHK1. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of SPHK will provide important clues to the understanding of the mechanism of intracellular action of SPP. It has been reported (22Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) that SPHK1 expressed in HEK293 cells was detected in both cytosol and membrane fractions. More detailed subcellular studies using density gradient centrifugation have also shown the membrane-associated SPHK activities, especially in vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane in rat tissues (23Gijsbers S. Van der Hoeven G. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our present studies indicate that SPHK1 distributes in a fine reticular pattern in the cytoplasm and that it co-localizes with RPK118-positive ring-shaped early endosomes when RPK118 is co-expressed with SPHK1 (Fig. 7, G–I). We also show that the ring-shaped endosomal pattern of SPHK1 distribution was completely altered to a nearly homogeneously diffuse pattern by the expression of the PSK2 fragment, the SPHK1-binding site of RPK118 (compare Fig. 7,H and L). This suggests that the intracellular localization of SPHK1 may vary depending on the functional state of the cell. Indeed, while this manuscript was under review, Melendez and Khaw (24Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) reported that antigen stimulation of human mast cells induced a rapid translocation of SPHK1 from the cytosol to the “nuclear-free membrane fractions.” Our present results strongly suggest that RPK118 may at least in part determine the endosomal localization of SPHK1. The mechanism of stimulation-induced translocation of SPHK1 to the appropriate cellular destination through RPK118 remains to be elucidated. RPK118-positive ring-shaped structures putatively identified as early endosomes based on EEA1 labeling were also co-labeled with the early recycling endosomal marker Rab4 (data not shown). Further studies are necessary for understanding the physiological relevance of SPHK1 recruitment to early endosomes by RPK118. From the structural analysis, it is obvious that RPK118 has the highest sequence homology with sorting nexin 15 (SNX15) (14Phillips S.A. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Haft C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5074-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Sorting nexins are an emerging family of proteins with a PX domain that are involved in regulating vesicular transport (13Ponting C.P.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The sequence of the PX domain of human SNX15 is 76.5% similar (55.3% identical) to that of RPK118. SNX15 also contains ESP but not PSK domains where SPHK1 binds. The exact destination where the PX domains of RPK118 as well as SNX15 bind remains to be identified. Recently, Xia et al.(27Xia P. Wang L. Moretti P.A.B. Albanese N. Chai F. Pitson S.M. D'Andrea R.J. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7996-8003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) reported that SPHK interacts with tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). However, there is no sequence homology between RPK118 and TRAF2. PtdIns (3Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar)P has been implicated in the regulation of endosomal traffic because the yeast Vps34p, a yeast protein essential for protein targeting to the yeast vacuole and vacuole morphogenesis (28Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), was molecularly and biochemically characterized as PtdIns 3-kinase (29Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In the mammalian system, PtdIns 3-kinase is involved in IgE-mediated histamine secretion (30Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar)P has been implicated in the control of vesicular trafficking between recycling and degradative pathways. For example, the treatment of K562 cells with the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin resulted in mistargeting of a lysosomal enzyme procathepsin D to the secretory pathway (33Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, wortmannin treatment of rat liver endothelial cells prevented ligand transport from endosomes to lysosomes, leading to increased recycling of internalized ligand (34Kjeken R. Mousavi S.A. Brech A. Griffiths G. Berg T. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 497-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with recent reports that proteins containing the PX domain specifically bind to PtdIns (3Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2090927759,"The d,d-transpeptidase activity of high molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) is essential to maintain cell wall integrity as it catalyzes the final cross-linking step of bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis. We investigated a novel beta-lactam resistance mechanism involving by-pass of the essential PBPs by l,d-transpeptidation in Enterococcus faecium. Determination of the peptidoglycan structure by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry revealed that stepwise selection for ampicillin resistance led to the gradual replacement of the usual cross-links generated by the PBPs (d-Ala(4) --> d-Asx-Lys(3)) by cross-links resulting from l,d-transpeptidation (l-Lys(3) --> d-Asx-Lys(3)). This was associated with no modification of the level of production of the PBPs or of their affinity for beta-lactams, indicating that altered PBP activity was not required for ampicillin resistance. A beta-lactam-insensitive l,d-transpeptidase was detected in membrane preparations of the parental susceptible strain. Acquisition of resistance was not because of variation of this activity. Instead, selection led to production of a beta-lactam-insensitive d,d-carboxypeptidase that cleaved the C-terminal d-Ala residue of pentapeptide stems in vitro and caused massive accumulation of cytoplasmic precursors containing a tetrapeptide stem in vivo. The parallel dramatic increase in the proportion of l-Lys(3) --> d-Asx-Lys(3) cross-links showed that the enzyme was activating the resistance pathway by generating the substrate for the l,d-transpeptidase."
https://openalex.org/W2074436812,"The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is coupled to the mobilization of Ca2+ by the protein-tyrosine kinase, Syk. Syk, recruited to the clustered BCR, becomes phosphorylated on three tyrosines (Tyr-317, Tyr-342, and Tyr-346) located within the linker region that separates the C-terminal catalytic domain from the N-terminal tandem Src homology 2 domains. Phosphorylation within the linker region can be either activating or inhibitory to Ca2+ mobilization depending on the sites that are modified. Syk that is not phosphorylated on linker region tyrosines couples the BCR to Ca2+ mobilization through a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent pathway. The phosphorylation of Tyr-342 and -346 enhances the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-γ and the early phase of Ca2+ mobilization via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-independent pathway. The phosphorylation of Tyr-317 strongly dampens the Ca2+ signal. In cells that lack the Src family kinase, Lyn, the phosphorylation of the inhibitory Tyr-317 is suppressed leading to elevated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and an amplified Ca2+ signal. This provides a novel mechanism by which Lyn functions as an inhibitor of BCR-stimulated signaling.

Syk is a positive effector of BCR-stimulated responses, and the disruption of this gene results in pronounced defects in Ca2+ signaling and B cell development (5Turner M. Mee P.J. Costello P.S.

Current models propose that Syk, activated following BCR clustering, activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate allowing for the recruitment of the Tec family kinase, Btk, via its pleckstrin homology domain to the plasma membrane (8Beitz L.O.

Syk also phosphorylates the adaptor protein, BLNK, on the tyrosines required for binding both phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and Btk (11Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C.

The combined actions of Syk and Btk to phosphorylate PLCγ are thought to be required for its optimal activation, leading to the production of IP3 (2Kurosaki T. Maeda A. Ishiai M. Hashimoto A. Inabe K. Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,4Marshall A.J. Niiro H. Yun T.J. Clark E.A. Immunol.

The picture that is emerging of the role of Lyn in mediating BCR-dependent signaling is more complicated with both positive and negative roles assigned to this Src family kinase. Lyn is thought to aid in the recruitment of Syk to the BCR through the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the cytoplasmic tails of Ig-α and Ig-β with which the tandem SH2 domains of Syk interact. However, although signaling from the BCR leading to the production of IP3 and the mobilization of Ca2+ is delayed in B cells lacking Lyn, the Ca2+ flux is actually amplified and prolonged (7Takata M.

Med. 1998; 187: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As a consequence, B cells from Lyn-deficient mice are hyper-responsive to IgM cross-linking, which leads to a hyperactivation of ERK1, ERK2, MEK1, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and a hyperproliferative response (15Chan V.W.F. Lowell C.A. DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Chan V.W.F. Meng F. Soriano P. DeFranco A.L. Lowell C.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect of Lyn on BCR-mediated signaling is attributed, in part, to its ability to phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on the cytoplasmic tails of inhibitory co-receptors (15Chan V.W.F. Lowell C.A. DeFranco A.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Smith K.G.C. Tarlinton D.M. Doody G.M. Hibbs M.L. Fearon D.T. J. Exp.

Med. 1998; 187: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The internalization of aggregated Syk-BCR complexes is also inhibited in the absence of Lyn, suggesting that a lack of receptor down-regulation contributes to the prolonged signaling response observed in Lyn-deficient cells (19Ma H. Yankee T.M. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Following its recruitment to the BCR, Syk becomes phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines, including three in the linker region that separates the tandem SH2 domains from the C-terminal catalytic domain (20Keshvara L. Isaacson C.C. Yankee T.M. Sarac R. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5276-5283PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that both Lyn and Syk contribute to this phosphorylation. The linker region residues, Tyr-317, -342, and -346, all lie within consensus sequences for recognition by Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. The phosphorylation of Tyr-317 creates a binding site for c-Cbl, an adaptor protein that serves as a negative regulator of BCR-stimulated Ca2+ signaling (21Lupher M.L. Rao N. Lill N.L. Andoniou C.E.

Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5827-5835PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphorylation of Tyr-342, -346, or both creates a binding site for PLCγ (23Law C.-L. Chandran K.A. Sidorenko S.P. Clark E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the direct interactions of these negative and positive mediators of Ca2+ signaling with Syk could also help determine the nature of the Ca2+ flux induced by BCR engagement. In this study we developed assays suitable for distinguishing between signaling events supported by different site-directed mutants of Syk that would reveal the effects of the two linker region sites of protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate that elimination of the negative regulatory site at Tyr-317 greatly enhances the BCR-stimulated phosphorylation of PLCγ, the production of IP3, and the amplitude and duration of the Ca2+ flux. This enhanced PLCγ phosphorylation and IP3 production is reduced, however, by elimination of Tyr-342 and -346. Mobilization of Ca2+ and activation of NFAT are strongly inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, in cells expressing any form of Syk lacking Tyr-342 and -346, but an alternative pathway independent of PI3K leading to the mobilization of Ca2+ exists for forms of Syk containing the PLCγ-binding site. Thus, the differential phosphorylation of Syk can determine the pathway by which the BCR is coupled to the regulation of intracellular Ca2+. Interestingly, in Lyn-deficient cells, the phosphorylation of Tyr-317 is greatly depressed and much of the inhibitory effect of the presence of Tyr-317 is lost, providing an additional mechanism by which Lyn functions as a negative regulator of B cell signaling. DT40 B cells lacking Syk or both Syk and Lyn were generously provided by Drs. T. Kurosaki (Kansai Medical University) and E. Puré (Wistar Institute). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Myc epitope-tagged Syk was expressed in transiently transfected cells and stable cell lines using the pGEM/EPB vector (24Dildrop R., Ma, A. Zimmerman K. Hsu E. Tesfaye A. DePinho R. Alt F.W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as described previously (25Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). cDNAs for the expression of site-directed mutants were prepared using the Transformer mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). Clones were analyzed for levels of cell surface IgM by flow cytometry using a fluorescein-labeled goat anti-chicken IgM antibody (Bethyl Laboratories). Multiple clones expressing each mutant form of Syk were isolated. Syk expression levels were determined by immunoblotting proteins from cell lysates with anti-Syk antisera prepared as described (26Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 217: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 15–20 μg of Syk expression plasmid and 10–15 μg of an NFAT-luciferase reporter construct (pNFAT Luc (Stratagene)). Cells were activated 24–48 h post-transfection with goat anti-chicken IgM at 10 μg/ml or as indicated or with a combination of PMA (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1.0 μm) for 6 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system kit (Promega). For some experiments, cells were treated with wortmannin at a concentration of 100 nm or Me2SO vehicle alone for 30 min prior to addition of the anti-IgM antibody. Cells (1 × 107/ml) were stimulated with or without the monoclonal anti-IgM antibody (M4) (Southern Biotechnology) (5 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C and then lysed with buffer containing 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Immunoprecipitations and Western blots were performed using anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-PLCγ2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Btk (BD PharMingen), or anti-BLNK antibodies (generously provided by Dr. A. Chan, Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Proteins in immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and detected using the indicated antibodies and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Levels of IP3 were determined using a competitive receptor-binding assay (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells (4 × 106/ml) were stimulated with the monoclonal anti-IgM (M4) antibody (10 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C. Intracellular Ca2+ was quantified in cells (3 × 106/ml) washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 27.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 1.87 mm CaCl2, 12.2 mm glucose, and 1% bovine serum albumin and loaded with 4 μg Fluo-3AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was monitored by flow cytometry before and after the addition of 10 μg of goat anti-chicken IgM or 1 μm ionomycin. For some cells, 100 nmwortmannin was added along with the Fluo-3AM. The activity of PI3Kin vitro was determined essentially as described (27Susa M. Keeler M. Varticovski L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22951-22956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Syk(WT) or one of the various mutant versions was immunoprecipitated from lysates of the appropriate stable cell lines and autophosphorylated in vitro by incubation of the immune complex in buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP. The preparation of tryptic phosphopeptides from in vitroautophosphorylated Syk and their separation by alkaline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described (20Keshvara L. Isaacson C.C. Yankee T.M. Sarac R. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5276-5283PubMed Google Scholar, 28West M.H.P., Wu, R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The Syk linker region possesses two sites involved in phosphotyrosine-mediated protein-protein interactions, one at Tyr-317 and a second at Tyr-342 and -346. To determine how these Syk linker region tyrosines participate in B cell signaling, we first examined the ability of site-directed mutants of Syk lacking Tyr-317, both Tyr-342 and Tyr-346, or all three tyrosines to couple the BCR to the activation of NFAT, a transcription factor regulated primarily through prolonged increases in intracellular Ca2+. In Syk-deficient DT40 B cells, BCR cross-linking is uncoupled from Ca2+ mobilization and from the activation of NFAT (7Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 20Keshvara L. Isaacson C.C. Yankee T.M. Sarac R. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5276-5283PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1A, transient re-expression of Syk(WT), which has all three linker region tyrosines intact, restored receptor-stimulated NFAT activity to Syk-deficient cells as measured by the production of luciferase from a co-transfected NFAT-luciferase reporter construct. Substitution of phenylalanine for Tyr-317 (referred to as Syk(Y317F)) enhanced the ability of Syk to couple the BCR to the activation of NFAT as reported previously (22Yankee T.M. Keshvara L.M. Sawasdikosol S. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5827-5835PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, the replacement of Tyr-342 and -346 with phenylalanines (referred to as Syk(Y342F/Y346F)) had no significant effect on the activation of NFAT when compared with Syk(WT). Elimination of all three sites of linker region tyrosine phosphorylation (referred to as Syk(F3)) led to an enhanced activation of NFAT that was similar to that observed for Syk(Y317F). Thus, phosphorylation of Syk within the linker region was not required for coupling the BCR to the activation of NFAT and removal of the inhibitory site at Tyr-317 enhanced signaling. Whereas an inhibitory role for Tyr-317 in B cell signaling was expected, the absence of an obvious role for Tyr-342 and -346 was not. To examine more closely a role for these tyrosines, we compared the abilities of Syk(Y317F), which retains these two sites of phosphorylation, and Syk(F3), which lacks these sites, to support the BCR-stimulated activation of NFAT using a variety of concentrations of anti-IgM antibody. At high concentrations of antibody, both mutants coupled the BCR to the activation of NFAT to a greater extent than Syk(WT), as expected (Fig. 1B). However, a marked difference in the relative abilities of Syk(F3) and Syk(Y317F) to couple the BCR to the activation of NFAT was observed at low concentrations of anti-IgM. The dose-response curve for cells expressing Syk(Y317F) was shifted dramatically toward lower concentrations of activating antibody. This reduction in the threshold for activation required the presence of Tyr-342 and -346 because cells expressing Syk(F3) were not hypersensitive to the activating antibody, although equivalent levels of kinase were expressed. These results indicated that, in the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr-317 and at low concentrations of activating antibody, the presence of Tyr-342 and -346 was important to the ability of Syk to couple the BCR to the activation of NFAT. To explore the molecular basis for the different signaling activities of Syk(Y317F) and Syk(F3), we compared the profile of proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine following engagement of the BCR in cells expressing each mutant form of Syk. For these experiments, stable cell lines lacking endogenous Syk were prepared, each expressing a cDNA encoding a mutant form of Syk driven by a B cell-specific promoter. Clones that expressed comparable levels of Syk mutant protein as determined by Western blotting with anti-Syk antibodies (Fig.2A) and comparable levels of surface IgM as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (data not shown) were isolated. Cells expressing Syk(Y317F) and Syk(F3) were left untreated or activated with anti-IgM antibodies. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. A comparison of the profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from cells expressing the two forms of Syk is shown in Fig. 2B. Receptor cross-linking led to the enhanced phosphorylation of multiple proteins on tyrosine in both cell types. The tyrosine-phosphorylation of Syk(F3) itself was reduced as compared with Syk(Y317F), as might reasonably be expected because of the loss of two sites of phosphorylation. Among substrates other than Syk, the most noticeable difference between the cell lines was the presence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein migrating atMr = 150,000. Stripping and reprobing the membrane with a specific antibody identified this protein as PLCγ. The tyrosine-phosphorylation of PLCγ was robust in anti-IgM-treated cells expressing Syk(Y317F) but was reduced by comparison in cells expressing Syk(F3). These data suggest that the phosphorylation of PLCγ is enhanced by the phosphorylation of Syk on Tyr-342 and -346, which constitute the PLCγ-binding site, and that this might account for the enhanced signaling capacity of Syk(Y317F) as compared with Syk(F3). To compare the phosphorylation of PLCγ in Syk(Y317F)-expressing cells to that in cells expressing mutants of Syk that retained Tyr-317, we also prepared and examined stable cell lines expressing Syk(Y342F/Y346F) and Syk(WT). These stable cell lines had levels of Syk protein (Fig. 2C) and surface IgM (data not shown) comparable with the cells described above. The receptor-mediated phosphorylation of PLCγ in Syk(Y317F)-expressing cells was enhanced as compared with Syk-deficient cells expressing either Syk(Y342F/Y346F) or Syk(WT) (Fig. 2D). Thus, the presence of Tyr-317 reduces, whereas the presence of Tyr-342 and -346 enhances, the phosphorylation of PLCγ on tyrosine. Differences in the receptor-mediated phosphorylation of PLCγ in cells expressing different mutants of Syk suggested that the BCR-stimulated production of IP3 and mobilization of Ca2+, second messengers produced in response to the activation of PLCγ, would also be altered by the elimination of specific linker region sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. We first examined receptor-mediated production of IP3 in the various stable cell lines. Cross-linking the BCR in Syk-deficient cells failed to result in the production of measurable amounts of IP3 as determined by a competitive receptor-binding assay (Fig.3A). The production of IP3 could be restored by re-expression of Syk(WT) to the same extent as that observed in wild-type DT40 cells expressing the endogenous chicken enzyme. BCR-stimulated production of IP3was then compared in the stable cell lines expressing the various forms of Syk (Fig. 3B). The level of IP3 produced in response to receptor aggregation was increased dramatically in cells expressing Syk(Y317F) as compared with cells expressing Syk(WT). As observed in cells expressing Syk(F3), this enhanced production of IP3 that resulted from the elimination of the inhibitory phosphorylation site at Tyr-317 was reduced considerably by the additional elimination of Tyr-342 and -346, indicating the importance of these two residues for coupling Syk to the activation of PLCγ and production of IP3. No significant difference in IP3 levels could be detected between cells expressing Syk(WT) and Syk(Y342F/Y346F), but these levels were quite low in comparison to cells expressing Syk(Y317F). Thus, the level of production of IP3 correlated well with the relative abilities of each form of Syk to couple the receptor to the phosphorylation of PLCγ. Because the production of IP3 leads to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, the ability of BCR aggregation to mobilize Ca2+ was measured in the stable cell lines by monitoring changes in the fluorescence of cells loaded with the Ca2+ indicator, Fluo-3AM (Fig. 3C). Changes in Fluo-3 fluorescence in response to receptor cross-linking were compared with changes arising from the treatment of cells with ionomycin. No changes in intracellular Ca2+ were observed in Syk-deficient cells in response to receptor cross-linking (data not shown). Intracellular Ca2+ levels rose rapidly, but transiently, in cells expressing Syk(WT). This response was similar to that observed in wild-type DT40 B cells expressing endogenous Syk (data not shown). The effect of the elimination of Tyr-317 on Syk-dependent Ca2+ signaling was dramatic. Both the initial and prolonged phases of Ca2+ mobilization were increased substantially in cells expressing Syk(Y317F) as compared with cells expressing Syk(WT). Ca2+ flux was also prolonged in cells expressing Syk(F3), but the rate of Ca2+ mobilization and the amplitude of the initial phase of the Ca2+ response were reduced as compared with cells expressing Syk(Y317F). BCR-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in cells expressing Syk(Y342F/Y346F) was similar to the response of Syk(WT)-expressing cells, although the initial rise in Ca2+ consistently occurred at a slower rate in the absence of these two sites of phosphorylation. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Syk on Tyr-342 and -346 enhances the magnitude of the initial phase of Ca2+ mobilization, whereas the phosphorylation of Tyr-317 acts to significantly dampen the Ca2+ response. Cells expressing Syk(F3), which lacks all of the in vivo sites of tyrosine-phosphorylation that have been identified within the linker region, clearly retain the ability to mobilize Ca2+ in response to receptor clustering. Thus, a pathway involving components that function independently of a direct interaction with phosphotyrosines within the linker must exist to couple the BCR to PLCγ. BLNK is an important substrate for Syk that is phosphorylated following engagement of the BCR and serves as an adaptor protein that binds SH2 domains of both PLCγ and the Tec family kinase, Btk (11Fu C.

The extent to which BLNK was phosphorylated in cells expressing the various Syk mutants was compared by immunoprecipitating BLNK from lysates of untreated or anti-IgM-treated cells and assessing its degree of tyrosine phosphorylation by a Western blot using an antibody against phosphotyrosine. Interestingly, BLNK was phosphorylated most extensively in cells expressing Syk(F3), which lacks all three linker region tyrosines (Fig. 4A). In cells expressing Syk(Y317F), BLNK phosphorylation was less than that observed in cells expressing Syk(F3) but was elevated as compared with cells expressing Syk(WT), which exhibited the lowest level of BLNK phosphorylation. The differences in BLNK phosphorylation were observed even though equivalent amounts of BLNK protein were immunoprecipitated from each cell. Thus, unlike PLCγ, the robust phosphorylation of BLNK on tyrosine following BCR cross-linking by Syk mutants lacking Tyr-317 does not require Tyr-342 or -346. Genetic studies indicate that PI3K is an important component of the signaling complex that couples the BCR to the mobilization of Ca2+ (29Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y.

In fact, Btk, as detected by immunoblotting with both anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Btk antibodies, was present at similar levels in anti-phosphotyrosine immune complexes isolated from the lysates of anti-IgM-activated cells containing each of the four forms of Syk (Fig. 4B), suggesting that it could be activated in all four stable cell lines. We were, however, unable to identify an antibody that could efficiently immunoprecipitate Btk from DT40 cell lysates, making it difficult to assess accurately its true extent of activation. To examine the importance of the PI3K pathway to signaling in cells expressing the various Syk mutants, we examined the effects of wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI3K, on the BCR-stimulated activation of NFAT in Syk-deficient DT40 B cells transiently transfected with plasmids for the expression of each mutant form of Syk and the pNFAT Luc reporter construct. As shown in Fig.4C, BCR-stimulated signaling in cells expressing different mutant forms of Syk exhibited different sensitivities to wortmannin.

Biochemical analysis of 3Dpol derivatives containing the thumb or palm substitutions revealed that these derivatives are both incapable of forming long fibers, suggesting that polymerase fibers are not essential for virus viability. The RNA binding activity, polymerase activity, and thermal stability of these derivatives were equivalent to that of the wild-type enzyme. The two significant differences observed for the thumb mutant were a modest reduction in the ability of the altered 3CD proteinase to process the VP0/VP3 capsid precursor and a substantial reduction in the ability of the altered 3Dpol to catalyze oriI-templated uridylylation of VPg. The defect to uridylylation was a result of the inability of 3CD to stimulate this reaction.

The RdRP from poliovirus (3Dpol) serves as a paradigm for this class of nucleic acid polymerases. The crystal structure for 3Dpol (1Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) revealed that this polymerase has the typical topology observed for other nucleic acid polymerases and can be compared with a cupped, right hand with fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains (Fig. 1A). A unique feature of this polymerase, however, is the presence of two extensive regions of polymerase-polymerase interactions, referred to as interface I and interface II (1Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Polymerase molecules interact in a “head-to-tail” fashion to form long, extended fibers via interface I, and these fibers interact with each other via interface II. Interface I is formed by an interaction between the back of the thumb of one polymerase molecule and the back of the palm of a second polymerase molecule (Fig.1B). A few of the critical interactions required for integrity of interface I are shown in Fig. 1C. Specifically, Arg-455 and Arg-456 of the thumb subdomain of one polymerase molecule interact with Asp-339, Ser-341, and Asp-349 of the palm subdomain of the second polymerase molecule (Fig. 1C). A variety of biochemical studies have provided additional evidence for oligomerization of 3Dpol. For example, filter-binding studies, performed in a manner that separates oligomers greater than 100 molecules from smaller assemblies, demonstrate a concentration-dependent increase in formation of large 3Dpol oligomers at low pH values (2Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar, 3Beckman M.T. Kirkegaard K. J. Biol.

Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, 3Dpol exhibits cooperativity with respect to polymerase activity (2Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the observed cooperative nature of polymerase activity is not observed in all cases (5Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and may either be substrate-dependent (5Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or a reflection of the absence or presence of certain divalent cations, in particular Zn2+ ions (4Hobson S.D. Rosenblum E.S. Richards O.C. Richmond K. Kirkegaard K. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the ability of 3Dpol molecules to interact has also been demonstrated by using the yeast two-hybrid system (6Hope D.A. Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Xiang W. Cuconati A. Hope D. Kirkegaard K. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clustered charged-to-alanine mutagenesis of 3Dpol identified residues Arg-455 and Arg-456 as residues essential for virus viability (8Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 863-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the role of these residues in the stability of interface I (Fig.1C) (1Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), these data provided the first evidence that oligomerization of 3Dpol might play a significant role in some step of the virus multiplication cycle. Subsequent studies of additional 3Dpol derivatives with modifications of residues involved in forming interface I provided additional support for the importance of this interface for 3Dpol function and virus viability (4Hobson S.D. Rosenblum E.S. Richards O.C. Richmond K. Kirkegaard K. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, this study also presented an interesting paradox. Mutation of the residue that interacts with Arg-455, Asp-349, does not produce a lethal phenotype (4Hobson S.D. Rosenblum E.S. Richards O.C. Richmond K. Kirkegaard K. Schultz S.C.

In this study, we test the hypothesis that the lethal phenotype associated with mutations on the back of the thumb of 3Dpol arises from a requirement for this subdomain that is independent of oligomerization. We find that 1) oligomerization via interface I may not be essential for virus multiplication and 2) the back of the thumb of 3Dpol may interact with host and viral factors to modulate capsid protein processing and initiation of protein-primed RNA synthesis, respectively. The implications of heteromeric interactions between 3Dpol and another viral factor on the mechanism for negative-strand RNA synthesis will be discussed.

Oligos 15 and 16 (Table I lists all oligonucleotides used in this study) were used to amplify the region encoding 3CD by using PCR and the viral cDNA (pMoRA, also known as pXpA-rib+polyAlong (Ref. 9Herold J. Andino R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)) as template. The 3CD-coding region was cloned into pET26Ub-3D plasmid (10Gohara D.W., Ha, C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) by using theSacII and AflII sites to give pET26Ub-3CD. To inactivate the protease activity of 3CD, histidine 40 was changed to a glycine by using overlap-extension PCR with oligos 15–18 and pET26Ub-3CD plasmid as template. The product was cloned into pET26Ub-3CD to yield pET26Ub-3CD-H40G.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studya An NheI site was introduced via a silent mutation.b The T7 promoter is underlined. a An NheI site was introduced via a silent mutation. b The T7 promoter is underlined. Cloning of the 3C gene was achieved by using oligos 15 and 19–21 and the viral cDNA (pMoRA (Ref. 9Herold J. Andino R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)) as template in overlap-extension PCR. The region was cloned into pET26Ub-Chis plasmid by using theSacII and BamHI sites to yield pET26Ub-3C-C147G-Chis. “C147G” designates mutation of cysteine 147 to a glycine to inactivate protease activity. The pET26Ub-Chis plasmid is designed to produce a C-terminal GSSG-His6 tag for any protein cloned in by using the 3′ BamHI site. The pET26Ub expression plasmid for 3Dpol (pET26Ub-3D-BPKN) was previously described (10Gohara D.W., Ha, C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing at the Pennsylvania State University Nucleic Acid Facility was used to verify the integrity of all clones. The thumb mutations of Arg-455 and Arg-456 in 3Dpol were introduced by using reverse oligonucleotides encoding the Ala (oligo 8), Ser (oligo 9), or Asp (oligo 10) substitutions and the forward oligonucleotide (oligo 7). PCR products were cloned into pET26Ub-3D-BPKN plasmid (10Gohara D.W., Ha, C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using the NheI and EcoRI sites. Palm mutations of Asp-339, Ser-341, and Asp-349 to alanine in 3Dpol were introduced by using overlap extension PCR using oligos 11–14. The PCR product was cloned into pET26Ub-3D-BPKN plasmid (10Gohara D.W., Ha, C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using the KpnI and EcoRI sites. The thumb (R455A,R456A) and palm (D339A,S341A,D349A) mutations were introduced into 3CD by digesting the region containing the mutations in the pET26-Ub-3D-BPKN plasmid and ligating into the pET26Ub-3CD-H40G plasmid. The BstBI and EcoRI sites were used to introduce the thumb mutations into 3CD; theBstBI and MfeI sites were used to introduce the palm mutations into 3CD. DNA sequencing confirmed the integrity of all clones. All proteins expressed from the pET26Ub-based plasmids constructed above are N-terminally fused to yeast ubiquitin. Overexpression of protein in this system is performed in the BL21(DE3)pCG1 strain of Escherichia coli; this strain carries the pCG1 plasmid, which constitutively expresses a yeast ubiquitin protease that processes the ubiquitin fusion protein to produce the authentic N terminus (10Gohara D.W., Ha, C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Expression, lysis, polyethyleneimine (PEI) precipitation, and ammonium sulfate precipitation for all 3Dpol and 3CD derivatives were performed as previously described (10Gohara D.W., Ha, C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). After suspension of the ammonium sulfate pellets in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 60 μm ZnCl2), the samples were dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 10 mm NaCl. Spectra/Por dialysis tubing (Spectrum Laboratories Inc.) with a molecular mass cut-off of 12,000–14,000 Da was used. All of the steps of the purification were performed either on ice or at 4 °C. After dialysis, the conductivity of the protein was adjusted to 50 mm NaCl and the protein was loaded at 1 ml/min onto a phosphocellulose (P-11) column that was equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. Approximately 1 ml of resin was used per 20 mg of total protein. Protein concentration was measured by using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The column was washed to baseline with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and protein was eluted by using a six-column volume, linear gradient from 50 to 350 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions (0.1 bed volume of the column) were collected and assayed for purity by SDS-PAGE. Conductivity of the pooled fractions was adjusted to 50 mm NaCl by using buffer A and the pooled fractions were loaded at 1 ml/min onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. Again, 1 ml of resin was used per 20 mg of total protein. Washing was the same as for the P-11 column; protein was eluted using a six-column volume, linear gradient from 50 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions (0.1 bed volume of the column) were collected and assayed for purity by SDS-PAGE. Conductivity of the pooled fractions was adjusted to 50 mm NaCl using buffer A. This pool was loaded at 1 ml/min onto a 0.5-ml Q column equilibrated as described above. The column was washed to baseline using buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 60 μm ZnCl2) containing 50 mm NaCl. Protein was eluted from this Q column by using buffer B containing 500 mm NaCl. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected until the concentration of the eluted protein fell below the desired value. Protein concentration was determined by using the following extinction coefficients: 0.071830 μm−1·cm−1 (3Dpol) and 0.079510 μm−1·cm−1 (3CD). These values were determined by using the protein parameters tool on the ExPASy site (us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). The absorbance values were measured at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine HCl (GdnHCl), pH 6.5. The conductivity of the individual fractions was measured; the fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. 3C was expressed essentially as described for 3Dpol and 3CD (10Gohara D.W., Ha, C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); however, a different lysis buffer was employed (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5.6 μg/ml pepstatin A, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Nonidet P-40 were added after lysis to a final concentration of 1 mm and 0.1% (v/v), respectively. PEI was added to a final concentration of 0.25% (v/v); the lysate was stirred slowly at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged in a Beckman Ti-60 rotor for 30 min at 30,000 rpm at 4 °C. The conductivity of the PEI supernatant was adjusted to 50 mm NaCl, and the supernatant was passed through a Q-Sepharose column followed in tandem by a P-11 column. Both columns were equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 50 mm NaCl prior to loading. Approximately 1 ml of resin/80 mg of total protein was used for the Q column, and ∼1 ml of resin/500 mg of total protein was used for the P-11 column. After all of the protein passed through the Q column, the P-11 column was detached and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer C containing 50 mm NaCl. 3C was eluted from the P-11 column by using buffer C containing 2 m NaCl. Fractions (1 ml) were eluted until the concentration of the eluted protein fell below the desired value. The high NaCl concentration was reduced from the fractions by dialysis against buffer C containing 250 mm NaCl using Spectra/Por dialysis tubing with a molecular mass cut-off of 6000–8000 Da. SDS-PAGE was used to assess the purity of the eluted fractions. Protein concentration was determined as described for 3Dpol and 3CD; the extinction coefficient used was 0.007680 μm−1·cm−1. The conductivity of the individual fractions was measured; the fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Introduction of mutations into the thumb subdomain in the viral cDNA required overlap extension PCR by using oligos 1–4; the viral cDNA, pMoRA (9Herold J. Andino R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was used as the template. The PCR product was digested with MfeI and EcoRI and subcloned into the intermediate plasmid, pUC18-BglII-EcoRI-3CD (referred to as pUC-3CD in Ref. 11Gohara D.W. Crotty S. Arnold J.J. Yoder J.D. Andino R. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25523-25532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). From this subclone, the fragment between BglII and EcoRI was cloned into the viral cDNA (pMoRA (Ref. 9Herold J. Andino R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)) to yield the thumb mutant viral cDNA (pMoRA-R455A,R456A). For the introduction of mutations to the palm subdomain, PCR amplification from the expression vector containing the palm mutations (pET26Ub-3D-BPKN-D339A,S341A,D349A) was performed using oligos 5 and 6; the fragment between BstBI and MfeI was subcloned into the pUC18-BglII-EcoRI-3CD intermediate and from there to the viral cDNA using the BglII and EcoRI sites to yield the palm mutant viral cDNA (pMoRA-D339A,S341A,D349A). To introduce mutations into the replicon, the fragment between the BglII and ApaI sites from the mutated viral cDNAs was cloned into pRLucRA (also known as pRLuc31-rib+polyAlong (Refs. 9Herold J. Andino R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and 12Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Achacoso P.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar)) to yield pRLucRA-R455A,R456A and pRLucRA-D339A,S341A,D349A. DNA sequencing was used to verify the integrity of all clones. RNA transcripts were generated according to the instructions of the manufacturer for the T7-MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Inc.) after linearization with EcoRI. DNase treatment was used to remove the template; lithium chloride precipitation was used to remove unincorporated nucleotides. RNA concentration was calculated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm, assuming an A260 of 1 was equivalent to 40 μg/ml. HeLa cells were propagated in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), always keeping the cultures between 20 and 80% confluence. Subconfluent monolayers of HeLa cells were detached from the culture flasks by trypsin treatment, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cell number adjusted to 3 × 106 cells/ml in PBS. Cell suspension (400 μl) was mixed with 10 μg of RNA (wild-type (pMoRA), thumb mutant (pMoRA-R455A,R456A), or palm mutant (pMoRA-D339A,S341A,D349A) viral transcripts) in a microcentrifuge tube, transferred to an electroporation cuvette (0.2-cm gap width; Bio-Rad) and subjected to an electric pulse at 500 microfarads and 130 V using a Gene Pulser system (Bio-Rad). Electroporated cells were diluted either 10- or 100-fold in PBS, and 100 μl of each dilution were plated on 2 × 105 HeLa cells (prepared 1 day in advance) in six-well dishes; 400 μl of DMEM/F-12 were added to each well. Undiluted electroporated cells (100 μl) were also plated using the same procedure. Cells were allowed to adsorb to the plate for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the medium/PBS was aspirated; the cells were covered with 3 ml of a mixture of 1× DMEM/F-12 plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% low melting point agarose (American Bioanalytical). Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. The agarose overlay was removed by using a spatula. Wells were stained with crystal violet, and viral plaques were counted. RNA transcripts were generated as described for the viral genomes from ApaI-linearized plasmids encoding the wild-type (pRLucRA (Refs. 9Herold J. Andino R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6394-6400Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and 12Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Achacoso P.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar)), the thumb mutant (pRLucRA-R455A,R456A) or the palm mutant (pRLucRA-D339A,S341A, D349A) subgenomic replicons. HeLa cells were propagated as described for the infectious center assays. HeLa cells were transfected with subgenomic replicons (20 μg) by using electroporation. Electroporated cells were immediately transferred to prewarmed (37 °C) DMEM/F-12 as follows. The volume of the electroporated cells added was calculated by multiplying 33 μl byn + 1 (where n is the number of time points to be measured). The volume of DMEM/F-12 to which the electroporated cells were added was calculated by multiplying 500 μl by n + 1 (where n is the number of time points to be measured). After mixing the appropriate volume of electroporated cells with the appropriate volume of medium, 500-μl aliquots were prepared in microcentrifuge tubes for each time point to be measured. These aliquots were then incubated in a water bath at 37 °C without any agitation. At fixed time points, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Lysis was performed by using 100 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) and placed on ice for 2 min before removal of cellular debris and nuclei by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min. Lysates were left on ice at 4 °C until all time points were collected. Lysates were assayed for luciferase activity by mixing 10 μl of lysate with 10 μl of luciferase assay substrate (Promega) and quantifying light production by using a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold). HeLa cell S10 extract (S10) and HeLa cell translation initiation factors were prepared as previously described (14Barton D.J. Morasco B.J. Flanegan J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 35-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HeLa S10 translation-replication reaction mixtures contained 50% by volume S10, 20% by volume initiation factors, 10% by volume 10× nucleotide reaction mix (10 mm ATP, 2.5 mm GTP, 2.5 mm UTP, 600 mm KCH3CO2, 300 mmcreatine phosphate, 4 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 155 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.4), 2 mm GdnHCl, and viral mRNA at 50 μg/ml. Poliovirus mRNA translation was assayed by including [35S]methionine (1.2 mCi/ml;Amersham Biosciences) in HeLa S10 translation-replication reaction mixtures. After 3 h of incubation at 34 °C, samples (4 μl) of the HeLa S10 translation-replication reaction mixtures containing [35S]methionine were mixed with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS (Sigma), 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol). The samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and 25-μl portions of each sample were loaded onto a 0.75-mm-thick polyacrylamide gel (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) consisting of a 4% stacking gel and a 9–18% gradient separating gel. The gels were fixed and dried; radiolabeled proteins were detected by phosphorimaging. Poliovirus RNA synthesis was assayed using preinitiation RNA replication complexes formed in HeLa S10 translation-replication reaction mixtures as previously described (15Barton D.J. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8482-8489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, viral RNAs (50 μg/ml) were incubated in S10 reaction mixtures containing 2 mm GdnHCl for 3 h at 34 °C. Preinitiation complexes were isolated from the reactions by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pellets containing preinitiation complexes were then suspended in 50-μl labeling reaction mixtures containing [α-32P]CTP and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min as previously described (method 4 in Ref. 15Barton D.J. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8482-8489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, radiolabel was incorporated into nascent negative- and positive-strand RNA as it was synthesized. The reactions were centrifuged at 13,000 × g to pellet the viral RNA replication complexes. Radiolabeled viral RNA remained in the replication complexes. 2D. J. Barton, unpublished results. The supernatant, containing unincorporated radiolabel, was discarded. The pellets were solubilized in SDS sample buffer. The products of the reaction were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose MOPS formaldehyde gel. RNA in the gels was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized by UV light. 32P-Labeled poliovirus RNA was detected and quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). VPg uridylylation was assayed using preinitiation RNA replication complexes. Preinitiation RNA replication complexes were isolated from HeLa S10 translation-replication reaction material using the same procedure as described above for poliovirus RNA synthesis. The preinitiation RNA replication complexes were suspended in 50 μl of labeling reaction mixture containing [α-32P]UTP rather than [α-32P]CTP. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Following incubation, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 13,000 × g to pellet the viral RNA replication complexes. Radiolabeled VPgpUpU and radiolabeled viral RNA remained in the replication complexes and were not released into the soluble portion of the reaction mixtures.2 The supernatant, containing unincorporated radiolabel, was discarded. The pellets, containing radiolabeled viral RNA and uridylylated VPg, were solubilized in SDS sample buffer. The samples were fractionated by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide Tris-Tricine gel, and radiolabeled VPgpUpU was detected by phosphorimaging. The RNA oligonucleotide was end-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase essentially as specified by the manufacturer. Reactions, typically 20 μl, contained 0.1 μm[γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm RNA oligonucleotide (rU30), 1× kinase buffer, and 0.4 units/μl T4 polynucleotide kinase. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and quenched by incubation at 65 °C for 5 min. Reaction mixtures, typically 50 μl, contained 10 nm trace-labeled rU30 and wild-type or mutant 3Dpol derivatives of varying concentrations in reaction buffer (25 mm MES-NaOH, pH 5.5, 60 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmZnSO4 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mmATP, 20% glycerol). 3Dpol was diluted immediately prior to use in enzyme dilution buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 60 μm ZnCl2and 20% glycerol). Binding reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of the diluted 3Dpol to the remaining components. Reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min. This assay employs three filters: polysulfone membrane, which traps any protein-nucleic acid complexes larger than 0.45 μm; a nitrocellulose membrane, which traps all other protein-nucleic acid complexes; and a nylon membrane, which binds all unbound nucleic acid. Membranes were presoaked in wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 5 mm MgCl2) and assembled, in order from top to bottom, polysulfone, nitrocellulose, and nylon, in a slot blotter (Invitrogen).

Incubation of K562 cells with SB203580, SB203580-iodo, or SB202474, an analogue of SB203580 that does not inhibit p38 MAPK activity, inhibited the uptake of [3H]Ara C or [3H]uridine and the differentiation of K562 cells. Consistent with the effects of these compounds on the nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-sensitive equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1), incubation with SB203580 or SB203580-iodo eliminated the binding of [3H]NBMPR to K562 cells or membranes isolated from human erythrocytes. Furthermore, using a uridine-dependent cell type (G9c), we observed that SB203580 or SB203580-iodo efficiently inhibited the salvage synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides in vivo.

Most mammalian cells co-express several nucleoside transporter isoforms at the plasma membrane that differ in their cation-dependent, permeant selectivities and inhibitor sensitivities and can generally be assigned to one of two major classes designated as the equilibrative or concentrative transporters (3Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The Na+-independent equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs)1 transport nucleosides by chemical gradients and can be further divided intoequilibrative-sensitive (es) andequilibrative-insensitive (ei) (encoded by ENT1 and ENT2 gene, respectively) based on sensitivity, or insensitivity, to the high affinity antagonist nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) (3Cass C.E.

The MAPKs are a large family of enzymes responsible for relaying cell surface signals to the nucleus and other intracellular targets (6Brunet A. Pouyssegur J.

SB203580 was identified as one of the first highly selective inhibitors of the stress-activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPKs) and was shown to block the production of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β release from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes (7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence now suggests that SB203580 exerts its anti-inflammatory actions by binding to the ATP binding site and inhibiting the activity of p38 MAPK (7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C.

SB203580 and related analogues have also been shown to inhibit the production of interferon-γ, interleukin-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α by lymphocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, phorbol myristate acetate, sorbitol, and anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (10Cannons J.L.

Since this initial discovery a wealth of studies has contributed to the discovery and design of a series of pyrimidine analogues as additional p38 MAPK inhibitors, some of which are currently in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (14Lee J.C.

While investigating the involvement of p38 MAPK in the regulation of erythroid cell differentiation, we observed effects of SB203580 that were inconsistent with inhibition of this kinase. Instead our results suggested that there were additional effects on the transport of nucleosides or nucleoside analogues into K562 cells. In this report we describe evidence for the equilibrative nucleoside transporters as additional targets for inhibition by the imidazoline class of p38 MAPK inhibitors. Human erythroleukemia K562 cells and G9c cells were cultured as described earlier (17Nagy K. Pasti G. Bene L. Nagy I. Leuk. Res. 1995; 19: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Uridine (35–50 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). [3H]NBMPR (22.5 Ci/mmol) and [5-3H]cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside ([5-3H]Ara C, 15–30 Ci/mmol) were from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Uridine, propidium, NBMPR, and Histopaque were obtained from Sigma. SB202190, SB202474, SB203580, SB203580-iodo, and SB220025 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Erythroid differentiation was determined by measuring hemoglobin production by benzidine staining (17Nagy K. Pasti G. Bene L. Nagy I. Leuk. Res. 1995; 19: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Benzidine dihydrochloride (2 mg/ml) was prepared in 0.5 m (3%) acetic acid, and H2O2 (1%) was added immediately before use. The cell suspensions were mixed with the benzidine solution in a 1:1 ratio and counted in a hemocytometer after 5 min. Blue cells were considered positive for hemoglobin, and at least 1000 cells were counted per sample. Uptake assays of [3H]Ara C was conducted in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C. 5 × 105 K562 cells/sample were washed once with RPMI 1640 medium and then resuspended in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 medium. After preincubation with SB analogues or control Me2SO for 15 min, an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing 3H-labeled Ara C (100 nm) plus inhibitors or control Me2SO was added for 30 min. Uptake of 3H-labeled Ara C was stopped by five rapid washes with ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium containing 200 μm unlabeled competing Ara C. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 200 μm unlabeled Ara C. The cell pellets were lysed in 10% SDS before quantification of radioactivity. Uridine uptake assays were conducted as described previously (18Fang X. Parkinson F.E. Mowles D.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) at room temperature in sodium-containing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 3 mm K2HPO4, 1 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 130 mmNaCl, pH 7.4) or sodium-free transport buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, 3 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 2 mmCaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 130 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine/HCl, pH 7.4). 5 × 105 K562 cells/sample or G9c cells were washed once with transport buffer and then resuspended in 400 μl of transport buffer. After preincubation with SB analogues, NBMPR, or Me2SO for 15 min, uptake assays were started by adding an equal volume of transport buffer containing 3H-labeled uridine (10 μm) plus inhibitors or Me2SO. Uptake assays were stopped by five rapid washes with ice-cold transport buffer containing 1 mm unlabeled competing uridine. The cell pellets were lysed in 10% SDS before quantification of radioactivity. Binding of NBMPR to K562 cells was measured using an assay described in detail previously (19Hogue D.L. Hodgson K.C. Cass C.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, total binding (5 × 105 cells/assay) was assessed in the transport buffer described above to which had been added graded concentrations (0.05–5 nm) of [3H]NBMPR. Alternatively, K562 cells were first incubated with various concentrations of SB analogues, and then 0.5 nm [3H]NBMPR was added. Binding was assessed at room temperature for 45 min. Nonspecific binding was determined by addition of 10 μm non-radioactive NBMPR in a set of replicate assay mixtures. Buffy coats from normal donors were obtained from the American Red Cross (Charlotte, NC). The human erythrocytes were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation (2600 rpm) using Histopaque 1077 (Sigma). Human erythrocyte ghost membranes were prepared as described earlier (20Hammond J.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 361: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). [3H]NBMPR binding assays were performed at room temperature in 10 mmTris (pH 7.1) containing 0.01% CHAPS (w/v). Incubations were initiated by adding an aliquot of 3 μg of erythrocyte ghost membranes to a glass tube containing the 0.5 nm [3H]NBMPR in the absence or presence of various concentrations of SB203580-iodo. Incubations were terminated after 45 min by dilution with 5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris (pH 7.1) followed by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters, which were then washed once with 5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris (pH 7.1). Nonspecific binding of [3H]NBMPR was determined in the presence of 10 μm NBMPR. G9c cells (1 × 107), treated as described in the figure legends, were harvested, and the samples were prepared and analyzed for nucleotides as described previously (21Huang M. Kozlowski P. Collins M. Wang Y. Haystead T.A. Graves L.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Incubation of human K562 erythroleukemia cells with 50 nm Ara C increased the benzidine-positive staining of these cells in a time-dependent manner with ∼80% differentiation occurring after 96 h. To determine whether p38 MAPK was involved in regulating the differentiation of these cells, K562 cells were co-incubated with Ara C and SB203580. Addition of 10 μmSB203580 inhibited greater than 90% of the Ara C-dependent differentiation of these cells after 96 h (Fig.1 A). To further investigate the influence of p38 MAPK inhibitors on this process, we examined whether these compounds affected the uptake of Ara C into cells. K562 cells were incubated with 50 nm [3H]Ara C and increasing concentrations of SB203580 or SB203580-iodo, an analogue of SB203580 with similar inhibitory effects on p38 MAPK (22Tong L. Pav S. White D.M. Rogers S. Crane K.M. Cywin C.L. Brown M.L. Pargellis C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, both SB203580 and SB203580-iodo significantly inhibited the uptake of [3H]Ara C into K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Because these results suggested that nucleoside transport was affected by these compounds, we examined whether the uptake of [3H]uridine was prevented by the p38 MAPK inhibitors. Incubation of K562 cells with four different SB derivatives (Fig. 2 A) demonstrated that SB203580-iodo, SB203580, and SB202474 inhibited the uptake of [3H]uridine in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SB220025 was without effect (Fig. 2 B). SB202474 does not inhibit p38 MAPK, whereas SB220025 inhibits this kinase with aK i similar to SB203580 (7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.C. Kumar S. Griswold D.E. Underwood D.C. Votta B.J. Adams J.L. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 47: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Thus these results demonstrated that the effects on [3H]uridine uptake occurred independently of p38 MAPK inhibition. Analysis of the data revealed an IC50 of 93.5 ± 1.5 and 689.4 ± 222.2 nm for SB203580-iodo and SB203580, respectively (Fig.2 B). In addition, the related compound SB202190 also inhibited [3H]uridine uptake in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Since previous studies suggested that the majority of nucleoside uptake in K562 cells occurred by NBMPR-sensitive, equilibrative transporters (23Boleti H. Coe I.R. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the uptake of [3H]NBMPR was prevented by the p38 MAPK inhibitors. Addition of [3H]NBMPR to K562 cells demonstrated that this compound was rapidly transported into K562 cells in a time-dependent manner (data not shown). Incubation of K562 cells with SB203580-iodo potently inhibited the uptake of [3H]NBMPR into these cells (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, using isolated human erythrocyte membranes, we found that SB203580-iodo directly interfered with the binding of3H-labeled NBMPR to nucleoside transporter with an IC50 of 0.5 μm (Fig. 2 C). Finally, the efficacy of the SB derivatives in preventing the uptake and salvage of pyrimidine nucleosides was further evaluated using a uridine-dependent cell model system (G9c). The G9c cell line is a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that lacks the capacity for de novo pyrimidine synthesis and requires exogenous uridine to synthesize pyrimidine ribo- (or deoxy-) nucleotides for cell growth (24Banerjei L.C. Davidson J.N. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1997; 23: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). G9c cells were first deprived of uridine for 24 h and then incubated with increasing concentrations of SB203580-iodo, NBMPR, or Me2SO for an additional 8 h in the presence or absence of 5 μm uridine. Removal of uridine from the growth medium resulted in the depletion of the UTP and CTP pools, whereas the purines, ATP and GTP, were unaffected (Fig. 3). Addition of 5 μmuridine to the growth medium restored the intracellular pyrimidine nucleotide pools; however, addition of SB203580-iodo and NBMPR prevented pool restoration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). By contrast, coincubation of uridine-starved G9c cells with SB203580-iodo or NBMPR alone for an additional 8 h had no obvious effect on pyrimidine pools in comparison with the uridine-starved G9c cells (data not shown). These results indicated that inhibition of nucleoside transporters by the SB analogues was sufficient to inhibit the salvage of pyrimidine nucleosides in vivo. The salvage of pyrimidine nucleosides is critically dependent on facilitated transport into cells. In addition, cellular uptake of chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogues such as Ara C or gemcitabine (2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine) occurs by equilibrative nucleoside transport (25Mackey J.R. Mani R.S. Selner M. Mowles D. Young J.D. Belt J.A. Crawford C.R. Cass C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4349-4357PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mackey J.R. Yao S.Y. Smith K.M. Karpinski E. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Young J.D.

Paterson A.R. Larratt L.M. Turner A.R. Belch A.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 346-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the current study demonstrate that the uptake of nucleosides and nucleoside analogues is potently inhibited by the imidazoline class of p38 MAPK inhibitors. While our results do not eliminate a role for p38 MAPK in Ara C-mediated differentiation of K562 cells, these data show that the SB compounds inhibit nucleoside transport independently of p38 MAPK activity. Specifically, SB202474, an analogue of SB203580 that does not inhibit p38 MAPK (7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar), dose dependently inhibited nucleoside transport. Consistent with this observation, incubation of K562 cells with SB202474 also prevented the Ara C-dependent differentiation of these cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner (72 h: control, 4.4 ± 0.8%; 10 μm SB202474, 4.8 ± 0.4%; 50 μm SB202474, 9.0 ± 0.4%; 50 nm Ara C, 33.7 ± 3.0%; 50 nm Ara C plus 10 μm SB202474, 20.1 ± 2.1%; 50 nm Ara C plus 50 μm SB202474, 8.8 ± 3.0%. 96 h: control, 8.2 ± 1.6%; 10 μm SB202474, 9.1 ± 2.0%; 50 μm SB202474, 9.9 ± 1.9%; 50 nm Ara C, 72.9 ± 6.9%; 50 nm Ara C plus 10 μm SB202474, 50.8 ± 6.6%; 50 nm Ara C plus 50 μm SB202474, 9.4 ± 1.5%). The observation that SB202474 was less effective than either SB203580 or SB203580-iodo suggests that the absence of a fluorobenzyl ring may reduce the efficiency of nucleoside transport inhibition (see Fig.2 A). By contrast, SB220025, a novel inhibitor of p38 MAPK with similar potency (IC50 = 60 nm) (29Jackson J.R. Bolognese B. Hillegass L. Kassis S. Adams J. Griswold D.E. Winkler J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 687-692PubMed Google Scholar) to SB203580 (IC50 = 48 nm) (7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.C. Kumar S. Griswold D.E. Underwood D.C. Votta B.J. Adams J.L. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 47: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit nucleoside transport in K562 cells. Thus these results show that some SB analogues inhibit nucleoside transport in a p38 MAPK-independent manner and provide insight into the structure/activity relationship of these compounds. The results of our studies demonstrate that the equilibrative transporters are targets for inhibition by this class of p38 MAPK inhibitors. In human erythroleukemia (K562) cells, ∼80–90% of total nucleoside transport activity occurs by equilibrative, NBMPR-sensitive (es) transport, whereas the remainder occurs by an NBMPR-insensitive (ei) transport process (23Boleti H. Coe I.R. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1167-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using K562 cells as a model system, we observed that greater than 90% of the uridine transport was inhibited by the SB compounds. Moreover using K562 cells or membranes from erythrocytes we demonstrated a specific, competitive inhibition of NBMPR binding, strongly indicating that the SB analogues inhibited the activity of human ENT1. The pattern of nucleoside transporter expression has been shown to vary according to the cell line or origin (1Pastor-Anglada M. Casado F.J. Valdes R. Mata J. Garcia-Manteiga J. Molina M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrating that the SB analogues completely prevented the salvage of pyrimidine nucleosides and that SB203580-iodo was more effective than NBMPR at inhibiting uridine transport or the repletion of intracellular pyrimidine nucleotide pools in G9c cells suggests additional effects of these compounds on the ei or concentrative transporters. Measuring uridine uptake in the presence of NBMPR in these cells demonstrated that the SB compounds inhibited both ei and es nucleoside transporters (data not shown). Whether there are similar inhibitory effects of these compounds on other types of nucleoside transporters (i.e.concentrative) remains to be determined.

In addition to the known effect of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, arachidonic acid itself also activates PPARs (10Alaoui-El-Azher M., Wu, Y. Havet N. Israel A. Lilienbaum A. Touqui L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a potentially important role of AA metabolism in the regulation of intracellular signal events through activation of PPARs. Altered arachidonic acid metabolism has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung diseases characterized by chronic airway inflammation, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis (18Drazen J.M.

The critical role of cPLA2 in AA metabolism is supported by the characteristics of this enzyme including its selectivity for substrate AA and its regulation by phosphorylation, physiologically relevant concentrations of calcium, and induction of enzyme synthesis. One of the intriguing characteristics of cPLA2 is its preferential translocation from cytoplasm to the membranes including the nuclear envelope in response to increased intracellular calcium (7Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 39Glover S. de Carvalho M.S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Leslie C.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Based on the important role of cPLA2 in AA release, the documented nuclear targeting of cPLA2, and the activation of PPARs by AA in nuclei, we hypothesized that translocation of cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope upon activation may lead to increased production of AA in the nuclei for PPAR activation in airway epithelial cells. This study was thus designed to document the potential role of cPLA2 in PPAR-mediated gene transcription in human airway epithelial cells, and this effect was compared with the effect of group IIA sPLA2. The lung epithelial cell lines BEAS 2B, A549, and H292 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Frozen vials of primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and the bronchial epithelial cell growth media (BEGM) were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). LHC-8 medium was obtained from BIOSOURCE International (Rockville, MD). Ham’s F12K medium, RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum, glutamine, antibiotics, and the LipofectAMINE PlusTM reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) enzyme assay system was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Chemiluminescent reporter assay for β-galactosidase was purchased from Tropix (Bedford, MA). The sPLA2 inhibitor LY311727 was a generous gift from Dr. E. Mihelich at Lilly Research Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). The cPLA2 inhibitor arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), iPLA2 inhibitor haloenol lactone suicide substrate (HELSS), and ionophore A23187 were obtained from Calbiochem. Methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphate (MAFP) and the antibody for human group IIA sPLA2 were obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). [3H]Chloramphenicol and [3H]arachidonic acid were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and AmershamBiosciences. Plasmid purification reagents were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The antibodies for human cPLA2, PPAR-α, -β, and -γ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked streptavidin and chemiluminescence detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. IL-1β was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Unless indicated otherwise, all other chemicals were from Sigma. The cPLA2expression plasmid was kindly provided by Drs. J. Clark and J. Knopf at the Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA (43Clark J.D.

The PPRE reporter construct was kindly provided by Dr. W. Wahli, Switzerland. This vector contains the CAT coding sequence driven by a promoter consisting of two copies of the CYP4A6 PPRE (2× AGGTCAAAGGTCA) in the upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter (15Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Four types of human lung epithelial cells were utilized in this study (BEAS 2B, A549, H292, and primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells). Passages 4–20 of the above three cell lines were used for experiments. The BEAS 2B cells were seeded on flasks or plates coated with a thin layer of type I rat tail collagen and cultured in serum-free and hormonally defined culture medium LHC. The A549 cells were cultured on uncoated culture flasks or plates and cultured in Ham’s F12K medium containing 2 mml-glutamine and 10% of fetal bovine serum. The H292 cells were cultured on uncoated culture flasks or plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The NHBE cells were expanded and cultured according to the protocol provided by Clonetics. Passages 3–7 NHBE cells were seeded on 6-well plates or T-25 culture flasks (2 × 104 cells/cm2) and cultured in the complete BEGM (modified LHC-9 media supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 6.5 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 0.5 μg/ml epinephrine, 5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 0.1 ng/ml retinoic acid, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 0.4% bovine pituitary extract; Clonetics). To construct the group IIA sPLA2 expression plasmid, we first obtained full-length human group IIA sPLA2 cDNA using reverse transcription-PCR of human lung RNA. The primer pair was constructed according to the cDNA sequence (44Seilhamer J.J. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Plant S. Miller J.A. Kloss J. Johnson L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5335-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It amplified an 823-bp product and was composed of the following sequences: 5′ primer,8CAACTCTGGAGTCCTCTGAGAGAGCC33; 3′ primer,830GCTAATTGCTTTATTCAGAAGAGAC806. The amplified full-length human group IIA sPLA2 cDNA was then cloned in sense orientation into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The identity and orientation of this construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The BEAS 2B and NHBE cells were used for transfection experiments. The cells were seeded on 6-well plates coated with a thin layer of type I rat tail collagen (LHC-8 medium for BEAS 2B cells and BEGM medium for NHBE cells). Transfection was performed when the cells reached ∼80% confluence. The cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg each of PLA2 expression plasmids (cPLA2 in pMT-2 and group IIA sPLA2 in pcDNA3.1) or vectors (pMT-2 and pcDNA3.1) and 1.5 μg of PPRE reporter plasmid expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagent. An internal control reporter plasmid expressing the β-galactosidase gene (pIGPlacZ) was used to normalize the transfection efficiency (0.2 μg in each transfection). After exposure to the mixture of transfection reagents and plasmids for 3 (for NHBE cells) or 4 h (for BEAS 2B cells), the cultures were maintained in medium for 24 h. The cells were then incubated with or without A23187(10−6m) for 2 h and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis of cPLA2 and group IIA sPLA2 as well as for measurement of CAT reporter activity. Different time points were used throughout the study in order to investigate different signal transduction events. One hour of incubation was used to investigate PPAR binding to PPREs in the EMSA experiments. A 2-h incubation afterA23187 stimulation was used for reporter gene experiments where cells transfected with overexpression vectors were used. A 4-h incubation was used for quiescent cells transfected with PPRE reporter gene only and stimulated with A23187. In these experiments, AACOCF3 was added 30 min and MAFP or NS 398 was added 2 h prior to initiation of the experiments. The 24-h time point was used for cells incubated with inhibitors without A23187 or co-transfection with expression vectors. In these particular experiments, cells were incubated with various PLA2 inhibitors immediately after the transfection in order to prevent exposure of the PPRE reporter gene to AA products derived from PLA2 activity. Human lung cells (A549, BEAS 2B, or NHBE) were grown to 90% confluence in 6-well dishes. Cells were labeled for 16 h with 1 μCi/ml [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) (214 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in media. Subsequently, after three washes with warm 1× PBS, 1 ml of calcium ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem) at the specified concentrations in media was added to some wells on a 6-well plate and incubated for 30 min. Cells incubated with Me2SO (vehicle) served as a control. Medium was collected and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and 0.9 ml of medium from each sample was transferred to a scintillation vial containing 10 ml of Bio-Safe II scintillation fluid (Research International Products Inc., Mount Prospect, IL) and counted in a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Columbia, MD). Data are expressed as mean dpm ± S.E. cPLA2 activity was determined as described previously (35Wu T. Levine S.J. Lawrence M.G. Logun C. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Data are presented as [14C]arachidonic acid release in dpm/μg of cellular protein/h ± S.E. Secreted phospholipase A2 activity was measured in cell supernatants using the same system as for cPLA2 with modifications allowing detection of sPLA2 activity. sPLA2 activity was obtained as a difference between the PLA2 activity from cells supernatant untreated with dithiothreitol and the PLA2activity from supernatant treated with 1 mm dithiothreitol. The activity assay for sPLA2 was performed in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+. Data are presented as [14C]arachidonic acid release in dpm/μg of cellular protein/h ± S.E. The CAT reporter activity in cell extract was determined using the CAT enzyme assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The β-galactosidase activity was measured with the chemiluminescent reporter assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For immunoblotting analysis of cPLA2, group IIA sPLA2, PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ, the cell lysates from human airway epithelial cells were prepared using lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics). Samples containing 10 μg of cellular protein were separated on 4–20 or 16% Tris glycine gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) using Tris glycine SDS running buffer. The separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (NOVEX). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 dilution of mouse anti-human cPLA2 monoclonal antibody, 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-human group IIA sPLA2 polyclonal antiserum, and 1:500 dilutions of rabbit anti-human PPAR-α, -β, and -γ polyclonal antibodies) in PBS-T containing 3% non-fat milk. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the membranes were washed three times with PBS-T and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 1:5000 dilution of the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBS-T containing 3% non-fat milk. Following washing three times with PBS-T, the protein bands were visualized with the ECL Western blotting detection system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A549 cells were grown in chamber slides (Lab-Tek II, Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) until 60% confluent. Cells were transfected with full-length cPLA2 tagged with GFP (EGFP-FL) vector, which was a generous gift from Drs. J. Evans and C. Leslie from National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, CO (45Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). After 16 h cells were washed twice with PBS and were incubated with media containing Me2SO (vehicle) or withA23187 (1 μm) for 60 s. Afterward, cells were fixed in 3.7% EM grade formaldehyde obtained from Polyscience (Warrington, PA) for 10 min. After 3 washes in PBS in a vertical shaker, cells were fixed using ProLong Antifade Kit from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Slides were analyzed using Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (Nikon, Japan) and Scion Image software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). A549 cells were grown in T-150 flasks to 90% confluence. Cells were exposed to A23187(1 μm) for the specified times. In some cases cells were pretreated with AACOCF3, MAFP, or NS 398 for 2 h prior to treatment with A23187. Culture medium was removed, and cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping into 4 ml of PBS, and centrifuged (500 × g, 5 min). The pellet was dispersed in 5 packed cell volumes of hypo-osmotic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, each 2 mg/ml). After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.6% (v/v), and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (5000 × g, 5 min). The pelleted nuclei were dispersed in a high salt buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin, each 2 mg/ml) to solubilize DNA-binding proteins. The suspended nuclei were gently shaken horizontally for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge (12,000 × g, 20 min). The supernatants containing nuclear proteins were stored at −70 °C until used for EMSA. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Double-stranded PPRE oligonucleotides (CAAAACTAGGTCAAAGGTCA) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The PPRE probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and purified on G-50 columns (AmershamBiosciences). Nuclear extracts (3 μg) were incubated with the32P-labeled PPRE oligonucleotide probe (0.5–1 × 106 cpm) in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5% glycerol, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 0.04 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis through 6% DNA-retardation gels (Invitrogen) in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at room temperature at 200 V. The gels were dried at 75 °C and autoradiographed at −70 °C overnight or until an adequate signal was developed. As a control for specificity, 200-fold molar excess of cold PPRE oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or TFIID consensus oligonucleotide (Promega), respectively, were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature prior to addition of labeled PPRE probe. The data were analyzed with a two-tailed independent Student’s t test. The level of significance was defined as p < 0.05. The dose-dependent effects of A23187 and arachidonic acid on PPRE reporter activity and arachidonic acid release were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. To determine the expression profile of PPARs in human airway epithelial cells, we first performed Western blot analysis for the three PPAR isoforms (PPARα, -β, and -γ) in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells, and in cell lines BEAS 2B, A549, and H292. As shown in Fig. 1, although PPARα is highly expressed in human hepatocytes, it is not detected in human airway epithelial cells by Western blot analysis. In contrast, PPARβ and PPARγ are expressed in all four types of human airway epithelial cells. The primary human bronchial epithelial cells express higher levels of PPARβ than the cell lines BEAS 2B, A549, and H292, which is consistent with the hypothesis that PPARβ may play a role in the differentiation of airway epithelial cells (46Matsuura H. Adachi H. Smart R.C., Xu, X. Arata J. Jetten A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 147: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of PPARγ (PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, which are produced by alternative splicing of the same PPARγ gene) are present in all four types of human bronchial epithelial cells. Whereas primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells contain higher PPARγ2 than PPARγ1, the three human airway epithelial cell lines express slightly higher levels of PPARγ1 than PPARγ2. As expression of PPARγ is detected in all the four types of human airway epithelial cells, we examined the contribution of cPLA2 to PPARγ-mediated gene transcription by using a PPRE reporter construct containing the CAT coding sequence driven by a promoter consisting of two copies of the CYP4A6 PPRE upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter (15Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Although this PPRE-response element can be activated by either PPARα or PPARγ, the absence of PPARα in human airway epithelial cells suggests that this construct likely reflects the activation of PPARγ.Figure 2Structure of the PPRE reporter construct used in this study. It contains the CAT coding sequence driven by a promoter consisting of two copies of the CYP4A6 PPRE in the upstream region of the thymidine kinase (TK) minimal promoter (15Devchand P.R. Keller H.

Western blot analysis of cells transfected with the cPLA2 expression vector demonstrated increased cPLA2 protein expression as compared with cells transfected with empty vector (Fig.3A). BEAS 2B cells transfected with the cPLA2 expression vector demonstrated increased [3H]arachidonic acid release after stimulation with calcium ionophore suggesting increased calcium-dependent phospholipase activity as compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 3B). In order to determine whether the increased cellular arachidonate release is due to increased expression of cPLA2, an assay of cellular lysate for cPLA2activity was performed. In cells transfected with the cPLA2expression vector, cPLA2 activity was significantly increased compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig.3C). In order to determine whether an increase in cPLA2 activity was associated with an increase in PPRE binding, cells were co-transfected with the PPRE reporter gene and then were stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 for 2 h to allow PPAR binding to PPRE and transcription and translation of CAT protein. Similarly, cells transfected with an empty vector were also co-transfected with the PPRE reporter gene. These cells were also stimulated with A23187. Based on the previously documented calcium-induced cPLA2 translocation to nuclear envelope (7Leslie C.C. J."
https://openalex.org/W2004027586,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays an import role in the control of apoptosis. The most well known apoptotic pathway regulated by TNF involves the TNFR1-associated death domain protein, Fas-associated death domain protein, and caspase-8. This study examines the mechanism of TNF-induced apoptosis in FaO rat hepatoma cells. TNF treatment significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. TNF did not activate caspase-8 but activated caspase-3, -10, and -12. The effect of TNF on the expression of different members of the Bcl-2 family in these cells was studied. We observed no detectable changes in the steady-state levels of Bcl-X(L), Bax, and Bid, although TNF suppresses Bcl-2 expression. Dantrolene suppressed the inhibitory effect of TNF on Bcl-2 expression. TNF induced release of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that was blocked by dantrolene. Importantly, the expression of Bcl-2 blocked TNF-induced apoptosis and decreased TNF-induced Ca(2+) release. These results suggest that TNF induces apoptosis by a mechanism that involves increasing Ca(2+) release from the ER and suppression of Bcl-2 expression."

We and others found that overexpressed E2F proteins up-regulate p18 expression. To better understand this phenomenon, we performed a functional analysis of the human p18 promoter. Deletion studies revealed that the E2F-responsive elements of the promoter are located within 131 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This region contains putative Sp1- and E2F-binding sites. Mutational inactivation of these elements revealed that the Sp1 sites were important for the basal activity of the promoter but could also mediate the effects of E2F1 on the p18 promoter. Moreover, we found that E2F1 and Sp1 can synergistically enhance the activity of the proximal p18 promoter. Gel shift analyses using p18 promoter-derived probes led to the identification of several multiprotein complexes that were found to contain different combinations of E2F proteins and/or Sp1. Recombinant E2F1 was also capable of binding to the E2F-binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that E2F1 and E2F4 associate with the p18 promoter in unperturbed cells.

One event of prime importance during the cell cycle is the passage from the G1 to the S phase, during which a complex intracellular signalization, involving a transient rise in the levels of G1 phase cyclin proteins and a concurrent increase in the activity of the associated kinases, leads to the activation of the E2F transcription factor, an important regulator of cell cycle-dependent gene expression (reviewed in Refs.1Harbour J.W.

This observation suggests that E2F1-mediated signaling may be part of an anti-proliferative pathway.One of the cell cycle regulatory genes whose expression is induced by E2F is p18INK4c, a member of the INK4 sub-family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. p18 shares sequence homology with p16INK4a, p15INK4b, and p19INK4dand acts primarily on CDK41and CDK6 kinases uncomplexed with their cyclin partners (19Guan K.L.

On the other hand, p18 expression is down-regulated by agents that stimulate cell proliferation such as genistein in breast cancer cells (32Zhou J.N. Linder S. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 1931-1935PubMed Google Scholar), phorbol esters in HL-60 cells (25Schwaller J. Pabst T. Koeffler H.P. Niklaus G. Loetscher P. Fey M.F. Tobler A.

Mice whose p18 alleles have been knocked out display a variety of aberrant phenotypes including lymphoproliferative disorders, organomegaly, and pituitary gland hyperplasia.

Despite the increasing knowledge concerning the role of p18 in diverse physiological processes, very little is known regarding the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of this gene.The human p18INK4c gene consists of three exons, with the two last exons containing the entire p18 protein coding sequence. In most cell lines, this gene is transcribed in two predominant mRNA species of 2.1 and 1.0 kb. However, several cDNAs of intermediate length have also been cloned. By Northern blot analysis, we have determined that the longest form is the most abundant form in cancer cell lines of various origins including breast cancer (MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and BT-20), erythroleukemia (K562), and cervix carcinoma (HeLa). The 2.1-kb transcript is also the one the most influenced by E2F expression. The p18 promoter, defined in this study as the genomic sequences located upstream of the transcription start site of the long form cDNA (GenBankTM accession numberAF041248 (37Blais A. Labrie Y. Pouliot F. Lachance Y. Labrie C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)), does not contain a TATA box, and its principal feature, reminiscent of other TATA-less promoters, is a region of high G + C content immediately upstream of the transcription initiation region. There are no evident initiator elements (41Smale S.T. Jain A. Kaufmann J. Emami K.H., Lo, K. Garraway I.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev.

Lachance Y. Labrie C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 42Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev.

In an attempt to achieve this objective, we have isolated p18INK4c regulatory sequences and identified those that mediate activation by E2F. We report here that both E2F and Sp1 response elements mediate E2F-induced activation of p18INK4cgene transcription. Furthermore, we have found that some members of the E2F transcription factor family can bind these elements in vitro and induce the transcription of the p18 gene. Moreover, we found that E2F1 and E2F4 associate with the regulatory region of the p18 gene in vivo.DISCUSSIONUnderstanding the complex mechanisms that regulate cell cycle progression will contribute to a better comprehension of the control of cell proliferation and differentiation in physiological circumstances, as well as of the pathological disruptions of this growth control pathway that occur in cancer. We have examined the regulation of p18 promoter activity by the cell cycle regulator E2F in order to understand, at the molecular level, how a transcription factor renowned for stimulating cell proliferation can up-regulate a gene whose product serves to prevent passage from G1 to S phase. Previous studies had shown that E2F up-regulates p18 mRNA levels. We have extended these observations by demonstrating that E2F-induced increases in p18 mRNA levels are accompanied by corresponding increases in p18 protein levels. Moreover, we found that the p18 promoter is a direct transcriptional target of E2F, and we have identified promoter elements that mediate the effect of E2F, and we have identified transcription factors that associate with these elements.To examine the various aspects of the regulation of p18 promoter activity by E2F, we used different experimental models that we deemed most informative. Adenovirus infections and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed in WI-38 cells because these cells represent a “normal” cell line with an intact Rb-E2F pathway. MCF7 cells were chosen for promoter deletion/mutation analyses because they have relatively low endogenous E2F activity, and they are easily transfected. Likewise, SL2 cells were chosen for experiments requiring overexpression of Sp1 because they lack endogenous Sp1. To identify transcription factors that associate with the E2F-responsive region of the p18 promoter, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using HeLa cell extracts because these have been extensively used to characterize E2F. The sum of these experiments provides a set of consistent data that paints a clearer picture of the mechanism of p18 promoter regulation by E2F. These data allow us to draw a number of conclusions.First, the elements of the p18 promoter that are required for induction by E2F reside within the first 131 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Transient transfection experiments performed in MCF7 cells showed that the 131-bp promoter was as responsive to E2F as a construct containing 1600 bp of promoter DNA. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that sites upstream of −1600 could be involved in activation by E2F, we believe that the −131 promoter contains the most essential E2F-responsive elements because the magnitude of the response of the −1600 and −131 promoters to E2F in transient expression experiments (38–53-fold) is at least equal to the magnitude of the increase in endogenous p18 mRNA levels induced by E2F in the context of an adenoviral infection (5–19-fold). Similar transient transfection experiments performed in T98G (neuroblastoma), HeLa (cervix carcinoma), and MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma) cells, as well as adenoviral infection experiments performed in U-2 OS and Saos-2 (osteogenic sarcoma) cells, yielded comparable results (data not shown).The −131 promoter contains four regulatory elements that could potentially bind transcription factors. These include a combined E2F/Sp1-binding site at −121, an Sp1-binding site at −98, a cluster of five Sp1-binding sites between −56 and −32, and an E2F-binding site at −23. The specificity of each response element was confirmed by EMSAs by incubating the corresponding labeled DNA probes with excess amounts of oligonucleotides containing E2F or Sp1 consensus binding sites. In addition, as predicted, the −121 and −23 E2F-binding sites could bind to recombinant (synthesized in vitro) E2F1 and DP1, whereas the −98 Sp1 site and the Sp1 cluster could interact with purified Sp1 protein. The physiological relevance of these interactions was further confirmed by performing EMSA antibody interference (supershift) experiments using HeLa cell extracts. These experiments showed that different members of the E2F family (E2F1, E2F3, E2F4, and DP1) and of the Sp1 family (Sp1 and Sp3) interact with the corresponding response elements. These results were confirmed by EMSA experiments performed with protein extracts prepared from T98G and MCF7 cells (data not shown).One particularly interesting finding of the EMSA experiments was that E2F1 and DP1 (expressed as GST fusion proteins), as well as Sp1, can interact with the Sp1 cluster of the p18 promoter. We could detect a strong interaction between bacterially produced GST-E2F1 and the −70 to −21 region of the p18 gene promoter, and this binding was unaffected by the binding of Sp1 to the probe (i.e. neither mutually exclusive nor cooperative). This observation agrees with data concerning the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene, and its induction by E2F involves a direct interaction between E2F1 and a GC-rich portion of the promoter of this gene (61Shin E.K. Tevosian S.G. Yee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12261-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Additional experiments will be needed to determine whether other transcription factors, particularly the other members of the E2F family, interact with the −131 p18 promoter. For instance, the sequences of the −121 and −23 E2F-binding sites of the p18 promoter are highly similar to the “class I E2F consensus site,” 5′-TTTCCCGC-3′, which is a preferred binding site for the E2F6 protein (62Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although the structure of the E2F6 protein suggests that it could act as a transcriptional repressor or as an inducer of E2F-regulated genes, depending on the cellular context, the function of this protein in cell cycle regulation is not yet well defined. In addition, because there exist different isoforms of some of these proteins which may be differentially regulated or expressed during the cell cycle, it will be important to determine which of these interact with the p18 promoter. For example, two human E2F3 proteins, designated E2F3a and E2F3b, have been described in HL-60 cells (63He Y. Armanious M.K. Thomas M.J. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3422-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The antibody we used to detect E2F3 in supershift experiments detects a predominant polypeptide of ∼55 kDa (presumably E2F3a) in Western blots of HeLa extracts. Similarly, the SP3 transcript gives rise by internal translation initiation to at least three proteins of different sizes. The shorter forms are truncated in their transactivation domain, a fact that could in part explain why Sp3 can also act as a transcriptional repressor (60Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding these limitations, which will be resolved in part when appropriate immunologic reagents are available, the results of the EMSA experiments provide a good indication of the type of proteins that interact with the E2F-responsive region of the human p18 promoter.The functional relevance of the aforementioned regulatory elements of the p18 promoter was tested in human MCF7 breast cancer cells and D. melanogaster SL2 cells, as well as in other cell lines (data not shown), in transient expression experiments using p18 promoter constructs harboring mutations in one or more of these elements. These experiments showed that the Sp1-binding sites in the −56 to −28 cluster play a particularly important role in controlling basal p18 promoter activity. The protein-DNA interaction data suggest that the Sp1 and/or Sp3 transcription factors are responsible for the basal level of p18 gene expression. These factors belong to a large family of zinc finger transcription factors that are not, as was once believed, only implicated in the transcription of housekeeping genes. The ubiquitous Sp1 and Sp3 proteins are also important for the control of the expression of several genes in response to a variety of stimuli such as mitogenic signaling and differentiation. Moreover, they have the ability to interact with different transcriptional modulators, including E2F1 and pRb (64Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar).In terms of the response to E2F1, we found that either the −23 E2F site alone or the Sp1 cluster could mediate a robust (∼10-fold) stimulation by E2F. On the other hand, both basal promoter activity as well as the magnitude of the response to E2F were severely impaired when both the Sp1 cluster and the −23 E2F site were mutated in combination with mutations of the −121 E2F/Sp1 and/or −98 Sp1 sites. These results indicate that these elements are functionally redundant, at least in terms of their role in mediating activation by E2F1. Interestingly, we observed a strong cooperative effect between E2F1 and Sp1 on p18 promoter activity. The promoter of the dihydrofolate reductase gene, which has been well characterized in hamster, mouse, and human, also contains Sp1 and E2F response elements in the vicinity of its transcription initiation region (42Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). The basal transcription of this gene relies on the presence of these sites, because the position of the E2F site influences the transcription initiation position, and because the absence of functional Sp1 protein or Sp1-binding sites in the promoter abolishes transcription. Moreover, it was found that the E2F site of the dihydrofolate reductase promoter is involved in promoter silencing in serum-starved conditions, whereas serum responsiveness relies on the Sp1 sites (65Jensen D.E. Black A.R. Swick A.G. Azizkhan J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Others have suggested that E2F and Sp1 could act in a synergistic fashion on the promoter of different genes, including dihydrofolate reductase, to recruit the transcriptional apparatus and to enhance transcriptional elongation (55Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 66Lin S.Y. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell.

Commun. 2002; 291: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There is also mounting evidence that the E2F-Sp1 cooperation may form, along with pRb and HDAC1, the core of a “transcriptional switch,” whose function is to couple transcriptional regulation with cell cycle phase transition (69Chang Y.C. Illenye S. Heintz N.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 70Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). These topics are beyond the scope of the work reported here but clearly deserve to be investigated in the future, because they could help to better understand the coupling of transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression.Previous studies that identified E2F as an inducer of p18 expression relied solely on overexpression of E2F proteins (22DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 53Ishida S. Huang E. Zuzan H. Spang R. Leone G. West M.

Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). We have also used adenoviral vectors and transient expression assays to assess the role of E2F on p18 expression and promoter activity. However, these models are not without flaws because overexpression of E2F may cause major perturbations in a cell and thereby elicit nonspecific responses. By using a more physiological approach, i.e. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we showed here that E2F1 and E2F4 can associate with the promoter of the p18 gene in unperturbed WI-38 cells. These results constitute additional and compelling evidence that E2F proteins are involved in the regulation of p18 gene expression.Of the seven cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes characterized to date, three (p18, p19, and p21) have been shown to be transcriptionally induced by E2F. The induction of p21 expression by E2F is not at odds with the properties of E2F when one considers that p21 can act as an assembly factor for cyclin-CDK complexes (72Hiyama H. Iavarone A. Reeves S.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 73Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the observation that E2F induces p18 and p19 is not so easily rationalized. Hirai et al. (20Hirai H. Roussel M.F. Kato J.Y. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the maximum levels of p19INK4d (and of p18INK4c) in S phase could serve to inhibit CDK4 and CDK6 activity once the G1phase is over. This concept was reiterated by DeGregori et al. (22DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) who proposed that the E2F-p18 link could constitute a retro-feedback loop that would prevent E2F activity beyond the restriction point. Others have proposed that p18 mRNAs derived from alternate promoters of the p18 gene may not be translated with equal efficiency such that differential expression of said transcripts could influence p18 protein levels. This hypothesis is based on the work of Phelps et al. (29Phelps D. Hsiao K., Li, Y., Hu, N. Franklin D. Westphal E. Lee E. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) who observed that a translationally inefficient long form of the p18 mRNA was down-regulated during myogenic differentiation of murine C2C12 myoblasts, whereas the short form of p18 mRNA, which is translated efficiently, was up-regulated during this process.

The phosphorylation-dependent interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with a subset of RGS proteins inhibits their GTPase-accelerating activity in vitro. The inhibitory interaction between 14-3-3 and RGS7 requires phosphorylation of serine 434 of RGS7. We now show that phosphorylation of serine 434 is dynamically regulated by TNF-α. Cellular stimulation by TNF-α transiently decreased the phosphorylation of serine 434 of RGS7, abrogating the inhibitory interaction with 14-3-3. We examined the effect of 14-3-3 on RGS-mediated deactivation kinetics of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) in Xenopusoocytes. 14-3-3 inhibited the function of wild-type RGS7, but not that of either RSG7P436R or RGS4, two proteins that do not bind 14-3-3.

By accelerating the inactivation of GTP-bound Gαi and Gαq subunits, the “regulator of G protein signaling” (RGS)1proteins negatively regulate the strength and duration of G protein signaling. RGS proteins act catalytically; a single molecule binds and inactivates multiple GTP-bound Gα subunits. Functional specificity and temporal activity of RGS proteins arises from patterns of expression, transcriptional regulation, subcellular localization, and posttranslational modification (1Benzing T. Brandes R. Sellin L. Schermer B. Lecker S. Walz G. Kim E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whereas some RGS proteins are ubiquitously expressed, others are temporally and spatially restricted to certain tissues and developmental stages or are induced by cellular activation (reviewed in Refs. 2Berman D.M.

Interaction with other cytoplasmic proteins affects the stability, function, and subcellular localization of RGS proteins (reviewed in Refs. 4De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G.

We have previously shown that binding to 14-3-3 modulates the activity of certain RGS proteins, including RGS7, in vitro (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B.

These RGS proteins contain a conserved SYP motif with upstream basic residues located in one of the three contact sites formed between Gαi and the RGS domain. Binding of 14-3-3 to the SYP motif of RGS7 requires the phosphorylation of the serine residue at position 434. In this study, we demonstrate that TNF-α inhibits the phosphorylation of serine 434 and the interaction of RGS7 with 14-3-3. RGS7 is highly expressed in the mouse brain, with a substantial fraction associated with 14-3-3. Treatment of mice with TNF-α completely abrogated the interaction of RGS7 with 14-3-3. We examined the effect of 14-3-3 on RGS-mediated deactivation kinetics of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) in a Xenopus co-expression system (7Doupnik C.A. Davidson N.

Microinjected 14-3-3 protein slowed the deactivation of GIRKs in the presence of wild-type RGS7, but had no effect in the presence of either RSG7P436Ror RGS4, two proteins that do not associate with 14-3-3. Our findings demonstrate that the activity of RGS7 is regulated by extracellular signals. FLAG-tagged versions of human RGS7, RGS3, and 14-3-3 have been described previously (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged RGS4 and RGS8 were cloned from human cDNA libraries generated by standard cloning procedures. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to insert mutations in RGS7. Point mutations were verified by sequence analysis. M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors and the GIRK constructs were kind gifts of Dr. Silvio Gutkind, Dr. Melanie Mark, and Dr. Ernest Peralta. A phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 429–451 of human RGS7 (acetyl-CLMKSDpSYPRFIRS-amide) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to generate polyclonal antiserum (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA). The rabbit antiserum was preabsorbed three times with the corresponding non-phosphopeptide coupled to an agarose column. Specificity and titer were monitored by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, using phospho- and non-phosphopeptide conjugated to BSA. Phospho-specific antiserum was affinity-purified by passing the flow-through of the third preabsorption over a phosphopeptide column. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method. After incubation for 24 h, untreated cells and cells treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α were washed twice and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose (for mouse monoclonal antibodies) or protein A-Sepharose (for rabbit polyclonal antisera) (Amersham Biosciences) for ∼3 h. Following extensive washing with lysis buffer, proteins samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and following primary and secondary antibody incubation, detected by chemiluminescence. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA as indicated. After stimulation, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 15 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors for 15 min on ice. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 4–8 μg of recombinant purified GST.14-3-3τ prebound to glutathione-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences). Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and precipitated proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.). Equal loading of GST.14-3-3τ was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. For preparation of brain protein extracts, female BALB/c mice (20 g in body weight, Charles River) were injected intravenously in the tail vein with solvent or 20 μg of murine TNF-α. After 4 h, the mice were sacrificed and brains were removed and homogenized essentially as described (1Benzing T. Brandes R. Sellin L. Schermer B. Lecker S. Walz G. Kim E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation and ultracentrifugation (100,000 ×g, 4 °C, 30 min), the supernatant was subjected to several preclearing steps, divided into two fractions, and immunoprecipitated with specific anti-RGS7 antiserum (rabbit polyclonal antiserum generated against MBP-RGS7170–469 and affinity-purified with GST-RGS7315–469) and control antibody, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose. Resulting precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-14-3-3 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antiserum and enhanced chemiluminescence. One microgram of purified GST.RGS7315–469 or MBP.RGS7315–469 was incubated with 0.5 unit of recombinant protein kinase C α (1850 units/mg, Panvera) in enzyme dilution buffer or enzyme dilution buffer alone (control) for 30 min or the indicated times at 37 °C in a 100-μl reaction. Final concentrations of reagents were 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP, 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.03% Triton X-100. To monitor the incorporation of phosphate, the unlabeled ATP was supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP. Radiolabeled MBP.RGS7315–469 or GST.RGS7315–469 was detected by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE or by scintillation counting after binding to nitrocellulose filter. Xenopus laevis frogs were anesthesized (4 mm aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester for 25 min), and oocytes were isolated by partial ovarectomy. Subsequently, oocytes were manually dissected from ovarian lobes and defolliculated by treatment with 1 mg/ml collagenase type A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) in a Ca2+-free hypotonic solution (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Oocytes were washed, and transferred to ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4, supplemented with 50 ng/ml gentamicin and 0.5 mmtheophylline. cRNAs were synthesized in vitro using the mMessage Machine kit (Ambion). 12–24 h after isolation, stage V-VI oocytes were injected with 30 nl of water containing 1 ng of cRNA for the M2 receptor, 0.1 ng for GIRK1 and GIRK2, and 10 ng for the different RGS proteins. Control oocytes were injected with water instead of RGS-cRNAs. Voltage clamp experiments were performed 2–4 days after injection of cRNAs. Recombinant proteins were injected into the oocytes 2–12 h prior to the experiments. 30 nl of GST (0.5 mg/ml) and GST.14-3-3 (1 mg/ml) were injected resulting in a final cytosolic concentration of ∼500 nm. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp was used to assess the RGS protein function in vivo. Whole cell currents of oocytes were recorded using the Turbo TEC 03X voltage/current clamp amplifier (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany). Microelectrodes were pulled on a vertical puller (Physiologisches Institut, Freiburg, Germany) from borosilicate glass capillaries (Clark Instruments, Reading, United Kingdom) and had resistances of 0.5–2 mΩ when filled with 2 mKCl solution. Experiments were performed at 20 °C. All whole cell voltage clamp experiments were conducted in ND96 solution or a modified ND96-K80 solution in which 80 mm of NaCl were replaced with KCl. Acetycholine (1 μm) and atropine (1 μm) were added to the ND96-K80 solution to activate and antagonize the M2 receptor. Oocytes were clamped at 0 mV, and voltage ramps from −100 to +50 mV were applied every 1.2 s. Time constants for current decrease after removal of acetycholine were fitted with a single exponential (Origin, Additive, Germany). Data are presented as original recordings and as mean values ± S.E. (n = number of experiments). Unpaired Student’st test was used for statistical analysis. A pvalue of <0.05 was accepted to indicate statistical significance. The serine at position 434 of RGS7 constitutes a 14-3-3 binding site when phosphorylated (Fig. 1A) (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To monitor the phosphorylation status of serine 434, a phosphopeptide containing phosphorylated serine 434 was used to generate polyclonal antiserum. To affinity-purify antiserum that specifically recognized phosphorylated serine 434, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides were covalently coupled to agarose. After several rounds of positive and negative selection, the phospho-specific serine 434 antiserum recognized less than 1 pmol of RGS7-derived peptide, but did not bind non-phosphorylated peptide nor BSA (Fig. 1B). Serine 434 can be phosphorylated by several protein kinase C isozymes (PKC α, β, γ, ε, μ, ζ; scansite.mit.edu/, Motif Scanner at low stringency). To test whether phosphorylated RGS7 was specifically recognized by the phosphoserine 434-specific antiserum, the RGS7 truncation containing the RGS domain (RGS7315–469) was fused to either maltose-binding protein (MBP) or GST and phosphorylated with PKC α (Fig. 1, C–E). Due to the presence of multiple potential PKC phosphorylation sites (Ser442, Ser456, Thr458, Ser468), the overall level of phosphorylation is unchanged by the mutation of serine 434 to aspartic acid (Fig. 1D). However, the phospho-specific antiserum specifically recognized phosphorylated, but not non-phosphorylated RGS7315–469 nor the S434D mutation of RGS7315–469 (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, the antiserum specifically immunoprecipitates phophorylated RGS7315–469 fused to GST, but not a non-phosphorylated GST-RGS7315–469 fusion protein nor GST alone (Fig. 1F). These experiments demonstrate the specificity of the antiserum for phosphorylated serine 434 of recombinant RGS7 in both immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. We have previously shown that binding to 14-3-3 modulates the activity of certain RGS proteins, including RGS7 (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine whether TNF-α mediates the accumulation of functionally active RGS7, we monitored serine 434 phosphorylation of RGS7 in transfected HEK 293T cells. Although lysates of TNF-treated cells contain more RGS7 than untreated cells (Fig.2A, left panel), precipitation of RGS7 by the phospho-specific antiserum is substantially decreased (Fig. 2A, right panel). The phospho-specific antiserum was used to precipitate phosphoserine 434-containing RGS7; precipitated protein was then detected using the FLAG-specific M2 antibody. After 30-min stimulation with TNF-α, the accumulation of RGS7 is accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of serine 434 and marked dissociation with 14-3-3 (Fig. 2B). These results are supported by pull-down experiments using a recombinant GST.14-3-3 fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. Treatment of cells with TNF-α both rapidly and greatly reduced the amount of RGS7 retained on a GST.14-3-3 column, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2Ddemonstrates the transient capacity of TNF-α to dissociate RGS7 and 14-3-3. In transfected HEK 293T cells, binding of RGS7 to 14-3-3 is inhibited after 30- and 60-min treatment with TNF-α, but reassociation is evident at 120 min. The dephosphorylation of RGS7 induced by TNF-α occurs rapidly. As shown in Fig. 2E, treatment with TNF-α reduced serine 434 phosphorylation of RGS7 at 15 and 30 min. These results indicate that TNF-α induces dephosphorylation of serine 434 and transiently releases RGS7 from its inhibitory interaction with 14-3-3. To examine whether TNF-α modulates the association between 14-3-3 and other SYP-containing RGS members, we assessed the interaction between 14-3-3 and RGS3 after stimulation with TNF-α. RGS3 belongs to a subset of RGS family members that bind 14-3-3 (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is a stable protein that does not accumulate in response to TNF-α (1Benzing T. Brandes R. Sellin L. Schermer B. Lecker S. Walz G. Kim E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 (left panel), binding between 14-3-3τ and RGS3 is decreased after 30 min of TNF-α treatment. Binding to 14-3-3β is virtually abrogated by treatment with TNF-α (Fig. 3, right panel). These results indicate that TNF-α activates a signaling cascade that regulates the interaction between several 14-3-3 and RGS family members. We previously reported that TNF-α inhibits the degradation of RGS7 (1Benzing T. Brandes R. Sellin L. Schermer B. Lecker S. Walz G. Kim E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), resulting in the accumulation of RGS7 in the brains of mice treated with TNF-α or endotoxin, a stimulator of TNF-α release and formation. In the brain, a significant fraction of RGS7 appears to be phosphorylated on serine 434 and complexed with 14-3-3, conditions known to inhibit thein vitro GAP activity of RGS7 (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To examine the dual effects of TNF-α in vivo, we examined the interaction of RGS7 with 14-3-3 in mice treated with TNF-α. As shown in Fig.4A, co-immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3 with RGS7 was evident in brains of solvent-treated animals. This interaction was completely abrogated in mice treated with TNF-α (Fig.4A, lower panel), although levels of 14-3-3 expression remained unchanged (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Binding of the adaptor protein 14-3-3 strictly depends upon a phosphorylated 14-3-3 binding site. As demonstrated in Fig.4B, the effect of TNF-α can be mimicked by calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. Treatment of immunoprecipitated RGS7 with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase markedly decreased 14-3-3 binding, indicating that the interaction between RGS7 and 14-3-3 can be abrogated by phosphatases. It is likely that TNF-α triggers the activation of a currently unknown phosphatase that is absent or inactive in resting cells. GIRKs open upon binding to Gβγ subunits released by the activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive Gαi/Gαo-coupled receptors (9Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourne H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Activation and deactivation kinetics of GIRK channels control the onset and termination of postsynaptic hyperpolarizing currents in neurons and cardiac atrial cells. The kinetics of neuronal and atrial GIRK channel activation and deactivation are markedly faster than those observed in heterologously expressed channels. Several RGS proteins, including RGS1, RGS3, RGS4, RGS7, RGS8, and RGS9, increase the rate at which GIRK channels close following agonist removal, presumably by accelerating the GTPase activity of Gαi and thereby sequestering Gβγ (7Doupnik C.A.

In the present study, we examined the effect of 14-3-3 on RGS7-mediated changes in deactivation kinetics of heterologously expressed GIRK1/2 channels. Oocytes were injected with water or RGS7 mRNA in combination with the muscarinic M2 acetylcholine receptor (M2 AChR) and GIRK1/GIRK2 to mimic the heteromultimeric state of native neuronal GIRK channels. Since the deactivation kinetics of GIRK channels are not affected by the ratio of G protein-coupled receptors to ion channel, this experimental setting permits the quantification of RGS protein function (15Herlitze S. Ruppersberg J.P. Mark M.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As reported previously (7Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), ACh-evoked GIRK currents recorded fromXenopus oocytes in the absence of RGS proteins are deactivated with a time course best described by a single time constant of ∼20 s (Fig. 5). In the presence of RGS7, the deactivation kinetics after removal of acetylcholine was significantly accelerated with a time constant of 13 s (Fig. 5,C and D). Microinjection of bacterially expressed and affinity purified recombinant GST.14-3-3 protein, but not of GST alone, significantly reduced the RGS7-mediated deactivation of GIRK currents (Fig. 5E). However, 14-3-3 did not influence GIRK channels kinetics in the absence of RGS proteins (data not shown). These findings indicate that interaction with 14-3-3 inhibits the activity of RGS7 in vivo. To confirm the specificity of the 14-3-3-induced inhibition of RGS7 activity in oocytes, we examined the effect of 14-3-3 on RGS4, a known accelerator of GIRK current deactivation that does not interact with 14-3-3. RGS4 accelerated the deactivation of GIRK1/2 in microinjected oocytes (Fig. 6,A and B). This RGS4-induced acceleration of GIRK channel deactivation was unaffected by co-injection with GST or GST.14-3-3 (Fig. 6C). The RGS domain of RGS4 contains an SYR motif that does not bind 14-3-3 (Fig.7A). This region, which is highly conserved across RGS proteins, contains a 14-3-3 binding site in a subset of RGS proteins, including RGS3, RGS7, and RGS8 (Fig. 7,A and B). Alignment of several representative RGS proteins (ClustalW, www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) reveals a highly conserved SY/F/L motif followed by either a proline (or serine/threonine) or arginine/alanine/lysine. A mutation of Pro-to-Arg at position 436 changed RGS7 from a 14-3-3 binding protein to an RGS4-type protein that failed to bind 14-3-3 (Fig. 7B). The ability of RGS7P436R to accelerate the deactivation of GIRK1/2 (Fig. 7C) was no longer inhibited by 14-3-3 (Fig.7D). These findings demonstrate that the activity of RGS7 is regulated in vivo by binding of 14-3-3 to a conserved SYP motif. The mutational analysis of RGS4 and RGS7 is consistent with the 14-3-3 binding motifs defined by peptide library screening: RGS proteins regulated by 14-3-3 contain an SYP/S/T motif, whereas 14-3-3-resistant RGS4 contains an SYR motif (30Rittinger K.

As shown in the top panel, only wild-type RGS7, RGS8, and RGS3, all containing the SYP motif, but neither RGS4 nor RGS7P436R, bound 14-3-3. Equal expression of 14-3-3 was verified by Western blot analysis of cellular lysates (middle panel). Expression of the FLAG-tagged RGS proteins is shown in thebottom panel.

RGS7 belongs to a subfamily of RGS proteins that contain a characteristic Gγ-like domain, which forms obligate heterodimers with the Gβ subunit Gβ5 (23Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F.

Gβ5co-expression dramatically enhances the activity of RGS7; in oocytes, co-expression accelerates the activation and deactivation of GIRK channels (11Kovoor A. Chen C.K., He, W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In vitro, the RGS domain of RGS7 efficiently accelerates GTP hydrolysis of either Gαi or Gαo (26Shuey D.J. Betty M. Jones P.G. Khawaja X.Z. Cockett M.I. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1964-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); in vivo, the RGS7·Gβ5 complex appears to predominantly inhibit Gαo-dependent signaling (27Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). RGS7 exists as both unmodified cytosolic and palmitoylated membrane-derived forms in the brain (28Rose J.J. Taylor J.B. Shi J. Cockett M.I. Jones P.G. Hepler J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2103-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both forms of RGS7, when complexed with Gβ5, are equally effective stimulators of Gαo GTPase activity, suggesting that palmitoylation of RGS7 occurs outside of the RGS domain and does not prevent RGS7/Gαo interactions. RGS7 is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome (29Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Comella N. Kocher O. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a process that is inhibited by TNF-α (1Benzing T. Brandes R. Sellin L. Schermer B. Lecker S. Walz G. Kim E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The TNF-mediated accumulation of RGS7 requires activation of the MAP kinase p38 and the presence of a short serine/threonine-rich motif (Ser241, Thr245, Thr247) located upstream of the Gγ-like domain of RGS7 (1Benzing T. Brandes R. Sellin L. Schermer B. Lecker S. Walz G. Kim E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of which inhibits the degradation of RGS7. In contrast, phosphorylation of serine 434 mediates association of RGS7 with 14-3-3, which inhibits the GAP activity of RGS7 in vitro (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consistent with in vitro results, 14-3-3 significantly slowed the deactivation of GIRKs in oocytes in the presence of RGS7, suggesting that the interaction between 14-3-3 and RGS7 is an important regulatory mechanism of RGS7 activity in vivo. The interaction between RGS7 and 14-3-3 appears to be constitutive, i.e. in resting cells most of the cellular RGS7 is phosphorylated on serine 434 and complexed with 14-3-3 (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To monitor the changes in phosphorylation state of serine 434, we generated a phospho-specific antiserum and analyzed serine 434 phosphorylation in response to extracellular stimulation in transfected cells. Our results demonstrate that cellular activation by TNF-α inhibits phosphorylation of serine 434 and thereby releases RGS7 from its inhibitory interaction with 14-3-3. Hence, TNF-α rapidly increases the concentration of functionally active RGS7 protein through two mechanisms. TNF-induced dephosphorylation of serine 434 liberates RGS7 from 14-3-3 binding and inhibition. In addition, TNF-α augments RGS7 levels through p38-dependent phosphorylation (1Benzing T. Brandes R. Sellin L. Schermer B. Lecker S. Walz G. Kim E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The onset of both dephosphorylation and accumulation of RGS7 occur rapidly (15–30 min) after stimulation with TNF-α. However, TNF-mediated dephosphorylation and dissociation with 14-3-3 peaks within 2 h, whereas accumulation of RGS7 peaks at 4–6 h in transfected cells, the endogenous cell line, and mouse brain. The 14-3-3 binding motif typically contains a phosphorylated serine followed by a proline at position +2 relative to serine. Although the proline at position +2 is the preferred amino acid, certain other residues can promote binding of 14-3-3, including Gly, Gln, Asn, Phe, Ser, and Thr (30Rittinger K. Budman J., Xu, J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). All other residues (most notably Arg, Lys, and Ala) abrogate the interaction with 14-3-3. As predicted from high resolution x-ray structure and peptide library screens, a proline to arginine substitution at position 436 of RGS7 completely abrogated binding of 14-3-3 (31Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid at position +2 relative to serine 434 of RGS7, RGS proteins can thus be divided into two categories, 14-3-3-binding RGS proteins and RGS proteins with an arginine, alanine, or lysine at position +2, which effectively abrogates 14-3-3 binding. Serine 434 of RGS7, located within one of the three sites mediating interaction with Gα subunits, is highly conserved among all mammalian RGS proteins and is likely to be critical for the interaction with Gα subunits and the function of RGS proteins. It is therefore not surprising that phosphorylation of this serine residue inhibits the GAP activity of RGS7 in vitro (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The amino acid at position +2 does not directly participate in Gα binding, is less well conserved and appears to be the crucial determinant for 14-3-3 binding of RGS proteins. To support this hypothesis, we mutated the proline at position +2 of RGS7 into arginine (RGS7P436R). Using the RGS7P436R mutation in oocytes expressing GIRK1/2, we showed that RGS7, while retaining its GAP activity, was no longer regulated by 14-3-3. Our data suggest that most RGS proteins are regulated by phosphorylation of serine 434, which interferes with binding to Gα subunits. In a subgroup of RGS proteins, phosphorylation of this serine residue transforms this motif to an active 14-3-3 binding site with pronounced inhibition of GTPase activity in vitro (6Benzing T. Yaffe M.B. Arnould T. Sellin L. Schermer B. Schilling B. Schreiber R. Kunzelmann K. Leparc G.G. Kim E. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28167-28172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) andin vivo. This is the first evidence that this interaction, and hence the activity of RGS proteins, can be regulated by extracellular signals. It remains to be examined how accumulation of active RGS7, following activation of p38 MAP kinase and release from its inhibitory interaction with 14-3-3, alters G protein-mediated signaling in native tissues. Since RGS7 is highly expressed in the brain, we postulate that transient accumulation of functionally active RGS7 has an important role in modulating the activation and deactivation kinetics of neuronal GIRKs and thus in determining how neuronal cells react to repetitive signals and participate in complex neuronal networks.

We have investigated the structural requirements for heparin/heparan sulfate in binding and activation of FGF8 (splice variant b). We present evidence that the minimal FGF8b-binding saccharide domain encompasses 5–7 monosaccharide units. TheN-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfate substituents of heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) are all involved in the interaction, preferentially in the form of trisulfated IdoUA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) disaccharide constituents. These structural characteristics resemble those described earlier for FGF1. By contrast, the saccharide structures required for the biological activity of FGF8b differed significantly from those characteristic for FGF1 and FGF2. Experiments with cells lacking active HS indicated that extended ≥14-mer heparin domains were needed to enhance cell proliferation and Erk phosphorylation by FGF8b, whereas in cells stimulated with FGF1 or FGF2 the corresponding responses were achieved by much shorter, 6–8-mer, oligosaccharides. Furthermore, still longer domains were needed to activate FGF8b in cells with “non-optimal” FGF receptor expression.

FGF8 has further been shown to induce morphological changes and malignant transformation of fibroblasts (2Kouhara H. Koga M. Kasayama S. Tanaka A. Kishimoto T. Sato B.

On the other hand, FGF8 appears to play important physiological roles in embryonic development and tissue patterning (7Crossley P.H. Martin G.R.

Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8928-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar)). However, the structure of the Fgf8 gene is more complex than that of other related genes, comprising at least four exons, which can be alternatively spliced to yield different FGF8 protein isoforms (9MacArthur C.A.

Upon ligand binding, the receptors are activated through dimerization and phosphorylation by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains (13Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar). This process activates the Ras signal transduction pathway, the key components of which are the MAP kinases Erk1 (p44mapk) and Erk2 (p42mapk) (for reviews see Refs. 14Denhardt D.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 15: 729-747Crossref Scopus (449) Google Scholar and 15Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 165-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, abundant components of cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix, appear critical for FGF signaling. Cells lacking endogenous HS respond poorly to FGFs, whereas the response can be readily restored by addition of exogenous heparin (16Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). Heparin/HS chains are initially synthesized as polymers of alternating glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) units (for reviews see Refs. 18Kjelleán L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 19Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 20Lindahl U.

In HS biosynthesis, the polymer is first modified by partialN-deacetylation/N-sulfation of the GlcNAc residues. The further modification reactions, C-5 epimerization of GlcA to iduronic acid (IdoUA) units and O-sulfation at various positions (C-2 of IdoUA and GlcA units and C-3 and C-6 of GlcN units), all occur in the vicinity of previously incorporatedN-sulfate groups. The modifications occur in a regioselective fashion, such that contiguous N-sulfated domains are interspersed with essentially unmodifiedN-acetylated sequences and with domains containing alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated disaccharide units (21Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 22Safaiyan F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10823-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Heparin, a highly specialized product of connective tissue-type mast cells, is more extensively modified than HS, and the modifications are more evenly distributed along the polymer (18Kjelleán L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). The interactions of HS with FGFs are believed to be mediated by theN-sulfated domains of the polysaccharide. The minimal HS domains binding to FGF1 and FGF2 are both contained in sequences encompassing 5–7 monosaccharide units (23Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23989-23995Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 25Kreuger J.

Svahn C.-M. Waksman G. Science. 1995; 268: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Apparently, the two factors require differential O-sulfation for their binding to HS, such that the binding of FGF2 is critically dependent on a single 2-O-sulfated IdoUA residue, whereas FGF1 binding requires a 6-O-sulfated GlcNSO3 residue and 2-O-sulfated IdoUA units (26Kreuger J.

The minimal FGF-binding HS domains do not, however, appear sufficient to stimulate FGF signaling which instead requires longer ∼8–12-mer domains containing both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate substituents (28Ornitz D.M.

Vives R.R. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), much less is known of the HS structures involved in the binding and activation of other species of the FGF family. Here we have investigated the binding of heparin/HS to the splice variant b of FGF8. FGF8b seems to have broader receptor-binding properties and higher transformatory potential than the other FGF8 isoforms, and it has been implicated in various forms of cancer (3MacArthur C.A. Lawsheá A. Shankar D.B. Heikinheimo M. Schackleford G.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 817-825PubMed Google Scholar, 4Marsh S. Bansal G. Zammit C. Barnard R. Coope R. Roberts-Clarke D. Gomm J.

Development. 1995; 121: 3603-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We further investigated the role of heparin/HS in the signaling of FGF8b, and we performed comparative experiments with FGF1 and FGF2. These results indicate that the minimal FGF8b-binding HS domain encompasses ∼5 monosaccharide units and contains both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups and may thus resemble the sequence interacting with FGF1. By contrast, FGF8b differs markedly from FGF1 and FGF2 with regard to the length of the heparin domains that are required for biological activity. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the requirement for the activating heparin domain is influenced by the cellular FGFR composition. The FGF8b expression clone was a kind gift from Dr. Craig MacArthur (Washington University). FGF8b was produced in Escherichia coli and purified trough its C-terminal His6 tag under denaturing conditions as described elsewhere (8MacArthur C.A. Lawsheá A., Xu, J. Santos-Ocampo S. Heikinheimo M. Chellaiah A.T. Ornitz D.M. Development. 1995; 121: 3603-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After refolding by dialysis, FGF8b was passed through a column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences AB), followed by elution of bound protein with NaCl. Recombinant FGF1 and FGF2 as well as untagged FGF8b were purchased from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, UK). Heparin from pig intestinal mucosa (stage 14, Inolex Pharmaceutical Division), was purified as described previously (33Lindahl U. Cifonelli J.A. Lindahl B. Rodeán L. J. Biol.

Heparin from bovine lung and HS from bovine kidney were from Sigma. HS from bovine aorta, lung, and intestine were generously provided by Dr. Keiichi Yoshida (Seikagaku Corp.).N-Sulfated heparan sulfate domains from bovine intestinal mucosa HS (a gift from Kabi AB, Sweden) were prepared and3H-labeled as described previously (25Kreuger J. Prydz K. Petterson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled glycosaminoglycans and FGFs were incubated in 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, and 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (phosphate buffer), containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Following a 2-h incubation, the mixtures were rapidly passed through nitrocellulose filters (Sartorius, diameter 25 mm, pore size 0.45 μm) using a vacuum suction apparatus followed by repeated washing with phosphate buffer. Proteins and protein-bound saccharides remain on the filter, whereas unbound saccharides pass through. The bound saccharides were released by 2m NaCl and quantified by scintillation counting. Sulfated Domains—FGF8b was immobilized through its His6 tag to the nickel groups of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow resin (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK). For preparation of 1 ml of resin, ∼0.5 mg of FGF8b was used. No binding of heparin to uncoupled nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was observed (data not shown). Decameric3H-labeled N-sulfated domains from bovine intestinal HS were applied to the column in phosphate buffer, followed by washing with phosphate buffer and elution of the bound material with a step gradient of NaCl. Fractions were collected, and the radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. The disaccharide compositions of the affinity-separated decasaccharides were determined as described earlier (37Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, the samples were subjected to cleavage by HNO2 at pH 1.5 (39Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), followed by reduction of the terminal anhydromannose units of the resultant saccharides with NaB3H4 (0.25–0.5 mCi/reaction, specific activity 28 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences AB), yielding3H-labeled 2,5-anhydromannitol residues. The end-labeled disaccharides were recovered by gel chromatography on a column of Sephadex G-15 (1 × 190 cm; Amersham Biosciences AB) in 0.2m NH4HCO3. The disaccharides were further separated on a Partisil-10 strong anion-exchange column (4.6 × 250 mm, Whatman) eluted with a step gradient of KH2PO4. The disaccharide peaks were identified by comparing their elution positions to those of standard heparin disaccharides. To analyze the proportions of non-O-sulfated disaccharides, the disaccharides were separated by high voltage paper electrophoresis on Whatman 3MM paper in pyridine/acetic acid buffer, pH 5.3, for 80 min at 2000 V (38Kusche M. Lindahl U. Enerba¨ck L. Rodeán L. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

TheEcoRV-EcoRI fragment of FGFR4 cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1-plasmid (Invitrogen). The FGFR1 cDNA, encoding a receptor with three Ig loops, in the pcDNA1neo vector, was kindly provided by Dr. Lena Claesson-Welsh (Uppsala University). The BamHI-XbaI fragment of FGFR1 was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1-plasmid (Invitrogen). Transfections of CHO677 cells were made with the calcium phosphate precipitation method (43Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), followed by selection of transfected cells in medium containing 750 μg/ml geneticin (G418; Sigma). The expression of the FGFR1 and FGFR4 proteins was detected by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-FGFR4 antibodies (C-16) and polyclonal anti-FGFR1 antibodies (C-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After the selection was completed, the transfected cells were maintained in a medium containing 300 μg/ml geneticin. CHO677 cells were plated onto 24-well plates, at a density of 20,000 cells/well. The cells were serum-starved for 48–72 h, after which fresh serum-free medium containing FGFs and glycosaminoglycans were added, and the cells were grown for an additional 24 h. To assess the cellular DNA synthesis, [methyl-3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added for the last 2–4 h of the 24-h incubation. The cells were trypsinized, washed with cold PBS (calcium- and magnesium-free; Reagena Ltd., Kuopio, Finland), and incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid on ice. Following centrifugation, the pellet containing acid-insoluble material was dissolved in 0.5 mNaOH, 0.5% SDS, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. S115 cells were plated on culture dishes in low sulfate Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (16Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum (44Noguchi S. Uchida N. Sato B. Koyama H. Matsumoto K. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 32: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and 30 mm sodium chlorate (Merck). After 48 h, the cells were trypsinized and plated on 24-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well in low sulfate Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 0.1% dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum and 30 mmsodium chlorate. After 24 h the medium was replaced, and FGFs and glycosaminoglycans were added. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured as described above. Cells were plated onto 24-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well. Following 48–72 h of incubation in serum-free medium, fresh medium containing FGFs and glycosaminoglycans was added to the cells. At various time points, the cells were lysed in 2× SDS sample buffer. The samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry blotting. The phosphorylated forms of Erk1 and Erk2 were detected by monoclonal anti-active mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies (Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To verify that the same amount of protein was loaded in each lane, the membrane was reprobed with polyclonal anti-Erk2 antibodies (C-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To study the binding of FGF8b to heparin, increasing amounts of [3H]heparin were incubated with FGF8b in solution at physiological ionic strength. The formed protein-saccharide complexes were trapped on nitrocellulose filters, followed by quantification of the bound saccharide. Heparin appeared to bind to FGF8b in a dose-dependent and saturable manner (Fig.1), and the binding was abolished by addition of excess cold heparin (data not shown). To identify the minimal FGF8b-binding heparin/HS domain, similar experiments were performed with even numbered, 3H-end-labeled heparin/HS oligosaccharides. Heparin and HS hexasaccharides were the smallest oligosaccharides with appreciable binding to FGF8b (Fig.2), suggesting that the minimal FGF8b-binding HS domain contains at least five intact monosaccharide units (the reducing terminal unit in the oligosaccharides being an3H-labeled 2,5-anhydromannitol residue). The binding increased with increasing saccharide length, possibly reflecting the presence of multiple, overlapping binding sites in the longer oligosaccharides. The apparent decrease in the binding seen with ≥12-mer heparin oligosaccharides probably reflected the binding of several FGF8b molecules to the same fragment. In fact, when excess protein was added no such decline in the binding was observed (data not shown).Figure 2Binding of heparin/HS oligosaccharides to FGF8b. To assess the minimal length of FGF8b-binding heparin/HS domains, 3H-labeled heparin oligosaccharides (10,000 cpm) (A) or N-sulfated domains from bovine intestinal HS (20,000 cpm) (B) were incubated with FGF8b (15 and 12.5 μg/ml, respectively) followed by the filter-trapping procedure and quantification of the bound saccharide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Distinct patterns of sulfation appear essential for the binding of HS to FGF1 and FGF2 (26Kreuger J.

To elucidate the importance of N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfate groups of heparin for its binding to FGF8b, selectively desulfated heparin species were tested for their ability to inhibit binding of [3H]heparin to FGF8b in solution using the filter-trapping assay. Although low concentrations (1 μg/ml) of unlabeled native heparin blocked the binding almost completely, the desulfated heparin preparations showed limited inhibitory capacity (Fig. 3). Thus at a concentration of 50 μg/ml the binding was inhibited only by 20–30%. Each of the preparations exhibited approximately similar inhibitory capacity, suggesting a role for all three sulfate substituents in the interaction. To assess further the O-sulfation of FGF8b-binding saccharide domains, compositional disaccharide analyses of FGF8b-binding and non-binding HS domains were performed. Decameric3H-labeled N-sulfated domains, from bovine intestinal HS, were fractionated according to their activity toward FGF8b on an affinity column (decasaccharides were used because it was not possible to recover sufficient amounts of the smaller FGF8b-binding oligosaccharides for analysis). Upon chromatography on the FGF8b affinity matrix, 15–20% of the starting decasaccharide material bound to FGF8b at a physiological ionic strength. Almost all of the bound decasaccharides were eluted from the column at 0.2 or 0.3 mNaCl (∼45% at each ionic strength). The separated decasaccharide pools were cleaved with nitrous acid and 3H-end-labeled by reduction with NaB3H4. The resulting3H-labeled disaccharides were recovered by gel filtration and further separated with strong anion-exchange chromatography and/or high voltage paper electrophoresis. The anion-exchange chromatography analysis indicated that the FGF8b-bound saccharides were enriched in disulfated IdoUA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3 units (∼1.4-fold) and particularly in trisulfated IdoUA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) units, the proportions of which were increased ∼5-fold in the fraction with the highest apparent affinity as compared with the unbound material (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the proportions of non-O-sulfated disaccharides, resolved by high voltage paper electrophoresis, were low (15–30%) in the bound fractions compared with the unbound fraction (>45%) (Fig.4B). These findings suggest that trisulfated IdoUA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) units are important for the FGF8b-HS interaction. We proceeded to study the importance of heparin/HS for the biological activity of FGF8b. HS-deficient CHO677 cells were used to assess the ability of various exogenously added saccharides to restore the cell proliferation induced by FGF8b. FGF8b and/or heparin were added to serum-depleted cells, and the cell proliferation was assessed after 24 h by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. The results indicated that FGF8b or heparin alone did not induce proliferation, whereas a combined FGF8b and heparin treatment increased the proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.5). To identify the minimal heparin domain capable of supporting the biological activity of FGF8b, similar experiments were conducted with size-defined heparin oligosaccharides (4–24 monosaccharide units in length). The results indicated that long oligosaccharides, ≥18-mers, were required to support proliferation induced by FGF8b (Fig.6). The results were thus very different from the experiments employing FGF1 or FGF2, in which octasaccharides were sufficient to enhance growth factor activity (Fig. 6), in agreement with previous data (28Ornitz D.M.

We note that the recombinant FGF8b used in this experiment contained a His6 tag at the C terminus. To exclude the possibility that this would influence the results we also studied commercially available FGF8b without any tag. Consistently with the data pertaining to the His-tagged FGF8b, the untagged FGF8b alone did not induce proliferation of the CHO677 cells, whereas concomitant treatment with ≥18-mer oligosaccharides stimulated proliferation (data not shown). The Erk1 and Erk2 kinases are important signal transducers downstream of FGFRs and critical for the mitogenic FGF responses (46Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Onco"

The leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor (BLT1) contains 14 intracellular serines and threonines, 8 of which are part of consensus target sequences for protein kinase C (PKC) or casein kinase 2. In this study, we investigated the importance of PKC and GPCR-specific kinase (GRK) phosphorylation in BLT1 desensitization. Pretreatment of BLT1-transfected COS-7 cells with PKC activators caused a decrease of LTB4-induced inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation. This reduction was prevented with the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine, and not observed in cells expressing a BLT1 deletion mutant (G291stop) lacking the cytoplasmic tail. Moreover LTB4-induced IP accumulation was significantly inhibited by overexpression of GRK2, GRK5, and especially GRK6, in cells expressing wild type BLT1 but not in those expressing G291stop. GRK6-mediated desensitization correlated with increased phosphorylation of BLT1. The G319stop truncated BLT1 mutant displayed functional characteristics comparable with wild type BLT1 in terms of desensitization by GRK6, but not by PKC. Substitution of Thr308 within a putative casein kinase 2 site to proline or alanine in the full-length BLT1 receptor prevented most of GRK6-mediated inhibition of LTB4-induced IP production but only partially affected LTB4-induced BLT1 phosphorylation. Our findings thus suggest that Thr308 is a major residue involved in GRK6-mediated desensitization of BLT1 signaling.

After exposure to an agonist, cellular responses to subsequent stimuli are usually attenuated; this phenomenon is known as desensitization (18Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation through GPCRs is regulated at different levels; homologous desensitization is rapid and involves uncoupling from the G-protein, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the ligand-occupied receptor by GPCR-specific kinases (GRKs), and binding of members of the arrestin family, which could act as adaptors between the receptor and components of the internalization machinery (18Pitcher J.A.

The internalized receptors are then exposed to phosphatases and to the acidic environment of the early vesicles, which usually leads to ligand dissociation, receptor resensitization, and, eventually, recycling to the cell surface. A percentage of the receptors, instead of recycling to the cell surface, can be targeted to lysosomes, which leads to down-regulation of the number of receptors and requires synthesis of new receptors for complete cellular resensitization (21Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Other kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A, activated during the signaling cascade, also play a role in the modulation of the cellular response by directly phosphorylating receptors and other components of signalization (22Fields T.A.

These second messenger-dependent kinases mediate homologous as well as heterologous desensitization, since receptors that did not trigger their activation may also be targeted. GPCRs, like BLT1, can contain motifs of recognition by casein kinases (CKs) in their intracellular loops and cytoplasmic tail. The CK1α was shown to act as a GRK for the muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors (27Tobin A.B. Totty N.F. Sterlin A.E. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol.

Rapid desensitization of BLT1 signaling is observed after stimulation with LTB4. This may involve early uncoupling of the receptor from its transductional elements, followed, in some cells, by down-regulation of high affinity LTB4 receptors; this latter stage may involve phosphorylation of the receptor or associated proteins, since PKC activation by other routes also down-regulates LTB4 binding sites (30O'Flaherty J.T. Redman J.F. Jacobson D.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Reexpression of receptors on the cell surface is rapid and appears to be associated with recycling of internalized receptors in certain cell types (31O'Flaherty J.T. Redman J.F. Jacobson D.P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). LTB4receptors can undergo both agonist- and phorbol ester-induced desensitization (31O'Flaherty J.T. Redman J.F.

As deduced from its amino acid sequence, BLT1 contains a GPCR signature, no consensus tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site, two consensus CK2 phosphorylation sites at positions Ser200/Ser202 and Thr308/Ser310, and multiple serine and threonine residues in the cytoplasmic loops and C-terminal tail. Six of them (Ser125, Ser216, Thr219, Ser314, Thr315, and Thr324) are within consensus phosphorylation sites for PKC. Whereas accumulating data have allowed definition of a consensus recognition site for CK, none has been established for GRKs. However, both types of kinases share a preference for Ser/Thr residues within an acidic environment (reviewed in Refs. 18Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar and 35Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Little is known about the structure/function elements of BLT1. In the present study, we examined the potential contribution of PKC and GRK in heterologous and homologous desensitization of BLT1. We identified a structural determinant essential for LTB4-induced BLT1 desensitization mediated by GRK6. cDNAs encoding Gα14, Gα16, and PLCβ2 were generous gifts from Dr. M. I. Simon (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA); the pJ3M expression vector (36Sells M.A. Chernoff J.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was previously described (13Gaudreau R., Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this construction, the N-terminal initiator methionine was replaced by the Myc sequence MEQKLISEEDLSRGSPG, resulting in a Myc epitope-tagged BLT1 protein. Each mutant BLT1 is identified by the original amino acid followed by the residue number, which is replaced by a stop codon or substituted for another amino acid. The C-terminal deletion mutant G291stop was constructed using a cassette formed by two oligonucleotidess: G291stop-FWD (5′-CGCGTGCGCCGGCGGCTAGCA-3′) and G291stop-RVS (5′-GATCTGCTAGCCGCCGGCGCA-3′). This product was subcloned into theMluI and BglII restriction sites of pJ3M-WT BLT1, eliminating the cytoplasmic tail. The G319stop mutant receptor was constructed using PCR amplification with the BLT1-FWD (13Gaudreau R., Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the G319stop-RVS (5′-GGCCGGGCCCACTACCCTCGGCGCGTGCTGGACGCCTCGG-3′) or the SST/A-RVS (5′- GCTGCCCCCGCGGCGCGCGGCGGCCGCCTCGGAACCCGTGCCCTCTAGCAGCTTGGC-3′). In order to construct the following mutant BLT1 (T308P/S310A, T308P, and S310A), the sequence encoding the cytoplasmic tail of BLT1 was first transferred into the pUC31 vector. New unique restriction sites were available, and a cassette generated by the annealing product of the two primers T308P/S310A-RVS (5′-GGCGCGTGCTGGAGGCCTCGGCCCCGGGGCCCTCCAGCAGC-3′) and T308P/S310A-FWD (5′-CTGGAGGGCCCCGGGGCCGAGGCCTCCAGCACGCGCCGC-3′) replaced the original sequence, which substituted amino acids Thr308 and Ser310, respectively, for proline and alanine. The introduction of silent SmaI and StuI restriction sites allowed us to use this construction to create the single mutations T308P, T308A, and S310A, using, respectively, the following sets of primers: T308P-RVS (5′- CCTCGGAACCGGGGCCCTCCAGCAGC-3′) and T308P-FWD (5′-CTGGAGGGCCCCGGTTCCGAGG-3′), T308A-RVS (5′-CCTCGGAACCGGCGCCCTCCAGCAGC-3′) and T308A-FWD (5′-CTGGAGGGCGCCGGTTCCGAGG-3′), and S310A-RVS (5′- CCTCGGCACCCGTGCCCTCCAGCAGC-3′) and S310A-FWD (5′-CTGGAGGGCACGGGTGCCGAGG-3′). The C-tail containing the mutations was then subcloned into pSP64-BLT1 WT, generating the full-length receptor containing the specific mutation. cDNAs of mutant receptors were then sequenced (University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada) to confirm proper incorporation of stop codon or amino acid substitution and integrity of the receptor sequence. cDNAs corresponding to WT and truncated mutant BLT1 receptors were then cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin sulfate (40 μg/ml). For transfection, cells were plated in 30-mm dishes (2.0 × 105 cells/dish) and transiently transfected, the following day, with constructions encoding WT or mutant BLT1 in combination with cDNA of Gα16, Gα14, or PLCβ2. In some experiments, cDNA encoding GRK2, -3, -5, or -6 were also added, as indicated in the figure legends. Using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE or 2 μl of FuGENE-6 per dish, 0.2 μg of each cDNA was used for IP studies and 1 μg of cDNA for flow cytometry analysis. In binding assays, 2 μg of cDNA were used to transfect 1.2 × 106 cells plated in Petri dishes. Experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Total transfected cDNA quantities were adjusted, for each experiment, with the pcDNA3 vector DNA. COS-7 cells expressing WT or mutant BLT1 receptors were harvested and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and twice in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (45Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which cells were also resuspended for the assay. Competition binding curves were carried out on 2 × 105 cells with 0.25 nm[3H]LTB4 and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive LTB4 for 2 h at 4 °C. Free radioactivity was separated from cells by centrifugation and a double wash with 1 ml of Hepes-Tyrode's buffer. Radioactivity contained in the cell pellet was counted in a scintillation β counter. Nonspecific binding represented less than 10% of total binding with 500 nm nonradioactive LTB4. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were labeled and stimulated with LTB4, IP were extracted, and radioactivity was counted as described previously (13Gaudreau R., Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with PKC activators (mezerein, phorbol esters (4β-PMA or the inactive form 4α-PMA)) or inhibitors (staurosporine, GF109203X) at the indicated concentrations and times or with CK1 or CK2 inhibitors (N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide, 50 μm, 30 min; 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, 10 μm, 30 min). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and then radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate (50 μCi/dish) for 2 h at 37 °C, in phosphate-free modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4. Agonist was applied as indicated in the figure legends in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A (10 nm). Treatment was stopped by transferring the plates onto ice, removing the medium, and washing once with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline. Cells were harvested with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline, followed by a brief centrifugation. The supernatant was then discarded, and cells were immediately used for immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 nm calyculin A). Samples were precleared for 45 min at 4 °C using Protein A-Sepharose. Supernatants were collected and incubated for 1 h with anti-Myc antibody (9E10 hybridoma; American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The mixture was then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of Protein A-Sepharose with gentle mixing. Protein A-Sepharose was pelleted by brief centrifugation, washed three times in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography, and receptor phosphorylation was analyzed using NIH Image software (obtained from the National Institutes of Health Web site: rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). Gel image was scanned and imported into NIH Image from Adobe Photodeluxe (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the Myc-tagged WT or mutant BLT1 receptors were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. 2.5 × 105 cells were labeled, as previously described (13Gaudreau R., Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), with anti-Myc, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio/Can Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). All measures were performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). Data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's paired t test or analysis of variance, as appropriate. Differences were considered significant atp < 0.05. In the present study, we used a cotransfection system in COS-7 cells to define the signaling pathways involved in heterologous and homologous desensitization of BLT1. In addition, we defined a structural determinant of BLT1, which is targeted by a specific GRK. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs for WT BLT1 or constructions of BLT1 in which either the receptor was truncated or specific residues were substituted (Fig. 1). Cell surface expression of WT and mutant receptors was confirmed by flow cytometry using an antibody directed against the Myc tag at the N terminus of each receptor. No specific labeling or 3H-LTB4binding could be detected on whole cells transfected only with pcDNA3 (data not shown). On the other hand, whole cells expressing WT and mutant forms of BLT1 showed specific [3H-LTB4]binding, which was displaced in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled LTB4 (0–500 nm). The nonlinear regression analysis of these competition binding curves revealed the presence of one class of binding sites exhibiting high affinity for LTB4 (dissociation constant (Kd) = 1.01 ± 0.13 nm). Moreover, the addition of the Myc epitope did not alter the affinity for LTB4 as compared with the reported Kd (6Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T.

Compared with the WT receptor, all mutant receptors displayed similar affinity for the LTB4. Similar Bmax values were also observed, ranging from 1.5 × 104 to 2.8 × 104 sites, with the exception of the mutant G291stop, which was expressed at higher levels.

J. 1998; 335: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), LTB4 induces a significant increase in IP accumulation in COS-7 cells cotransfected with BLT1 and Gα16. Since BLT1 contains six potential phosphorylation sites for PKC and two potential sites for CK2, we first confirmed previous studies on the involvement of a second messenger-activated kinase in the heterologous desensitization of BLT1 signaling. Pretreatment of these cells with the nonphorbol PKC activator mezerein caused a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of ligand-induced IP accumulation (Fig. 2, A and B). It reached 30–40% of inhibition at 60 min at 1 μm mezerein and was prevented by concomitant treatment with the PKC inhibitor, staurosporine (Fig. 2C). Similar findings with 4β-PMA (Table II) indicated that the effect was mediated by PKC but was not dependent on the phorbol moiety. These results suggested a partial role for PKC in regulating BLT1 signal transduction and suggested that other kinases would participate to a greater extent. Recently, protein kinase CK1α was shown to be involved in the phosphorylation and regulation of the m3-muscarinic receptor (27Tobin A.B. Totty N.F. Sterlin A.E. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol.

Previously, we postulated that the transmission of amyloid fibrils induces conformational changes of endogenous amyloid protein in mouse senile amyloidosis (Xing, Y., Nakamura, A., Chiba, T., Kogishi, K., Matsushita, T., Fu, L., Guo Z., Hosokawa, M., Mori, M., and Higuchi, K. (2001) Lab. Invest.81, 493–499). To further characterize this transmissibility, we injected amyloid fibrils (AApoAII(C)) of amyloidogenic C type apolipoprotein A-II (APOAIIC) intravenously into 2-month-old SAMR1 mice, which have B type apolipoprotein A-II (APOAIIB), and develop few if any amyloid deposits spontaneously. 10 months after amyloid injection, deposits were detected in the tongue, stomach, intestine, lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. The intensity of deposition increased thereafter, whereas no amyloid was detected in distilled water-injected SAMR1 mice, even after 20 months. The deposited amyloid was composed of endogenous APOAIIB with a different amyloid fibril conformation. The injection of these amyloid fibrils of APOAIIB (AApoAII(B)) induced earlier and more severe amyloidosis in SAMR1 mice than the injection of AApoAII(C) amyloid fibrils. Thus, AApoAII(C) from amyloidogenic mice could induce a conformational change of less amyloidogenic APOAIIB to a different amyloid fibril structure, which could also induce amyloidosis in the less amyloidogenic strain.

In transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, prion induces the conformational change of PrPC to the prion form PrPSc and causes a detectable phenotype or disease in the affected individual. Recent studies with yeast have broadened the definition of prion from proteinaceous infectious agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy to infectious proteins or protein-based genetic elements. Like PrPSc, prions URE3 and PSI inSaccharomyves cerevisiae can induce the conversion of the cytoplasmic proteins ure2p and sup35p to the prion form. This infectious agent propagates in the cytoplasm and is also transferable to other yeast (4Wickner R.B. Edskes H.K. Maddelein M.L. Taylor K.L. Moriyama H. J. Biol.

The term amyloidosis refers to a group of diverse conditions characterized by the extracellular accumulation of fine amyloid fibrils to which normally innocuous soluble proteins polymerize (7Sipe J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 947-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The nucleation-dependent polymerization model is postulated to explain well the kinetics of amyloid fibrilization and conversion of PrPC to PrPSc (8Kelly J.W. Lansbury P.T. Amyloid. 1994; 3: 186-205Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). This model consists of nucleation and extension phases. Preformed amyloid fibrils accelerate conformational changes of many amyloid precursor proteins and result in rapid extension of amyloid fibrils in vitro (10Jarrett J.T. Lansbury P.T.

Although Alzheimer’s disease is not known to be infectious like prion disease (13Chesebro B. Science. 1998; 279: 42-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Caughey B. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), intracerebral injection of brain homogenate from an Alzheimer’s patient into marmoset monkeys induced the formation of amyloid β plaques in these primates (15Baker H.F. Ridley R.M. Duchen L.W. Crow T.J. Bruton C.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 25-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Injection of synthetic amyloid-like fibrils or modified silk accelerated amyloid protein A (AA) amyloidosis and showed amyloid-enhancing activity, possibly by serving as a seed on which new AA amyloid fibrils could form (16Johan K. Westermark G. Engstrom U. Gustavsson A. Hultmanm P. Westermark P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2558-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Kisilevsky R. Lemieux L. Boudreau L. Yang D.S. Fraser P. Amyloid. 1996; 6: 98-106Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results suggested that amyloid β and AA amyloidoses may be transmissible under experimental conditions. We established the Senescence-Accelerated Mouse (SAM) strains as a good model for senile amyloidosis (18Higuchi K. Matsumura A. Honma A. Takeshita S. Hashimoto K. Hosokawa M. Yasuhira K. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1983; 48: 231-239PubMed Google Scholar). In mouse senile amyloidosis, apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II), the second most abundant apolipoprotein of serum high density lipoprotein, polymerizes to form amyloid fibrils and deposits systemically but not in the brain and bone (19Yonezu T. Higuchi K. Tsunasawa S. Takagi S. Sakiyama F. Takeda T. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Higuchi K. Yonezu T. Kogishi K. Matsumura A. Takeshita S. Higuchi K. Kohno A. Matsushita M. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12834-12840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three variants of apoA-II (types A, B, and C) with different amino acid substitutions at four positions (positions 5, 20, 26, and 38 from the N terminus) are present in inbred strains of mice (21Higuchi K. Kitagawa K. Naiki H. Hanada K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Senescence-Accelerated Mouse-resistant 1 (SAMR1) mice with wild-type B apoA-II (APOAIIB, Pro5, and Val38) show few, if any, signs of senile amyloidosis. The R1.P1-Apoa2C mice are a congenic strain of mice that have the amyloidogenic allele of the apoA-II gene from the Senescence-Accelerated Mouse prone 1 (SAMP1) strain on the genetic background of the SAMR1 strain. This strain with the variant C type apoA-II (APOAIIC, Gln5, and Ala38) spontaneously exhibits a high incidence of amyloidosis and severe amyloid deposition with aging (22Higuchi K. Naiki H. Kitagawa K. Kitado H. Kogishi K. Matsushita T. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, we found that intravenous injection of AApoAII(C) fibrils isolated from livers of old R1.P1-Apoa2Cmice markedly accelerated amyloid deposition in young R1.P1-Apoa2C mice (23Higuchi K. Kogishi K. Wang J. Chen X. Chiba T. Matsushita T. Hoshii Y. Kawano H. Ishihara Y. Yokota T. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1535-1542PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitroexperiment also demonstrated that the extension of AApoAII(C) proceeds by the association of APOAIIC to the ends of existing fibrils (24Naiki H. Higuchi K. Nakakuki K. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 104-110PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleation-dependent polymerization model addressed these phenomena. We fed young R1.P1-Apoa2C mice with AApoAII(C) fibrils or reared the young mice with old severe amyloid-deposited R1.P1-Apoa2C mice in the same cage. All of the treated mice developed amyloid deposits (1Xing Y. Nakamura A. Chiba T. Kogishi K. Matsushita T., Fu, L. Guo Z. Hosokawa M. Mori M. Higuchi K. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the oral transmission of amyloid fibrils results in the fibril formation of amyloid proteins in AApoAII amyloidosis and presented a possible pathogenesis of amyloidosis. In this study, we investigated whether exogenous AApoAII fibrils can induce amyloid deposition in less amyloidogenic SAMR1 mice. Our results revealed that exogenous amyloid fibrils can change the less amyloidogenic wild-type apoA-II monomer to amyloid fibrils; these new amyloid fibrils can more easily induce de novo amyloid deposition in SAMR1 mice. The results of this experiment provide further evidence for the hypothesis of transmission in mouse senile amyloidosis. R1.P1-Apoa2C and SAMR1 mice were raised in the Institute for Frontier Medical Science of Kyoto University under conventional conditions at 24 ± 2 °C with a light-controlled regimen (12-h light/dark cycle). A commercial diet (CE-2, Nihon CLEA, Tokyo, Japan) and tap water were available ad libitum. Mice were killed by cardiac puncture under diethyl ether anesthesia. All of the experiments were performed with the consent of the Animal Care and Use Committee of both Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine and Shinshu University School of Medicine. AApoAII(C) amyloid fibril fractions were isolated from the livers of 18–21-month-old R1.P1-Apoa2C mice using Pras’ method with some modification (25Pras M. Schubert M. Zucker-Franklin D. Rimon A. Franklin E.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47: 924-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Purified AApoAII(C) fibrils were suspended in distilled water (DW) at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml and sonicated five times on ice for 30 s at 30-s intervals using a microtip-equipped Astrason ultrasonic processor W-380 (Heat System-Ultrasonics Inc., Farmingdale, NY) (23Higuchi K. Kogishi K. Wang J. Chen X. Chiba T. Matsushita T. Hoshii Y. Kawano H. Ishihara Y. Yokota T. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1535-1542PubMed Google Scholar). A single dose of 0.1 ml of sonicated AApoAII(C) fraction (0.1 mg) was immediately injected into the tail veins of 2-month-old SAMR1 mice. An equal volume of DW was injected to SAMR1 and R1.P1-Apoa2C mice of the same age. After 1–20 months, the treated mice were sacrificed and their organs were subjected to pathologic or biochemical analysis as described below. The amyloid fractions from the tongue and lungs of each animal were used for biochemical and electron microscopy studies. The amyloid fraction from the severely deposited tongue of one SAMR1 mouse was injected into an additional group of 2-month-old SAMR1 mice. After 1–12 months, these mice were killed and amyloid deposition was determined. We also injected 0.1 mg of sonicated AApoAII(C) into six 18-month-old SAMR1 mice. These mice were killed for pathologic examination 3 months after injection. Half of each organ was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into serial 4-μm sections. The other half was stored frozen for biochemical analysis. The amyloid was identified by green birefringence in Congo Red-stained sections under polarizing microscopy. Amyloid deposits were also immunohistochemically stained by the horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin-biotin method (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) using anti-apoA-II antiserum as the primary antibody (23Higuchi K. Kogishi K. Wang J. Chen X. Chiba T. Matsushita T. Hoshii Y. Kawano H. Ishihara Y. Yokota T. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1535-1542PubMed Google Scholar) and 3,3 diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. The intensity of the AApoAII amyloid deposition was determined semi-quantatively using the amyloid index (AI) as a parameter. The AI is the average of the degree of AApoAII deposition graded from 0 to 4 in the seven organs examined (liver, spleen, skin, heart, stomach, small intestine, and tongue) in sections stained with Congo Red after immunohistochemical confirmation of the AApoAII deposition (18Higuchi K. Matsumura A. Honma A. Takeshita S. Hashimoto K. Hosokawa M. Yasuhira K. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1983; 48: 231-239PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of AApoAII deposited in each organ was categorized into the following five grades: grade 0 with no AApoAII found; grade 1 with a minute amount of AApoAII deposits; grade 2 with small amounts of AApoAII deposits only in the periportal areas of the liver, in the perifollicular regions of the spleen, in the interstitial tissues covering <10% of the areas of both ventricles, atrioventriclar septum, and both atria of the heart, only in the glandular portion and squamous glandular junction of the stomach and in <30% papillary layer of the dermis of the skin; grade 3 with a moderate amount of AApoAII deposits in <30% of the area of the lobules of the liver, in <30% of the area of the red pulp of the spleen, in the interstitial tissues covering 10–30% of the area of the heart muscles, in <50% lamina propria and submucosa of the squamous epithelia of the stomach, and in 30–80% of the area of the papillary layer of the dermis of the skin; and grade 4 with extensive AApoAII deposits in 30–80% of the area of the lobules of the liver, in 30–80% of the area of the red pulp of the spleen, in the interstitial tissues covering >30% of the area of the heart muscles, in >50% lamina propria and submucosa of the squamous epithelia of the stomach, and in almost all parts of the papillary layer of the dermis and around the hair follicles and sebaceous glands of the skin. The grading in the small intestine and tongue was described previously (23Higuchi K. Kogishi K. Wang J. Chen X. Chiba T. Matsushita T. Hoshii Y. Kawano H. Ishihara Y. Yokota T. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1535-1542PubMed Google Scholar). Two observers who had no information regarding the examined tissue graded and averaged the AI independently for each mouse. 10 μl of purified amyloid fractions (0.4 mg/ml) and 10 μl of 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0) were mixed. Half of the carbon-coated plastic grid (Ouken, Tokyo, Japan) was immersed in this mixture for 1 s. The negatively stained samples were observed with a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 80 kV. We measured amyloid fibrils if both ends were visible on the prints. Absolute breadth and length were calculated using the calibration bar on the photographs. Amyloid fractions were purified from the tongue and lungs of a 17-month-old AApoAII(C)-treated SAMR1 mouse with severe amyloid deposition. The isolated amyloid fraction was applied to Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels (16.5% (w/v)) (27Scha¨gger H.J. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, Ohio). Proteins were blotted onto immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). ApoA-II on the blots was detected with anti-apoA-II antiserum (1:4000), horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:3000, New England Biolabs, Beverly, Massachusetts), and the ECL Western blotting analysis system (AmershamBiosciences). To examine the type of apoA-II in the amyloid deposits, a part of each purified amyloid fraction was subjected to preparative two-dimensional PAGE with the Multiphore II system (AmershamBiosciences) essentially as described in the manufacturer’s manual. The fraction was soaked into Immobiline Drystrips (pH 3.0, 10 NL, 13 cm, Amersham Biosciences) overnight, and then the strips were processed by isoelectric focusing electrophoresis in the presence of 8m urea, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 9.7 mmdithiothreitol. After equilibration, the strips were processed by 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immuno-detected as described above. The apoA-II spot located by immunoblotting of a separate gel was excised and digested with 200 μl of 25 ng/μl pyroglutamine aminopeptidase deblocking buffer (Roche Diagnostics) for 24 h in a 30 °C-water bath. The membrane then was air-dried and processed by an automatic peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems 477 A and 120 A, Foster City, CA). We used the StatView software package (Abacus Concepts, Berkley, CA) to analyze the data. Because the AI is a nonlinear index, the AI of different groups of mice was compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney-U test. The average lengths of amyloid fibrils were compared with the Student's ttest. At 1, 2, and 3 months after injection of AApoAII(C) or DW to 2-month-old SAMR1 mice, no amyloid deposition was identified in any tissue. At 10 months after AApoAII(C) injection, we observed mild or moderate amounts of amyloid deposition in the lamina propria of the tongue, the lamina propria and submucosa of the small intestine, the glandular portion and squamous glandular junction of the stomach, and the vessel wall and alveolar septa of the lungs. A slight deposition was also observed in the collecting tubules in the papillae of the kidney, around the central vein in the liver, and in the interstitium of the myocardium. Amyloid deposition detected by green birefringence in Congo Red-stained slides under polarizing microscopy was confirmed by immunohistochemistry to be composed mainly of AApoAII. After 10 months, the intensity of the deposition gradually increased (Fig.1). At 15 months after treatment, we detected severe amyloid deposition in the tongue (Fig.2, A and C), stomach (Fig. 2, B and D), small intestine, and lungs. We detected mild deposition in the heart and kidneys and slight deposition in the liver, skin, and spleen. In contrast, we did not observe any amyloid deposition in DW-injected SAMR1 mice, even 20 months after treatment. To study the effect of age at the time of injection on amyloid induction, we also injected AApoAII(C) into 18-month-old SAMR1 mice, but no amyloid deposition was apparent in the tissues 3 months after injection.Figure 2AApoAII deposition in tissues of AApoAII(C)-treated SAMR1 mice. Amyloid deposition in the tongue and stomach of a 17-month-old AApoAII(C)-treated SAMR1 mouse was detected by immunohistochemical staining (A andB) and green birefringence in Congo Red-stained sections and examination by polarized microscopy (C and D). AApoAII deposits (grade 4) in the papillary layer of the tongue of a SAMR1 mouse 15 months after AApoAII injection (A andC) are shown. AApoAII deposits (grade 4) in the lamina propria and submucosa of the squamous glandular junction of the stomach (B and D) are shown. The scale barindicates 15 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) R1.P1-Apoa2C mice were injected with 0.1 ml of DW at 2 months of age. Three months after treatment, mild amyloid deposition was seen in only one mouse. At five months after injection, the AI increased obviously (Fig. 1), and at ten months after treatment, severe amyloid deposition was seen systemically but not in the bone and brain parenchyma. We analyzed amyloid fractions from the tongue and lungs of a 17-month-old AApoAII(C)-treated SAMR1 mouse. The biochemical results indicated no differences between these two organs. We applied the amyloid fractions to 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels. One major band with a molecular mass of 6.5 kDa and several faint bands with high molecular masses were detected in the Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250-stained gel (Fig. 3A). Subsequent immunoblot analysis showed three immunoreactive signals with molecular masses of 6.5, 16.2, and 26.4 kDa (Fig. 3A). Judging by their molecular masses and immunoreactivities, the prominent 6.5-kDa polypeptide and the other larger bands were determined most likely to be the monomeric and oligomeric forms of apoA-II, respectively. Immunoblot analysis after two-dimensional PAGE revealed that the oligomeric forms were almost completely depolymerized to the monomeric form. AApoAII monomers formed four isoforms, one major and three minor forms (data not shown). The major apoA-II membrane spot was cut and subjected to sequencing. The result revealed that the fifth amino acid at the N terminus was proline, which specified APOAIIB (Fig.3B). No contaminant peaks were detected in the sequencing. These results show that the major component of the deposited amyloid in AApoAII(C)-treated SAMR1 mice was endogenous APOAIIB and not exogenous AApoAII(C). To analyze the ultrastructure of the AApoAII(B) fibrils, we observed the negatively stained lung and tongue amyloid samples from two AApoAII(C)-treated SAMR1 mice with transmission electron microscopy. Both of the samples exhibited amyloid-characteristic straight and unbranched fibril images with 9-nm mean breadths, lacking any very obvious surface features (Fig. 4A). AApoAII(C) fibrils were also examined for comparison and were ∼9 nm in diameter (Fig.4B). The average length of AApoAII(B) measured was 87.58 ± 10.39 nm (50 fibrils), whereas that of the amyloid fibril AApoAII(C) was 439.28 ± 43.38 nm (80 fibrils). The former fibrils are shorter than the latter fibrils (p < 0.0001). Compared with AApoAII(B), we could see more obvious helically wound structures in AApoAII(C) fibrils. We injected 0.1 mg of AApoAII(B) in solution into 2-month-old SAMR1 mice. Similar to results in AApoAII(C)-treated mice, no amyloid deposition was detected at 1 or 3 months after injection. However, at seven months after treatment, we detected severe amyloid deposition in the lamina propria of the tongue and interstitium of the myocardium. We detected moderate amyloid deposition in the glandular portion and squamous glandular junction of the stomach and in the lamina propria and submucosa of the small intestine. Mild amyloid deposits were observed in the extracellular sites around the central veins in the liver. The intensity of the deposition increased after seven months (Fig. 1). The average AI of the AApoAII(B)-treated group at 10 and 12 months after induction was 2.21, whereas that of AApoAII(C)-treated mice at 10 and 12 months after injection was 1.36 (p = 0.0018). We compared the average level of amyloid in five major organs with deposits in tongue, heart, stomach, small intestine, and liver at 10 and 12 months after AApoAII injection (Fig.5A). In AApoAII(B)-treated 12- and 14-month-old SAMR1 mice, intense amyloid plaques were detected in the heart such that the plaques occupied and destroyed the histologic structure (Fig. 5B). The average AI of the heart was 3.67, which is significantly higher than that of hearts from AApoAII(C)-injected mice of the same age (AI = 1.22,p = 0.0022). Although, in general, the liver did not contain extensive deposits of amyloid, more amyloid deposited in the livers of AApoAII(B)-treated SAMR1 mice (AI = 1.17) than in those of AApoAII(C)-injected mice (AI = 0.11, p = 0.0157). In this study, we found that AApoAII(C) administration causes a conformational change of less amyloidogenic APOAIIB to amyloid fibrils AApoAII(B) in vivo. AApoAII(B) has the structure of an amyloid fibril, and when injected, it can further induce earlier and more severe amyloidosis in SAMR1 mice than AApoAII(C). The histologic results revealed that the heart and liver also contained extensive amyloid deposition in AApoAII(B) fibril-treated SAMR1 mice. We attribute the different effects of these two AApoAII fibrils to the different conformation of the fibrils, although the APOAIIB and APOAIIC monomers differ by only two amino acids. Two observations support this conclusion. First, electron microscopy revealed that the fibrils of AApoAII(B) are shorter and less helically wound than those of AApoAII(C). Because both amyloid fractions were purified by the same method, the structural discrepancy is probably caused by different conformations. Second, an in vitro thioflavine-T binding assay also revealed that AApoAII(B) generates little fluorescence, whereas AApoAII(C) shows high affinity for the fluorescence reagent (data not shown). Prions result from a conformational change in a protein, making it infectious (28Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 29Sparrer H.E. Santoso A. Szoka F.C., Jr. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 289: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate the existence of a species barrier in mammalian and yeast prions (30Raymond G.J. Hope J. Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond L.D. Bossers A. Ironside J. Will R.G. Chen S.G. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Rubenstein R. Smits M.A. Lansbury P.T. Jr. Caughey B. Nature. 1997; 388: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 31Santoso A. Chien P. Osherovich L.Z. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2000; 100: 277-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, recent work demonstrated that the yeast prions URE3 and PSI facilitate thede novo formation of Rnq1 prion aggregates (32Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). All of these proteins have similar Gln/Asn-rich domains but different primary structures. This phenomenon suggests that the appearance of prions is enhanced by heterologous prion aggregates and reveals a general principle of prion transmission. Our results suggest a prion-like transmission of a protein with a specific conformation in the pathogenesis of mouse senile amyloidosis. Although APOAIIB and APOAIIC have only two distinct amino acids, they have clearly different amyloidogenicity. R1.P1-Apoa2C mice with APOAIIC spontaneously develop amyloidosis as young as 5 months of age, whereas SAMR1 mice with APOAIIB have no amyloid deposition, even at 22 months of age. Like yeast prions, the injection of heterologous AApoAII(C) fibrils may provide a nidus on which the first seeds of the different AApoAIIB can form. This new conformational protein can further induce fibril formation in other SAMR1 mice in an experimental situation and is more effective than AApoAII(C), which suggests more efficient propagation of a homologous seed. The in vitro fibril extension experiment showed that there was no amyloid fibril formation 1 week after incubation of the APOAII(B) monomer from high density lipoprotein with AApoAII(C) (data not shown). This may be because of the long incubation time needed for heterologous nucleation of AApoAII(B) or to other as yet uncovered endogenous factors. The seeding model has also been proposed to explain how injecting mice with synthetic amyloid-like fibrils or modified silk enhances the formation of AA-amyloid fibrils. Furthermore, it has been reported that in patients with heterozygous familial amyloidosis polyneuropathy, cardiac amyloidosis consists of 46.5–50% wild-type transthyretin (TTR) in addition to mutant TTR (33Stangou A.J. Hawkins P.N. Heaton N.D. Rela M. Monaghan M. Nihoyannopoulos P. O'Gardy J. Pepys M.B. Williams R. Transplantation. 1998; 66: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). After liver transplantation, cardiac amyloidosis can be exacerbated, possibly because of enhanced deposition of wild-type TTR on the template of amyloid fibrils of variant TTR (34Yazaki M. Tokuda T. Nakamura A. Higashikata T. Koyama J. Higuchi K. Harihara Y. Baba S. Kametani F. Ikeda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The heart and liver contain more extensive amyloid deposition in AApoAII(B)-treated than in AApoAII(C)-injected SAMR1 mice. This phenomenon was proposed to relate to the distinct primary structure and conformation of the two amyloid fibrils. Tissues may also provide different environments for protein aggregation (35Hammarstrom P. Schneider F. Kelly J.F. Science. 2001; 293: 2459-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A similar observation was made for human hereditary amyloidosis. The first described apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) variant Gly26-Arg is being associated with peripheral neuropathy, peptic ulcers, and nephrotic syndrome (36Nichols W.C. Gregg R.E. Brewer H.B., Jr. Benson M.D. Genomics. 1990; 8: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A deletion/insertion mutation in exon 4 of the apoA-I gene could cause amyloid hepatopathy (37Booth D.R. Tan S. Booth S.E. Tennent G.A. Hutchinson W.L. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Truong O. Soutar A.K.

Variant Leu90-Pro of apoA-I has been found to be associated with cutaneous amyloid deposition and cardiomyopathy (38Hamidi Asl L. Liepnieks J.L. Hamidi Asl K. Uemichi T. Moulin G. Desjoyaux E. Loire R. Delpech M. Grateau G. Benson M.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 221-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Patients with familial amyloidosis polyneuropathy with the variant TTR Pro52 and TTR Thr84 but seldom those with TTR Met30 have substantial cardiac amyloidosis (33Stangou A.J. Hawkins P.N.

Further study is needed to elucidate this tissue specificity of amyloid deposition. The amyloid deposition in R1.P1-Apoa2C mice increases with age, suggesting the existence of age-related amyloidogenic factors. We injected AApoAII(C) fibrils into 18-month-old SAMR1 mice to determine whether the age at inducement will affect the amyloid formation. No amyloid deposition was detected three months after treatment. Unfortunately, the mice died afterward, and we could not continue the study (data not shown). We must recognize that amyloid fractions generally contain several minor contaminants including apolipoprotein E (39Kindy M.S. King A.R. Perry G. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 469-475PubMed Google Scholar), amyloid P component, proteoglycans, and ubiquitin (40Kisilevsky R. Gruys E. Shirahama T. Amyloid. 1995; 2: 128-133Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein E, amyloid P component, and proteoglycans are speculated to have “chaperone”-like activity in amyloidogenesis (41Hoshii Y. Kawano H. Cui D. Takeda T. Gondo T. Takahashi M. Kogishi K. Higuchi K. Ishihara T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 911-917PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that these components synergistically modulate the amyloidogenesis of APOAIIB. Nevertheless, because a guanidine-hydrochloride-treated amyloid fraction could not induce amyloid fibrils in vivo (23Higuchi K. Kogishi K. Wang J. Chen X. Chiba T. Matsushita T. Hoshii Y. Kawano H. Ishihara Y. Yokota T. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1535-1542PubMed Google Scholar), there is no doubt that AApoAII(C) fibrils are essential for amyloidogenesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that like PrPSc in prion diseases, exogenous variant AApoAII(C) amyloid fibrils could induce a conformational change in the endogenous wild-type, less amyloidogenic protein APOAIIB. AApoAII(B) fibrils possessing a new conformation can further induce amyloidosis in SAMR1 mice. Our work on the experimental transmission of mouse apoA-II amyloidosis will help to elucidate the pathogenesis of amyloidosis including hereditary human apoA-II amyloidosis (42Benson M.D. Liepnieks J.J.

Here we have characterized a homolog designated as YOS9 (YDR057w) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast protein (Yos9) is a membrane-associated glycoprotein that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). YOS9 interacts genetically with genes involved in ER-Golgi transport, particularly SEC34, whose temperature-sensitive mutant is rescued by YOS9overexpression. Interestingly, Yos9 appears to play a direct role in the transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the Golgi apparatus. Yos9 binds directly to Gas1 and Mkc7 and accelerates Gas1 transport and processing in cells overexpressingYOS9. Correspondingly, Gas1 processing is slowed in cells bearing a deletion in YOS9. No effect upon the transport and processing of non-GPI-anchored proteins (e.g. invertase and carboxypeptidase Y) was detected in cells either lacking or overexpressing Yos9. As Yos9 is not a component of the Emp24 complex, it may act as a novel escort factor for GPI-anchored proteins in ER-Golgi transport in yeast and possibly in mammals.

Membrane-bound compartments are in a state of dynamic flux in eukaryotic cells. Transport vesicles emerge from donor compartments and are targeted to specific acceptor compartments where they deliver cargo molecules through membrane fusion (1Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). Vesicular transport not only permits the trafficking of soluble and membranal components from one compartment to the other but also controls the protein and lipid composition of membranes as well as the size of cellular organelles. Complimentary biochemical and genetic studies in both yeast and mammalian cells have established the basic principles and molecular mechanisms that underlie protein sorting. Initially, proteins are translocated into the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IP, immunoprecipitation; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; endoH, endoglycosidase-H; CPY, carboxypeptidase-Y; WT, wild type; UPR, unfolded protein response; SL, sphingolipid; TCL, total cell lysate; abs, antibodies; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; SNARE, soluble NSF attachment protein receptors; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; ORF, open reading frame; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IP, immunoprecipitation; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; endoH, endoglycosidase-H; CPY, carboxypeptidase-Y; WT, wild type; UPR, unfolded protein response; SL, sphingolipid; TCL, total cell lysate; abs, antibodies; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase. where they undergo folding and N-linked glycosylation. Proteins are then transported to the Golgi before reaching their final destination, such as the cell surface or the lysosome/vacuole. ER-Golgi protein trafficking in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been studied intensely, and many of the components involved in the derivation and consumption of Golgi-targeted transport vesicles have been characterized. These include the Sar1 GTPase and COPII coat components that are recruited to the sites of vesicle formation at the ER and are required for vesicle biogenesis (2Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In addition, those components involved in the docking and fusion of ER-derived vesicles at the Golgi, i.e. the SNAREs (e.g. Bet1, Bos1, Sec22, and Sed5) as well as the Ypt1 GTPase and t-SNARE-associated protein, Sly1, have been studied (3Dascher C.

Additional factors operate upstream of Ypt1 and the SNAREs to mediate the tethering of COPII vesicles and include Uso1 (9Nakajima H. Hirata A. Ogawa Y. Yonehara T. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the Sec34/Sec35 complex (10Van Rheenen S.M. Cao X. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J.

Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Despite their high concentration, lumenal-resident proteins are not secreted and are hardly detectable in the Golgi. Two complementary systems, one that ensures retention in the ER and another that retrieves escapees from the Golgi, confer this highly selective steady-state distribution. ER-resident proteins are retrieved by discrete targeting motifs such as cytoplasmic KKXX and RR signals or lumenal H/KDEL sequences (22Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Most soluble ER-resident proteins are characterized by the H/KDEL sequence that prevents their secretion (23Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar, 24Pelham H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The protein translated from open reading frame (ORF) YDR057w is the last HDEL-containing protein in S. cerevisiae that has not been characterized. ORFs encoding proteins of similar structure are found in the genomes of Schizosaccharomyces pombe,Caenorhabditis elegans, and Homo sapiens, etc. (25Su Y.A. Hutter C.M. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The probable human homolog, hOS-9, is present in all tissues and is overexpressed in osteosarcomas, although no function has been assigned to the protein thus far. Here, we characterize the yeast homolog of the OS-9 family, designated Yos9. We show that Yos9 is an ER-resident protein that is membrane associated and facilitates delivery of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the Golgi. Yos9 interacts directly with the Gas1 and Mkc7 GPI-anchored proteins, and the processing of Gas1 is significantly altered in cells either lacking or overexpressing the YOS9 gene. In contrast, processing and secretion of non-GPI-anchored proteins is unaffected. Thus, the yeast OS-9 homolog plays an important role in the maturation and exit from the ER of GPI-anchored proteins. Yeast were grown in standard media containing 2% glucose as a carbon source (26Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1990Google Scholar). DNA introduction into yeast was performed using standard procedures (26Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1990Google Scholar). Homologous recombination was used to disrupt the YOS9 gene. Strains were transformed with linearized pYOS9U (cut withEcoRI to release a 4085-bp fragment). After selection on plates lacking uracil, DNA derived from the subsequent colonies was subjected to Southern analysis to verify the disruption ofYOS9.

Primers included: YOS9HAF (5′-CATCCCCTTTCTTCCCCTGCAGAATGCAAGC-3′), which introduces aPstI site at the 5′ end of YOS9, and YOS9HAR (5′-CTCCTGAGCTCTTAAAGCTCATCATGGGACGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTAAGGGTATTCGATGAAAACACCAGC-3′), which introduces the HA tag directly upstream of the encoded HDEL sequence and a SacI site 3′ to the subsequent stop codon. A multi-copy plasmid, pADH-YOS9HA, that bears the LEU2selectable marker, was created by cloning the YOS9HA PCR fragment into vector pAD4Δ. A multi-copy plasmid, pRS426-HAYOS9, which bears the URA3 selectable marker, was created by subcloning a BamHI fragment containing aADH-YOS9HA fragment into the BamHI site of pRS426. A myc epitope-tagged version of YOS9 was created in a similar fashion, except that a reverse oligonucleotide, YOS9MYCR (5′-CTCCTGAGCTCTTAAAGCTCATCATGCAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATCAGCTTTTGCTCTTCGATGAAAACACCAGC-3′), was used instead of YOS9HAR in the PCR reaction. Construct for YOS9 gene disruption: To disrupt theYOS9 gene a disruption plasmid, pYOS9U, was created. First, a fragment of 4017 bp containing full-length genomic YOS9(with flanking regions) was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the YOS9F (5′-GTACCTGTCATTCACACATGTG-3′) and YOS9R (5′-GAAGTCAGACGCGTTGCCATTACGC-3′) oligonucleotides. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) to yield pGEM-YOS9. In parallel, the URA3 gene was amplified using oligonucleotides URA3F (5′-ATCGATAGCTTATCAATTCATCTT-3′) and URA3R (5′-TTTTAATTAACGTCATTATGAAATC-3′), which bear ClaI andPacI restriction sites, respectively. Subsequently, an 1150-bp ClaI-PacI fragment of YOS9 was removed by restriction endonuclease treatment and was substituted with the URA3 selection marker to yield plasmid pYOS9U. Construct for Yos9 localization: To localize Yos9 in yeast, a construct expressing Yos9 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) upstream of the HDEL localization sequence. First, a XhoI site was created in pADH-YOS9HA directly upstream to the HA epitope, using the YOS9XHO1F (5′-GGTAACAAACGTAGCAGCTCGAGTTTTCATCGAATACCCTTAC-3′) and YOS9XHO1R (5′-GTAAGGGTATTCGATGAAAACTCGAGCTGCTACGTTTGTTACC-3′) oligonucleotides and PfuI polymerase to yield plasmid pADH-YOS9HAX. Next, a GFP-encoding fragment bearing XhoI ends was generated by PCR using the GFPXHO1F (5′-GATCCTCGAGGTAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTT C-3′) and GFPXHO1R (5′-GATCCTCGAGCTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC-3′) oligonucleotides. This fragment was inserted into the XhoI site in pADH-YOS9HAX to yield plasmid pADH-YOS9HAGFP. A multicopy plasmid bearing a URA3 marker and expressing HA-tagged Mkc7, pHKMKC7HA, was kindly provided by R. Fuller (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). An integrating plasmid expressing Sec7-RFP, YIplac204-T/C-SEC7-DSRED.T4 was kindly provided by B. Glick (University of Chicago). After linearization with Bsu36I, this construct was integrated into the trp1 locus of SP1 wild-type yeast to yield SP1-SEC7RFP yeast. Yeast strains either overexpressingYOS9 or bearing a disruption in the YOS9 gene were assayed for viability at different temperatures. Cells were patched onto plates for growth at room temperature prior to replica plating to the experimental conditions. To measure Kar2 secretion on filters, cells were first grown as patches on plates, then replicated onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell, BA-S85) that were placed yeast-side-up onto fresh plates and grown for 36–48 h. Next, the filters were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% non-fat dry milk. Filters were then probed with anti-Kar2 antibodies (1:2,000 dilution) (a gift of C. Barlowe, Dartmouth University) and detected by chemiluminescence using conjugated anti-rabbit second antibodies (1:10,000 dilution) (AmershamBiosciences). Yeast were grown to log phase and processed for immunoprecipitation (IP) and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, as described (27Couve A. Protopopov V. Gerst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5987-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with the exception that 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was substituted for Triton X-100 in the co-IP buffer. For pulse-chase experiments, detergent solubilized cell extracts were incubated with the appropriate antibodies, including anti-Gas1 (gift of H. Riezman, Biozentrum); anti-CPY (gift of Scott Emr, University of California, San Diego); and anti-invertase (gift of Eitan Bibi, Weizmann Institute). For co-IP experiments, monoclonal anti-HA (gift of M. Wigler, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) or anti-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were used to IP tagged proteins. Immunoblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes was performed, and subsequent detection of co-IP'd proteins was performed using anti-HA, anti-Erv25 (gift of C. Barlowe), or anti-Emp24 (gift of H. Riezman) antibodies, by chemiluminescence. Metabolic labeling with [35S]-methionine and pulse-chase analysis was performed as described (27Couve A. Protopopov V. Gerst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5987-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Gels were treated with a fluorescence enhancer (10% salicylic acid), fixed, and exposed for autoradiography using a phosphorimager. Protein phosphorylation studies were carried out essentially as described (28Marash M. Gerst J.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-HA antibodies were used to IP Yos9HA from yeast pre-labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.25 mCi per 10A 600 units). Unlabeled cells were used as controls. The metabolic labeling of sphingolipids using [3H]-myo-inositol was as described (29David D. Sundarababu S. Gerst J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1167-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation of yeast was performed using a glass bead method as described (31Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (0.5–0.75 mg protein) from the 10,000 × g pellet were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (30Lustgarten V. Gerst J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4480-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and incubated with one of the following reagents: 0.5 m potassium acetate, pH 5.5; 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5; 0.5% Triton X-100; 1m NaCl; 0.25 m glycine, pH 2.5, or buffer alone (control). Samples were incubated on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, suspended in sample buffer, and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblot analysis. Extraction with precondensed Triton X-114 was carried out as described (30Lustgarten V. Gerst J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4480-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein samples (0.5 mg) were added to a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1.0% Triton X-114 in a final volume of 200 μl. For better phase separation, a 6% (w/v) cushion of sucrose was used. Proteins from the detergent and aqueous phases were concentrated by precipitation with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min (4 °C) before being washed, resuspended in sample buffer, and electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels. Endoglycosidase Treatment: Deglycosylation of yeast extracts was performed using endoglycosidase H (endoH) according to the supplier's instructions (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 100-μg protein aliquots from cell lysates were incubated with endoH (1,000 units) for 2, 4, and 16 h. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and probed in blots using anti-HA or anti-CPY antibodies. Concanavalin-A (Con-A) chromatography: Total cell lysates prepared using the glass bead method were diluted 10-fold with the column buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5; 0.25 m NaCl; 1 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MnCl2; and 0.55% Triton X-100) and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g. Supernatants were subjected to chromatography on immobilized concanavalin A-Sepharose 4S beads (Sigma). Cleared lysates were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with beads that had been prewashed with buffer. Next, the beads were washed extensively, the bound proteins eluted with sample buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and detected in immunoblots. Yeast were fixed and permeabilized for immunofluorescence as described (30Lustgarten V. Gerst J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4480-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Yos9 was detected using affinity-purified anti-HA monoclonal antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). MnnI was detected using affinity-purified anti-MnnI antibodies (gift of S. Emr, University of California, San Diego) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). Various protein identification and analysis algorithms available in the ExPASy Server (Geneva University; expasy.hcuge.ch/www/tools.html) were used. Multiple alignments of the protein sequences were performed using the Clustal W method and MegAlign software (DNAstar Inc.). Comparison of the amino acid sequences translated from full-length human and rat OS-9 cDNAs with the sequences of possible C. elegans (F48E8.4) and S. cerevisiae (YDR057w) homologs (Fig.1) reveals that OS-9 is highly conserved. This is especially true for the NH2 terminus of the proteins (residues 1–250), which shares 96% identity between rats and humans and 20% identity between mammalian OS-9 and that of ORF YDR057w (12% identity overall with mammalian OS-9). Moreover, six of eight cysteine residues found in the mammalian forms are positionally conserved with yeast OS-9 (Yos9). Thus, Yos9 is a probable OS-9 homolog and can be studied in order to elucidate the function of this conserved family of proteins. Interestingly, we noted that Yos9 contains a HDEL ER retention signal present at the COOH terminus of the protein, suggesting that it is a lumenal ER-resident protein and may be involved in the transport of proteins through the ER. To determine the function of Yos9 in yeast, we checked the effects of a null mutation in YOS9by disrupting the gene using homologous recombination. AYOS9 disruption cassette containing the URA3selectable marker was transformed into wild-type cells, and the disruption was verified by Southern analysis. yos9Δstrains were found to grow normally and showed no obvious phenotype. These cells had a normal morphology and were able to grow under different conditions of pH, salt concentration, and temperature (i.e. 15°, 18°, 26°, 30°, 35°, and 37 °C) as well as the parental SP1 strain, and the cells were not defective for mating (data not shown). Thus, the YOS9 gene does not provide any essential function that can be identified phenotypically upon its disruption. A HA epitope-tagged form of Yos9 (Yos9HA) was expressed in order to monitor its localization in yeast. The calculated molecular mass of native Yos9 is 61 kDa, while addition of the HA tag should increase the mass to 63 kDa. However, when identified on Western blots using anti-HA antibodies, we found that Yos9HA runs on SDS-PAGE gels at a mass corresponding to 75 kDa (data not shown, and Figs.2 B and 4).Figure 4GPI-anchored proteins co-precipitate with Yos9. A, Gas1 co-precipitates with Yos9. WT cells alone (−) or WT cells expressing Yos9HA (+) were grown to log phase, proteins were extracted, and Yos9HA was precipitated using anti-HA abs. Anti-Gas1 abs were used to show the presence of Gas1 in the immunoprecipitates, while anti-HA abs (1:5,000 dilution) were used to show the presence of Yos9HA. The total cell lysate (TCL) (75 μg) from Yos9HA expressing cells is shown. B, Mkc7 co-precipitates with Yos9.

To help determine its localization in cells, fractionation techniques were used to prepare extracts from yeast expressing Yos9HA. The 10,000 × g soluble (S10) and pellet (P10) fractions as well as the 100,000 × g soluble (S100) and pellet (P100) fractions were separated by centrifugation and then probed for Yos9 using anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2 A). Western blot analysis revealed that Yos9HA is found mostly in the P10 membrane fraction, with some in the P100. This distribution was basically identical to that seen for bona fide membrane proteins such as Sso1 and 2, which are integral membrane proteins functioning as t-SNAREs at the cell surface (32Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In contrast, a soluble yeast vacuolar hydrolase, carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (33Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), was found in the supernatant fractions only. Thus, Yos9 is associated with the total membrane fraction and not with the cytosol (Fig. 2 A). As YOS9 does not appear to encode a membrane protein, aliquots of the P10 membrane fraction were subjected to various treatments to reveal the nature of the interaction between Yos9 and the membrane. High pH extraction with 0.2 mNa2CO3 (pH 11) and low pH extraction with 0.2m glycine (pH 2.4) were performed in order to detach proteins associated with membranes, but not integral membrane proteins. Yos9HA was found to be split evenly between the soluble and pellet fractions in both cases, whereas Sso proteins were associated with the pellet fractions, and CPY remained soluble (Fig. 2 A). However, upon extraction with high salt (0.5 M NaCl), Yos9HA remained associated with the pellet like the Sso proteins. Thus, although the amino acid sequence of Yos9 does not predict a hydrophobic region (aside perhaps from the NH2-terminal signal peptide), the data suggests that it is tightly associated with membranes. To determine whether Yos9 is an integral membrane protein, we examined its distribution between lipid and aqueous phases using extraction with Triton X-114. Upon such treatment, transmembrane or lipid-anchored proteins separate to the Triton X-114 phase, while membrane-associated and soluble proteins are found in aqueous phase. As seen in Fig.2 A, Yos9HA is found in the aqueous fraction upon phase separation, unlike Sso. Thus, Yos9 is not an integral membrane protein but is tightly membrane associated. Analysis of the Yos9 protein sequence predicts potential sites for phosphorylation and glycosylation. To check whether Yos9 undergoes phosphorylation, an in vivo metabolic labeling assay was performed with [32P]orthophosphate. After IP with anti-HA antibodies, Yos9HA was found to be present in the precipitates, but no signal was detected by autoradiography (data not shown). Thus, Yos9 is not phosphorylated in vivo under these conditions. As stated above, Yos9HA runs at a higher molecular mass than expected, possibly because of glycosylation. To determine whether Yos9 is a glycoprotein, we examined whether Yos9 is sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H (endoH) or binds to concanavalin A (con A)-conjugated beads. Treatment of cell lysates with endoH resulted in a clear increase in the mobility of Yos9HA on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig.2 B), the change in molecular mass being on the order of 10 kDa. This treatment also resulted in a change in mobility of CPY, a highly glycosylated protein, which served as a control. Similarly, we found that Yos9HA bound tightly to con A beads, as did CPY (Fig.2 C). However, in contrast Sso could not bind to the resin and eluted in the wash phase. Thus, Yos9 is a glycoprotein. Although Yos9 bears a COOH-terminal HDEL sequence and pellets in the P10 fraction, we wished to verify its localization to the ER. To do so, we expressed a Yos9-GFP fusion protein in yeast and examined its localization using confocal microscopy (Fig. 2 D). We found the GFP fluorescence to label the intracellular aspect of the cell surface and often ring the nucleus, which is typical for ER-localized proteins such as Kar2 (34Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Some punctate labeling was also observed at the cell surface and may indicate possible ER exit sites. In contrast, there was no significant co-localization with the Sec7 Golgi marker when expressed as a fusion with red fluorescent protein (RFP) (35Graham T.R. Seeger M. Payne G.S. MacKay V.L. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained by immunofluorescence, using affinity-purified antibodies to detect Yos9HA and the Golgi-resident protein, MnnI, which were visualized via the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and rhodamine channels, respectively (data not shown). Thus, Yos9 appears to be a membrane-associated ER-localized glycoprotein. Since Yos9 is ER localized, it may be involved in protein trafficking. Thus, we looked for genetic interactions with genes that are involved in secretion. We did this by overexpressingYOS9 in different early (sec12, sec13,sec18, sec21, sec22, sec23,sec34, sec35, bet1, bos1,sed5, ypt1, and uso1), middle (sec14), and late-acting (sec6 andsec9) sec mutants (36Novick P.

https://openalex.org/W2035940253,"In Escherichia coli there are two pathways for conversion of adenine into guanine nucleotides, both involving the intermediary formation of IMP. The major pathway involves conversion of adenine into hypoxanthine in three steps via adenosine and inosine, with subsequent phosphoribosylation of hypoxanthine to IMP. The minor pathway involves formation of ATP, which is converted via the histidine pathway to the purine intermediate 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide and, subsequently, to IMP. Here we describe E. coli mutants, in which a third pathway for conversion of adenine to IMP has been activated. This pathway was shown to involve direct deamination of adenine to hypoxanthine by a manganese-dependent adenine deaminase encoded by a cryptic gene, yicP, which we propose be renamed ade. Insertion elements, located from −145 to +13 bp relative to the transcription start site, activated theade gene as did unlinked mutations in the hnsgene, encoding the histone-like protein H-NS. Gene fusion analysis indicated that ade transcription is repressed more than 10-fold by H-NS and that a region of 231 bp including theade promoter is sufficient for this regulation. The activating insertion elements essentially eliminated the H-NS-mediated silencing, and stimulated ade gene expression 2–3-fold independently of the H-NS protein.

Conversion of adenine into guanine nucleotides occurs by two different pathways that converge on IMP and utilize the subsequent reactions of the de novosynthesis pathway to guanine nucleotides (1Zalkin H. Nygaard P. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology 1. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 561-579Google Scholar). The major pathway involves conversion of adenine to hypoxanthine in three steps involving the intermediate formation of adenosine and inosine (Fig.1). The first and third reactions in this sequence are catalyzed by the deoD gene product, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, whereas the second step is catalyzed by adenosine deaminase encoded by the add gene. Hypoxanthine in turn is converted to IMP by hypoxanthine or guanine phosphoribosyltransferases encoded by the hpt and gpt genes, respectively. The minor pathway involves formation of ATP, which is converted via the histidine pathway to the purine intermediate 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribonucleotide and subsequently to IMP (Fig. 1). The flux through this pathway is limited because the first enzyme of the histidine pathway, HisG, is subject to strong feedback inhibition by the end product histidine (2Winkler M.E. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology 1. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 485-505Google Scholar). Thus, purine-requiring mutants in which the major pathway is blocked by mutation of thedeoD gene only grow very slowly with adenine as the sole source of purines, and this residual growth can be eliminated by the addition of histidine to the growth medium (3Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Neidhardt F.C. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 445-473Google Scholar). These findings indicate that there are no other pathways for converting adenine into guanine nucleotides. Specifically, studies of enzymatic activities in crude extracts indicated that E. coli contains no adenine deaminase activity, which might convert adenine directly to hypoxanthine by deamination (4Leung H.B. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10867-10874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Kocharyan et al. (5Kocharyan S.M. Kocharyan A.M. Meliksetyan G.O. Akopyan Z.I. Genetika. 1982; 18: 906-914PubMed Google Scholar) reported the isolation of E. coli mutants, in which an apparently cryptic adenine deaminase gene had been activated. The genetic locus affected in these mutants, however, was not identified nor mapped. The paradigm example of cryptic genes in E. coli is thebgl operon involved in metabolism of aromatic β-glucosides. A key element in the silencing of the bgloperon is the small abundant nucleoid-associated protein, H-NS, which probably forms a repressing nucleoprotein complex upon binding to silencer DNA regions flanking the bgl promoter (6Reynolds A.E. Mahadevan S., Le Grice S.F. Wright A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Higgins C.F. Dorman C.J. Stirling D.A. Waddell L. Booth I.R. May G. Bremer E.

In addition to the bgl operon and other cryptic genes the H-NS protein also modulates the expression of a large number of activeE. coli genes, usually by repressing transcription initiation (11Atlung T.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3986-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Binding of H-NS generally induces strong condensation of DNA, and thus, the protein has been implicated in the organization and compaction of the bacterial nucleoid (18Spassky A. Rimsky S. Garreau H. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5321-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). H-NS consists of an N-terminal oligomerization domain and a C-terminal DNA binding domain, and the ability of the protein to condense DNA and repress transcription apparently depends on its ability to oligomerize (19Ueguchi C. Suzuki T. Yoshida T. Tanaka K. Mizuno T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Spurio R. Falconi M. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O.

In the present work we have isolated and characterized mutants with increased adenine deaminase activity and demonstrate that this activity is due to a manganese-dependent adenine deaminase encoded by a cryptic gene, yicP, which we propose be renamedade. In agreement with these findings, purified YicP protein has recently been shown to posses significant adenine deaminase activity (22Matsui H. Shimaoka M. Kawasaki H. Takenaka Y. Kurahashi O. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To define the elements responsible for the cryptic nature of the ade gene, we have identified a large number of cis- and trans-acting mutations that lead to activation of gene expression. Like the bgl promoter, the adepromoter region was found to be extremely AT-rich and subject to strong repression by the H-NS protein. As also observed for the bgloperon, we found that insertion of a variety of IS elements within an extended region surrounding the ade promoter resulted in relief of the H-NS-mediated silencing. The results suggest that these IS1elements interfered with the formation of an H-NS·DNA complex, which would otherwise sequester the adjacent ade promoter region. The bacterial strains used in this study are all derivatives of E. coliK12 and are listed in Table I.

Open table in a new tab An auxotrophic purE deoD strain, CN1980 (Table I), was plated on glucose minimal medium containing 40 μg/ml histidine and 15 μg/ml adenine as the sole source of purines. Mutants that were still auxotrophic and capable of utilizing adenine as a purine source were characterized further as described under “Results.” Several independent selections were performed. To facilitate subsequent analysis of the mutants obtained, some of these selections were performed on strains that were isogenic with CN1980 except that they contained gsk mutant alleles which did not give rise to kanamycin resistance. Verification of genomic mutations by colony PCR amplification and DNA sequencing was performed as described previously (23Petersen C. Møller L.B. J. Biol.

PCR amplifications were performed on 1 μg of genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The DNA oligonucleotides used as primers in PCR reactions are described in Table II. The sequence of cloned PCR fragments were verified by sequencing on an ABI377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems/PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For construction of pAde, the ade gene and flanking regions (nucleotides 3612–5598) were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with theade-R1 and ade-Bam primers (Table II) and inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the medium-copy vector pBR322 (30Bolivar F.

For construction of medium-copy ade-lacZ gene fusions, the ade promoter and 65 base pairs of N-terminal coding region was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and inserted between unique EcoRI and HindIII sites in thelacZ gene fusion vector pCN302, which is based on the pBR322 replicon (24Petersen C.

The ade promoter fragments in pCN2421 and pCN2422 were amplified with the ade-R1 and ade-H3 primers (Table II), whereas the promoter insert in pCN2534 was generated with the ade-R12 and ade-H3 primers (Table II). A low-copy derivative, pCN2515, of the IS1-activatedade-lacZ fusion, pCN2422, was constructed by inserting theade promoter fragment into the low-copy lacZ gene fusion vector, pCN2423, which is based on the pSC101 replicon (23Petersen C.

Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to A436 = 20. Cells were disrupted by sonic treatment, and the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 3 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. Assays were performed at 37 °C by mixing appropriately diluted extract with [8-14C]adenine (8.4 Ci/mol) at a final concentration of 0.5 mm in a total volume of 50 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2. At timed intervals, samples of 15 μl were taken out, boiled for 2 min, and cooled on ice. After a 3-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g, 5 μl of supernatant was applied to a polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plate. Substrate and products were separated by chromatography in water and subsequently quantitated by counting in an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). The enzymatic activities were calculated from the initial slope of a plot of the amount of radioactive substrate remaining as a function of time (see Fig.2). The reported activities are the averages of two independent determinations, which deviated less than 10% from the average. The adenine deaminase was strongly dependent on manganese ions; the enzymatic activity decreased more than 30-fold if MnCl2 was omitted from the assay (data not shown). Differential rates of β-galactosidase synthesis were measured at 37 °C as described previously (31Petersen C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Bacterial RNA was prepared by hot phenol extraction, and primer extension analysis was performed on 5 μg of total RNA as described (32Melefors Ö. von Gabain A. Cell. 1988; 52: 893-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We used a32P-labeled DNA primer complementary to nucleotides 41–64 of the lacZ coding sequence (#1224, see Table II). Mutants with an activated adenine deaminase gene were sought by plating a purine-requiringdeoD mutant strain, such as CN1980 (Table I), on glucose minimal medium containing adenine and histidine (see “Experimental Procedures”). With a frequency of 10−6, mutant colonies appeared that apparently converted adenine efficiently into guanine nucleotides despite the blocked deoD pathway and the presence of histidine in the medium. Sixty of such independent mutants were characterized further and found to belong to three distinct classes as described in the following. Half of the isolated mutants lost the ability to grow with adenine as a purine source upon introduction of thehisG::Tn10 allele from NK5526 (Table I), and for several of these mutants the responsible mutation was mapped to the hisG gene itself (data not shown). Thus, the feedback regulation of the HisG enzyme was probably eliminated in this class of mutants to allow an increased flux through the histidine biosynthetic pathway even in the presence of histidine. These mutants were not characterized further. The remaining mutants did not lose the ability to grow on adenine upon introduction of a hisG::Tn10 or adeoD::cam mutation (data not shown), suggesting that a novel third pathway for conversion of adenine into guanine nucleotides had been activated. Based on differences with respect to growth and colony morphology, these mutants could be divided into two distinct classes (II and III) consisting of 20 and 10 independent clones, respectively. The Class II mutants, like the parent strain, grew well on a variety of carbon sources and formed normal non-mucoid colonies. Genetic analysis revealed that the responsible mutation in the Class II mutants showed a high cotransduction frequency with the ilvB locus (data not shown), which is compatible with a location in the immediate vicinity of theyicP gene. Thus, we hypothesized that the novel activated pathway in Class II mutants might involve direct deamination of adenine to hypoxanthine by the yicP gene product. In support of this notion, we found that a crude extract of one of the Class II mutants, CN2388–2, efficiently converted adenine into hypoxanthine with no apparent formation of any intermediate products, corresponding to a 20-fold increase of the cellular adenine deaminase activity compared with the parent strain, CN1980 (Fig. 2, left and center panels). Furthermore, we subjected a derivative of CN2388–2 to transposon mutagenesis with mini-Tn10 cam and isolated a clone that had specifically lost the ability to grow with adenine as a purine source while retaining the ability to utilize hypoxanthine. Subsequent analysis revealed that the cam insert in this strain, CN2451, had indeed disrupted the yicP gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). Back transduction of theyicP::cam allele into all the Class II mutants eliminated their ability to use adenine as a purine source (data not shown), confirming that the original phenotype was caused by activation of the yicP gene, which we propose be renamedade. This conclusion was further corroborated by cloning of the chromosomalade gene and its native promoter in a multicopy plasmid, pAde (see “Experimental Procedures”). Introduction of this plasmid increased the adenine deaminase activity of CN1980 ∼30-fold from 0.5 to 15.4 μmol/min/g of dry weight and enabled the transformant to grow well in glucose minimal medium with adenine as the sole source of purines at a rate comparable with that of a purine-prototrophic strain (data not shown). These results indicated that the wild typeade gene encodes a functional adenine deaminase but is simply too poorly expressed at normal gene dosage to satisfy the cellular purine requirement, which is on the order of 4 μmol/min/g of dry weight (33Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1990Google Scholar). Indeed, the low but significant adenine deaminase activity in the wild type strain, CN1980, was completely abolished by the ade::cam disruption in CN2481 (compare Figs. 2, left and right panels). In agreement with the results of Matsui et al. (22Matsui H. Shimaoka M. Kawasaki H. Takenaka Y. Kurahashi O. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), theE. coli adenine deaminase was strongly dependent on manganese ions for activity (see “Experimental Procedures”), as also observed for the homologous enzyme from B. subtilis(36Nygaard P. Duckert P. Saxild H.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 846-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations responsible for the increased adenine deaminase activity were identified for 15 Class II mutants by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of the ade promoter region (Fig. 3). In 12 of these mutants theade gene was activated by integration of an IS1 element within the first 100 base pairs of the divergent neighboring gene, yicO. Two mutants were activated by insertion of IS4 or IS5 in the same region of yicO, whereas one mutant contained an IS5 insertion in the intercistronic region between ade and yicO. The latter insertion was the only one found to be located downstream of the ade promoter. In addition we found two Class II mutants with unidentified insertions or rearrangements inyicO that could not be spanned by PCR amplification as well as three mutants that apparently contained an amplification of the entire ade region including the ilvB locus (data not shown). The finding that all the identified Class II mutations mapped outside of the structural ade gene underscored that the cryptic nature of this locus was caused by a low level of expression rather than by malfunctioning of the encoded gene product. It is also noteworthy that activation could occur by insertion of IS elements within an extended region of 160 base pairs surrounding theade promoter and that this activation, at least for IS1, was independent of the orientation of the insertion element. The Class III mutants were clearly distinguishable from the parent strain and the other mutant classes by their formation of mucoid colonies even on LB plates and their poor growth with glycerol or succinate as carbon sources irrespective of the purine source. The cellular adenine deaminase activity of a representative Class III mutant, CN2388-16 (Table I), was found to be 3.8 μmol/min/g of dry weight, which is nearly 8-fold higher than the enzymatic activity of the wild type parent. Furthermore, CN2388-16 lost the ability to grow with adenine as a purine source upon introduction of theade::cam allele. These results indicated that the Class III mutants, like those of Class II, contain an activated ade gene. However, transductional mapping experiments indicated that the responsible activating mutation was unlinked to the ade and ilvB loci (data not shown), suggesting a mutation in a trans-acting regulatory locus. Accordingly, we mapped the mutation responsible for the increased adenine deaminase activity and the other phenotypes of CN2388-16 to the 27-min region of the genome immediately clockwise of thesupF marker (data not shown). This corresponds to the location of the hns gene, mutations in which are known to cause increased formation of capsular polysaccharides and poor growth on gluconeogenic carbon sources (37Sledjeski D. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, we inferred that the Class III mutants might contain loss-of-function mutations in thehns gene, and this was confirmed by PCR amplification of thehns gene in CN2388-16 and another Class III mutant, CN2388–11, using the primers hns-RV + hns-H3 (Table II). DNA sequencing of the PCR fragments revealed that the hns gene in both cases had been disrupted by insertion of an IS1 element in the region encoding the C-terminal DNA binding domain of H-NS,2 leaving a truncated reading frame of 126 or 108 codons, respectively (plus additional codons encoded by the IS1 sequence). In agreement with these results, we found that the cellular adenine deaminase activity increased 11-fold upon introduction of the well characterized hns205::Tn10 allele into CN1980 (Table III). This hnsdisruption allele, which codes for a truncated H-NS protein of only 93 amino acid residues (38Free A. Porter M.E. Deighan P. Dorman C.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 903-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), also mimicked the other phenotypes of the selected Class III mutants with respect to increased mucoidicity and poor growth on glycerol or succinate. All these results indicated that the cryptic nature of the ade gene in wild type strains is due to H-NS-mediated gene silencing.Table IIIEffect of IS insertions and H-NS on the cellular adenine deaminase activity (in μmol/min/g of dry weight)Strain pair (hns+/hns205::Tn10)adealleleAdenine deaminase activityFold repression by H-NShns+hns205::Tn10CN1980/CN2479Wild type0.55.811.0CN2388–2/CN2588yicO-2::IS113.618.91.4CN2388–6/CN2589yicO-6::IS47.213.21.8CN2388–15/CN2590yicO-15::IS15.011.82.4(CN2349/CN2498) + pBR322Wild type0.34.313.8(CN2349/CN2498) + pAdeWild type + pAde6.983.412.0 Open ta"

These DNA glycosylases initiate repair by identifying and removing damaged bases from DNA. Monofunctional DNA glycosylases, including AAG, hydrolyze the glycosylic bond between the base and sugar to leave an abasic sugar residue in DNA. Other enzymes in the pathway remove this apurinic/apyrimidinic lesion and resynthesize DNA to complete repair. The ability of DNA glycosylases to identify and excise damaged DNA bases is key to the overall success of base excision repair. Structural studies of AAG (5Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and other DNA glycosylases have revealed that they use a nucleotide “flipping” mechanism for damaged base recognition and excision where the damaged base is flipped out of the DNA helix and bound in an enzyme active site. In these nucleotide-flipped DNA glycosylase·DNA complexes, an enzyme amino acid side chain is inserted into the base stack at the site vacated by the flipped base and may assist in nucleotide flipping by pushing the damaged base from the helix. It is believed that DNA glycosylases actively flip damaged bases out of the helix rather than passively capturing bases that have transiently adopted extrahelical conformations. This active nucleotide flipping mechanism is supported by detailed kinetic studies of Escherichia coli uracil DNA glycosylase which show a two-step binding mechanism where UDG initially binds DNA to form an unflipped protein·DNA complex prior to flipping uracil from the helix (7Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Many questions remain about how nucleotide flipping enables DNA glycosylases to discriminate between damaged and undamaged bases. For DNA glycosylases that have a narrow substrate specificity, a mechanism where a “tight fit” of the damaged base in the enzyme active site allows the DNA glycosylase to discriminate between damaged and undamaged bases seems probable. For example, UDG excises only uracil from DNA, and mutation of enzyme residues that form specific interactions with U alters the specificity of the enzyme so that it can excise C and T (8Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 9Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Alseth I. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). On the other hand, for DNA glycosylases that excise a structurally diverse group of damaged bases such as AAG, a mechanism for damaged base recognition and excision that depends solely on specific interactions between enzyme binding pocket residues and a damaged base seems unlikely. Damaged bases excised by AAG, including 3-methyladenine, 1, N6-ethenoadenine (εA), hypoxanthine (Hx), and 7-methylguanine, have no obvious structural features in common that would allow the enzyme to distinguish between damaged and undamaged bases (10Chakravarti D.

In addition, the efficiency of excision by AAG is dependent on the base pairing partner for some damaged bases (15Saparbaev M. Kleibl K. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 16Asaeda A. Ide H. Asagoshi K. Matsuyama S. Tano K. Murakami A. Takamori Y. Kubo K.

Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,6Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D.

This base pair specificity of AAG further suggests that substrate specificity is governed by a mechanism that involves more than the fit of the damaged base in the enzyme binding pocket. To define further the mechanisms of damaged base recognition and excision by AAG, the question of how nucleotide flipping contributes to the efficiency of base excision by AAG was addressed using two general approaches. First, site-directed mutations that were predicted to reduce the efficiency of nucleotide flipping were made to the DNA intercalating Tyr-162 residue of AAG. Second, hydrogen bonding interactions within the damaged base pair were removed by substitution of the nonhydrogen bonding partner, difluorotoluene (21Guckian K.M. Krugh T.R. Kool E.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Kool E.T. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), for thymine to increase the efficiency of nucleotide flipping by reducing the stability of the damaged base within the helix (Fig.1). Synthetic oligonucleotides were made on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA synthesizer using standard β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry and reagents from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE. Concentrations of purified single-stranded oligonucleotides were determined from absorbances measured at 260 nm using extinction coefficients calculated for each oligonucleotide at 260 nm (23****Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient used for εA was 5000m−1 cm−1 (extinction coefficient for 1,N6-ethenoadenosine (24Secrist III, J.A. Barrio J.R. Leonard N.J. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3499-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar)), and extinction coefficients for εA dinucleotides were estimated to be the average of mononucleotide extinction coefficients. Extinction coefficients for A and A dinucleotides were used for Hx-containing oligonucleotides. All oligonucleotides were 25 nt in length and of identical sequence (5′-GCGTCAAAATGTDGGTATTTCCATG-3′) except for the central damaged base (D). Duplex DNA substrates were made by annealing labeled oligonucleotides to an equal concentration of unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide. Annealed duplexes were typically prepared at 20 times greater concentrations than used in excision or binding assays and then diluted directly into assay mixtures without further purification. RNA was isolated from near-confluent monolayers of human foreskin fibroblast cells (American Type Culture Collection) as described by Jarman et al. (25Jarman R.G. Wagner E.K. Bloom D.C. Virology. 1999; 262: 384-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This RNA was used to prepare cDNA using the cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding AAG was amplified by PCR in reactions containing human foreskin fibroblast cDNA, 1.25 mm dNTPs, 600 ng of each primer (LD1, 5′ CGA ATT CGT GTT TGT GCC TCA TAA CAA CCC ACA 3′; LD2, 5′ CGA ATT CAA ATC TTG TCT GGG CAG GCC CTT TG 3′), and 2.5 units of Ampli-Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a total volume of 50 μl of buffer containing 1.5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.8, 16.6 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.17 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm MgCl2. Following this initial amplification, products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and PCR-amplified a second time. Products from several amplification reactions were combined, and a band corresponding to the predicted size of AAG cDNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Ends of this DNA product were filled in by T4 DNA polymerase, and the resulting blunt-ended fragment was cloned into theSmaI site of pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The identity of the clone was verified by DNA sequencing. A deletion mutant of AAG that is missing the first 79 amino acids from the N terminus (AAGΔ79) was constructed using PCR to insert an ATG start codon and amplify the region of the gene beginning at nucleotide 238 (amino acid 80). Deletion of this unconserved N-terminal region has been shown to have no effect on either base excision or DNA binding activities of the enzyme, but the truncated protein is more soluble at low ionic strength. All site-directed mutants were made in the coding sequence of this truncated gene using the Transformer Site-directed mutagenesis kit (BD PharMingen and CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The primers used to generate the desired mutations were also engineered to contain silent mutations that created restriction sites to facilitate screening of clones. The coding sequence for each AAG mutant was cloned into a pET-14b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described previously (5Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Base excision was measured using a chemical cleavage/gel assay. DNA strands containing a damaged DNA base were 5′-end-labeled with 32P and annealed to a complementary strand. Excision reactions were performed by incubating AAGΔ79 or mutants with a DNA substrate at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm DTT, and 9.5% v/v glycerol. Typical reaction mixtures contained 400–1600 nm AAGΔ79 and 50 nmduplex DNA. At several time points during the course of excision reactions, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was quenched in 0.2m NaOH (final concentration) and heated at 90 °C for 5 min to cleave DNA products containing apurinic sites. After heating, samples were diluted with 2 volumes of loading buffer consisting of 95% formamide and 20 mm EDTA. Unreacted substrates were separated from cleaved products by electrophoresis on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantitated using an AmershamBiosciences Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. DNA binding was measured in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The DNA strand containing the damaged base was 5′-end-labeled with 32P and annealed to a complementary strand containing either T or F (difluortoluene) opposite the damaged base. Labeled oligonucleotides (50 nm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of AAGΔ79 for 10 min at 4 °C, diluted with loading buffer, and loaded directly onto a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. PAGE was performed at 4 °C for 180 min at 8 V/cm. The EMSA buffer was identical to the buffer used in excision assays and contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm DTT, and 9.5% v/v glycerol. The fraction of DNA bound by AAG was quantitated using an AmershamBiosciences Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. The 298-amino acid coding sequence for AAG was amplified by PCR from cDNA made from human foreskin fibroblast cells as described under the “Experimental Procedures.” To improve yields of soluble protein when expressed in E. coli, a deletion mutant, AAGΔ79, missing the first 79 amino acids from the N terminus was constructed (5Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Deletion of this unconserved N-terminal domain does not affect the base excision activity of the enzyme (5Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 26Roy R. Biswas T. Hazra T.K. Roy G. Grabowski D.T. Izumi T. Srinivasan G. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), 2C. W. Abner and L. B. Bloom, unpublished data. and all site-directed mutations were made in the AAGΔ79 protein. Mutation of Glu-125 to Gln creates a catalytically inactive mutant (E125Q) with undetectable base excision activity but has no effect on DNA binding activity (20Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of the DNA-intercalating Tyr-162 residue to the base excision activity of AAG, Tyr-162 was converted to Ser and Phe by site-directed mutagenesis to generate two mutant proteins, Y162S and Y162F, respectively. A catalytically inactive double mutant, Y162F/E125Q, was made for DNA binding experiments. Converting the Tyr-162 residue to Ser removes the aromatic ring generating a smaller amino acid side chain that should not be able to penetrate the DNA helix as deeply when intercalated. Base excision activity for the Y162S mutant was measured in a chemical cleavage/gel assay for DNA substrates where damaged bases were located at nucleotide 13 of oligonucleotides 25 nucleotides in length. The strand containing the damage was end-labeled with 32P prior to annealing to its complementary strand to create duplexes of otherwise identical sequences that contained Hx·T and εA·T base pairs. In 60-min assays using 1600 nm Y162S and 50 nm DNA substrate, no detectable base excision was observed for either DNA substrate. We estimate that the Y162S mutant is at least 1000-fold less active than the AAGΔ79 enzyme based on this result and using the conservative assumption that 1 nm product (2% reaction) would have been detected if formed in these assays. The DNA binding activity of the Y162S mutant was measured in EMSAs with the same damaged duplexes as used in excision assays, where the damage-containing DNA strand was 5′-end-labeled with 32P. A damage-specific protein·DNA complex was not observed for the Y162S mutant with DNA substrates containing Hx or εA opposite T (Fig.2). At high Y162S concentrations in EMSAs, a general smearing of the DNA band was observed in a pattern similar to that for AAGΔ79 with undamaged DNA (not shown). This smearing may represent weaker damage-independent DNA binding. Mutation of Tyr-162 to Phe removes the hydroxyl group but leaves the aromatic ring intact to intercalate into the DNA base stack. Single turnover kinetics of excision of Hx when paired with T were measured in a chemical cleavage/gel assay for both AAGΔ79 and the Y162F mutant. Enzymes, at concentrations of 400, 800, and 1600 nm, in two separate experiments at each concentration were incubated with 50 nm32P-labeled 25-nt duplex DNA substrates at 37 °C. Aliquots of each reaction mixture were withdrawn at several time points, quenched, and analyzed by PAGE to quantitate the concentration of products formed. For each enzyme, reaction time courses were essentially the same at all three concentrations demonstrating that single-turnover conditions were met. Individual time courses were fit empirically to an exponential rise to calculate observed rates (kobs). Average values and S.D. forkobs calculated from all six experiments (two at each enzyme concentration) are shown in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Because AAG catalyzes excision of a structurally diverse group of damaged purine bases, the possibility that the Y162F mutation may have differential effects on excision of different damaged bases was tested. Kinetics of excision of the structurally dissimilar1,N6-ethenoadenine placed opposite T were measured in single turnover assays containing 400 and 800 nm enzyme. For each enzyme, observed rates were the same at both enzyme concentrations. The Y162F mutation had a smaller effect on the single turnover excision rate for εA where AAGΔ79 was 1.7-fold faster than the Y162F mutant (Table I). Mutation of the Tyr-162 residue to Phe also reduces the DNA binding activity measured in EMSAs. For EMSAs, 50 nm32P-labeled duplex DNA substrates, identical to those used in excision assays, were incubated with increasing concentrations of enzyme (10–800 nm) prior to nondenaturing PAGE analysis. Because base excision would convert DNA substrates to products during the time course of EMSAs, catalytically inactive mutants (E125Q) of AAGΔ79 and Y162F were used in these assays. The affinity of the Y162F/E125Q mutant for DNA containing a Hx·T pair is reduced relative to E125Q (Fig.3, A and B, upper panels). A concentration of 50 nmY162F/E125Q was needed to form a similar fraction of enzyme·DNA complex as seen with 20 nm E125Q. At concentrations of 400 nm enzyme, about 70% of the DNA is bound by E125Q whereas about 25% is bound by Y162F. As reported previously (20Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), E125Q binds to DNA containing an εA·T pair with greater affinity than an Hx·T pair (Fig. 3A and Fig.4A, upper panels). This is also true for the Y162F/E125Q mutant (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4B, upper panels). The Y162F/E125Q mutant binds DNA containing an εA·T pair more weakly than E125Q as it takes 20 nm Y162F/E125Q to form about the same concentration of enzyme·DNA complex as 10 nm E125Q.FIG. 4Binding of AAG Δ79 and the Y162F mutant to DNA containing εA·T and εA·F base pairs. EMSAs were done as in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 with 25-nt duplexes containing either an εA·T (upper panels) or εA·F (lower panels) pair at position 13. Increasing concentrations (10–800 nm) of E125Q (A) and the Y162F/E125Q mutant (B) were incubated with 50 nm DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether rates of excision of Hx would increase by making the base easier to displace from the helix, the T opposite Hx was replaced by difluorotoluene (F), which does not form hydrogen bonds with Hx (Fig. 1). Single turnover kinetics of excision of Hx opposite F were measured in the chemical cleavage/gel assay with 50 nm DNA and 400, 800, and 1600 nm enzyme (Table I). Excision rates were not dependent on enzyme concentration for either AAGΔ79 or Y162F. Excision activities for both AAGΔ79 and the Y162F mutant increased on the Hx·F DNA substrate relative to the Hx·T duplex (data for 400 nm enzyme are shown in Fig.5, A and B). The magnitude of the increase was greater for the Y162F mutant (3.5-fold) than for AAGΔ79 (2-fold). It is possible that the increased excision activity could be due to some effect of replacing T with F other than removing hydrogen bonding interactions. To rule out this possibility, excision was also measured for DNA substrates containing εA·T and εA·F base pairs. εA does not form Watson-Crick-type hydrogen bonding interactions with either T or F. Single turnover kinetics of excision of εA opposite F were measured in chemical cleavage/gel assays using 50 nmDNA and 400 and 800 nm enzyme in separate experiments (Table I). There was not a significant effect on excision rates of εA, as a 1.2-fold decrease in the excision rate for AAGΔ79 and a 1.1-fold increase for the Y162F mutant were observed (Fig.5C). To determine what effect substitution of T with F would have on the DNA binding activity of AAG, EMSAs were done for DNA substrates containing Hx·F and εA·F pairs. Binding assays contained 50 nm32P-labeled duplex DNA and increasing concentrations of AAG E125Q or Y162F/E125Q (10–800 nm). For both enzymes, binding was similar for DNA duplexes containing Hx·T and Hx·F pairs, and binding was slightly enhanced on duplexes containing εA·F in comparison with εA·T (Figs. 3and 4). The ability of DNA glycosylases to identify and excise damaged DNA bases is key to the overall success of base excision repair. Structural studies of AAG and other DNA glycosylases have revealed that DNA glycosylases use a base or nucleotide flipping mechanism for damaged base recognition and excision. Even though structural data for DNA glycosylases bound to damaged DNA indicate that they use a nucleotide flipping mechanism, many questions remain about how nucleotide flipping enables DNA glycosylases to discriminate between damaged and undamaged bases. This is particularly true for AAG, which is capable of excising a structurally diverse group of damaged bases including 3-methyladenine, 1, N6-ethenoadenine, hypoxanthine, and 7-methylguanine (10Chakravarti D.

A mechanism for damaged base specificity that depends solely on specific interactions between enzyme binding pocket residues and functional groups on a damaged base seems unlikely for AAG. It is possible that the substrate specificity of AAG depends at least in part on the ability of AAG to flip damaged nucleotides out of the helix. If this were true then mutations to AAG that impaired its ability to flip damaged nucleotides would decrease the efficiency of base excision by AAG and changes in a DNA substrate that decreased the stability of a damaged base in the helix would increase the efficiency of base excision. In this study, the DNA-intercalating Tyr-162 residue of AAG was converted to serine (Y162S) and phenylalanine (Y162F) by site-directed mutagenesis. A decrease in the base excision activities of both mutants was observed as expected if the Tyr-162 residue contributed to nucleotide flipping by helping to push the damaged base from the helix. Base excision and DNA binding activities of the Y162S mutant were reduced to undetectable levels for DNA substrates containing Hx·T and εA·T pairs, indicating that this mutant must be at least 1000-fold less active than AAGΔ79. The fact that DNA binding activity of the Y162S mutant was not detectable by EMSA suggests that the enzyme·DNA complex seen for AAGΔ79 is a nucleotide flipped complex. A similar mutation in UDG converting the DNA-intercalating Leu residue to Ala resulted in an 8–80-fold decrease in excision activity, and mutation of Leu to Gly reduced UDG's excision activity by a factor of 100–600 (27Handa P. Roy S. Varshney U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17324-17331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Jiang Y.L. Kwon K. Stivers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42347-42354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The comparatively large effect of the Y162S mutation on AAG's activity may reflect a greater contribution of the DNA-intercalating residue to the activity of AAG than UDG. It has been proposed that UDG uses steric compression or “pinching” of the sugar-phosphate backbone to destabilize the damaged base within the helix and assist in nucleotide flipping (29Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5214-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 30Mol C.D. Parikh S.S. Putnam C.D., Lo, T.P. Tainer J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This pinching may not make as great a contribution to the activity of AAG as AAG·DNA structures do not show the degree of backbone compression seen in UDG·DNA structures. Mutation of Tyr-162 to Phe leaves the aromatic ring to intercalate in DNA but removes the hydroxyl group from the aromatic ring. This mutation decreases the size of the DNA-intercalating residue much less than the Ser mutation but still affects the excision activity of the enzyme. Excision of Hx when paired with T by the Y162F mutant is 4 times slower than excision by AAGΔ79, and excision of εA paired with T is 1.7 times slower. Interestingly, the activity of the Y162F mutant is “rescued” on a DNA substrate where Hx is paired with F. The excision rate for the Y162F mutant increases to the rate measured for AAGΔ79 excision of Hx paired with T. It is possible that making Hx easier to flip in the context of an Hx·F pair counterbalances a deficiency in the flipping ability of the Y162F mutant. An alternative explanation for the effect of the Y162F mutation on the excision activity of AAG is that the slightly smaller Phe residue is not able to “push” the displaced base as far into the enzyme binding pocket to align it properly for catalysis. If this were true then no difference in excision rates for Hx when paired with T and F would have been seen because the Phe mutant would have “pushed” Hx the same distance in both cases. The rationale for replacing T with F in Hx base pairs was that F is isosteric with T having the same overall shape but will not form hydrogen bonds with Hx. The expectation was that the lack of hydrogen bonding will increase the ease of flipping Hx by decreasing the stability of the base pair. To rule out the possibility that F could have some other unanticipated effect on excision activity, excision of εA was measured when paired with T and F where neither pair forms hydrogen bonding interactions. Substitution of T with F had no significant effect on excision rates of εA for either AAGΔ79 or the Y162F mutant, whereas it increased the excision rate of Hx by a factor of 2 for AAGΔ79 and about 3 to 4 for the Y162F mutant. Thus, the increase in Hx excision rates is likely to be due to changes in hydrogen bonding interactions in the Hx pair. These results are consistent with a model where the ease of flipping a damaged base contributes to the base pair specificity of AAG; however, the ease of flipping is not the only criterion by which AAG selects damaged bases for excision as neither A nor G were excised when paired with F (data not shown). The kinetic mechanism for base excision by AAG is likely to contain a nucleotide flipping step in addition to the chemistry step where base excision occurs. Changing the ease of nucleotide flipping either by mutations to the enzyme or by changes to the stability of a damaged base within the helix would not affect single turnover excision rates unless nucleotide flipping were rate-limiting. The observation that substitution of T with F increases single turnover excision rates of Hx for both AAGΔ79 and the Y162F mutant suggests that nucleotide flipping is rate-limiting for Hx excision. A rate-limiting nucleotide flipping step for Hx excision would also explain the base pair specificity observed previously (16Asaeda A. Ide H. Asagoshi K. Matsuyama S. Tano K. Murakami A. Takamori Y. Kubo K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol.

Hypoxanthine is excised more slowly from a more stable Hx·C Watson-Crick type pair than an Hx·T wobble pair (31Cruse W.B.T. Aymani J. Kennard O. Brown T. Jack A.G.C. Leonard G.A.

Castro M.M. Aboul-ela F. Tinoco I.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8927-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Two explanations are possible to explain why excision of εA is not affected to a great degree by its base pairing partner. Either the nucleotide flipping step may not be rate-limiting for εA excision or nucleotide flipping may be rate-limiting but is not affected by the base pairing partner because εA lacks hydrogen bonding interactions with its partner. For UDG, the chemistry step, not the flipping step, was found to be rate-limiting for excision of uracil under single turnover conditions (7Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 34Drohat A.C. Jagadeesh J. Ferguson E. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Based on the results of this paper and previous work, we have developed a working model that explains the damaged base and base pair specificity of AAG. We propose that the specificity of base excision by AAG is governed by two important selection steps, nucleotide flipping and proper fit of the damaged base in the enzyme active site. The enzyme may use the ease of flipping a damaged base as the initial criterion for discriminating between damaged and undamaged bases and then use fit of the damaged base in the active site as a final check. The first nucleotide flipping selection step would be affected by changes in local DNA sequence or structure that affect the stability of a damaged base within the helix. Once a damaged base is flipped, it still must be aligned properly in the active site for hydrolysis of the glycosyl bond to occur. This second criterion, proper fit in the active site, would explain why Hx but not G is excised from a wobble-type base pair with T (20Abner C.W. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13379-13387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 2-amino group may prevent G from fitting in the active site properly (6Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). An implication of this two-step selection is that the overall efficiency of base excision repair may be a function of local DNA sequence and structure which affect the stability of damaged bases in the helix. A dependence of the efficiency of base excision on DNA sequence and structure could contribute to the formation of mutational “hot spots” and “cold spots.” Both AAG DNA-intercalating or pushing mutants and the difluorotoluene base pairing partner will be useful tools for testing this model further."

The type IB subfamily members bind to double-stranded DNA and can relax either positive or negative supercoils in the absence of energy cofactors or divalent cations. DNA cleavage is initiated by the nucleophilic attack of the O-4 atom of the active site tyrosine on the scissile phosphate with the resultant covalent attachment of the enzyme to the 3′ end of the broken strand. Rotation of the DNA at the site of the break relaxes any supercoiling tension followed by religation of the DNA and release of the enzyme (2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev.

Human topoisomerase I is a member of the type IB subfamily and is composed of 765 amino acids (91 kDa).

Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 14Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). To dissect the function of the core domain and explore the functional relationship between the cap and the core subdomain III, we have studied the properties of three fragments of human topoisomerase I either alone or in pairwise combinations (Fig. 1A). Topo31 (residues 175–433), a 31-kDa fragment that consists of the cap region of the protein, binds DNA well, whereas topo17 (residues 175–320), a 17-kDa fragment that mainly comprises core subdomain II (the homeodomain-like region), cannot bind DNA. The third fragment corresponds to the catalytic domain of the enzyme and contains core subdomain III, the linker region, and the COOH-terminal domain (residues 433–765), and the fragment is referred to as Δcap. Although Δcap contains all of the elements required for catalysis and can bind DNA, it is catalytically inactive. However, when topo31 and Δcap are combined, they reconstitute enzymatic activity. All of the truncation mutants were generated using standard PCR methodology. To generate topo17, pGEX-topo70 DNA (13Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was used as the PCR template, in combination with a plus-sense primer that starts at position 852 of the topoisomerase I cDNA sequence (16D'Arpa P. Machlin P.S. Ratrie III, H. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and a minus-sense primer that contained two stop codons followed by an AvrII restriction site immediately after the codon for residue 320 of the protein. The PCR products were purified and digested with NdeI and AvrII and ligated to pGEX-topo70-WT DNA that had been cleaved with the same two restriction enzymes. To generate topo31, we used the same plus-sense primer and a minus primer that contains two stop codons followed by an AvrII restriction site after the codon for residue 433 of the protein. The PCR fragment was purified and digested with SphI and AvrII and ligated to the pGEX-topo70-WT that had been cut with the same two restriction enzymes. The Δcap mutant was generated using a plus-sense primer containing aBamH1 site followed by an AUG codon that annealed upstream of residue 433 and a minus-sense primer that annealed downstream of position 2392 of the topoisomerase I cDNA sequence. The PCR fragment was purified and digested with BamH1 and NheI and ligated to pFASTBAC1 topo70 (17Yang Z. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 677-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that had been cut with the same two restriction enzymes. All of the mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. GST1-topo17 and GST-topo31 were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli TOP10F′ (Invitrogen) cells containing the pGEX-topo17 and pGEX-topo31 plasmids, respectively, as described previously for GST-topo12 (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The GST-topo17 and GST-topo31 fusion proteins were either stored bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT at 4 °C or removed from the beads with Factor Xa, followed by dialysis in storage buffer (50% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA) and storage at −20 °C. Δcap was purified from the recombinant baculovirus-infected SF-9 insect cells as described previously for topo70 (12Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 500 ng of supercoiled pBluescript KSII(+) DNA and a 2-fold serial dilution of topo31 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 pmol) either with or without 4 pmol of Δcap in 20 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 5× stop buffer (2.5% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, 25% Ficoll 40, 0.08% bromphenol blue, 0.08% xylene). The products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with a UV illuminator. The duplex oligonucleotide suicide cleavage substrate CL14/CP25 was labeled and annealed as described previously (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The suicide cleavage reactions were carried out by incubating 2 μg of topo17, topo31, or Δcap alone or in the indicated combinations in 20 μl of reaction buffer with 5 ng of the suicide cleavage substrate at 23 °C for 3 h. Topo70 (0.5 μg) was used as a positive control for suicide cleavage. 5 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer (5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.12% bromphenol blue) was added to quench the reactions. The samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the protein bands and dried before exposure to film to detect the radiolabeled proteins. Covalent complexes used as substrates for the religation reaction were generated by suicide cleavage as described previously (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Suicide cleavage was carried out in 100 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 nm labeled suicide substrate and 0.5 μm topo70 for 1 h or 2.5 μm topo31 plus 2.5 μm Δcap for 6 h at 23 °C. The suicide cleavage reaction with topo70 was stopped by adding KCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m to prevent further cleavage during religation. High salt inactivation of the reaction with the reconstituted enzyme was unnecessary owing to the slow cleavage rate, and furthermore, high salt was found to dissociate the topo31-Δcap complex (see Fig. 7). The reactions were transferred to 37 °C and preincubated for 2 min. Religation was initiated by the addition of a 300-fold molar excess of the 11-mer religation acceptor oligonucleotide (R11) that is complementary to the region downstream of the cleavage site (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 10 μl were removed at different time points (5 s, 15 s, 30 s, 2 min, 5 min, and 60 min), and the reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS. Religation was complete by the 60-min time point in both cases. Samples were ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in 10 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin and digested at 37 °C for 1 h to remove all but a short topoisomerase-derived peptide from the covalent complexes. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 20% sequencing gel. The religation product migrates as a 23-mer and is well resolved from the oligonucleotide-peptide covalent complex that migrates slower than the uncleaved oligonucleotide. The percentage of religation at each time point was quantified using a phosphorimager and the ImageQuant software. The labeling and annealing of the 25-mer duplex oligonucleotide, CL25/CP25, has been described previously (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The DNA binding assay was carried out by incubating the labeled CL25/CP25 DNA (0.5 nm) with aliquots of 2-fold serial dilutions of the indicated protein in 10 μl of reaction buffer. For topo70, topo58, topo31, and Δcap, the protein concentrations used in the assay ranged from 1 μm to 8.7 nm. For topo17 and the lysozyme control, the concentrations extended from 10 μm to 87 nm. The reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 15 min before the addition of 2.5 μl of 50% glycerol, followed by analysis on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The running buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 162 mm glycine. Due to the high pI values for the topo70 protein and the truncation fragments used here (>9.0), free protein and protein-DNA complexes migrated to the cathode and therefore only the free oligonucleotides entered the gel. The amount of unbound oligonucleotide in the gel was quantified using a phosphorimager and the ImageQuant software. The dissociation constant (Kd) was estimated from the protein concentration at which one-half of the total duplex oligonucleotide was bound to the protein (19Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out by incubating GST-topo31 (∼2.5 μm on beads) with an equal molar concentration of Δcap in the presence of 20 nm labeled suicide substrate in 45 μl of reaction buffer. The reaction was rotated at 23 °C for 2.5 h to permit suicide cleavage, and then the reaction was divided into three equal portions. The first 15-μl portion was quenched by the addition of 5 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer and used as the control for the total amount of DNA-Δcap generated in the reaction by suicide cleavage. The second 15-μl portion was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min to remove the beads, and the supernatant was added to 5 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer. The beads were washed once with 50 μl of reaction buffer and suspended in 20 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer, and both the supernatant and the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to test for the association of Δcap-DNA with GST-topo31. The third 15-μl portion was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min, and the beads were washed once with 50 μl of 1× reaction buffer, then suspended in 20 μl of 300 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and rotated at 23 °C for 5 min to elute the Δcap-DNA. The beads with the bound GST-topo31 were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant containing the Δcap-DNA was adjusted to 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 100 mm KCl. Fresh glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were added to the eluted Δcap-DNA and the mixture was rotated at 23 °C for 2.5 h to test whether Δcap-DNA associates nonspecifically with the beads. To test the effects of salt on the GST-topo31 interaction with Δcap-DNA, bead-bound covalent complexes were prepared as described previously and incubated for 5 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and KCl concentrations ranging from 100 to 400 mm. The beads were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 15 μl of 1× SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 5 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer was added to each supernatant and similarly analyzed. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and dried before exposure to film to compare the amount of labeled DNA present in the beads with the amount in the supernatant at the different salt concentrations. To generate the substrate for religation, GST-topo31 bound to beads (∼2.5 μm) was mixed with an equal molar amount of Δcap, and the mixture was incubated with 20 nm of labeled suicide substrate in reaction buffer in a total volume of 100 μl at 23 °C for 6 h to allow suicide cleavage to occur. The beads were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 100 μl of 300 mm KCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and rotated at 23 °C for 5 min to elute the Δcap-DNA from the beads. The beads were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 2 min. To eliminate all traces of GST-topo31, 5 μl of pre-equilibrated glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were added to the supernatant and rotated at 23 °C for 30 min before removal of the beads by centrifugation. This step was repeated three times. The supernatant that contains the Δcap-DNA was divided into four 25-μl aliquots prior to preparing the samples for the religation assay. 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT was added to two of the aliquots to make 75-μl reactions with a final KCl concentration of 100 mm. 3 μl of topo31 (0.7 μg/μl) was added to the first 75-μl reaction (+topo31), and an equal volume of storage buffer was added to the second 75-μl reaction (−topo31). The same procedure was used to prepare two additional reactions for religation except the KCl concentration was adjusted to 800 mm. All the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 min before religation was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of the R11 religation oligonucleotide (final concentration, 2 μm). A 10-μl aliquot was removed prior to the addition of R11 for the zero time point analyses. 10-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times and quenched by adding an equal volume of 1% SDS. All the reactions were ethanol-precipitated and digested with 10 μl of 1 mg/ml of trypsin at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were analyzed on a 20% sequencing gel and subjected to phosphorimager analysis using ImageQuant software. The various fragments of human topoisomerase I employed in this study are shown schematically in Fig. 1, panel A. Both topo17 (residues 175–320) and topo31 have the same NH2 terminus as topo70, but topo17 extends to the end of core subdomain II, whereas topo31 (residues 175–433) includes all of the cap region of the protein. The Δcap fragment corresponding to the catalytic domain begins where topo31 ends and extends through to the COOH terminus of the protein. Fusion constructs of topo17 and topo31 containing NH2-terminal GST were expressed and purified from E. coli. The fusion proteins were either used directly or the GST portion was removed by Factor Xa prior to use. Topo58 (residues 175–659) and the Δcap fragment (residues 433–765) were purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. Analysis of the purified proteins by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, panel B) showed that all four fragments were essentially homogenous. Although the Δcap fragment contains all of the amino acids that constitute the active site of the enzyme, no plasmid DNA relaxation activity was detectable in the purified fragment (Fig.2, lane 9). As expected, no relaxation activity was associated with topo31 alone (Fig. 2, lanes 2–8). However, relaxation activity could be reconstituted by the addition of topo31 to Δcap. Under these conditions (1-h incubation), activity was first detectable at approximately a 2:1 molar ratio of topo31 to Δcap, and essentially complete relaxation was achieved at a molar ratio of 4 (Fig. 2, lanes 13 and 14, respectively). A 5′ end-labeled suicide substrate that contained a 14-bp duplex with an 11 base 5′-tail (Fig. 3, top of panel B) was used to test the cleavage activity of the topoisomerase I fragments alone or in pairwise combinations. Upon cleavage and formation of the covalent complex with the 5′ end-labeled DNA, the AG dinucleotide at the 3′ end of the scissile strand is released, preventing religation. Suicide cleavage resulted in the formation of a labeled oligonucleotide-protein species that could be detected by SDS-PAGE analysis. The results showed that none of the protein fragments alone had cleavage activity and that combining topo17 with Δcap did not reconstitute cleavage activity (Fig. 3, lanes 2–5). However, the combination of topo31 with Δcap yielded a labeled protein band that migrated slightly above the Δcap protein band on the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3, panels A and B, lane 6) and that corresponded in size to a Δcap-DNA covalent complex. The amount of cleavage observed for the combination of topo31 with Δcap was less than that observed with a smaller amount of topo70 (Fig. 3, lane 7). These results confirmed that topo31 and Δcap can reconstitute topoisomerase I cleavage activity. When a suicide cleavage time course combining topo31 and Δcap was performed, cleavage reached a plateau after ∼20 h of incubation under these conditions (data not shown). Religation was studied under single turnover conditions by assaying the ability of the covalent intermediate to attach a 5′-hydroxyl-terminated 11-mer to the cleaved oligonucleotide (12-mer) to form a 23-mer product (18Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32950-32960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The first step of the reaction was carried out by incubating the suicide cleavage substrate described previously with topo70 or with the reconstituted topo31-Δcap complex to generate the corresponding covalent complexes. The religation reactions were initiated by the addition of the 11-mer acceptor oligonucleotide to the reaction mixtures. The religation assay for topo70 was carried out at 0.5m KCl to promote dissociation of the topoisomerase after strand closure and to prevent recleavage of the product. Religation by the reconstituted enzyme had to be carried out at 100 mmKCl because higher salt concentrations dissociated the topo31-Δcap complex (see below). Under these conditions the cleavage rate by the reconstituted activity was too slow to interfere with the religation measurement. The samples were treated with trypsin to remove all but a short trypsin-resistant peptide from the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes prior to analysis in a sequencing gel (Fig.4, panel A). The percentage of religated product formed at each time point was plotted for topo70 and the topo31-Δcap mixture (Fig. 4, panel B). The results indicated that the religation kinetics for the reconstituted topo31-Δcap complex and topo70 are very similar and that topo31 and Δcap can fully reconstitute the religation activity of topoisomerase I. Δcap contains all of the critical residues involved in catalysis yet it lacks enzymatic activity. This lack of catalytic activity could result from a reduced affinity of Δcap for DNA. To test this possibility a native gel mobility shift assay was used to measure the DNA binding properties of the various topoisomerase-derived fragments. Similar to topo70, topo31, topo17, and Δcap are positively charged, and because a covalently bound oligonucleotide only partially neutralizes the positive charge, the protein-DNA complexes fail to enter the native gel. Under these conditions, Kd is equal to the protein concentration at which the amount of unbound oligonucleotide observed in the gel has been reduced by a factor of 2 (19Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Lysozyme has a similar pI value and was therefore used as a negative control for DNA binding by topo31, topo17, and Δcap. The binding assays showed that the affinity of the topo17 protein for the DNA was about the same as that of the lysozyme control, indicating that the binding is relatively nonspecific (Kd of ∼5 × 10−6m) (Fig. 5, inset). Topo31 bound DNA with a Kd of ∼4 × 10−7m, whereas Δcap bound the substrate DNA with a higher affinity (∼1 × 10−7m), which is only 2-fold lower than that of topo70 (∼5 × 10−8m). These results showed that topo31 binds DNA with a somewhat reduced affinity compared with topo70 and that the absence of activity for Δcap is not due to a failure to bind DNA. Topo31 and Δcap together can reconstitute complete topoisomerase I activity, indicating that topo31 interacts with and activates Δcap either before or after the addition of DNA. However GST-topo31 bound on the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads failed to pull down a detectable quantity of Δcap after incubating the two proteins together either in the presence or absence of DNA (data not shown). This result could indicate either that the intera"

Silhavy T.J. Two Component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, a two-component system that consists of the sensor kinase EnvZ and the response regulator OmpR regulates the expression of the outer membrane porins OmpF and OmpC in response to environmental osmolarity. At low osmolarity, OmpF predominates in the outer membrane; OmpC is expressed at high osmolarity (2van Alphen W. Lugtenberg B. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 131: 623-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response to an unidentified environmental signal, the EnvZ kinase autophosphorylates at histidine 243 and transfers the phosphoryl group to aspartate 55 of OmpR (3Roberts D.L. Bennett D.W.

OmpR consists of an amino-terminal phosphorylation domain and a carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain, which are joined by a linker region (7Kato M. Aiba H. Tate S. Nishimura Y. Mizuno T.

The two domains of OmpR influence each other. Phosphorylation of OmpR at the amino-terminal aspartate 55 increases the DNA binding affinity of the carboxyl terminus (9Aiba H. Nakasai F. Mizushima S.

Conversely, the presence of specific DNA binding sites increases the steady-state amount of OmpR-P formed in vitro (13Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our laboratory is interested in determining the mechanism responsible for this interdomain communication in OmpR. The linker regions of response regulators are not highly homologous; however, they are relatively rich in glutamine, arginine, glutamate, serine, and proline residues (15Wootton J.C. Drummond M.H. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 943-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These linker regions have no predicted secondary structure. Wootton and Drummond (15Wootton J.C. Drummond M.H. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) termed these sequences Q-linkers because of the preponderance of glutamine residues. These authors suggested that the Q-linkers serve the simple role of tethering the two domains to allow functional interactions to occur. However, point mutants have been isolated in the linker region of both OmpR and the homologous regulator DmsR that disrupt protein function (17Aiba H. Kato N. Tsuzuki M. Mizuno T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Russo F.D. Slauch J.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol.

Acta. 1999; 1447: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to determine whether specific amino acids were required for interdomain communication of OmpR. In the present work, we have analyzed the effect of replacing the linker region with different amino acid sequences and found that some, but not all, linker substitutions allow OmpR-mediated transcriptional activation of the ompF and ompC genes. OmpR orthologues are very highly conserved among enteric bacteria such as Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pestis, Enterobacter cloacae, andShigella flexnerii. As such, although the linker sequences are conserved, it is impossible to determine whether this has functional significance, as the entire protein varies by only 1–8 residues. Among more divergent species such as Xenorhabdus nematophilus, Vibrio cholerae, andPseudomonas aeruginosa, it appears that a central PGAP sequence (residues 128–131 in OmpR) is more highly conserved than the rest of the linker; this is where the previously isolated point mutants are located (17Aiba H. Kato N. Tsuzuki M. Mizuno T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Russo F.D. Slauch J.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol.

Acta. 1999; 1447: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The Q-linkers of response regulators vary greatly in length as well as in sequence composition. For example, two highly homologous regulators from the same subfamily, OmpR and PhoB, have linker regions of 15 and 6 amino acid residues, respectively (20Sola M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Serrano L. Gonzalez A. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Martinez-Hackert E. Stock A.M.

An understanding of the molecular mechanism for transmitting information between the two domains will depend upon understanding the interface that connects them. As the putative interdomain interface might vary with linker length, it is useful to understand the required length of the linker region for each regulator. Here we express OmpR constructs encoding linkers of various lengths and find that alterations in linker length impair OmpR function. In our analysis of several linker mutants, it was striking that three different substitutions resulted in an OmpF+OmpC− phenotype. An examination of these OmpR mutants revealed that their porin gene expression profiles are similar, and yet they differ in their phosphorylation and DNA binding properties. Thus, there are different molecular mechanisms by which an OmpR linker mutant may present an OmpF+ OmpC− phenotype in vivo. ompR was subcloned into the Bluescript KS vector using HindIII and XbaI sites. To create some of the mutations, two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were used in a PCR reaction as described (22Mattison K. Oropeza R. Byers N. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Tran V.K. Oropeza R. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1257-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These oligonucleotides are listed in Table I as group A. The linker is defined in this case based on structural determination by x-ray crystallography (20Sola M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Serrano L. Gonzalez A. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Martinez-Hackert E. Stock A.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 109-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The linker is defined by the lack of electron density, and its edges are the first residue after the α 5 helix in the receiver (amino terminus) domain and the last residue before the β strand of the carboxyl-terminal DNA-binding domain. To create the linker substitutions, the endogenousSalI and DraI sites were removed from the pBluescript vector, and silent SalI and DraI sites were created in ompR flanking the linker region. This mutagenesis was by the same PCR reaction (22Mattison K. Oropeza R. Byers N. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Tran V.K. Oropeza R.

Oligonucleotides corresponding to new linker sequences were then synthesized, annealed, and ligated into the vector at these now uniqueSalI and DraI sites. The oligonucleotides used in this approach are listed as group C in TableI.

All of the linker mutants were subcloned into pFR29* using the XbaI and HindIII sites. pFR29* is a derivative of pFR29 from which theenvZ gene has been excised (25Russo F.D. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol.

Biol. 2002; 315: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The proteins were phosphorylated with 25 mm acetyl phosphate (OmpR and GGK) or 25 mm phosphoramidate (OmpR, G129D, and P131S) in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2) for 3 h (acetyl phosphate) or 1 h (phosphoramidate) at room temperature. The amount of OmpR-P was determined to be 74% by C4 reversed phase HPLC analysis, and GGK-P was 58% (Fig. 4C). For Fig. 4, A and B, OmpR-P, G129D-P, and P131S-P were 100%. Binding reactions were prepared, DNase I-treated, and run on gels as described (22Mattison K. Oropeza R. Byers N. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previous results indicate that the linker is important for interdomain communication in OmpR signaling (17Aiba H. Kato N. Tsuzuki M. Mizuno T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Russo F.D. Slauch J.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol.

To test this hypothesis more directly, we constructedompR mutants containing non-native amino acids in place of the endogenous linker sequence. These sequences replaced amino acids 123–137 of the ompR sequence (QANELPGAPSQEEAV) with one of the following: QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ (Q15), QGSTGSSTGSTTGST (GST), GGGKGGKGGKGGKGG (GGK′), or QKINGELVISLIVES (ELVIS). The resulting constructs were expressed in the ompF-lacZ fusion strain, MH513.101, and the ompC-lacZ fusion strain, MH225.101 (27Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,29Hall M.N. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We performed liquid β-galactosidase assays in media of low and high osmolarity to determine both the relative expression levels and the osmoregulatory profiles of the mutants. The results are presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A shows that theompF-lacZ fusion strain displays the normal osmoregulatory profile when OmpR is present, activating expression at low osmolarity and repressing expression at high osmolarity. Whereas both Q15 and GST activate expression of ompF, they fail to repress ompF transcription at high osmolarity. In contrast, like wild type OmpR, GGK′ is capable of both activating expression of ompF at low osmolarity and repressing its transcription at high osmolarity. ELVIS does not activate expression of the ompF-lacZ fusion. In Fig. 1B, results obtained in the ompC-lacZfusion strain are reported. Wild type OmpR, as well as Q15 and GST, activates expression of ompC. All three constructs demonstrate normal osmoregulatory profiles in the expression of this locus. Neither GGK nor ELVIS is capable of activating transcription from ompC. Because ompRQ15 expressed bothompF and ompC, it enabled us to examine the effect of changing the length of the linker sequence without concern for the specific amino acid residues deleted. We constructed Q15 variants that added or removed amino acids from the linker region ofompRQ15. The linker substitutions were examined in liquid β-galactosidase assays. The results are presented in Fig.2. When Q15 is substituted with a longer linker region of 20 amino acid residues (Q20), activation ofompF is greatly diminished, although the construct still expresses ompF constitutively (Fig. 2A). When OmpR contains a linker of 15 or 13 amino acids, it can activate expression of ompF to normal levels but fails to mediate repression of this locus at high osmolarity. When the linker region is shortened to 11 amino acids, some loss of activation is observed, and this construct still fails to repress ompF. With a linker length of 10 amino acids, OmpR is barely capable of ompFtranscriptional activation. Further reduction of linker length completely abolishes transcriptional activation. Interestingly, the results obtained with the ompC-lacZfusion clearly show that a decrease in transcriptional activation occurs with increasing and decreasing linker length (Fig.2B). Linkers of 20, 13, and 11 residues exhibit normal patterns of osmoregulated expression of ompC. However, deviation from the wild type length of 15 decreases the level of transcription observed. When only 10 residues separate the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of OmpR, no transcription is detected in logarithmically growing cells. Linkers of even shorter length similarly have no function. Thus, changing the length of the linker that separates the two domains of OmpR severely curtails its functionin vivo. This finding has serious implications for function (signal output) and may limit the validity of comparisons between OmpR and closely related response regulators. For example, the recently crystallized OmpR homologue DrrD from Thermotoga maritimahas a linker length of only 5 residues, and the limited interdomain interface observed may not be relevant to the structure of OmpR (30Bourret R.B. Charon N.W. Stock A.M. West A.H. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Buckler D.R. Zhou Y. Stock A.M. Structure. 2002; 10: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Kenney L.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Since two previously identified point mutants (G129D and P131S) of the OmpR linker region were OmpF+ OmpC−, it was of interest that the GGK linker substitution also resulted in this phenotype (17Aiba H. Kato N. Tsuzuki M. Mizuno T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Russo F.D. Slauch J.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To characterize the OmpF+ OmpC− phenotype observed in OmpR mutants with a defective linker, we expressed and purified OmpRG129D, OmpRP131S, and OmpRGGK for in vitro analysis. We hypothesized that the OmpC− phenotype associated with substitutions in the linker resulted from a defect in interdomain communication, and thus it was of interest to compare the effects of DNA binding on phosphorylation and vice versa. We performed kinase assays to determine whether phosphotransfer from the EnvZ kinase to the linker mutants was similar to wild type OmpR. Fig. 3 shows the results of this experiment. In Fig. 3a, it is apparent that wild type OmpR is phosphorylated upon incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and EnvZ (lanes 1–3). The phosphorylated EnvZ is turned over as OmpR is phosphorylated and OmpR-P is dephosphorylated. Upon the addition of a 2-fold molar excess of the high affinity OmpR binding site from the ompF promoter (F1), slightly more OmpR-P is visible (lanes 4–6). In Fig. 3b, P131S is phosphorylated (lanes 1–3), similar to the wild type OmpR (Fig. 3a). The addition of F1 DNA in this case only slightly increases the amount of P131S-P. G129D is also phosphorylated by EnvZ-P (Fig. 3c, lanes 1–3), and in this case, the addition of DNA does not affect the phosphoprotein levels (lanes 4–6). GGK is phosphorylated by EnvZ-P (Fig. 3d, lanes 1–3), but the addition of DNA has a remarkable effect on the level of GGK-P (lanes 4–6), as GGK-P decreases over time in the phosphorylation reaction when DNA is present. In summary, all three linker mutants are phosphorylated by EnvZ-P, but the effect of DNA on the GGK linker substitution is dramatic, causing an increase in turnover of GGK-P (24Mattison K. Kenney L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11143-11148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In vitro, the EnvZ kinase capable is of phosphorylating both OmpR and dephosphorylating OmpR-P. When EnvZ is the phosphodonor, the observed increase in OmpR-P formation upon the addition of DNA is due to a decrease in the phosphatase activity of EnvZ (14Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mattison K. Kenney L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11143-11148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We can quantify the effect of DNA on the phosphatase activity of EnvZ, using an assay that detects the release of Pi (33Kenney L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of OmpR, EnvZ, and ATP there is a large increase in Pi production over time. The average rate of Pirelease in the presence of OmpR is 7.1 nmol/ml/min (Fig.4A, filled triangles). The P131S mutant possesses a net ATPase activity (Pi release) of 6.6 nmol/ml/min, close to the level observed with wild type OmpR (Fig. 4A, filled circles). When G129D is incubated with EnvZ and ATP, there is a low rate of Pi production, 1.0 nmol/ml/min (Fig.4A, open squares). In the presence of GGK, Pi production is barely above background (0.3 nmol/ml/min, Fig. 4A, open diamonds). When specific DNA such as the region upstream of the ompCpromoter (C1-C2-C3) is included in the ATPase reaction, the level of OmpR-stimulated ATPase activity decreases dramatically, falling to 0.3 nmol/ml/min (Fig. 4B, filled triangles). None of the linker mutants follows this pattern. The ATPase activity in the presence of P131S does not decrease substantially in the presence of C1-C2-C3 (4.1 nmol/ml/min, only a 2-fold decrease) (Fig. 4B, filled circles). The Pi release stimulated by G129D is also not affected by the presence of DNA, decreasing ∼1.5-fold to 0.7 nmol/ml/min (Fig. 4B, open squares). These differences are small when compared with the ∼20-fold reduction in phosphate turnover seen with wild type OmpR (Compare filled triangles in Fig. 4, A andB). Both P131S and G129D are known to bind DNA (see below), and yet DNA binding does not increase the stability of the mutant phosphoproteins as it does for wild type OmpR-P (Comparecircles or triangles in Fig. 4, A andB). When specific DNA is included in the GGK reaction, a large increase in Pi production is observed (Fig. 4B, diamonds). This is the opposite of the effect of DNA on wild type OmpR. GGK also binds DNA, as shown in the footprinting assay below. The interaction of GGK with DNA decreases the stability of GGK-P; this effect is diametrically opposed to that observed for OmpR (24Mattison K. Kenney L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11143-11148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We characterized the DNA binding ability of all three of the linker mutants using a DNase I footprinting assay. We observed that all three of the mutants were capable of protecting the ompF promoter to the same extent as wild type OmpR, as expected by their OmpF+ phenotypes. Therefore, only the ompCbinding data are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5, A–C, reveals that the three linker mutants have different DNA binding properties at the ompC promoter region. Both OmpR-P and P131S-P are capable of protecting theompC promoter sequences from −104 to −40 as shown in Fig.5A. With the G129D point mutant, a different pattern of protection is observed (Fig. 5B). Whereas OmpR-P is capable of protecting the entire ompC upstream region from −104 to −40, G129D-P binds only at the high affinity C1 site, from −104 to −75. Even at protein concentrations up to 2 μm G129D-P, no binding is evident at the C2 or C3 regions. As observed with the point mutant G129D-P, the substituted linker mutant GGK-P binds only to the high affinity C1 region (Fig.5C). It seems likely that the OmpC− phenotypes of two of the linker mutants (G129D and GGK) are due to a DNA binding defect at the −35 proximal regions of the promoter (sites C2 and C3). The P131S point mutant may be incapable of interacting productively with RNA polymerase to initiate transcription because it can bind to the entire ompC promoter region but does not activate transcription from this locus. Thus, the underlying defects in G129D and GGK are distinct from that of P131S, and yet they all give rise to an OmpF+ OmpC− phenotype (see “Discussion”). We chose to use Q15 as a basis for our studies of OmpR linker length to eliminate concerns that specific amino acid residues were being added or deleted. We discovered that a linker of 13–15 amino acid residues is optimal for OmpR function, with shorter linkers gradually decreasing the ability of the protein to activate transcription of the porin genes (Fig. 2). This finding has important implications for the likelihood of a similarity in the activation mechanisms of closely related response regulators. One OmpR family member, PhoB, which shares a high degree of sequence homology with OmpR, has a linker of only 6 amino acid residues (34Blanco A.G. Sola M. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Coll M. Structure. 2002; 10: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Chimeric protein studies with CheY/PhoB have shown that α-helix 5 in the amino terminus of PhoB inhibits transcriptional activation by the carboxyl terminus; inhibition is relieved when the amino terminus is phosphorylated (35Allen M.P. Zumbrennen K.B. McCleary W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This is unlike the signal propagation mechanism that controls OmpR signaling. Both the amino and carboxyl termini of OmpR are necessary for its function, and neither domain is inhibitory (36Tsuzuki M. Aiba H. Mizuno T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly, although the FixJ family members UhpA and NarL share high sequence similarity, the carboxyl terminus of NarL is inhibited by its amino terminus, whereas that of UhpA is not (37Baikalov I. Schroder I. Kaczor-Grzeskowiak M. Grzeskowiak K. Gunsalus R.P. Dickerson R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11053-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 38Webber C.A. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NarL has a short interdomain linker of 6 amino acid residues, and the linker of UhpA is 16 residues long (38Webber C.A. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, even within the FixJ family of response regulators to which UhpA and NarL belong, there is a correlation between linker length and functional differences in the activation mechanism. In any attempt to predict functional homology based on sequence analysis, it may be useful to consider the length of the interdomain linker as well as the respective domain architectures. An additional point worth noting is that longer linker sequence also reduced transcriptional activation by OmpR. Thus, a functional OmpR linker must be 13–15 amino acid residues in length. Because a linker of 20 amino acid residues should provide a similar increase in local concentration of the amino and carboxyl termini as a linker of 15 amino acid residues, it seems likely that the linker of OmpR plays some active role in directing the appropriate interaction between the two domains (13Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 39Buckler D.R. Anand G.S. Stock A.M.

Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 155-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Evidence supporting this view comes from our studies of limited proteolysis with trypsin, in which we found that cleavage sites in the linker were sensitive to both phosphorylation and DNA binding in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, respectively (13Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 41Kenney L.J. Bauer M.D. Silhavy T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8866-8870Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Four different linker sequences were used to examine whether the sequence of the linker region was important for OmpR function. Of these, only the ELVIS linker did not activate transcription (Fig. 1), suggesting that the linker region may require flexibility and hydrophilicity to allow appropriate interactions between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of OmpR. In contrast to the other substitutions, GGK′ activates transcription from one locus (ompF+) and not the other (ompC−). GGK′ is also the only construct that mediates repression of ompF expression at high osmolarity. The GGK linker is expected to be flexible, which may improve its ability to activate transcription over that of the ELVIS construct. The five positively charged residues concentrated in the linker region of GGK may allow OmpR to more readily adopt a conformation that repressesompF transcription at high osmolarity than one that allows expression of ompC (see Fig.6). Q15 and GST both contain hydrophilic residues and are predicted to be flexible. Thus, hydrophilicity and flexibility, as well as the length requirement mentioned above, seem to be important requirements for OmpR linker function. We have shown that OmpR can retain its basic function of transcriptional activation at the ompF and ompCpromoters when the endogenous amino acid sequence of the linker is altered (Table I and Fig. 1). However, there are subtleties in porin gene regulation that are not maintained in the mutants with substituted linkers, as none of the constructs tested displayed wild type osmoregulatory profiles (Fig. 1, A and B). With both OmpRQ15 and OmpRGST, the ability to repress transcription ofompF at high osmolarity was lost (Fig. 1A). Note that this does not result from constitutive expression of both porin genes, as osmoregulation of ompC is normal in these assays (Fig. 1B). We present a model in Fig. 6 that incorporates these findings. We propose that unphosphorylated OmpR does not play a role in the osmoregulation of porin genes, because it interacts with the promoter regions with low affinity (10Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). At low osmolarity, OmpR-P exists in a conformation that activates expression of ompF but binds only at the high affinity C1 site and as such fails to activate transcription from the ompC promoter (Fig. 6A, circles). At high osmolarity, wild type OmpR-P is capable of adopting a conformation that represses transcription ofompF (Fig. 6B, squares) or one that allows binding at the downstream sites of the ompC promoter and activation of ompC expression (Fig. 6B, triangles). The model predicts that two different conformations of OmpR-P co-exist in the cell at high osmolarity, one of which represses ompF and another that activatesompC. The DNA binding sites at the ompF andompC promoter regions may induce these alternate conformational changes. We can explain the phenotypes of the linker mutants using this model (Fig. 6C). GGK-P is capable of activating and repressing ompF but is unable to undergo the conformational change that would allow binding at the C2 and C3 sites of the ompC promoter. Q15-P and GST-P are capable of activating transcription from both ompF and ompCbut cannot access the conformation that would direct repression loop formation and repress transcription at ompF. The three linker mutants described in the present work share an OmpF+OmpC− porin profile but have different molecular defects. G129D and GGK fail to bind the promoter-proximal C2 and C3 sites of theompC promoter region, and this explains their failure to activate transcription from ompC (Fig. 5). However, a closer examination of mutant phosphorylation properties indicates that although the mutants have similar DNA binding properties, the G129D and GGK substitutions have altered the protein in different ways. The G129D substitution appears to have only quantitatively altered the effect of DNA on the stability of the phosphoprotein (Figs. 3 and 4). GGK, however, has a dramatic phenotype (24Mattison K. Kenney L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11143-11148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results obtained with GGK in assays of phosphotransfer and Pi release are diametrically opposed to those seen with wild type OmpR. P131S can protect the same sites at ompC to which OmpR binds, indicating that this residue change most likely interferes with the ability of the P131S protein to contact RNA polymerase, as suggested by previous studies (Figs. 4B and 5) (17Aiba H. Kato N. Tsuzuki M. Mizuno T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have thus examined the molecular phenotypes of three OmpR linker mutants with the same porin profiles and found that no two behave in the same way. This result, together with the possibilities for conformational changes in OmpR-P revealed by the linker substitutions and depicted schematically in Fig. 6, underscores the sophisticated mechanism by which OmpR and EnvZ control the osmoregulation of porin gene expression.

To define whether this event plays a functional role in cell differentiation, we used anin vitro model system that allows chick chondrogenic cells to remain undifferentiated when cultured in monolayer and to differentiate into chondrocytes when grown in suspension culture. We report that: (i) upon over-expression of the human α6B, adherent chondrogenic cells differentiate to stage I chondrocytes (i.e. increased type II collagen, reduced type I collagen, fibronectin, α5β1 and growth rate, loss of fibroblast morphology); (ii) the expression of type II collagen requires the activation of p38 MAP kinase; (iii) the over-expression of α6A induces an incomplete differentiation to stage I chondrocytes, whereas no differentiation was observed in α5 and mock-transfected control cells; (iv) a prevalence of the α6A subunit is necessary to stabilize the differentiated phenotype when cells are transferred to suspension culture. Altogether, these results indicate a functional role for the α6B to α6A switch in chondrocyte differentiation; the former promotes chondrocyte differentiation, and the latter is necessary in stabilizing the differentiated phenotype.

Following cell condensation, chondrogenic cells that produce type I collagen, fibronectin (FN), and its integrin receptor α5β1, differentiate to stage I chondrocytes that express type II collagen and eventually to stage II hypertrophic chondrocytes, characterized by type II and X collagen production (12Cancedda R. Descalzi Cancedda F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 159: 265-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).

These cells, which adhere to tissue culture dishes and display a fibroblast-like phenotype (pre-chondrogenic cells), proliferate and secrete type I collagen and FN. When transferred to suspension culture, the cells rapidly aggregate and secrete type II collagen and other stage I chondrocyte-specific ECM molecules (12Cancedda R. Descalzi Cancedda F. Castagnola P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 159: 265-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In addition, differentiation is associated with: (i) down-regulation of type I collagen, FN, and its receptor, α5β1integrin; (ii) switch from the α6B to the α6A isoform of the integrin α6β1 receptor for laminin (LN); (iii) reduced growth rate; and (iv) acquisition of a cobblestone morphology when re-plated in monolayer culture (12Cancedda R.

The family of MAP kinases comprises several subtypes, including ERK-1 and -2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase), and p38. Each kinase subtype is activated by similar, but distinct, upstream kinases. Extracellular stimuli appear to activate either single or multiple MAP kinase pathways (46Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr.

Here we have studied the role of the α6B to α6A switch, at the onset of chondrocyte differentiation, by over-expressing α6A and α6B integrin subunits in chondrogenic cells derived from chick embryo tibiae. We have evaluated the effect on the expression of several differentiation markers (cell morphology, growth rate, collagen expression pattern) in cells grown under culture conditions that are either permissive or nonpermissive for chondrocyte differentiation, i.e. cells cultured in suspension or in monolayers. Our results indicate a functional role for α6Bβ1 in the induction of chondrocyte differentiation and for α6Aβ1 in its progression. Furthermore, we suggest that these events depend on p38 MAP kinase activity. The following antibodies to integrin subunits were used: mouse monoclonal (mAb) BQ16 to human α6 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); mouse mAb P1D6 to human α5 (Dako), mouse mAb V2E9 to avian β1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to avian α2, α3, and α5 raised against their C-terminal regions (a gift from Prof. G. Tarone, Torino, Italy). The following antibodies to matrix proteins were used: mouse mAb B3/D6 to avian fibronectin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank); rabbit polyclonal antibodies to chick type I and type II collagens (52Descalzi Cancedda F.

Primary cultures of chondrocytes were isolated from chick embryo tibiae developed in virus-free eggs (Lohmann GMBH, Cuxhaven, Germany) at stages 28–30 (53Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 195: 231-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar) as described previously (34Tacchetti C. Quarto R. Campanile G. Cancedda R. Dev.

Briefly, embryo tibiae were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and digested with 400 units/ml collagenase I and 0.25% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C to remove the perichondrium, including the putative perichondral ossification sleeve. The tissue debris was removed by centrifugation and the pellet digested for an additional 45 min at 37 °C with the above mixture supplemented with 1000 units/ml collagenase II. Released chondrocytes were pooled, harvested by low speed centrifugation, and resuspended in culture medium (35Castagnola P. Moro G. Descalzi-Cancedda F. Cancedda R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2310-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in monolayer culture in Coon's modified F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 2 mml-glutamine. The medium was changed every other day, and confluent cells were split at a ratio of 1:3. After 12 days, cells were transfected with the appropriate vector and then cultured in monolayer for a maximum of 15–17 days. When required, the transfected cells were released by trypsin treatment and transferred to anchorage-independent conditions on a 1% agarose layer (35Castagnola P. Moro G. Descalzi-Cancedda F.

The human wild type α5 (3147 bp) cDNA, cloned in the pECE vector, was a kind gift from Dr. E. Ruoslahti (Cancer Research Center, The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). The full-length cDNA was isolated by digestion with SalI and XbaI and, after Klenow treatment, inserted in-frame into the retroviral vector linearized with EcoRV. All constructs were checked by nucleotide sequencing using the ABI PRISMTM DNA sequencing kits (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following sequencing primers were used: the upstream oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGGGAGCCGGACGCCAG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCGAGGGTTCCCTG-3′ and the downstream oligonucleotides 5′-CCCGGGGGCCCCGAGAGTAC-3′ and 5′-GGCATCAGAGGTGGCTGG-3′ for the human α5 integrin; the upstream oligonucleotides 5′-TTCAACTTGGACACTCGG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGGTTATGGAACAGCAC-3′ and the downstream oligonucleotides 5′-GTAGACATACACTGCACCTCC-3′ and 5′-CAATTACAGAAGTAGATC-3′ for the human α6A isoform; and 5′-GTAGACATACACTGCACCTCC-3′ and 5′-TGAGTAGCTTTCATTTCTG-3′ for the human α6B integrin isoform.

The empty pSFCV-LE vector or, alternatively, the vector containing the full-length human cDNA of either α5, α6A, or α6B, was transfected into avian chondrogenic cells using polybrene and Me2SO. 24 h before transfection, 8 × 105-1 × 106 chondrogenic cells were seeded in culture dishes. After 24 h, cells were rinsed with PBS and resuspended in 3 ml of F-12 medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, and 30 μg of polybrene. Ten μg of circular plasmid DNA were admixed with the cells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h with occasional agitation. Cells were then incubated at room temperature with fresh medium and 30% Me2SO for 4 min, washed twice with PBS, and covered with complete medium (Coon's modified F-12). Neomycin-resistant cells were isolated by use of a selection medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for 1 week. When indicated, cells were transferred to suspension culture at day 10 of adherent culture to promote their differentiation. Using this method, we obtained a much higher transfection efficiency than with other protocols tested (not shown). For flow cytometric analyses, transfected cells were harvested with 2 mm EDTA in PBS, washed once in PBS, and counted. 1 × 105 cells were incubated with either a monoclonal antibody against human α6 (mAb-BQ16, diluted 1:20) or with a monoclonal antibody against human α5 (mAb-PID6, diluted 1:20) for 20 min on ice. Cells were washed and incubated with a donkey anti-mouse FITC-conjugated antibody (diluted 1:100) for 20 min on ice. Finally, samples were washed twice in PBS and analyzed in a FACScan using the CellQuest software (FACScalibur, BD PharMingen). This analysis was performed on every new batch of transfected cells. For the flow cytometric analysis of the endogenous levels of avian integrin subunits α2 or α3, transfected cells were permeabilized with PBS, 0.1% saponin for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with antibodies to α2 (1:20) or α3 (1:5) diluted in PBS, 0.1% saponin and processed as described above. As a negative control, transfected cells were incubated with the secondary antibody alone. Each analysis was performed twice on two different batches of transfected cells. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed routinely on each new batch of transfected cells. At day 7 after transfection (end of the selection period), cells were seeded on 10-mm glass coverslips and grown adherent for 2 days. Coverslips were washed once with PBS and fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, rinsed in PBS, incubated with 30 mm NH4Cl, and permeabilized with PBS, 0.1% saponin. Cells were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies to detect the presence of type I collagen (1:400), type II collagen (1:300), fibronectin (1:100), or laminin-1 (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, cells were incubated with the suitable secondary antibodies, i.e. anti-rabbit CyTM3 conjugate (1:200), or anti-mouse FITC conjugate (1:100). All antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.1% saponin. Nuclear staining was revealed by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:200, Sigma). Coverslips were mounted using Moviol. To determine the number of human α5 and α6 expressing cells at early time points after transfection (day 2 and day 4), cells were immunostained with primary antibodies to either human α6 (1:50) or human α5 (1:25) and processed as described above. Analyses were performed with an epifluorescence inverted microscope (Olympus Optical Co.); images stored using a chilled Hamamatsu CCD black and white camera and processed with IP-LAB and Adobe Photoshop software. Ten epifluorescence microscope fields, obtained using a 40× lens, were collected for each sample. Cells were seeded on 10-mm glass coverslips, transfected, and grown in the presence or absence of 10 μm p38 inhibitor, SB203580, as described below. After 2 and 4 days, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde at 4 °C, washed several times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. After several washes with PBS, apoptosis was determined using the TUNEL method (TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min with equilibration buffer followed by a 1 h-incubation at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with TdT diluted in the reaction buffer. The TdT reaction was stopped with 2× SSC for 15 min at room temperature, and cells were washed with PBS and deionized water. Coverslips were mounted in Moviol, and apoptosis was assessed and quantified by nuclear staining observed with an epifluorescence inverted microscope. Ten fields, obtained using the 40× lens, were counted for each sample. Cells, cultured either in monolayer or in suspension, were starved for 2 h at 37 °C in serum and methionine-free F-12 medium containing 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid. The medium was then supplemented with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 37 °C. The culture medium was harvested and clarified by low speed centrifugation. To evaluate type X collagen secretion, aliquots containing 4 × 105 cpm of labeled medium were dialyzed against 0.5 n acetic acid for 24 h at 4 °C, and proteins were digested with 100 μg of pepsin at 4 °C for 12–15 h. The digested proteins were lyophilized, dissolved in Laemmli reducing buffer, and separated by a 12.5% SDS-PAGE (57Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography with HyperfilmTM MP (Amersham Biosciences). To analyze the levels of secreted fibronectin in dedifferentiated chondrocytes, aliquots of labeled medium containing 4 × 105 cpm were immunoprecipitated with the B3/D6 antibody in the presence of the FN carrier (5 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 12 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose, washing the beads four times with IPP buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS) containing the protease inhibitors (2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 mm leupeptin, 2 mm pepstatin). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE (57Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions and detected by autoradiography with HyperfilmTM MP (Amersham Biosciences). Cells obtained after different times of culture under adherent or suspension conditions were pooled, washed with PBS, lysed for 1 h in ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 2 mm PMSF and 2% aprotinin as proteinase inhibitors, and centrifuged. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford dye colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Samples containing 50–100 μg of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by immunostaining. Membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in TBS, 0.05% Tween for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with antibodies to type I (1:500) or type II (1:250) collagen diluted in TBS, 0.05% Tween, 3% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. HRP-conjugated swine anti-rabbit Ig (Dako) diluted at 1:2000 was used for detection. Reactivity was evaluated using a chemiluminescence emission assay (ECL,Amersham Biosciences). The activity of p38 was determined by an immunocomplex kinase assay. Cell lysates from transfected cells were cultured in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm). The culture medium, containing SB203580, was changed every 12 h. Cells were collected on days 2 and 4 after transfection (e.g. during the selection period). Experiments were performed in parallel, with cells treated with the same amount of Me2SO used to dilute the SB203580 inhibitor. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford dye colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Samples containing 200 μg of total cell extract were precipitated with immobilized phospho-p38 MAP kinase monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, New England Biolabs) and incubated with rotating overnight at 4 °C. After two rinses with lysis buffer and kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2), beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer followed by boiling. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, by probing the membranes with the phospho-ATF-2 antibody diluted 1:1000 overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected as described above. Furthermore, samples containing 200 μg of total cell extract were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies to either actin or p38 and type II collagen. The reaction was developed using the ECL luminescence reagent. Confluent chondrocytes at day 10 after transfection were starved in serum-free F12-medium for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed five times with ice-cold buffer A (1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm MgS04 × 7 H20, 5 mmKCl, 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and incubated twice for 15 min at 4 °C with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in buffer A.

Finally, asymmetric G·T templates with a remote nick and a nearby DNA end were repaired efficiently. mismatch repair double strand DNA single strand DNA The known contributions of the human DNA mismatch repair (MMR)1 pathway to genomic stability have expanded greatly over the past decade (1Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 2Jiricny J. Nystrom-Lahti M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 3Hsieh P. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A clear relationship between the loss of a functional DNA MMR pathway and tumor formation in both hereditary and sporadic settings has emerged (1Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 2Jiricny J. Nystrom-Lahti M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Loss of one of the protein activities essential for mismatch correction results in a mutator phenotype, in which mononucleotide repeats within coding sequences of genes that contribute to growth suppression or apoptosis represent important mutational hot spots. In addition to its role in repairing biosynthetic errors, the MMR pathway plays an oversight role in DNA recombination events, limiting nonhomologous strand exchange (4Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 5Evans E. Alani E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7839-7844Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Lesion recognition and processing have also been implicated in apoptotic events mediated by p53 and p73, although the specific sequence of events subsequent to lesion recognition is not well defined (for review, see Ref. 6Karran P. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1931-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Two commonly cited models are the futile repair model, in which attempted repair events target the strand without the lesion, and the direct signaling model, in which assembly of the MMR machinery at the lesion initiates the apoptotic cascade. The precise mechanism by which mismatch recognition results in strand excision and resynthesis remains unresolved (1Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 3Hsieh P. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Jiricny J. Mutat. Res. 1998; 409: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This is especially true for the events subsequent to mismatch recognition, including the identification of the strand discrimination mechanism. One model posits that mismatches are bound by the MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer (MutSα), followed by an ATP-dependent, bidirectional translocation along the DNA to identify a strand discrimination signal and orchestrate downstream events (8Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A more recent analysis suggests that MutSα and MutLα (MLH1/PMS2) together form a complex capable of translocating along the DNA helix (9Blackwell L.J. Wang S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33233-33240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A second model suggests that MSH2/MSH6 is an activity analogous to a G protein, recognizing mismatches when an ADP molecule is bound (10Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 11Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Exchange of ADP for ATP in the ternary complex results in a hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp that allows diffusion along the DNA, again presumably to initiate later events in the repair pathway. In a very different formulation, it has also been argued that mismatch-binding proteins, in the presence of a heterodimer of MutL homologs and ATP, remain at the mismatch site (3Hsieh P. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This model was formulated using prokaryotic proteins and proposes a role for ATP in mismatch verification (12Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which appears to be inconsistent with the two models cited above. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen is also known to participate in the early stages of mismatch correction (13Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), most recently as a modulator of mismatch recognition (14Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and by its ability to disrupt the complex of MutS and MutL homologs from the mismatch site in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15Bowers J. Tran P.T. Joshi A. Liskay R.M. Alani E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 957-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast to the diverse efforts directed toward understanding how the protein components interact to effect mismatch correction, the known DNA template requirements for human MMR are few. A successful template for in vitro assays can be summarized as a circular molecule containing a mismatch and nick positioned from 100 to 1,000 bp away in either DNA strand (16Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 17Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where repair efficiency is diminished as the distance separating the two sites is increased (18Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nick is essential for targeting repair to the strand where it resides (16Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 17Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 10156-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), although the ultimate strand signal in human cells (or any organism outside a small number of related Gram-negative prokaryotes) remains unknown. Recent biochemical analyses suggest that mismatch processing in human cell extracts operates independently of the CpG methylation status on the template, whether it is fully, hemi-, or unmethylated (20Drummond J.T. Bellacosa A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2234-2243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; for an analysis using Xenopus laevis extracts, see Ref. 21Petranovic M. Vlahovic K. Zahradka D. Dzidic S. Radman M. Neoplasma. 2000; 47: 375-381PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that a nick was sufficient to act as a strand signal was drawn from the better characterized Escherichia colimodel system (3Hsieh P. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In this organism, a site-specific DNA nick represents an intermediate in mismatch correction (23Lahue R.S., Su, S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The action of MutH protein on a hemimethylated GATC sequence introduces a strand-specific nick, and this reaction is largely dependent upon the presence of a nearby mismatch (25Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of a nick eliminates the need for MutH activity in a reconstituted assay system (24Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In parallel with the bidirectional capability of mismatch correction in E. coli (26Cooper D.L. Lahue R.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11823-11829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), extracts from human cells can access a single strand nick placed in either strand and in either orientation with respect to the mismatch (18Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mismatch processing appears to function equally well when exonucleolytic removal of the mismatch occurs 5′ → 3′ or 3′ → 5′. Although a nick may act as a strand discrimination device in vitro, its relationship with the authentic strand signal in vivo remains unclear. Strand discontinuities, including nicks, are present during replication, but they are much more frequent in lagging strand biosynthesis. Another potential means of identifying the daughter strand is via the DNA end where strand elongation occurs, even though it is sequestered by the replicative polymerase. This possibility is supported by the fact that proliferating cell nuclear antigen participates in an early step in mismatch correction, prior to resynthesis, and it has been shown to interact directly with mismatch recognition proteins (13Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 27Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Models for strand discrimination which invoke the site of DNA synthesis are superficially inconsistent with nick-directed repair because displacement of the replicative polymerase to allow access to the MMR machinery is likely to reveal a DNA end (3′-OH) within a gap rather than a nick. Restated, the ability to identify and access a nick does not represent the same capability as accessing the active site of replication. In this work, we assessed the contribution of two major features of the DNA template upon which the human MMR pathway acts. First, we asked whether strand discontinuities beyond a single strand nick are competent to target mismatch correction. Heteroduplexes containing a single G·T mismatch and a site- and size-specific single strand gap, positioned in either orientation (5′ → 3′ or 3′ → 5′ from the discontinuity to the mismatch) were assayed using nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells. The gap sizes chosen were intended to represent those that might arise from specific DNA repair or synthesis events and would plausibly represent targets for the human DNA polymerases α, β, δ, or ε. Nicks and gaps of 4–210 nucleotides were found to be effective strand signals, and intermediate sized gaps were the most efficient in either orientation. Second, we asked whether DNA ends were competent to direct MMR, and we found that neither blunt ends nor small overhangs supported mismatch correction targeted to either strand. MMR was supported efficiently on linear templates, and we used this result to ask systematically whether DNA ends limited mismatch correction as they were moved close to either the strand signal or mismatch. In this way, we were able to define some of the spatial and structural relationships required for efficient mismatch correction in vitro. Manipulation of M13mp18 bacteriophage and its derivatives was performed using standard methodology for culturing filamentous phage (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) using the XL-1 Blue strain of E. coli(Stratagene). Similarly, all DNA manipulation steps such as precipitation, digestion, and ligation were carried out using standard methodology (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Before introducing a site competent for mismatch construction, the unique HindIII site was eliminated from M13mp18. A sample of the DNA was digested with HindIII, the overhanging ends filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and the molecule was recircularized using a blunt end ligation. The original HindIII site was thus replaced with an NheI site, giving a molecule we called M13ΔH. An oligonucleotide duplex containing a G·T mismatch was designed to replace the sequence intervening between the M13ΔH KasI and AvaII sites and generate two progeny phages for substrate construction. The sequence, described below, included a mismatch embedded within overlapping restriction sites to facilitate strand-specific identification of MMR in the final substrates (29; see Fig. 1). After digestion with AvaII and KasI, removal of the putative intervening fragment, and ligation in the presence of the replacement heteroduplex, transformation yielded single plaques that were sequenced across the targeted region. It became apparent that the KasI digestion failed, and a cryptic but useful ligation reaction occurred. Plaques were isolated in which theAvaII site was reconstituted correctly, but theKasI overhang was trimmed from the oligonucleotide and ligated to the second AvaII overhang, which was apparently also converted to a blunt end by replicative filling in vivo. Two of the recovered plaques had sequences across the modified region which read 5′-GGACCTAGGCAAGCT(T/C)TCGAGTCTGACC. The sequence in bold represents the parent M13ΔH sequence after oligonucleotide incorporation (plain text) into the AvaII site (5′-GGACC), and the bases in italics represent the filled-in overhang. The double strand form of M13ΔH clone 4 was sensitive toXhoI (C), whereas M13ΔH clone 7 was sensitive toHindIII (T). Both included an additional StyI site (CCTAGG) located adjacent to the mismatch site to facilitate template remodeling. To construct G·T heteroduplexes with 5′-strand discontinuities, large scale preparations of both double (ds) and single strand (ss) DNA were performed such that clone 4 was used as the double strand species and clone 7 as the single strand species. Because the heteroduplex region was introduced at the AvaII site of M13ΔH, such constructs place the mismatch 329 bp from the EcoRI site and a rich source of other nearby unique digestion sites useful for the construction of gapped regions. The DNA sequence reads 5′ → 3′ from nick or gap toward the mismatch. Repair directed by the nick or gaps is therefore scored with HindIII, whereas mismatch correction in the continuous strand is identified with XhoI (16Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar,29Su S.S. Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct comparable phages useful for preparing 3′-nicked or gapped substrates, a 394-bp segment containing the mismatch region and polycloning site of M13 was excised and inverted. The fragment was first digested with NheI and StyI, which recognize distinct sequences but yield complementary overhanging ends upon digestion. The fragment was reinstalled in situ by adding a 1/10 volume of 10× ligase buffer (New England Biolabs) and 80 units of T4 DNA ligase, then incubating for 24 h at 22 °C in the presence of NheI and StyI. The presence of these activities selects against regeneration of the parent phage. The reaction was transformed into XL1-Blue cells, and the resulting plaques were screened for loss of StyI and NheI sensitivity. Two selected phages, designated 4F (XhoI site) and 7F (HindIII site), were sequenced through the targeted region to demonstrate sequence inversion between the StyI and NheI sites. For construction of 3′-substrates, clone 4F was used to prepare the single strand species, and DNA derived from clone 7F was used to amplify the double strand species. The substrate preparation protocol described below results in the production of G·T heteroduplexes wherein the DNA sequence intervening between the mismatch and strand discontinuity is preserved compared with the 5′-substrates. Mismatch removal and resynthesis events that are nick- or gap-directed now yield products that are sensitive to XhoI, whereas mismatch correction in the continuous strand is identified withHindIII (16Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 29Su S.S. Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of heteroduplexes was performed using minor modifications to published protocols (29Su S.S. Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct a nicked substrate, 150 μg of the appropriate dsDNA was linearized by digestion with EcoRI and precipitated by the addition of 1/10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 2 volumes of absolute ethanol. The DNA was recovered by centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at room temperature. This precipitation protocol was followed for each ethanol precipitation described subsequently, unless otherwise specified. The pelleted DNA was then resuspended in 2.6 ml of buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 12.5 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm EDTA, and 750 μg of ssDNA. The strands were denatured for 5 min at room temperature by the addition of 60 μl of 10 n NaOH, and the reaction was neutralized by the addition of a mixture of 200 μl of 2.9 n acetic acid, 248 μl of 1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 90 μl of 3 m KCl. The reannealing reaction was incubated at 65 °C for 1 h and then 37 °C for a further 3 h. The solution was diluted with 1.5 volumes of distilled water and the DNA precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was recovered by centrifugation in an SW41 swinging bucket rotor at 68,000 × g for 1 h at 20 °C. To remove the excess ssDNA, the pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of 1 mNaCl and passed three times through a column containing 1 ml of benzoylated napthoylated DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) that had been equilibrated in 1 m NaCl. The dsDNA was then precipitated directly from this solution by adding 2 volumes of absolute ethanol and centrifugation as described above. To digest any residual linear DNA, the pellet was resuspended in a 400-μl reaction containing 66 mm glycine at pH 9.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, and 35 units of exonuclease V enzyme (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The enzyme was then inactivated by a 20-min incubation at 65 °C. The circular substrate was fractionated from nucleotides and small oligonucleotides by ultrafiltration; each reaction was concentrated to less than 100 μl in volume using a Microcon 100 centrifugal filter as described by the manufacturer (Millipore). The filtrate containing small molecules and buffer was discarded, and the process was repeated twice by rediluting the sample to 400 μl with a buffer of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. To construct substrates containing 4-nucleotide gaps, two additional phage templates were constructed which were expanded by 4 bp. The double strand form of clones 7 (5′-template) and 4F (3′-template) were digested independently with EcoRI, and the resulting overhangs were filled in with the Klenow fragment, as described above. After blunt end ligation and transformation, individual plaques were screened for lack of sensitivity toEcoRI digestion and sequenced to confirm the addition of 4 nucleotides. These two constructs, called 7ΔE and 4FΔE, were used to produce the ssDNA partner in the annealing reaction described above. The annealing reactions yield a gapped molecule containing the single strand sequence 5′-AATT in place of a nick generated byEcoRI digestion. All further steps were carried out as per the nicked circular DNA substrate. To construct the templates containing gaps of 28 nucleotides, the protocol for preparing nicked substrates was followed with one modification. Before digestion with EcoRI, 100 μg of the appropriate dsDNA was digested with 1 unit/μgXbaI, and the product was precipitated with ethanol. The first digestion was monitored for completeness by gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing was used to verify the second digestion. One-fifth of the EcoRI digestion was passed through each of five High Pure PCR columns as described by the manufacturer to remove the 28-bp fragment resulting from the double digest, and the eluates were combined. All subsequent steps were performed as described for templates containing a nick. To construct the 5′-gapped molecule (202 nucleotides), 150 μg of dsDNA was sequentially digested with 1 unit/μg EcoRI followed by precipitation and digestion with 1 unit/μg BglI, each in recommended buffer for 4 h at 37 °C. For the 3′-gapped molecule (210 nucleotides) the dsDNA was digested sequentially with DrdI and EcoRI. The DNA was precipitated with ethanol, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and 300 mm NaCl (TNE). The excised 202- or 210-bp fragment was removed from the digest by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S500 column (Amersham Biosciences) which had also been equilibrated in TNE. Fractions containing twice digested DNA were pooled, precipitated by the addition of 2 volumes of absolute ethanol, and centrifuged for 1 h at room temperature at 68,000 ×g in an SW41 rotor. Subsequent steps were carried out as described for the nicked circular DNA substrate. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa and LoVo cells according to Ref. 16Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar. Both HeLa and LoVo cells were provided by the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis). Protein concentrations were determined with a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. MutSα was purified from HeLa cells as described (30Drummond J.T., Li, G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Repair assays were performed essentially as described by Holmes et al. (16Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), using a 15-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mmglutathione, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm dNTPs. 100 ng of DNA (∼20 fmol) was used in each assay, and the reaction was driven by the addition of 45 μg of HeLa nuclear extract protein. Reaction components were combined on ice, with the HeLa extract added last, then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The assays were terminated by the addition of 45 μl of a termination solution (25 mmEDTA, 0.67% SDS, 67 μg/ml proteinase K) and a further 20-min incubation at 37 °C. The mixture was then extracted twice with 60 μl of phenol with the initial phenol phase being back extracted once with 40 μl of TE. The aqueous phase that resulted (100 μl) was diluted with an equal volume of distilled water followed by the addition of 10 μl of 3 m sodium acetate and 2 volumes of absolute ethanol. Precipitated DNA was pelleted by a 20-min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 16,000 × g at room temperature. In each case where a circular template was used in a MMR assay, all DNA molecules recovered from the extract were linearized by the addition of 1 unit of AlwNI in buffer 2 (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 20 μg/ml ribonuclease A and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The extent of mismatch correction was scored concurrently by including either 0.5 unit of HindIII or 1 unit of XhoI/assay, depending upon the strand assessed (29Su S.S. Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 1% agarose gel at 300 V/h. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and a digital image was captured under UV illumination using a ChemiImager 4000 CCD cooled camera (Alpha Innotech). The fraction of DNA in each band was determined by a densitometric analysis using NIH Image software, version 1.62. Assays were set up so that the final salt concentration of components entering the assay was 100 mm with respect to added cations (primarily potassium). When complete assays were tested, the ionic strength was found to be equivalent to a solution of 125 mm KCl, based on a standard titration curve. In our hands, maximal repair was observed over a range from 125 to 150 mm. Repair assays failed when the salt concentration exceeded 200 mm KCl. Although the assays reported in this work were done at the lower end of the range, no improvement in repair activity for any substrate was observed at higher salt concentrations. The amount of nuclear extract used in each assay was determined by titrating the repair efficiency using 100 ng of heteroduplex DNA. The maximal level of repair was reached at ∼20–30 μg of extract, and 50 μg was chosen as a standard assay amount to ensure that extract components did not limit repair efficiency. Time courses were performed to verify that no significant amount of mismatch correction occurred beyond the 20-min assay time course. The MMR assay employed here (16Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) has several limitations that must be recognized. Foremost, it is a nonlinear assay (18Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that reports the maximal amount of repair that may be obtained under a specific set of reaction conditions. For a given amount of template, no increase in the extent of MMR can be obtained by increasing the amount of nuclear extract that provides the requisite activities (16Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 18Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrates rely on a strand break to direct repair, and sealing the required break by a DNA ligase can preclude further mismatch processing (18Fang W.H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in the reconstituted repair pathway from E. coli(24Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), high concentrations of ligase can suppress mismatch correction. HeLa extracts prepared as described are relatively unstable at 37 °C, 2K. Iams, E. D. Larson, and J. T. Drummond, unpublished observation. which complicates the critical assessment of parameters beyond the magnitude of mismatch correction. Under the conditions used here, patterned on earlier characterizations of this assay method (16Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2164522945,"Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans undergo unique intracellular degradation pathways after they are endocytosed from the cell surface. Heparanase, an endo-beta-glucuronidase capable of cleaving heparan sulfate, has been demonstrated to contribute to the physiological degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and therefore regulation of their biological functions. A rat parathyroid cell line was found to produce heparanase with an optimal activity at neutral and slightly acidic conditions suggesting that the enzyme participates in heparan sulfate proteoglycan metabolism in extralysosomal compartments. To elucidate the detailed properties of the purified enzyme, the substrate specificity against naturally occurring heparan sulfates and chemically modified heparins was studied. Cleavage sites of rat heparanase were present in heparan sulfate chains obtained from a variety of animal organs, but their occurrence was infrequent (average, 1-2 sites per chain) requiring recognition of both undersulfated and sulfated regions of heparan sulfate. On the other hand intact and chemically modified heparins were not cleaved by heparanase. The carbohydrate structure of the newly generated reducing end region of heparan sulfate cleaved by the enzyme was determined, and it represented relatively undersulfated structures. O-Sulfation of heparan sulfate chains also played important roles in substrate recognition, implying that rat parathyroid heparanase acts near the boundary of highly sulfated and undersulfated domains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Further elucidation of the roles of heparanase in normal physiological processes would provide an important tool for analyzing the regulation of heparan sulfate-dependent cell functions."

Trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs) 1The abbreviations used are: TRED, trinucleotide repeat expansion disease; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. 1The abbreviations used are: TRED, trinucleotide repeat expansion disease; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. are genetic disorders that are caused by expanded tracts of repeated sequences (usually CNG) (reviewed in Ref. 1Warren S.T. Nelson D.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Naturally variable lengths of these tracts occur in several genes involved in neurological disorders. Up to about 30 trinucleotide repeats do not cause neurological defects, but once a certain critical length is exceeded, disease ensues. The disease-causing alleles are usually dominant. The TREDs are complex syndromes that may exhibit anticipation (genetic instability leading to longer tract lengths with each generation). In several cases there is evidence that the longer the tract, the more severe or the earlier the onset of disease. Proof that long tracts cause disease rather than merely being correlated with it was obtained by artificially introducing long CNG tracts into mice, thereby inducing a version of spinocerebellar ataxia type I (2Burright E. Clark H. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R. Yunis W. Duvick L. Zoghbi H. Orr H. Cell. 1995; 82: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In those experiments some, but not all, features of the syndrome were reproduced in the mouse model, and in fact it is known that even in humans, instability and other features of the syndromes depend on poorly understood contributions of the genetic background (3Goldberg Y. McMurray C. Zeisler J. Almqvist E. Sillence D. Richards F. Gacy A. Buchanan J. Telenius H. Hayden-M R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although long tracts cause disease, several lines of evidence suggest that the shorter tracts perform some useful function; for example, CNG tracts in neurodevelopmental genes seem to have grown during primate evolution (4Djian P. Hancock P. Chana H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There are three main outstanding questions regarding the TREDs: (i) what is the normal function of the CNG tracts?, (ii) why and how does the long tract cause disease?, and (iii) is it correct to talk of the TREDs as a unitary phenomenon, or should we be distinguishing Fragile X and myotonic dystrophy (where the CGG or CTG repeats are normally transcribed but not translated) from Huntington's Chorea, SCA1, and other diseases where the CAG repeats are translated into polyglutamine, resulting in proteins that differ from wild-type protein (5Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P.

Brice A. Mandel J.-L. Nature. 1995; 378: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar)? Answers to these questions require molecular analysis of the differences between the long and short tracts. Accordingly, work in various laboratories has investigated the effects of the triplet repeats on various macromolecules as discussed below. Even when the triplet repeats are translated, the protein by itself cannot explain even the CAG TREDs, because if it did there would be a class of CA(Purine) diseases (CAA is another codon for glutamine). Furthermore, in the case of Fragile X it appears that absence of the protein and/or RNA in the cytoplasm causes the main features of the disease (9Kooy R.F. Willemsen R. Oostra B.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). There are several mechanisms that can lead to this result. One possibility is that expanded-tract alleles of FMR-1 are hypermethylated (perhaps because CGG repeats are particularly good substrates for methyltransferases; (10Smith S.S. Laayoun A. Lingeman R.G. Baker D.J. Riley J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)), and this is associated with genetic shutdown. That absence of gene function can explain the condition is shown by the existence of rare deletions in FMR-1, leading to symptoms of Fragile X (11Gu Y. Lugenbeel K.A. Vockley J.G. Grody W.W. Nelson D.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1705-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Lugenbeel K.A. Peier A.M. Carson N.L. Chudley A.E. Nelson D.L.

Genet. 1994; 51: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, intermediate-sized alleles (41–60 repeats) of the tract in FMR1 are associated with learning difficulties in boys, despite the fact that other symptoms of Fragile X are absent and that protein levels are normal (14Murray A. Youings S. Dennis N. Latsky L. Linehan P. McKechnie N. MacPherson J. Pound M. Jacobs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the totality of the syndrome also includes a DNA effect: the expanded-tract chromosomes themselves are physically fragile and genetically hypervariable. This may be a general property of CNG tracts, since these are known to mediate genetic instability not only in eukaryotes but also in Escherichia coli(16Darlow J. Leach D. Genetics. 1995; 141: 825-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jaworski A. Rosche W.A. Gellibolian R. Kang S. Shimizu M. Bowater R.P. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pinheiro, manuscript in preparation. Similar behavior of other repeated sequences was previously shown to reflect cellular reaction to the in vivo formation of non-B DNA secondary structures (19Greaves D. Patient R. Lilley D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 461-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20McClellan J.A. Boublikova P. Palecek F. Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8373-8377Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Less attention has been paid to the role of the RNA. Nevertheless, since in all cases the CNG tracts are transcribed but in the loci associated with the two commonest diseases (Fragile X and myotonic dystrophy), they are not translated, it is likely that effects at this level are of central importance, at least for the normal function of the tracts (21Hamshere M.G. Brook J.D. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 332-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22McClellan J.A. Newbury S.F. Nature. 1996; 379: 396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). As for how the expanded tracts actually cause disease, the complex nature of the syndromes suggests that this is likely to involve all these aspects. For example, in cases where the tracts are translated, the production of mutant protein may have effects on the cell; if the expanded tracts form a novel structure in DNA, this may act to stimulate recombination or to compromise replication, thus accounting for anticipation and chromosomal fragility; and formation of a new structure in RNA may lead to abnormal stability, splicing, localization, or translation. The clearest candidate for a CNG disease mediated largely by effects at the RNA level is myotonic dystrophy (21Hamshere M.G. Brook J.D. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 332-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The shortest repeats that are known from the general population are about 15 nucleotides in length (five repeats). The shorter abnormal alleles are associated with adult-onset myotonic dystrophy and the longer ones with the congenital form. In this case a CTG repeat (CUG in the RNA) is untranslated and located in a locus involved in neuromuscular development. The disease-causing allele is dominant. Long RNA containing the expanded tracts has been shown to be transcribed effectively and to accumulate in foci within the nucleus (23Taneja K.L. McCurrach M. Schalling M. Housman D. Singer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis therefore is that there are special features of CNG RNA structure or biochemistry. These special features mediate some useful function in the short, wild-type alleles and possibly also a deleterious function in the long, disease-causing alleles. In this paper we have used in vitro transcription and chemical synthesis to produce CUG RNA of various sizes and compared it with control RNAs, such as GUC (different polarity) and a randomized but isobasic sequence, using gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and thermal melting of the RNA. Plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5α, and supercoiled DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis and purified by ultracentrifugation in caesium chloride (Invitrogen) gradients that contained ethidium bromide (Sigma). Long CNG tracts and RNA markers were produced by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmids pGEM1, pGEM2, and Bluescript KS+ (all originally from Promega). Plasmid Bluescript KS+ was linearized with restriction enzymesTsp501I, MwoI, HaeIII, andXbaI (all New England Biolabs) to produce markers that were 9, 24, 30, and 39 nucleotides long, respectively. Plasmids pGEM2 and pGEM1 were digested with MwoI and AluI, respectively. Transcription of these templates produced markers that were 16 and 18 nucleotides long. All transcriptions were performed on ∼1 μg of appropriately linearized plasmid in a 20-μl volume (5× T7 buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 30 mmMgCl2, 10 mm spermidine) and 100 mm dithiothreitol (Promega), RNAguard (AmershamBiosciences), 2.5 mm cold nucleotides A, G, and U, and 100 μm cold CTP (Amersham Biosciences), T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), RNase free water (Sigma)) containing 1 μl (1 μCi; 0.33 nmol) of radioactive [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol: ICN-FLOW). To remove the template the transcription reactions were treated with 2 μl of 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (RNase-free; AmershamBiosciences) and finally purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA templates for transcription were constructed using oligonucleotides synthesized on an Applied Biosystems machine using phosphoramidate chemistry. For efficient transcription it turned out to be crucial that each RNA start with a G, and to aid annealing a G + C-rich clamp was required at the “upstream” end of the duplex promoter region. In each case a top strand comprising the T7 promoter sequence was annealed to a bottom strand of which the 3′ end was its complement, and the 5′ end provided a template for the transcription of the following RNAs: G(CUG)5, G(CUG)6, and G(CUG)7. Control templates were constructed similarly, and they encoded G(GUC)5 or an isobasic control RNA 5′-GUGGUUGGCCUCCGUC-3′. DNase I treatment, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation were performed after transcription to remove the template. The sequences used are as follows: top strand of T7 promoter, 5′-GCCGGTAATACGACTCACATA-3′; template for transcribing G(CUG)5, 5′-(CAG)5CTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACCGGC-3′; template for transcribing G(CUG)6, 5′-(CAG)6CTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACCGGC-3′; template for transcribing G(CUG)7: 5′-(CAG)7CTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACCGGC-3′; template for transcribing G(GUC)5, 5′-(GAC)5CTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACCGGC-3′; template for transcribing isobasic control RNA, 5′-GACGGAGGCCAACCACTATAGTGAGTCGTATTACCGGC-3′; synthetic RNA for control purposes, 5′-(r(CUG)6)-3′. RNA markers and triplet repeat RNA transcripts were run on 10% non-denaturing and denaturing (7 m urea (Sigma)) acrylamide (29:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide (National Diagnostics)) gels. In all cases the electrophoresis buffer was 1× TBE (90 mm Tris, pH 8.0 (Sigma), 90 mm boric acid (Sigma), 2 mm EDTA (Sigma)). Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and dried under vacuum onto Whatman 3MM paper, before autoradiography using Kodak film. DNA oligonucleotide markers 8–32 were purchased from AmershamBiosciences and labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Synthetic RNA was labeled in a similar manner. RNA and DNA oligonucleotides for both CD and UV melting were dissolved to a concentration of 4 μm (for DNA) or 8 μm(for RNA) in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, unless otherwise stated. All solutions for both the CD and UV melting experiments were filter-purified using a 0.2-μm nylon filter (Sigma). CD spectra were gathered on a Jasco J-715 CD spectropolarimeter using a 5-mm path length cell. Data were stored using the supplied software and then exported to Kaleidagraph for manipulation. Data were collected over the range 350–200 nm with a 0.5 nm resolution and 1 nm bandwidth at a speed of 100 nm/min; spectra were averaged over 16 scans. For comparison purposes the RNA CD data have been normalized to 1.2 OD260, while the DNA CD spectra have been normalized to 0.6 OD260. UV melting was conducted on a Cary 1 spectrophotometer ramped at 1 degree/min and the data collected with the supplied software, before exporting to Kaleidagraph for manipulation. Prior to the melting curve determinations, the samples were heated to 95 °C and cooled slowly (24Puglisi J.D. Tinoco I.J. Methods in Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Melting curve measurements were repeated at least three times, and no significant differences were found between each set of data. The data were analyzed following Marky and Breslauer (25Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The fraction of unfolded RNA in solution was determined by calculating, α=xx+yEquation 1 where x is the difference between the final absorbance of the unfolded RNA and the absorbance at a given temperature, and y is the difference in absorbance between the temperature-dependent absorbance and the base line corresponding to the temperature dependence of the unmelted RNA absorbance. The midpoint of the plot of α versus1/T, where T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin), gives the melting temperature (by definition the temperature at which half of the RNA is melted). The van't Hoff transition enthalpy of the unimolecular transition is, ΔHyH=B′(1/Tmax)−(1/T2)Equation 2 where B′ = 3.50 cal K−1mol−1 (25Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), T max is the absolute temperature of the maximum of the α versus 1/Tplot, and T 2 is the absolute temperature of the high temperature half-height of the curve. The entropy of the transition is given as follows. ΔS=ΔHVHTmEquation 3 A variety of techniques were used to perform the conformational search within CHARMm version 25.2. These methods included a grid search based on the backbone torsion angles, a Boltzmann jump algorithm, and molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures of both 300 and 600 K. NOE constraints were used in some of the calculations to improve the chance of locating suitable Watson-Crick C-G base pairings within each triplet and also to locate possible stacked triplets; other calculations were performed without constraints. In all cases, the selected conformations were energy minimized at the end of the conformational searches; where NOE constraints were imposed the minimization was initially done with constraints imposed, but then subsequently with the constraints removed. The mobility of end-labeled chemically synthesized (CUG)6 electrophoresed on denaturing gels together with RNA markers (Fig.1A) shows that the RNA migrates as expected for an 18-mer. Electrophoresis of CUG repeat RNAs and control RNAs on denaturing gels shows that in vitro transcription generates bands of the expected sizes for all the samples (Fig.1 C). When these CUG repeat RNAs are electrophoresed on non-denaturing gels (Fig. 1, B and D), they migrate significantly faster than the marker RNAs. Randomized and GUC repeat RNAs migrate similarly to controls. The overall conclusion to be drawn from Fig. 1, A–D, is that the CUG RNAs are all unusually compact, whether they are made by chemical synthesis orin vitro transcription and that over this size-range their degree of compaction increases with tract length. This is in accord with the behavior previously observed for single-stranded DNA (26Mitchell J.E. Newbury S.F. McClellan J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1876-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For all the CUG and GUC repeats, it is interesting to note that extra bands at low molecular weight are observed. These extra small bands are not observed for the randomized control and probably reflect abortive transcription. DNA polymerase apparently also appears to pause at CNG tracts (27Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27014-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). 3A. Murray, unpublished observations. In addition to bands that move faster than the appropriate markers, some that move more slowly, especially in the six-repeat (19 nucleotides) and seven-repeat (22 nucleotides) tracks, are observed. These are not present in the denaturing gel nor in the chemically synthesized sample, so they are probably higher order complexes of RNA; possibly DNA/RNA hybrids that resist DNase I treatment. Multistrand complexes of CNG DNA have been observed previously by other workers (28Smith G.K. Jie J. Fox G.E. Gao X.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4303-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Structural work on triplet repeats has been on short tracts that cannot be directly compared with those from TRED patients. Recently we have managed to create RNAs of lengths approaching clinical relevance by in vitro transcription of a range of plasmids containing 24–51 CTG repeats by cloning CNG tracts into bacterial plasmids under conditions where phenomena similar to anticipation may be observed.2 The gel mobility of these RNAs is shown in Fig. 1, E and F. These in vitrotranscriptions are not marked by the high levels of premature termination seen for the oligonucleotide templates. On the non-denaturing gel (Fig. 1 F) the CNG RNAs migrate as two bands which migrate anomalously slowly (in contrast to the anomalously fast migration of the smaller triplet repeats). Comparison with the mobilities of the markers shows this to be consistent with duplex or higher formation. Some sort of structural transition appears to occur between the 5–7 range and the 36–50 repeat range. Since this structural transition occurs at a length close to the threshold for myotonic dystrophy, this is potentially a result of some significance. To investigate the structures of the unusual compact structures found in the gels, CD spectra were collected for the chemically synthesized (CTG)5 and (CUG)5 samples and randomized controls. The CD spectrum of (CTG)5 in phosphate buffer consists of a positive peak at 285 nm and two negative peaks at 258 and 208 nm (Fig. 2 A). The 285 nm maximum is at too long a wavelength for the molecule to be adopting an A-DNA conformation, and the spectra do not contain a positive peak at around 205 nm, which would be expected if the tract were adopting duplex B-DNA structure (29Park Y.W. Breslauer K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6653-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Gray D.M. Ratcliff R.L. Vaughan M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 389-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 31Scaria P.V. Shafer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5417-5423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The negative peak at 208 nm suggests that the tract has triplex character, as a negative peak between 200 and 220 nm is considered a hallmark of triplex DNA (29Park Y.W. Breslauer K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6653-6657Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Gray D.M. Ratcliff R.L. Vaughan M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 389-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 32Radhakrishnan I. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11405-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Spectra for triplexes are usually able to be approximated as the sum of the CD for the component duplex and single-stranded DNA plus some extra intensity due to the more rigid structure (33Chastain M. Tinoco I.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In accord with this the observed spectrum closely resembles that expected for the sum of poly(d(G-C))2 and poly(d(T)) (34Johnson K.H. Gray D.M. Morris P.M. Sutherland J.C. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Addition of 20 mm NaCl or 20 mm MgCl2 increases the 285 nm and 258 nm bands to the same intensity and increases the 208 nm band. The 208 nm band is particularly enhanced by MgCl2, which probably correlates with a stabilization of base stacking and more effective reduction of phosphate-phosphate repulsion (35Schweisguth D.C. Chelladurai B.S. Nicholson A.W. Moore P.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Laing L. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 560-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 37Cole P.E. Yang S.K. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4358-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the observed triplex-like structure was inter or intramolecular, labeled (CTG)5 was titrated with unlabeled (CTG)5. Gel electrophoresis showed that there is no evidence for intermolecular structures (Fig. 1 G), which would be expected to shift the band up the gel due to an increased mass of the complex. There was also no evidence of concentration dependence of spectra other than that required by the Beer-Lambert Law. We therefore conclude that (CTG)5 forms a monomolecular base stacking structure that has spectroscopic triplex characteristics. The CD spectra of (CUG)5 RNA and an isobasic randomized control at 20 °C are shown in Fig. 2 B. The (CUG)5 spectrum has a positive band at 269 nm, a small negative band at 237 nm, and a large negative band at 208 nm. The 208 nm band, which is indicative of RNA base pairing and stacking (38Gray D. Liu J. Ratcliff R.L. Allen F.S. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1337-1382Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), is not present in the randomized control, suggesting that (CUG)5 RNA is significantly more base-paired and stacked than the control. The long wavelength peak (at 269 nm rather than the 285 nm of the corresponding DNA and 282 nm for the RNA control) is very sensitive to base composition and RNA conformation (38Gray D. Liu J. Ratcliff R.L. Allen F.S. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1337-1382Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 39Causley G.C. Johnson W.C.J. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 1763-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The overall spectrum is very similar to those obtained for RNAs containing pseudoknots with a small but significant negative band at ∼237 nm (40Johnson K.H. Gray D.M. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1992; 9: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 41Shi P.-Y. Brinton M.A. Veal J.M. Zhong Y.Y. Wilson W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4222-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (naturally occurring A-form RNAs generally lack any marked band at this wavelength (42Johnson K.H. Gray D.M. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 43Loret E.P. Georgel P. Johnson W.C.J. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Aci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9734-9738Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Newbury S.F. McClellan J.A. Rodger A. Anal. Commun. 1996; 33: 117-121Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar)). The spectrum of the intermolecular triplex formed by poly(A)-poly(G)-poly(C) is also similar to that of the (CUG) repeat, except that the small negative band for this intermolecular triplex is at 245 nm (33Chastain M. Tinoco I.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since an intramolecular pseudoknot might be described as a pseudo-triplex, these two descriptions are equally valid. To analyze the effect of temperature on (CUG)5 RNA, we measured the CD spectra at a range of temperatures between 5 and 80 °C (Fig. 2 C). The negative band at 208 nm decreases markedly with increased temperature as the base pairs melt apart (44Newbury S.F. McClellan J.A. Rodger A. Anal. Commun. 1996; 33: 117-121Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). At 65 °C, the 208 nm band is absent and the 267 nm band decreases and shifts to 275 nm resembling the randomized control, indicating that the (CUG)5 structure is completely melted. The series of spectra obtained are almost identical to CD spectra of a 59-nucleotide flavivirus pseudoknot at various temperatures (41Shi P.-Y. Brinton M.A. Veal J.M. Zhong Y.Y. Wilson W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4222-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The melting curve for (CUG)5 (Fig. 2 D) was analyzed following (25Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) to give a single transition with melting temperature of 54.8 °C. The van't Hoff transition enthalpy of the transition was determined from Fig. 2 F(T max = 328.1 and T 2 = 336.6 K) to be ΔH VH = (190 ± 30) kJ mol−1 and ΔS = (580 ± 90) J K−1 mol−1. A single transition is not inconsistent with the possibility that the structure may resemble a pseudoknot; detailed studies of the thermal melting of pseudoknots show that they can melt with one apparent transition (45Spedding G. Gluik T.C. Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 229: 609-622Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Gluick T. Draper D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 246-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However,T m and ΔH values are high for a 15-mer of any kind, especially as this usually means <8 base pairs. For example, the T m for a duplex with a similar ratio of G/C and A/U in 1 m NaCl (GUCUAGAC) (versus 5 mm sodium phosphate in our experiments) is 56.2 °C (47Freier S.M. Kierzek R. Jaeger J.A. Sugimoto N. Caruthers M.H. Neilson T. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9373-9377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar) and the T m and ΔH values for a 23-mer RNA hairpin (with 7 Watson-Crick base pairs) in 10 mmsodium phosphate are 50.9 °C and 193 kJ mol−1, respectively (48Sarkar M. Sigurdsson S. Tomac S. Sen S. Rozners E. Sjoberg B.-M. Stromberg R. Graslund A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4678-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus whatever structure is adopted is very stable and is unlikely to be a hairpin. The RNA containing (CUG)50 by way of contrast has two thermal transitions occurring at ∼40 °C and 76 °C (Fig.2 H) and a CD spectrum resembling that of A-form RNA (Fig.2 G). It is interesting to note that there are two bands when this sequence is run on a non-denaturing gel (Fig. 1 F). It may therefore be that the two transitions reflect two distinct species melting rather than one species undergoing a two stage transition. A conformational study of a single strand of RNA was undertaken to assess the viability of the proposed structure (see below). This was not intended to be a definitive modeling study, indeed the scope of this study would not allow for such a major computational undertaking, but rather to ensure that the proposed structure was reasonable; in particular it should be thermally accessible and represent at least a local free energy minimum structure.

The spectra of the oxidized enzyme indicate a low electron density for the isoalloxazine ring. As far as the two-electron reduced species are concerned, the spectral comparison of the NADPH-reduced enzyme with the glutathione- or dithiothreitol-reduced enzyme shows significant frequency differences for the flavin bands II, III, and VII.

Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). GR is a cytoplasmic flavoenzyme that is widely but not universally distributed in aerobic organisms. As shown in Equation 1, it catalyzes the reduction of GSSG by NADPH to form glutathione GSH. GSSG+NADPH+H+⇔2GSH+NADP+(Eq. 1) By maintaining an elevated [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio in most eukaryotic cells, GR participates in several vital functions such as the detoxification of reactive oxygen species as well as protein and DNA biosynthesis (1Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Glutathione reductase has been isolated, characterized, and sequenced from different sources (1Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of the enzymes purified from human erythrocyte and Escherichia coli have been refined at high resolution (2Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1752-1757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These structures show that GR is a homodimer. Each subunit (molecular mass = 49–59 kDa) contains one molecule of FAD and is composed of four domains, i.e. from the N- to the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain, FAD-binding, NADPH-binding, central, and interface domains (3Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 4Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 5Mittl P.R. Schulz G.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The FAD-binding domain includes not only the FAD cofactor but also a part of the GSSG-binding site, the redox-active disulfide bridge, which is located adjacent to the si-side of the isoalloxazine ring, and a His-Glu pair considered to be the acid-base catalyst in the catalytic electron transfer (3Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 4Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

NADPH lies in the NADPH-binding domain, toward the re-side of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. Thus, the binding positions for the two substrates, NADPH and GSSG, are separated by the isoalloxazine ring at opposite sides of each subunit (2Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1752-1757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism has been investigated by spectroscopic, kinetic and genetic approaches as well as by crystallography (1Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar, 4Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reducing equivalents of NADPH are passed to GSSG via the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and the redox disulfide/dithiol center formed by two cysteinyl residues, Cys-58 and Cys-63 in the human enzyme (6Rietveld P. Arscott L.D. Berry A. Scrutton N.S. Deonarain M.P. Perham R.N. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13888-13895Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle can be subdivided into two half-reactions. The first one represents a reductive reaction with the enzyme reduction by NADPH. This step gives rise to the formation of a two-electron reduced species (EH2) with an oxidized FAD and a reduced dithiol center. H++NADPH+Eox⇔NADP++EH2(Eq. 2) The oxidation-reduction potential of the Eox/EH2 couple is −230–250 mV at pH 7.0 and 20 °C (8Veine D.M. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15575-15582Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One of the nascent thiols, i.e. the donor thiolate group of Cys-63, and the flavin form an intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) complex characterized by a broad absorption band peaking at 540 nm (1Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). In this step, the side chain of Tyr-197 fulfills a very important role. It lies in the NADPH-binding pocket but moves aside when NADPH is bound. This movement allows the nicotinamide ring to come close to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD for electron transfer (2Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1752-1757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that this residue might serve as a gate in the NADPH-binding pocket, shielding the isoalloxazine ring of FAD (9Krauth-Siegel R.L. Arscott L.D. Schonleben-Janas A. Schirmer R.H. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13968-13977Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The second half-reaction is oxidative. EH2 reacts with GSSG yielding two molecules of GSH and regenerating the oxidized enzyme with its active disulfide site. EH2+GSSG⇔Eox+2GSH(Eq. 3) In this reaction, many intermediates are formed. A stable mixed disulfide (MDS) 2EH2 is generally considered as a mixture of several two-electron reduced species, including MDS. EH2 will be used here to mean all two-electron reduced species other than MDS. intermediate was proposed according the following equations (7Arscott L.D. Veine D.M. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). EH2+GSSG⇔EH2­GSSG⇔MDS­GSH⇔MDS+GSH(Eq. 4) MDS⇔Eox­GSH⇔Eox+GSH(Eq. 5) In this catalytic scheme, the Cys-58 residue (human GR) is the interchange (or distal) thiol and interacts with GSSG (1Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar, 7Arscott L.D. Veine D.M. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The acid-base catalyst of the interchange, i.e. the histidyl side chain of His-467′ paired with a glutamate residue (Glu-472′), would have two roles; its primary function would be to protonate (acid catalyst) the first departing molecule of GSH, inhibiting the back reaction, i.e. attack of glutathione thiolate on the MDS (10Wong K.K. Vanoni M.A. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7091-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The second function (base catalyst) would be to stabilize the charge-transfer complex between FAD and the thiolate group of Cys-63 (6Rietveld P. Arscott L.D. Berry A. Scrutton N.S. Deonarain M.P. Perham R.N. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13888-13895Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interchange thiol, the charge-transfer thiol, and the His-Glu acid-base catalyst are closely linked structural elements in human GR. They are conserved in the E. coli and yeast sequences (1Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar, 11Greer S.

A full understanding of the molecular mechanism of electron transfer in GR requires detailed information concerning the structures and environments of the redox sites. To better understand the role of the FAD cofactor in GR, we have undertaken a resonance Raman (RR) study on the two-electron reduced state, this redox state appearing to be of key importance in the function and regulation of the enzyme (4Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Rietveld P. Arscott L.D. Berry A. Scrutton N.S. Deonarain M.P. Perham R.N. Williams Jr., C.H.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RR spectroscopy has proven to be a valuable method for the investigation of the structure and the environment of the flavins in flavoproteins (13Morris M.D. Bienstock R.J. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 395-442Google Scholar, 14McFarland J.T. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy: Resonance Raman of Polyenes and Aromatics. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 211-302Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe and analyze the RR spectra of the Eox, EH2, and MDS forms of the yeast GR. The two-electron reduced states were formed under controlled conditions using different reducing agents: NADPH, GSH, or dithiothreitol (DTT), in the absence or presence of GSSG or NADP+. Although the three-dimensional structure of oxidized GR is known, and models of the reductive and oxidative half-reactions are available, many questions still remain unanswered. One of these is the importance of FAD in the GR catalysis. Our objective is to determine the possible influences of the substrates and products on the structure and environment of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and to relate our observations to the function and regulation of the GR activity. Yeast glutathione reductase was purchased from Sigma. The enzyme in an ammonium sulfate solution was dialyzed for 6 h in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2. To improve the protein purity, the solution was then applied onto a column of 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (15Carlberg I. Mannervik B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 484: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The elution of GR was done with a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m) added to the buffer (8Veine D.M. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15575-15582Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pooled fractions were washed by repeated concentrations and dilutions with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, on Centricon 50. The concentration of the eluted oxidized enzyme was spectrophotometrically determined using an extinction coefficient of 11,300 m−1 cm−1 at 462 nm (16Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4470-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The measured activities of the purified enzyme were higher than 0.33 mmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein. The NADPH concentration was calculated using ε340 = 6,220m−1 cm−1 (17Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH, GSSG, GSH, and DTT were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. The two-electron reduced forms of the enzyme, EH2 and MDS, were generated by reduction of oxidized GR (0.6–0.8 mm for the Raman experiments) with NADPH, GSH, or DTT in the presence or absence of GSSG or NADP+. These reductions were performed under anaerobic conditions in equilibrating independently the enzyme and the solutions of reactant with wet argon (18Leondiadis L. Momenteau M. Desbois A. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 31: 4691-4696Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After equilibration, a small aliquot of a solution of NADPH or GSH was injected through a septum in a cuvette containing the solution of GR. The color change of the enzyme from yellow to orange-red as well as the concomitant changes in absorption spectrum proved the formation of the EH2 or MDS species. To maintain the enzyme in the two-electron reduced state, the spectroscopic measurements were performed under anaerobic conditions using a continuous flow of wet argon over the surface of the sample. Under these conditions, the EH2 and MDS samples were stable for several hours. The reduction of GR with DTT was conducted by dialyzing the protein at 4 °C in a 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mm DTT. This reduction produces an EH2 species that is stable for several hours, even in the presence of air. Using electronic absorption and RR spectroscopies, the enzyme stability under laser irradiation was checked. No spectral variation was observed during the experiments. After the RR experiments were done, we controlled the reversibility of the enzyme reduction in regenerating the fully oxidized form by dialysis and in measuring the enzyme activity. Such controls showed that the GR activity was stable during the spectral determinations. Resonance Raman experiments were recorded at 20 ± 1 °C on a Jobin-Yvon spectrometer (Ramanor HG2S-UV) using argon (Coherent, model Innova 100) and helium/cadmium (Liconix, model 4050) lasers. The signal-to-noise ratios were improved by summation of individual spectra. Spectral treatments (addition, subtraction, and removal of broad and featureless fluorescence backgrounds) were made using the Grams 32 software (Galactic Industries) (19Tegoni M. Gervais M. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8932-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The frequency precision was 0.5–1 cm−1 for the most intense RR bands and 1.5–2 cm−1 for the weakest bands. Fig.1a shows the high frequency region of the RR spectrum of oxidized GR, excited at 441.6 nm. In this study, the band numbering previously adopted for the prominent RR bands of oxidized flavoenzymes has been used (20Bowman W.D. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the 1300–1700 cm−1 region of the spectra, four bands observed at 1626 (band I), 1579 (band II), 1402 (band VI), and 1353 (band VII) cm−1 dominate. However, shoulders on the high frequency sides of band I (at 1643 cm−1), band III (at 1545 cm−1), band IV (at 1498 cm−1), and band V (at 1461 cm−1) are also identified. The 1200–1300 cm−1 region of the RR spectrum shows a complex pattern with overlapping bands at 1224, 1248, 1261, and 1273 cm−1(Fig. 2a). The frequency of the RR bands observed in the 1000–1700 cm−1 region of oxidized GR (Eox) are listed in Table I. The addition of either GSSG (up to 60 eq) or NADP+ (up to 100 eq) to oxidized GR has no influence on the RR spectrum (spectra not shown).FIG. 2. 1100–1300 cm−1 regions of RR spectra of GR at pH 7.2.a, oxidized GR. b, GR reduced with 2.5 eq of NADPH. c, GR reduced with 20 eq of GSH. d, GR reduced with 2 eq of DTT.

Open table in a new tab The RR spectra of GR anaerobically reduced with NADPH (2.5 eq) at pH 7.2 are displayed in Figs. 1b and 2b. When compared with the RR spectra of the oxidized form (Figs. 1a and 2a), those of the NADPH-reduced GR have lower signal-to-noise ratios. However, we clearly identify significant shifts for bands II (+2 cm−1), V (+3 cm−1), VI (+5 cm−1), and VII (−2 cm−1). The 1200–1300 cm−1 regions also exhibit substantial modifications. The band observed at 1248 cm−1 for oxidized GR is markedly diminished upon enzyme reduction, whereas we notice an increase in relative intensity and a broadening of the 1262 cm−1 band for the NADPH-reduced form (Fig. 2b). Band XI is apparently upshifted from 1224 cm−1 for oxidized GR to 1230 cm−1 for NADPH-reduced GR (Fig. 2, a and b). When GR is reduced by NADPH (2 eq) at pH 7.2, the addition of NADP+ (15–150 eq) has no significant influence on the frequencies of the RR bands (Fig. 1c and Table I). However, a slight broadening of these bands is detected. The titration of Eox with GSH produces gradual upshifts of the RR bands II, III, V, VI, IX, and X (spectra not shown). With a saturating concentration of GSH (15–20 eq), the RR spectrum of the GSH-reduced enzyme exhibits maximal shifts of +3–6 cm−1 for bands II, III, V, and VI, when compared with the spectrum of oxidized GR (Fig.3a versus Fig.1a and Table I). As in the case of the NADPH-reduced enzyme, band X is apparently upshifted from 1248 to 1262 cm−1(Fig. 2, a and c). The comparison of the 1300–1670 cm−1 regions of the spectra of NADPH-reduced GR and GSH-reduced GR shows frequency shifts for bands II (from 1581 to 1584 cm−1), III (from 1546 to 1549 cm−1), and VII (from 1351 to 1354 cm−1) (Fig. 1b versus Fig. 3a). In the 1200–1300 cm−1 regions, the RR spectrum of the GSH-reduced enzyme closely resembles that of the NADPH-reduced form (Fig. 2band c and Table I). The RR spectrum of GR reduced with DTT at pH 7.2 is essentially identical to that of the enzyme reduced with GSH (Figs. 2a and 3b). The broad band XIV, however, appears to be downshifted (Table I). Combined effects of GSH, GSSG, and pH produce different ratios of EH2 and MDS (7Arscott L.D. Veine D.M. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The RR spectrum of GR reduced with GSH at pH 8.4 is shown in Fig. 3c. The RR spectra of GR reduced with GSH (15 eq) at pH 6.3 in the presence of various concentrations of GSSG (2–60 eq) are not significantly different from each other (spectra not shown). The observed frequencies are listed in Table I, and one of these spectra is displayed in Fig. 3d. The comparison of the RR spectrum of GR reduced with GSH at pH 8.4 with that of GR reduced with GSH at pH 6.3 in the presence of GSSG shows a significant downshift and broadening of bands II (from 1585 to 1583 cm−1) and III (from 1551 to 1548 cm−1) (Fig.3, c and d). In the lower frequency regions, bands X (1263/1261 cm−1), XI (1229/1227 cm−1), and XIV (1061/1058 cm−1) are also slightly affected (spectra not shown and Table I). We have investigated the effect of NADP+ on the GSH-reduced enzyme at pH 7.2. The RR spectrum obtained for GR reduced with GSH (15 eq) at pH 7.2 in the presence of NADP+ (15 eq) is very similar to the spectrum obtained for GR at the same pH in the absence of NADP+. Small differences concern a slight broadening of most of the RR bands and the detection of a downshift of band II from 1584 cm−1 in the absence of NADP+ to 1583 cm−1 in its presence (spectra not shown and Table I). The assignment of the RR bands of the isoalloxazine ring is based on isotopic data and normal mode vibrational analysis (19Tegoni M. Gervais M. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8932-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Bowman W.D. Spiro T.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3313-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Abe M. Kyogoku Y.

Fig. 4shows the chemical structure and the numbering of the isoalloxazine ring, and Table I summarizes the band assignments for the oxidized and two-electron reduced forms of yeast GR. The RR spectra of oxidized GR were previously investigated (24Schmidt J. Coudron P. Thompson A.W. Watters K.L. McFarland J.T. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Lively C.R. McFarland J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 136: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Our study shows frequencies close to those published in the study of Schmidt et al.(24Schmidt J. Coudron P. Thompson A.W. Watters K.L. McFarland J.T. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). With reference to the RR frequencies of FAD in water, Raman diagrams were previously drawn to visualize the apoprotein effect on the high frequency modes of the isoalloxazine ring (19Tegoni M.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8011-8022Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the diagram of oxidized GR (Fig. 5), the frequency shifts detected for GR are generally negative, indicating an electron-deficient isoalloxazine ring (19Tegoni M. Gervais M. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8932-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Desbois A. Tegoni M. Gervais M. Lutz M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8011-8022Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The shapes of the Raman diagrams were associated with the electron distribution through the three rings of the isoalloxazine moiety and correlated with the biological activities of several flavoproteins (19Tegoni M.

The Raman data are listed in Table I, and those of FAD in water are from Desbois et al. (26Desbois A. Tegoni M. Gervais M. Lutz M.

The reaction product, NADP+, forms a complex with EH2(KD = 70 μm), but NADPH in excess forms a tighter EH2-NADPH complex (KD = 2.1 μm) (27Bulger J.E. Brandt K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5578-5587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter complex enhances the thiolate-flavin CT band (9Krauth-Siegel R.L. Arscott L.D. Schonleben-Janas A. Schirmer R.H. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13968-13977Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The RR spectra of NADPH-reduced GR are in agreement with an oxidized isoalloxazine ring (Table I) (13Morris M.D. Bienstock R.J. Clark R.J.H. Hester R.E. Spectroscopy of Biological Systems.

The comparison of the RR diagrams drawn for oxidized GR and its NADPH-reduced form illustrates the influence of the disulfide reduction on the isoalloxazine modes (Fig. 5). Upshifted frequencies are observed for most of the RR bands of the NADPH-reduced GR, indicating an increased electron density of the isoalloxazine ring upon dithiol formation. However, the isoalloxazine ring remains electron-deficient. This low electron density is likely at the origin of the stable formation of the CT complex between FAD and the proximal thiolate group constituting the dithiol active site (1Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). The changes in shape of the Raman diagrams also indicate a modification in the electron distribution through the isoalloxazine ring (Fig. 5). For an enzyme preliminarily reduced with excess NADPH (EH2-NADPH), the displacement of the bound NADPH molecule by NADP+ has no influence on the RR modes of FAD (Table I). Although NADPH binding causes an important protein reorganization around Tyr-197 (2Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1752-1757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Karplus P.A.

To investigate the early steps in the signal transmission from the chemokine-binding site to the G protein-coupling region we engineered metal ion-binding sites at putative extracellular sites in the chemokine receptor CXCR1. We introduced histidines into sites located in the second and third putative extracellular loops of CXCR1, creating single, double, and triple mutant receptors: R199H, R203H, D265H, R199H/R203H, R199H/D265H, R203H/D265H, R203H/H207Q, and R199H/R203H/D265H. Cells expressing the double mutants R199H/D265H and R203H/D265H and the triple mutant R199H/R203H/D265H failed to trigger interleukin 8-dependent calcium responses. Interestingly, calcium responses mediated by the single mutant R203H and the double mutants R199H/R203H and R203H/H207Q were blocked by Zn(II), indicating the creation of a functional metal ion-binding site. On the other hand, cells expressing all single, double, or triple histidine-substituted CXCR1 demonstrated high affinity binding to interleukin 8 in the presence and absence of metal ions. These findings indicate that occupation of the engineered metal-binding site uncouples the chemokine-binding site from the activation mechanism in CXCR1. Most importantly, we identify for the first time elements of an early signal transduction switch of chemokine receptors before the activation of cytoplasmic G proteins."

We compared the fate of active and S195A inactive rat trypsin upon binding to α1-antitrypsin and P1-Arg-antichymotrypsin using stopped-flow kinetics with fluorescence resonance energy transfer detection and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We show that inhibition of active trypsin by these serpins leads to two irreversible complexes, one being compatible with the full insertion of the serpin-reactive site loop but not the other one. Binding of inactive trypsin to serpins triggers a large multistep reversible rearrangement leading to the migration of the proteinase to an intermediate position. Binding of inactive trypsin, unlike that of active trypsin, does not perturb the rhodamine fluorescence at position 150 on the helix F of the serpin. Thus, inactive proteinases do not migrate past helix F and do not trigger full serpin loop insertion. Serpins inhibit proteinases through a complicated multistep mechanism.

Serpins have roles in many regulatory processes including fibrinolysis, complement activation, and blood coagulation. The human genome contains more serpins than other classes of serine proteinase inhibitors (2Southan C. J. Peptide Sci. 2000; 6: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whereas canonical inhibitors such as BPTI1 form non-covalent reversible complexes with their target proteinases, serpins operate through a complex multistep pathway leading to an irreversible covalent adduct. The crystal structure of one of these complexes (3Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) shows that the reactive site loop of the serpin has been cleaved at the P1-P′1 position and has inserted into the A β-sheet in a conformation close to that obtained by cleaving the loop with a non-inhibited proteinase. This 70-Å translocation of P1 has dragged the proteinase to the opposite pole of the serpin. The tertiary structure of the complex also confirms that the proteinase forms a covalent acyl-enzyme with the P1 residue of the inhibitor (4Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B.

The position of the proteinase on the top of the uncleaved and uninserted loop suggests that it provides a good model of the first reversible encounter complex, the so-called Michaelis-type complex, which has previously been studied kinetically (9Mellet P. Boudier C. Mely Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This complex is converted to the final complex via multiple steps, including irreversible acylation and several reversible steps (10Luo Y. Zhou Y. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol.

The nature of these steps is debated. Evidence has been given that one or several conformational changes occur before acylation of the P1 amino acid (11Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol.

However, other authors using NMR failed to detect any conformational change upon binding of S195A trypsin to a stabilized Pittsburgh variant of α1-proteinase inhibitor (16Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11884-11892Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In another work the kinetics of active and inactive trypsin and tissue plasminogen activator with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 were followed by fluorescence of a probe attached to the serpin. Again, no conformational change could be detected with the inactive proteinase (17Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The conformational changes that diagnose the occurrence of reversible intermediate steps are of great importance regarding the comprehension of how serpins regulate subtle proteolytic cascades. They determine the interval of time during which the inhibition is reversible. During this reversible phase proteinase exchange has been observed (18Duranton J. Adam C. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11239-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), implying that these steps also play a role in the selection of the proteinase that will be irreversibly inhibited and thus in the specificity of the serpin. Recently, using stopped flow kinetics and FRET between fluorescein-labeled elastase and tetramethylrhodamine-labeled α1-antitrypsin, we came to the conclusion that the minimum scheme describing this serpin-proteinase interaction was as described in the following scheme (13Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SCHEME1 EI* is the encounter complex whose concentration is governed by K i*, EItr a conformer in which the proteinase has been translocated, andEIac is the final acylated complex, which may be further translocated or not. In this previous work, we had to use random labeling of elastase that prevented to use the FRET results for distance measurements and thus prevented the evaluation of the extent of the translocation that occurred prior to acylation. Furthermore, the kinetic parameters were such that the detailed study of the steps following the formation of EI* was not possible. In this paper, we further studied the reversible steps characterized by successive conformational changes. We followed the reaction of active and inactive S195A rat trypsin mutants with AT and P1R-ACT. Each protein was labeled at a single site on either a naturally present cysteine or on a cysteine added by mutation. FRET measurements at equilibrium were correlated with time-resolved fluorescence measurements for a better precision and to be able to analyze mixtures of species. The single and double mutants of rat trypsinogen were expressed in yeast, purified, and activated as described previously (19Pasternak A. White A. Jeffery C.J. Medina N. Cahoon M. Ringe D. Hedstrom L. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1331-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The following single mutants were prepared: Q23C, K113C, A122C, and S125C rat trypsins. Two active site modified double mutants in which Ser-195 of the catalytic triad is replaced by alanine were also obtained using the same protocol, namely K113C/S195A and A122C/S195A trypsins. Activation was done with enterokinase (Sigma) and followed by electrophoresis on SDS-acrylamide gels until completion. Active enzymes were titrated with BPTI (Biosys) using 1 mmchromogenic substratel-benzoyl-arginyl-para-nitroanilide (Bachem). Concentrations of inactive mutants were estimated by measuring the optical density at 280 nm and using the calculated molar extinction coefficient of 34,000 m−1 cm−1. The construction of the human antichymotrypsin double variant P1Arg/S150C expression vector and the subsequent purification of the protein followed previously described methods (20Rubin H. Wang Z.W. Nickbarg E.B. MacClarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rubin H. Plotnick M. Wang Z.-H. Liu X. Zhong Q. Schechter N.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7627-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The mutant was titrated with active site titrated trypsin using the chromogenic substratel-benzoyl-arginyl-para-nitroanilide (Bachem). Recombinant human AT was obtained from Novartis (Basel, Switzerland) and was titrated with human neutrophil elastase (22Faller B. Dirrig S. Rabaud M. Bieth J.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The free cysteines of active trypsin mutants were labeled with fluorescein maleimide (Molecular Probes). Five mg of trypsin in 50 mm HEPES buffer with 0.1 m NaCl at pH 7 were bound to 2 ml of wet benzamidine-Sepharose gel (Amersham Biosciences) to prevent autolysis of the enzymes. A 10-fold molar excess of fluorescein maleimide was added. The labeled proteins were eluted with 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 2.5, after 2 h of incubation at room temperature. The labeling ratio varied from 0.2 to 0.5 mol of fluorescein/mol of trypsin. The inactive double mutants of trypsin were labeled in the same conditions except that the benzamidine-Sepharose gel was omitted. Antitrypsin was labeled with tetramethylrhodamine maleimide (Molecular Probes) on cysteine 232 as described previously (13Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The P1Arg/S150C antichymotrypsin double mutant was labeled using the same protocol as for antitrypsin. Because wild-type antichymotrysin contains a free cysteine, the P1Arg single mutant labeling was probed in the same conditions. We were not able to detect any labeling, confirming that this cysteine residue is buried as shown by the crystal structure of the inhibitor (23Lukacs C.M. Zhong J.Q. Plotnick M.I. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the 1/1 labeling ratio obtained with the double mutant was attributed solely to the new cysteine added in position 150. BPTI was randomly labeled with the succinimidyl ester derivative of tetramethylrhodamine (Molecular Probes) following the protocol of the manufacturer. A labeling ratio of 0.9/1 was then obtained. The rate of inhibition was measured by adding trypsin to a mixture of P1R-ACT and substrate (d-isoleucyl-prolyl-arginyl-para-nitroanilide 2.2 × 10−5m, K m = 2.2 10−6m) (Chromogenix) and recording the release of product with time. Rapid mixing and recording were done with a stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic SFM3). The release of product was followed by monitoring the optical density at 410 nm. All measurements were done under pseudo-first order conditions ([I0] > 10[E 0]) with constant concentrations of rat trypsin and variable concentrations of P1R-ACT. The pseudo-first order rate constants k obs of trypsin inhibition were calculated by fitting the progress curves to a single exponential by non-linear regression analysis. The rate of binding of trypsin to AT was measured fluorometrically by assessing the rate of displacement of the active site probe p-aminobenzamidine from the active center of the enzyme (24Evans S.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3014-3017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equilibrium dissociation constant K d of the rat trypsin-p-aminobenzamidine complex was 2.4 μm. Trypsin (0.24 μm) was added to a mixture of AT andp-aminobenzamidine (2.4 μm) under pseudo-first order conditions. Mixing and fluorescence recording were done with the above stopped-flow apparatus. The excitation wavelength was 270 nm, whereas emission was monitored at λ > 300 nm using a glass filter. This experiment was done using constant concentrations of rat trypsin and variable concentrations of AT. The recorded progress curves were fitted to a single exponential function to calculate the pseudo-first order rate constants k obs for the binding of trypsin to AT. The kinetics of variation of FRET from Fl-labeled trypsins to TMR-labeled serpins was measured with the above stopped-flow using λex = 450 nm through a monochromator and λem = 514 nm through an interferential filter (Melles-Griot). For the observation of fluorescence emission of TMR-labeled P1R-ACT with time, the excitation wavelength was 550 nm through a monochromator and the emitted light was observed through a high pass filter with a cut-off at 590 nm (Melles-Griot). The least squares fittings of all traces were calculated with BioKine (Bio-Logic). All the above experiments were done at 25 °C in 50 mmHEPES buffer at pH = 7.4 and 0.1 m NaCl. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20.0 ± 0.5 °C on an SLM 48000 spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission bandwidths were 4 and 8 nm, respectively. The spectra were corrected for inner filter effects at both excitation and emission wavelengths as described (25Mely Y. Cadene M. Sylte I. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15624-15631Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The quantum yield of the Fl-labeled enzymes was determined by using fluorescein in 0.1m NaOH (φ = 0.92) (26Weber G. Teale F.W.J. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1957; 53: 646Crossref Scopus (493) Google Scholar) as a reference. The quantum yield of the complex of Fl-labeled enzyme with TMR-labeled inhibitor was corrected for the fractional labeling, fA, of the inhibitor by using Equation 1. φDAEI=φDAmEI−(1−fA)φDEIfAEquation 1 φ DAEI and φ DAmEI are, respectively, the corrected and measured quantum yields of the Fl dye in the Fl-enzyme/TMR-inhibitor complex. φ DEI is the quantum yield of the complex of the Fl-labeled enzyme with the non-labeled inhibitor. Time-resolved fluorescence intensity and anisotropy measurements were performed with a time-correlated, single-photon counting technique using the stable excitation pulses provided by a pulse-picked frequency tripled Ti-sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) pumped by a Millenia X laser (Spectra Physics). Temperature was maintained at 20 °C. The excitation pulses were at 470 nm, with a repetition rate of 4 MHz. The emission was collected through a 4-nm band-pass monochromator (Jobin-Yvon H10) at 515 nm and a GG495 filter to reject the scattered light from the excitation beam. The single-photon events were detected with a microchannel plate Hamamatsu R3809U photomultiplier coupled to a Phillips 6954 pulse preamplifier and recorded on a multichannel analyzer (Ortec 7100) calibrated at 25.5 ps/channel. The instrumental response function was recorded with a polished aluminum reflector, and its full width at half-maximum was 40 ps. For lifetime measurements, the polarizer in the emission path was set at the magic angle. For time-resolved anisotropy measurements, this polarizer was set in a vertical position. I∥(t) and I⊥(t) were alternatively recorded every 5 s, by using the vertical polarization of the excitation beam without and with the interposition of a quartz crystal rotating the beam polarization by 90°. The correction factor G is equal to 1 in our system. Time-resolved data analysis was performed using the maximum entropy method and Pulse5 software (27Livesey A.K. Brochon J.C. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 693-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 28Brochon J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 262-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For the analysis of the fluorescence decay, a distribution of 200 equally spaced lifetime values, on a logarithmic scale between 0.01 and 20 ns, was used. Similarly, 200 equally spaced rotational correlation time values on a logarithmic scale were used for the analysis of the fluorescence anisotropy decay (29Deprez E. Tauc P. Leh H. Mouscadet J.F. Auclair C. Brochon J.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9275-9284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We assume that each rotational correlation time is associated with all fluorescence lifetimes. The anisotropy is then defined by Equation 2. r(t)=r0100∑jβje−t/θjEquation 2 r 0 is the fundamental anisotropy, θj is the rotational correlation time and βj is its associated relative amplitude. In all cases, the χ2 values were close to 1.0, and the weighted residuals as well as the autocorrelation of the residuals were randomly distributed around zero, indicating an optimal fit. The average distance between the Fl dye bound to trypsin and the TMR dye bound to the inhibitor (AT or P1R-ACT) in the enzyme/inhibitor complex was calculated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, using the quenching of Fl, the donor. The efficiency of transfer was calculated by Equation 3. E=1−τjDAτiDEquation 3 τiD corresponds to the ith fluorescence lifetime of the donor (Fl) in the absence of the acceptor (TMR) and τjDA corresponds to thejth fluorescence lifetime of Fl in the presence of TMR. The Förster critical distance, R 0, was calculated according to Equation 4. R0=(8.79×1023n−4QDκ2JAD)16(AÅ)Equation 4 n designates the refractive index of the medium (a value of 1.333 is usually taken), QD, the quantum yield of the donor, JAD, the overlap integral calculated from the overlap between the emission spectrum of the donor and the absorbance spectrum of the acceptor, and κ2, the orientational factor. Finally, usingR 0 and E, the distance, R, between the acceptor and the donor is calculated using Equation5. R=R01E−116Equation 5 All measurements were done in 50 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 and 150 mm NaCl. For the irreversible complexes formed of active trypsin and serpin, the concentrations were 3 μm for trypsin and 6 μm for the serpin to avoid proteolytic degradation of the complexes. For the reversible complexes formed of inactive trypsin and serpin, the concentration of inactive trypsin was 3 μm whereas the concentration of the inhibitors was chosen such that the association was near completion ([I0] = 10 × Kd). Thus, the AT and the P1R-ACT concentrations were 14 and 20 μm, respectively. All serpin-trypsin mixtures were incubated for 15 min prior any measurement. When BPTI was used as a dissociation agent, it was added 15 min after mixing trypsin with serpin and left another 15 min to allow backward reaction. Wild-type and active mutants of rat trypsin Q23CTRY, K113CTRY, A122CTRY, and S125CTRY were reacted with either AT or P1R-ACT. Both serpins were able to inhibit each trypsin variant with a 1/1 ratio. Each unlabeled or fluorescently labeled proteinase-serpin pair gave SDS-resistant complexes on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). The kinetic mechanism of trypsin inhibition was assessed by measuringk obs as a function of serpin concentration as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig.1, k obs varies linearly with the serpin concentration, indicating that the binding of the two partners conforms to a simple bimolecular irreversible reaction (E + I → EI) (30Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that, for the reaction of AT with porcine pancreatic elastase (9Mellet P. Boudier C. Mely Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or human cathepsin G (31Duranton J. Boudier C. Belorgey D. Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3787-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), k obs varies hyperbolically with the AT concentration, diagnosing a minimum two-step mechanism for the inhibition by serpins. E+I⇌Ki*EI*→k2EI SCHEME2 EI* is the initial encounter complex. The stepEI* → EI may include several reversible or irreversible steps like translocation and acylation as shown previously (13Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Scheme 2 predicts (30Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) the result shown in Equation 6. kobs=k2[I0][I0]+Ki*1+[L0]KeqEquation 6 [L0] is the concentration of the ligand that competes with the serpin for the binding of trypsin (p-aminobenzamidine or p-nitroanilide substrate) with the equilibrium dissociation constant K eq. Equation 6 describes a linear dependence of k obson [I0] if [I0] ≪K i*(1 + [L0]/K eq). Thus, ifK i* ≫ [I0]/(1 + [L0]/K eq), [I0] being the largest inhibitor concentration used, the EI* complex does not accumulate to a significant extent during the inhibition reaction. Thus, for the interaction of wild-type trypsin with AT or P1R-ACT, K i* is much larger than 90 or 2 μm, respectively. The second order association rate constantsk 2/K i* calculated from the slope of the curves in Fig. 1 (A and B) were found to be 1.1 × 106m−1s−1 for the inhibition of trypsin by P1R-ACT and 2 × 104m−1s−1 for the inhibition of trypsin by AT. The Fl-labeled active trypsin mutants were reacted with either AT-TMR or P1R-ACT-TMR in a stopped-flow apparatus under pseudo-first order conditions ([I0] ≫ [E 0]). Variations of FRET from fluorescein to tetramethylrhodamine were followed with time. The curves shown in Fig.2 (A and B) could only be fitted with at least a double exponential model. Because the concentrations of inhibitor were not sufficient for the accumulation of the first encounter complex, the presence of a double exponential suggests that the rearrangement in our systems is at least a two-step event. With AT, the absence of a first step during which the chromophores get closer, followed by a second step during which they get away as observed with elastase and AT in previous works (9Mellet P. Boudier C. Mely Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10788-10795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), confirms that the encounter complex did not accumulate. To search for non covalently-bound reaction intermediates, we reacted a stoichiometric mixture of K113CTRY (1 μm) with AT-TMR or P1R-ACT-TMR (1 μm) for 15 min, a time that ensures full inhibition of trypsin. The complex was then rapidly mixed in a stopped-flow apparatus with unlabeled BPTI (4 μm), an efficient inhibitor of rat trypsin (32Hedstrom L. Lin T.Y. Fast W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). No change in the FRET was detected during an observation time of 800 s, confirming that all the trypsin molecules were involved in an irreversible complex. To study the reversible steps occurring before the acylation step, the active mutants A122CTRY and K113CTRY were further mutated on the serine residue of their catalytic triad. Both A122C/S195ATRY and K113C/S195ATRY were labeled with Fl and used for distance measurements (see below). The former was used to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant K d of the complexes formed of inactive trypsin and AT or P1R-ACT. Increasing concentrations of AT-TMR or P1R-ACT-TMR were reacted with constant concentration of A122C/S195ATRY-Fl in a stopped-flow apparatus, and the FRET from Fl to TMR was recorded until it was stable with time. Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence intensity as a function of AT-TMR (Fig. 3 A) and P1R-ACT-TMR (Fig. 3 B) concentration. The calculation of the overall binding constant K d was based on the following equation (9Mellet P. Boudier C. Mely Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ΔFF0=([E]0+[I]0+Kd)−([E]0+[I]0+Kd)2−4[E]0[I]02[E]0×(ΔFmaxF0)Equation 7 ΔF is the difference between the fluorescence intensity at t = 0 (F 0) and that at the time of completion of the reaction. ΔF max is the asymptotic value of ΔF for infinite concentrations of inhibitor. Iterations were done on K d and ΔFmassF0. For the binding of A122C/S195ATRY-Fl with AT-TMR, the least square fitting yielded K d = 1.4 μm. TheK i* value for the complex of active enzyme with AT, as estimated above was found to be larger than 90 μm, which is at least 64-fold higher than the overall K dvalue. If we make the reasonable assumption that the binding of the initial encounter complex between active or inactive trypsin and AT are of the same order of magnitude, i.e. thatK i*(active trypsin) ≈K i*(inactive trypsin), the foregoing observation provides evidence that one or several favorably equilibrated steps involving interchromophore distance changes follow the encounter of the enzyme with the serpin in the absence of any catalytic step. A122C/S195ATRY-Fl reacted with P1R-ACT-TMR with an overallK d of 2.1 μm. At an inhibitor concentration of 2.1 μm, no accumulation of the encounter complex could be detected with the active enzyme (see above). This again indicates that at least one favorably equilibrated step shifts the initial equilibrium E + I → EI* toward the final state. In correlation with the above observations, it was interesting to study the kinetics of inactive trypsin-serpin association in the same conditions. Fig.4 shows the time dependence of the reaction of A122C/S195ATRY-Fl with AT-TMR (red trace). None of the curves obtained in pseudo-first order conditions could be fitted to a simple exponential equation. Theinset to Fig. 4 illustrates the attempts to fit the traces obtained with each serpin to a single-exponential function. Only the three-exponential fits gave an acceptable description of the curves. In the example given in Fig. 4 (red trace), the least square fitting yielded 31, 2, and 0.13 s−1 forc 1, c 2, andc 3, respectively with 1.12, 0.55, and 0.32 for their respective amplitudes. Because the experiment was carried out with a concentration well under the estimated K i* and because we observed exclusively interchromophore distance changes (see under “Time-resolved Fluorescence on Trypsin-Serpin Complexes Formed with Inactive Trypsin”) the observation of a triple exponential behavior reveals that at least three well separated rearrangement steps follow the initial encounter. Reaction of A122C/S195ATRY-Fl with P1R-ACT-TMR (Fig. 4, blue trace) also yielded stopped-flow traces that could only be described by a three-exponential fitting with c 1= 23, c 2 = 2.1, and c 3 = 0.24 s−1 with the amplitudes of 0.74, 0.49, and 0.48, respectively. From the experiments reported above, we know thatK i* for the active trypsin-P1R-ACT complex is much higher than 2 μm. If we assume again thatK i*(active trypsin) ≈K i*(inactive trypsin), we may conclude that the triple-exponential behavior reflects the occurrence of at least three rearrangement st"
